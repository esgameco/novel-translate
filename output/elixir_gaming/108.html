        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yellow sand flew through the air, dust filling the sky.</p><p></p><p>Within the swirling dust, one could faintly make out the ferocious faces of enormous creatures.</p><p></p><p>Not just one or two, but a dense mass... over ten thousand terrifying monsters! Ten thousand monsters charging together - what an earth-shaking, soul-crushing sight!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the yellow sand, Zhao Ju saw this scene and felt his courage falter.</p><p></p><p>They were hiding here, nearly ten miles from Wugui City. Even at this distance, the army of over ten thousand monsters was enough to unsettle them. One can only imagine the immense pressure on Qi Yuan, sitting alone atop the city wall facing this monstrous horde.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan stood up on the city wall. The wind gently lifted his sleeves as he held a broken sword, a joyful expression on his face: "The monsters have finally come to attack the city!"</p><p></p><p>In games, there were often beast hordes attacking cities.</p><p></p><p>At those times, player guilds would work together to defend the city.</p><p></p><p>But in this game, Qi Yuan was the only player.</p><p></p><p>So he had to defend the city alone.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the army of over ten thousand monsters, the smile in his eyes grew even wider.</p><p></p><p>These monsters were all experience points.</p><p></p><p>If he could slay them all, he could level up several times in one go.</p><p></p><p>As the monster army advanced, Qi Yuan leapt down from the city wall, wielding his broken sword alone.</p><p></p><p>"Unite as one!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately merged with Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>For the current Qi Yuan, a giant form was more effective for slaughtering enemies.</p><p></p><p>Standing ten zhang tall, Qi Yuan was like a terrifying blood-red demon, holding a crimson broken sword, resembling a blood-soaked war god.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhao Ju's eyes widened: "What incredible divine power, so impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Even Earthly Legends could possess divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities had unimaginable power.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai also stared at Qi Yuan's enormous body. Though it wasn't his first time seeing it, he still felt shocked to his core.</p><p></p><p>The colossal figure in the distance seemed like a towering celestial god, a terrifying demon.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like this Wugui City Guardian will use his divine power to strike once with his sword, then flee!" Zhao Ju stated his judgment. "We should also be prepared. As soon as the Wugui City Guardian leaves, we must retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" The cultivators present all nodded, feeling somewhat nervous.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, he did indeed do as Zhao Ju predicted, facing the ten thousand monsters.</p><p></p><p>For the first round - Heavenly Sword Draw!</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, the Heavenly Sword Draw was the simplest, most domineering, and most destructive skill.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike could transcend worlds, capable of destroying thousands and slaying tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>The broken sword, dozens of meters long, descended from the sky. Where the blade passed, it stirred up hundred-zhang waves of heat.</p><p></p><p>Yellow sand billowed as the giant crimson sword cleaved into the monster army like an immortal drawing his blade.</p><p></p><p>The once terrifying and orderly monster army was split apart by this single strike.</p><p></p><p>The power of one sword killed nearly a thousand monsters!</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" Zhao Ju was shocked. "If I were that powerful, I'd harass the monster army with guerrilla tactics every day, striking once daily to infuriate them!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Qi Yuan's strike had caused massive damage, it was nothing to the monster army as a whole.</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings within the monster army had barely suffered any losses.</p><p></p><p>"We should..." Zhao Ju was about to suggest leaving, but what happened next left him completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had assumed that after inflicting damage on the monster army with one strike, the Wugui City Guardian would immediately flee.</p><p></p><p>But what did he see? Faced with an army of over ten thousand monsters, not only did the Wugui City Guardian not run, he actually charged into the encirclement!</p><p></p><p>"The Wugui City Guardian's actions... are truly unwise!" Zhao Ju couldn't understand Qi Yuan's reasoning.</p><p></p><p>It looked impressive, but being surrounded by the monster army would lead to death.</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly, there's still a chance to break through now!" Zhao Ju was even more anxious than the blood-red figure. He wanted to stand up and shout at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai was extremely worried. In his mind appeared Qi Yuan's cold face. He felt that Qi Yuan shouldn't be this kind of person.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the rear of the monster army, some apprentice monster controllers revealed smug smiles.</p><p></p><p>"This Wugui City Guardian is truly reckless!"</p><p></p><p>"Charging alone into our army of over ten thousand monsters - he's seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Does he really take us for pushovers?"</p><p></p><p>These monster controllers sharpened their knives, their words towards Qi Yuan full of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong looked at that terrifying figure, a cold smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of White Emperor's disciple, so confident as to dare charge an army alone. Unfortunately, you've encountered me." Wu Tong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He spoke, his voice carrying across the army: "All Nation Protectors, attack the Wugui City Guardian!"</p><p></p><p>He no longer wanted to wear down the Wugui City Guardian with ordinary monsters. He would use forceful methods to subdue him directly! After all, with that important figure's ultimate strike using his essence, he didn't fear the Wugui City Guardian at all.</p><p></p><p>Following Wu Tong's voice, dozens of Nation Protectors converged on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Powerful monsters also advanced towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten breaths of time, over a hundred Nation Protectors had secretly surrounded Qi Yuan, who was wreaking havoc.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ju, over ten miles away, saw this and despair showed on his face: "Now... the Wugui City Guardian likely can't escape."</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by so many Nation Protectors, along with numerous monsters, the Wugui City Guardian had lost his last chance to flee.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai's heart also tightened, his emotions complex.</p><p></p><p>He had great faith in Qi Yuan's immense strength, but the pressure Qi Yuan now faced was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, without a Supreme appearing, how could it be resolved? Unfortunately, the Supremes of this world were lofty and aloof - how could they appear in such a small place? "What a pity, I'm still too weak. Otherwise... I would certainly fight alongside the Wugui City Guardian!" Liu Wentai lamented.</p><p></p><p>At this moment on the battlefield, Qi Yuan was like a god of slaughter. One man with one sword, killing all within sight.</p><p></p><p>Now as he slaughtered monsters, his extraction of Monster Source had reached 10%.</p><p></p><p>As he killed, his eyes grew increasingly blood-red. Greed, rage, arrogance and other emotions flashed through his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grew more and more excited as he killed.</p><p></p><p>"More, give me more!"</p><p></p><p>With so much experience before him, Qi Yuan was like a glutton who had starved for hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>One sword swing killed over ten monsters.</p><p></p><p>These monsters could neither stop him nor cause him any harm.</p><p></p><p>Back during the Heavenly Tribulation, Qi Yuan could battle three thousand peers.</p><p></p><p>During the Earthly Tribulation, he could even defeat otherworldly demons of higher realms.</p><p></p><p>These ten thousand monsters may seem numerous, but to Qi Yuan they were all just experience points.</p><p></p><p>His combat skills had been honed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Those of the same level, he could slay with one sword! He charged into the monster army as if entering unoccupied territory.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up as he looked a thousand meters away: "An elite monster?"</p><p></p><p>He had spotted a Nation Protector.</p><p></p><p>That Nation Protector also met Qi Yuan's gaze, and inexplicable fear arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This Wugui City is too bizarre, I'd better lay low." The old man thought to himself, slowly retreating. He didn't dare retreat too obviously, fearing Wu Tong would notice.</p><p></p><p>But how could Qi Yuan let his targeted prey escape so easily?</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>A thousand meter distance was but a breath's time for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The huge broken sword swung, sword energy crossing thousands of meters.</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's strike, that Nation Protector old man was no different from an ordinary monster.</p><p></p><p>The power of one sword could only be met with death.</p><p></p><p>Just before dying, his pupils dilated, regret showing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If only he had retreated faster; if only he hadn't come at all.</p><p></p><p>This scene also fell into Wu Tong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He grew anxious, because in this short time, the Wugui City Guardian had already slaughtered a tenth of the monster army.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, even if he took Wugui City, he would suffer severe losses.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly shouted: "Wugui City Guardian, come quickly to your death!"</p><p></p><p>As Wu Tong spoke, he charged directly towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His subordinates were somewhat confused seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Since when had their leader become so reckless?</p><p></p><p>But after hesitating briefly, they also followed behind Wu Tong, surrounding Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also heard Wu Tong's voice, displeasure showing in his eyes: "I still prefer NPCs who don't talk. When I kill them, I can voice them myself. I hate NPCs like you who keep talking."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards Wu Tong: "No wonder you're so confident, you've just entered the Earthly Legend realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his broken sword, looking at Wu Tong with calm eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just an Earthly Legend - he could kill him with one sword.</p><p></p><p>Even if three thousand came, he would just...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You really are a Terrestrial Legend," Wu Tong's eyes showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, he had broken through to become a Terrestrial Legend. None of his subordinates knew about this.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Guardian of Wuguicheng could see it at a glance was enough to prove that his strength should be that of a Terrestrial Legend, and an experienced one at that.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are an experienced Terrestrial Legend, so what? Trapped in our military formation, you have no choice but death!" Wu Tong said confidently. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, even an experienced Terrestrial Legend surrounded like this would only face death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Wu Tong and shook the sword in his hand: "Since you're going to die anyway, hurry up and twist off your own head and give it to me. Life is difficult, one should open doors of convenience for others."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Tong's face revealed a cold smile: "You're a Terrestrial Legend, and I'm a Terrestrial Legend too. Why should I fear you?"</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Origin Strike given to him by the Supreme Being, he would indeed fear Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But now? He was confident of victory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Wu Tong: "I... have built my foundation on the Heavenly Way, my cultivation has long since broken through village-level immortal cultivation. To kill you, I only need one sword!"</p><p></p><p>Building his foundation on the Heavenly Way made Qi Yuan's confidence swell.</p><p></p><p>Just like a newly rich coal boss.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" Wu Tong no longer paid attention to Qi Yuan, "Take my divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Behind Wu Tong, those subordinates who saw this scene were extremely excited in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine ability, the strongest technique of a Terrestrial Legend.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Terrestrial Legends were called legends was that they possessed divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>A fierce look flashed in Wu Tong's eyes: "Since breaking through to become a Terrestrial Legend, you are the first to see my divine ability. Dying under my divine ability, you die with honor!"</p><p></p><p>After Wu Tong finished speaking, he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth Yin-Yang Reversal Palm! He pushed out a palm, yellow sand filled the air, and all the demonic creatures retreated.</p><p></p><p>And within this palm strike, a purple water droplet was mixed in, floating towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan widened his eyes, looked at Wu Tong, and cursed loudly: "You have no martial virtue!"</p><p></p><p>This was no divine ability! This was an Origin divine ability! The Origin divine ability possessed only by Supreme Beings! When facing nearly three thousand otherworldly evil demons at Ground Zero, he was most familiar with Origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong was slightly stunned, then he understood. Qi Yuan was the disciple of the White Emperor, so it was normal for him to recognize an Origin Strike.</p><p></p><p>He smiled in his eyes: "How is an Origin divine ability not a divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment. He said to Wu Tong: "That sentence of yours is clever. It's mine from now on."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided that after learning Origin divine abilities in the future, when using divine abilities to kill enemies at the Golden Core or Divine Infant stage, he would say, "Isn't an Origin divine ability still a divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>The effect would be comparable to saying "Isn't the Milky Way still a river?"</p><p></p><p>"In order to prevent others from knowing that I plagiarized this sentence from you, I have no choice but to go on a killing spree today and silence you all!" Qi Yuan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong found this nonsensical: "Since you know the power of Origin divine abilities, you have no future."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong's eyes revealed a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>Once Qi Yuan died, Wuguicheng would fall into his hands.</p><p></p><p>What he had done for the Supreme Being would already be half successful.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The purple water droplet rushed towards Qi Yuan, and at this moment the world began to fall silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's huge body seemed to be locked in place, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>The Origin divine ability involved the essence of things. Without reaching the realm of Supreme Being, Terrestrial Legends had no means of counterattack at all.</p><p></p><p>Facing an Origin divine ability, there was only the path of death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also smelled a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>If this strike landed on him, he would surely die.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Terrestrial Legend and Supreme Being was like the gap between Divine Infant and Purple Palace, it was a qualitative difference.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan's mouth still curved into a smile: "You sneak attack me without martial virtue and think you can win? But you forgot one fact, I'm not an old man, I'm young!"</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's memory, it seemed that young people could sneak attack and defeat old people without martial virtue.</p><p></p><p>But there had never been a case of old people sneaking attack and defeating young people without martial virtue.</p><p></p><p>At Ground Zero, those otherworldly evil demons had sneak attacked him without martial virtue, but as a result, Qi Yuan grew stronger with each battle, and even figured out techniques to dodge Origin attacks with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A full hundred kinds.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the purple water droplet, calm and collected, as nearly a hundred techniques for dodging and countering Origin attacks flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a ten-thousandth of an instant, Qi Yuan smiled: "Found it!"</p><p></p><p>Break! He parted his lips slightly and blew a breath at the purple water droplet.</p><p></p><p>That seemingly indestructible Origin divine ability, which seemed capable of destroying a city with a single drop, was actually directly dispersed by Qi Yuan's breath.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mouth curved into a smile as he looked at Wu Tong: "Thanks for the rocket, big brother!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the dispersed purple water droplet suddenly underwent a dramatic change, turning into two droplets, four droplets... thousands of droplets... tens of thousands of droplets.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of purple droplets condensed around Qi Yuan, standing still.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Wu Tong was completely dumbfounded: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The original army of demonic creatures, as well as those demon controllers, also felt a sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of purple droplets hovered in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan gently blew on the purple droplets again.</p><p></p><p>"As if spring breeze came overnight, thousands of troops and horses open their skulls!"</p><p></p><p>The wind blew the purple droplets, and the motionless droplets suddenly exploded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless droplets, like flying arrows, splashed into the army of demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his broken sword, his face full of vigor: "The feeling of cheating is still good!"</p><p></p><p>The purple droplets fell on the bodies of the demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest demonic creatures couldn't last for a breath before dying and turning into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>These droplets were like an enhanced version of bone-dissolving water, performing a human body disappearing act.</p><p></p><p>Anything touched would surely die.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"What is this!"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong also felt fear, the scene before him was beyond his understanding.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that Origin divine ability supposed to be his trump card? How did it end up being used by the Guardian of Wuguicheng? Could it be that this Guardian of Wuguicheng was that Supreme Being?</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The raindrops fell on Wu Tong's body, he struggled, but to no avail, and perished.</p><p></p><p>Under the attack of the purple raindrops, whether demonic creatures or demon controllers, they died upon contact.</p><p></p><p>This scene was extremely spectacular, as if it was raining from the sky, and where the rain passed, living beings fell and perished.</p><p></p><p>In just three breaths of time, the army of tens of thousands of demonic creatures completely disappeared without a trace, as if they had never come.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Qi Yuan's eyes, intense killing intent flashed.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had extracted a lot of demonic essence, his whole body emitting a terrifying aura, like a true demonic creature.</p><p></p><p>He held the broken sword in his hand, his form also shrinking at this moment. He looked at the yellow sand filling the sky and said softly.</p><p></p><p>"The wind suddenly rises, rippling a pool of spring water."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Zhao Ju and Liu Wentai in the distance, then his form flashed, and he returned to Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhao Ju in the distance was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Did I... see things?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai was also very silent, the scene before him was beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong used a divine ability to attack the Guardian of Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian of Wuguicheng blew on Wu Tong's divine ability, and instantly the army of tens of thousands of demonic creatures... was gone.</p><p></p><p>This scene, no matter how you think about it, feels absurd.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's too absurd!" Zhao Ju sighed, "I misunderstood him, he's not just acting cool, he's truly cool!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>One person going out and killing an army of tens of thousands of demonic creatures!</p><p></p><p>This Guardian of Wuguicheng could probably be called the number one person below Supreme Being!</p><p></p><p>"However, the only flaw is..." Zhao Ju continued to regret, "If the Guardian of Wuguicheng had died of exhaustion after killing the army of tens of thousands of demonic creatures, holding his broken sword with blood in his mouth, today's deed would have become a legendary tale for a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qialan City, Dong Long's hair was silver, white and aged. He stood on the city wall, his face covered in wrinkles.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely anxious about the battle situation ahead.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong was an opponent several times more troublesome than Mi San.</p><p></p><p>After Wuguicheng fell, Qialan City would be the first to bear the brunt, who knows how long it could hold out.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a gloom passed over Dong Long's aged face.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Dong Long's spirit lifted, because the cultivator who had been sent to scout the battle situation at Wuguicheng was returning.</p><p></p><p>He was nervous inside, but still maintained an unchanged expression, sitting in the high tower.</p><p></p><p>No matter how great the changes, as the commander of an army, one must have the ability to remain calm even if a great mountain collapses before them.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 377</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That silhouette was the phantom image of Dongjun.</p><p></p><p>He was resisting the Root Demon.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes also told him that if the Root Demon crossed Dongjun, the Origin Land, the Mountain and Sea Scroll, and the End Land would instantly become a paradise for the Root Demon.</p><p></p><p>So Dongjun was indeed fighting against the great calamity and saving the world.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords on the scene looked at Dongjun's phantom image with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>"In the Origin Land, perhaps only a hundred thousand years have passed, but in... the Land of Calamity, Dongjun has been fighting the great calamity alone for a million years." Black Deer Martial Lord's voice was desolate, filled with deep helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"The world has restarted so many times and always failed. This is the last chance. We must revive Dongjun's dao partner to support him!"</p><p></p><p>"Dongjun has been isolated and unsupported for a million years!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords were visibly moved, their eyes revealing various emotions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "Poor Dongjun, he probably hasn't bathed in several million years. If I see him, I'll have to give him a bucket of bathwater."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords present were speechless.</p><p></p><p>However, after interacting with him these days, they had gradually come to understand some of Qi Yuan's personality and thought processes.</p><p></p><p>For a martial arts fanatic, this was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>If one wasn't obsessed, how could they become a Martial God!</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, Dongjun's Wall will close soon. If you have any questions, please ask Dongjun's Wall quickly!" Black Deer Martial Lord reminded at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan nodded and looked at Dongjun's Wall, politely asking, "May I ask, do you know about the Spirit Realm Martial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Blood spread across Dongjun's Wall.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared at the wall.</p><p></p><p>An elegant voice sounded, like heavenly music.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm Martial Lord is the leader of all Martial Lords. Challenge all Martial Lords in the world, defeat them, and you can become the Spirit Realm Martial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"That simple?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his nose, and it hadn't grown longer.</p><p></p><p>This meant that what Dongjun said was true.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the Martial Lords present. Didn't this mean that as long as he defeated these Martial Lords, he could complete his task and become the Spirit Realm Martial Lord?</p><p></p><p>"How does one become a Myriad Dao Martial God?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>The realm of Martial God was above that of Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Myriad Dao Martial God was somewhat different from Martial God.</p><p></p><p>"Embody the myriad dao, become the dao of this world's heaven and earth, and you can become a Myriad Dao Martial God.</p><p></p><p>However, once you become the dao of this world's heaven and earth, if the world is destroyed, the Myriad Dao Martial God will also fall from that realm.</p><p></p><p>There can only be one Myriad Dao Martial God in a world."</p><p></p><p>Dongjun's Wall spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed this, and his nose indeed hadn't grown longer.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that Dongjun's Wall wasn't deceiving him.</p><p></p><p>"Does this world have a Myriad Dao Martial God?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to become a Myriad Dao Martial God, but if this world already had one, wouldn't that mean he'd have to fight for it?</p><p></p><p>"Never has been." Dongjun's voice from the wall remained elegant.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't Dongjun's true self answering, not even an avatar, merely a mechanical response, as if someone was asking an AI and getting an instinctive answer.</p><p></p><p>Having received all the answers, Qi Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something and said softly.</p><p></p><p>"What's the biggest obstacle to me becoming a Myriad Dao Martial God?"</p><p></p><p>Since Dongjun's Wall was so powerful, why not milk it for all it's worth and ask a few more questions?</p><p></p><p>"It's yourself. For the realm of Myriad Dao Martial God, the hardest part is embodying the myriad dao. This requires a very deep understanding of all the dao of this world. Most Martial Lords can hardly achieve this in their entire lifetime."</p><p></p><p>The voice remained as elegant as ever.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan now narrowed his eyes, his expression still calm: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>He found this quite interesting now.</p><p></p><p>Because he immediately believed what Dongjun said, and also felt it was particularly reasonable.</p><p></p><p>But... his nose had grown longer.</p><p></p><p>This feeling now was particularly strange.</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone had gained a superpower to accurately judge the correctness of addition and subtraction within ten.</p><p></p><p>As a result, for "1+1=2", the superpower gave the judgment: incorrect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan now had this feeling.</p><p></p><p>Dongjun's words were deeply planted in his mind, believed to be true, but his nose told him it was false.</p><p></p><p>"Dongjun's Wall never lies, it only informs others of the information it already knows." Dongjun's Wall's voice remained elegant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "My brain tells me to believe you, but my nose is frantically saying you're lying."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Black Deer Martial Lord said: "Dongjun would never lie, what he says must be true!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it must be true!" said a titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"It's true!"</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords all chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, these nearly ten thousand Martial Lords all believed what Dongjun said was true.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan thought of something and said softly: "Thunder God Old Deng, do you think what he said is true or false?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Thunder God Old Deng's figure appeared atop the high tower at some point.</p><p></p><p>He wore a purple robe covered in lightning, emanating a profound and vast aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Thunder God, the Martial Lords present fell silent instantly, all feeling immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>Could this be... another Venerable One? Their gazes towards Qi Yuan changed once again.</p><p></p><p>Especially as Thunder God looked at Qi Yuan with a respectful expression, like a subordinate.</p><p></p><p>"What he said... is true." Thunder God Old Deng answered, his voice like shocking thunder.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Old Deng was not like these Martial Lords, nor was he a fanatic believer of Dongjun.</p><p></p><p>He would also believe what Dongjun said immediately.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan himself believed it too, it was just his nose that didn't.</p><p></p><p>"Dongjun, where do you come from, and what kind of race is the Holy Light Race?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>At this point, however, Dongjun's Wall fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord quickly said: "Insufficient energy, Dongjun's Wall has fallen into dormancy and cannot answer questions."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed: "Ah, I was about to ask him if he's a love-brain."</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord then said: "Venerable One, if you want to become a Martial Dao Martial God, you must help Dongjun.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the calamity destroys the world, you won't be able to embody the myriad dao and become this world's Myriad Dao Martial God!"</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord also understood that Qi Yuan wanted to become a Spirit Realm Martial Lord and a Myriad Dao Martial God.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Realm Martial Lord was simple, Myriad Dao Martial God was very difficult.</p><p></p><p>To become a Myriad Dao Martial God, one had to protect the world.</p><p></p><p>So he used this to draw Qi Yuan into their camp.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was a Venerable One, and he had other mysterious Venerable Ones under him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm a good person, I'll save the world!" Qi Yuan readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Black Deer Martial Lord felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As ancestral blood washed over his body, Mu Yan opened his eyes, revealing a sharp glint.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally become a Martial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was full of vigor, his eyes seeming able to split a mountain with a glance.</p><p></p><p>Entering the realm of Martial Lord, he finally saw the light through the dark clouds, understanding how weak the Martial King realm was.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Yan, you've finally become a Martial Lord. Come out quickly, we're just waiting for you!" </p><p></p><p>Mu Yan's ancestor, a Great Martial Lord, walked in with an appreciative look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!" After entering the Martial Lord realm, Mu Yan knew he had become very strong, but he also more clearly understood how vast the gap between Martial Lords could be.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The difference in martial apertures is almost double."</p><p></p><p>"What brings the Ancestor here?" Mu Yan asked with curiosity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this - there's a Heavenly Venerable who wishes to become the Spiritual Martial Lord and needs to challenge a Martial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Mu Yan was a bit confused. </p><p></p><p>What was a Heavenly Venerable? But from what the Ancestor said, it seemed he wanted him to arrange a duel with a Martial Lord?</p><p></p><p>"I will certainly do my best!" Mu Yan quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, as you wish," the Great Martial Lord chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Following the Great Martial Lord, Mu Yan actually had many questions in his mind: "Ancestor, is my opponent strong? Should I... hold back?"</p><p></p><p>"Just use your full strength," the Great Martial Lord said casually. "Oh, and don't provoke or insult them."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Even though he didn't fully comprehend, Mu Yan agreed.</p><p></p><p>Following the Great Martial Lord, the two walked out of the tall tower.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan kept his head down, but soon he saw some familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>They were all participants in the Ancestral Blood Competition who had now become Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Those people looked at Mu Yan with envy in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan's confusion grew stronger, because there were more and more Martial Lords here.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they were densely packed, too many to count.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor... why are there so many Martial Lords?" Mu Yan asked carefully, while feeling excited.</p><p></p><p>Because he seemed to sense several particularly powerful auras.</p><p></p><p>Those seemed to be... Titled Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Those were the legendary Titled Martial Lords, existences at the pinnacle of this world.</p><p></p><p>"They've all come to participate in the duel," said the Great Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan was even more bewildered. Could it be...</p><p></p><p>This was something like a martial arts tournament in the mortal world?</p><p></p><p>And all the participants were Martial Lords?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly a voice sounded by Mu Yan's ear: "As expected of the person I had my eye on, arriving last to steal the show."</p><p></p><p>A man wearing a blood-red robe appeared, standing beside Mu Yan with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Mu Yan's face lit up with joy: "Qi... Qi Yuan, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>He was very happy to see Qi Yuan here.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Qi Yuan could appear here meant the Ancestor had already helped settle his affairs.</p><p></p><p>"I came here to challenge... you, and also..."</p><p></p><p>"Challenge me? Does that mean you've entered the realm of Martial Lord!" Mu Yan was even more delighted for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Qi Yuan to have had another stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't worry, I won't go too hard on you. I won't let you lose too badly," Mu Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Lose? I won't lose!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I may not have been your match above the Black Sea, but after being apart for some time, you should take a fresh look. I'm no longer who I was before!" Mu Yan said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough idle talk. I need to complete my task and become the Spiritual Realm Martial Lord!" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the arena?" Mu Yan was eager to begin.</p><p></p><p>"What need is there for an arena?" Qi Yuan spoke, his tone rising at this moment as he flew out of the tall tower in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mu Yan's heart suddenly tightened, almost leaping to his throat.</p><p></p><p>Because now all the Martial Lords were gathered on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Not one person was flying, even the Titled Martial Lords stood on the ground. Though he didn't understand why, the other Martial Lords certainly wouldn't dare to fly.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan flying wasn't that disrespectful to the other Martial Lords?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan flew towards the sky, his blood-red robe fluttering in the wind as he stood in mid-air, like an immortal descending to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"Have all the Martial Lords of the Origin Lands... gathered?" Qi Yuan spoke, his voice resounding, carrying throughout the entire tower.</p><p></p><p>On top of the tower, the new Martial Lords who had interacted with Qi Yuan before in the strongholds and Sea Scroll all looked shocked, staring at Qi Yuan in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, dozens of Titled Martial Lords stepped forward with respectful expressions: "Reporting to the Heavenly Venerable, all Martial Lords have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the over ten thousand Martial Lords all bowed in salute, like mortals facing an emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Heavenly Venerable, we have all arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Mu Yan was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Because even his Ancestor was bowing to Qi Yuan, just like a eunuch bowing to the emperor.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Mu Yan wondered in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"To become the Spiritual Realm Martial Lord is very simple - you just need to defeat all the Martial Lords in the world.</p><p></p><p>So, you can all attack together. Don't worry, I'll be gentle and won't hurt you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always advocated civility and new customs.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't like that old man from the upper realm, who had no sense of restraint.</p><p></p><p>In the next realm, to demonstrate his prowess, he had shocked quite a few of his subordinate demons to death.</p><p></p><p>If he treated his own demons like that, not to mention ordinary people, he would definitely slaughter innocents indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, please forgive our offense!"</p><p></p><p>"Please forgive our offense!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Martial Lords shouted in unison, their voices like waves.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan had a bewildered expression, feeling both confused and anxious.</p><p></p><p>So many people attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, are we all going to fight Qi Yuan together?"</p><p></p><p>"Address him as Heavenly Venerable!" the Great Martial Lord hurriedly instructed.</p><p></p><p>"He... what if he dies?"</p><p></p><p>Although Mu Yan knew Qi Yuan might not be as simple as he appeared and likely had great strength,</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful he was, facing nearly ten thousand Martial Lords...</p><p></p><p>This was still suicide.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, kill the Heavenly Venerable? You really dare to dream.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, the Heavenly Venerable swallowed a sun."</p><p></p><p>"What? Swallowed a sun?" Mu Yan's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Fight!" At this moment, Qi Yuan's voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>Endless attacks surged forth, rushing towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, these attacks were like a drizzle of rain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, not resisting, allowing any attack to land on his body.</p><p></p><p>Because this was also an opportunity to comprehend the myriad ways.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seasons passed.</p><p></p><p>The Two Emperors of Transience often appeared, traversing the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords of the Eastern Alliance had grown accustomed to the appearance of the Two Emperors of Transience.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the Arching Star, on the stage of the Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the old man before him, his expression calm: "Old man, this will be the last time I participate in the Martial Arts Tournament. Next time, you'll be able to fulfill your dream and win the championship."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Tournament continued.</p><p></p><p>Although the people on Arching Star all knew that the person who had swallowed a sun alive was the champion,</p><p></p><p>They very much wanted to participate in the Martial Arts Tournament to see Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But no one dared.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to disrupt Qi Yuan's life trajectory.</p><p></p><p>What if participating in the Martial Arts Tournament and bullying the old man was that Heavenly Venerable's hobby?</p><p></p><p>So, the Martial Arts Tournament went on as usual, with no audience on site.</p><p></p><p>If there was an audience, it was only in the livestream.</p><p></p><p>And the viewers watching this livestream were of extremely high quality.</p><p></p><p>This livestream was also very special - no negative words could be typed, only "positive" bullet comments could be sent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the white-haired old man looked a bit dazed: "Immortal, you won't be participating anymore?"</p><p></p><p>For so many years, he had always lost to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At first, he really couldn't accept it.</p><p></p><p>Later... after seeing Qi Yuan swallow a sun alive.</p><p></p><p>Well, he accepted it.</p><p></p><p>He was almost a hundred years old, it was normal to lose to someone who could swallow a sun alive, right?</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's over." Qi Yuan looked at the empty audience seats, feeling a bit hollow inside.</p><p></p><p>The game... was coming to an end.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

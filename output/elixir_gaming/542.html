        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Clarity.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p></p><p>A slightly cold voice came, and Qi Yuan's consciousness gradually became clear.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, wanting to see the world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, what he saw was not the world, nor the void and nothingness, but a stretch of black and red.</p><p></p><p>"How long was I unconscious?"</p><p></p><p>Just waking up, Qi Yuan's consciousness was still a bit muddled.</p><p></p><p>"Two months."</p><p></p><p>"That long?" Qi Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was just not suited for real-life meetings.</p><p></p><p>This time, the others didn't have any problems, but he did.</p><p></p><p>"It was I who saved you, using my blood, and you also broke my swing." The blind girl said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" Qi Yuan expressed his sincere gratitude.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't currently playing the role of a blind craftsman, he would have definitely said something like, "Thank you so much, I'll save you a spot in the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>But now, he had to be reclusive.</p><p></p><p>"You have to compensate me." The blind girl's voice was devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Compensate!" Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Can you forge?"</p><p></p><p>"I can."</p><p></p><p>"Too bad you're blind."</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm blind, my heart is not. I'm already a heavenly-level craftsman, don't discriminate against the blind."</p><p></p><p>"I'm blind too."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yuan looked towards the blind girl.</p><p></p><p>Everything was blurry, he couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the blind girl's voice, he could judge that she should be quite young.</p><p></p><p>He fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In the surrounding environment, he could only hear the blind girl's faint breathing and the sound of the wind blowing fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Spirit Wood Abyss?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit curious, as the Spirit Wood Abyss could only be opened by gathering three Spirit Wood Tokens.</p><p></p><p>Why did he directly fall into it?</p><p></p><p>"In a way."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Spirit Wood Deep Abyss, only those blessed by the Mandate of Heaven can enter."</p><p></p><p>"Those blessed by the Mandate of Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan associated this with many things.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this blind girl is also a major NPC explainer.</p><p></p><p>But these are not important, his current priority is to play the role of a blind craftsman, becoming a divine-level craftsman, and even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Since this is the Spirit Wood Deep Abyss, are there any Spirit Woods here that I can take some materials from to forge?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>There are Spirit Woods in the Spirit Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Wood Deep Abyss has an extra word compared to the Spirit Wood Abyss, so it should be even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Having some divine-level materials is normal, right? "...There are." The blind girl said after a long silence, "I can give you some when you need them."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Okay, that was just a figure of speech.</p><p></p><p>He's blind.</p><p></p><p>"You're a really nice person."</p><p></p><p>"You seem quite naive."</p><p></p><p>"That sounds like an insult."</p><p></p><p>"These things are not free..." The blind girl paused and turned to look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent, waiting for the blind girl to continue.</p><p></p><p>Free things are the most expensive.</p><p></p><p>The other party has a request, and Qi Yuan is more willing to accept this.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can become a divine-level craftsman, even an Ancestor God-level craftsman." The blind girl said, "When you become an Ancestor God-level craftsman, I hope... you can forge a pair of eyes for me."</p><p></p><p>The blind girl's voice sounded a bit desolate.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have fallen into reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... not having eyes greatly affects one's life. Look at me, I'm blind and can't see anything, otherwise I would have known your name."</p><p></p><p>Blindness has a huge impact on people.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan has divine-level strength in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"I've gotten used to this kind of life." The blind girl seemed to be answering, "Since I was born, the world has been a void, without sound, without color..."</p><p></p><p>"Then why do you want me to forge a pair of eyes for you?"</p><p></p><p>"Because... if I have eyes, he won't give me his eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan's heart was filled with curiosity, "Who is he, your father?"</p><p></p><p>The originally cold and reclusive blind girl seemed to become a bit flustered by Qi Yuan's words, her icy voice seemingly tinged with a blush.</p><p></p><p>"He is my future husband."</p><p></p><p>"An enviable relationship, I give it a thumbs up."</p><p></p><p>If this were on Earth, Qi Yuan might have said something like "You're a simp" to imitate others, but this is a game in another world, he has to say something sentimental.</p><p></p><p>Even while playing a blind craftsman, he has to give a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming an Ancestor God-level craftsman... is not an easy task." The blind girl said.</p><p></p><p>It's very likely that all her efforts will be in vain.</p><p></p><p>"My talent is very strong."</p><p></p><p>"Among the craftsmen I've seen, your talent is indeed one of the top, but... you're blind."</p><p></p><p>Craftsmen forging, the steps are complex.</p><p></p><p>Identifying materials, perceiving the flames, hammering the materials, and so on, all require the use of the eyes.</p><p></p><p>A slight difference in the flames, or a slight weakness, can have a huge impact.</p><p></p><p>A hair's breadth can lead to a thousand miles of difference.</p><p></p><p>"You've met other craftsmen? Well, since you're blessed by the Mandate of Heaven, there should be quite a few Mandate-blessed ones who have seen you." </p><p></p><p>"The last one who came in was named Sheng N端, her talent is stronger than yours."</p><p></p><p>"Sheng N端?" Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to hear about the creator of the Divine Descent from someone else's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Has the former Sheng N端 also fallen into the depths of the Spirit Wood Deep Abyss?</p><p></p><p>"I taught her a lot of forging techniques." The blind girl said proudly, seeming to show off a bit.</p><p></p><p>"You know forging techniques?" Qi Yuan really wants to get three days of clear vision now, to see what kind of extraordinary person this blind girl is.</p><p></p><p>"I don't." The blind girl shook her head, "But I have a few forging methods, and Sheng N端 took one of them away back then."</p><p></p><p>The blind girl stealthily walked towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Before she arrived, Qi Yuan could smell a faint pleasant fragrance, like the scent of unknown flower petals.</p><p></p><p>She sat on the cold stone, and a few wooden tablets slid out from her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"There are eight wooden tablets here, each one records a forging method.</p><p></p><p>I'll give you one night to choose the path you want to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan leaned against the cold stone, his hands touching the slightly warm wooden tablets.</p><p></p><p>"Can I learn them all?" He was always a bit greedy.</p><p></p><p>"If you can learn them all, then go ahead." The blind girl said, then stealthily left.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps not very familiar with the environment here, she walked with a bit of stumbling.</p><p></p><p>After walking about ten meters, her clear voice came: "Turn right at the cave entrance, then walk seven hundred meters, that's my residence. Normally don't come bother me, if you need materials, you can throw a stone into the cave, I'll hear the sound and bring the materials to you."</p><p></p><p>The blind girl then entered the pitch-black cave on the right.</p><p></p><p>In this dark mountain cave, only Qi Yuan was left.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the faint sound of flowing water, the rustling of falling leaves, and the footsteps of the blind girl leaving, this place was eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, too bad I can't activate the Spirit Wood Token in the Spirit Wood Deep Abyss, otherwise I'd let them know that this meeting has to be postponed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured to himself, then placed his hands on the wooden tablets, carefully feeling the words on them.</p><p></p><p>His eyes couldn't see, but his hands could sense the words.</p><p></p><p>"Metal Method."</p><p></p><p>"Wood Method."</p><p></p><p>"Water Method."</p><p></p><p>"Fire Method."</p><p></p><p>"Earth Method."</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Method."</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Method."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Rain Technique."</p><p></p><p>There are eight forging techniques, with a clear pattern - gold, wood, water, fire, earth, cloud, thunder, and rain.</p><p></p><p>Each forging technique is quite profound, and there is little introduction to them.</p><p></p><p>For the Gold Technique, there are only thirty-six words, introducing the sharpness of gold.</p><p></p><p>"Wood grows strong then withers, gold becomes strong then perishes..."</p><p></p><p>As for the others, they have not been introduced.</p><p></p><p>"So, this forging technique... is actually a general outline, and needs to be supplemented by people... it is indeed exquisite."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood gold well through practicing the Five Elements cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Yet the description of gold in the Gold Technique still gave him a sense of gain.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I'm blind, otherwise my eyes might be able to gradually supplement the rest of the content, not like how it is now?" Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Since he was blind, he had to rely on himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The divine trees reach the heavens, hidden in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>It seems to be on the horizon, but once you try to approach, you'll find that everything is illusory, nothing but a mirage.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's entire body was soaked in the hot spring, her black long dress wet and clinging to her voluptuous figure. Her long, slender legs were pressed together, her skin as white as jade.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly fluttered down, looking at Shen Lingxuan with a smile in her eyes: "Your cultivation progress in the past two months has been very fast. It may not take two hundred years before we no longer have to hide in the Divine Wood Abyss."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan opened her eyes, her face still covered by a veil, concealing her peerless beauty.</p><p></p><p>"How is the situation in the outside world?" Shen Lingxuan asked.</p><p></p><p>She had always been curious about the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly's expression became gloomy: "I haven't received any news from the outside world for three hundred years. The last message I received was... the Black Abyss invading the Void Sea."</p><p></p><p>Between universes, there is an unspeakable place, also known as the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>The intersection and collision of two universes is called the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sea is profound and chaotic, and even Ancestral Gods find it difficult to survive and move around.</p><p></p><p>Only those at the Realm Lord level, the third layer of the Yang Gods, can walk in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>For the rest of the lower-level cultivators, they can only walk in the Void Sea by relying on Realm Lord-level treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Abyss, which is the manifestation of the Black Abyss, has an army of hundreds of millions, with seventeen black sails, intending to invade this nascent universe from the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>These seventeen black sails are all Realm Lord-level treasures.</p><p></p><p>But our Divine Wood Universe only has one half-finished Realm Lord treasure."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly's heart ached.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral God Yuan single-handedly went to the Void Sea, carrying the only half-finished Realm Lord treasure of the Divine Wood Universe, the Green Cloud, to block the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Green Cloud had just been forged and was not yet fully formed, not even a true Realm Lord treasure.</p><p></p><p>But... the Void Sea guardians have brought various ancient divine artifacts and ancestral artifacts and equipped the Green Cloud, to fight against the Black Abyss."</p><p></p><p>A half-finished Realm Lord treasure against dozens of Realm Lord treasures.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Realm Lord treasures of the Black Abyss were all fully formed and well-equipped.</p><p></p><p>And what was on the Green Cloud? Ancient divine artifacts and ancestral artifacts! It's like bringing cannons and artillery to fight against a real navy.</p><p></p><p>How could they win? Shen Lingxuan was a bit anxious: "What was the result?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly shook her head: "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>This was the last news she had received.</p><p></p><p>Ancestral God Yuan, carrying the Green Cloud and a group of divine and ancestral artifacts, went to the Void Sea to block the Black Abyss manifested by the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Mountain Realm is located in the Chaotic Star Domain, an area where the Light Radiance League is powerful. We cannot stay here for long," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly reminded.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Mandate Bearers are the hope of all worlds. As long as you are still alive, you can represent the will of the worlds.</p><p></p><p>If we can gather all the Mandate Bearers, we can... ignite the light, forge the light, and dispel the Black Heavens." The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes held hope, but deep down, there was a hint of despair.</p><p></p><p>Gathering all the Mandate Bearers and forging the light is the only way to break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>But forging the light is difficult.</p><p></p><p>This nascent universe does not have any Realm Lord-level experts, how can they forge Realm Lord treasures?</p><p></p><p>And so, the term "Light Treasures" was coined, which are alternative Light Treasures.</p><p></p><p>The Green Cloud is a half-finished Light Treasure.</p><p></p><p>What made the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly feel the most desperate was that the plan to use Light Treasures to counter the Black Heavens was proposed by the Sky Clan who had fled to this nascent universe.</p><p></p><p>Light Treasures are alternative Realm Lord treasures, specifically created to counter the Black Heavens and the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But even the Sky Clan had failed.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, even if they could forge true Light Treasures, would they be able to counter the Black Heavens and the Black Abyss? The Black Heavens and the Black Abyss already had thirty-two Realm Lord treasures on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"If we could cooperate with the Light Radiance League, perhaps we wouldn't be in such a difficult situation," Shen Lingxuan's voice was cold.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they forging Light Treasures, but the Light Radiance League was also forging Light Treasures.</p><p></p><p>The thirty thousand Artifact Masters hidden in the Ten Thousand Mountain Peaks, concealing their identities, were forging fragments of Light Treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly rejected the idea, "The most valuable things are the free ones. The Light Radiance League is constantly hunting down the Mandate Bearers, isn't it because they fear that we will forge the Light Treasures divinely inspired? Rather than divinely inspired light, we in the Divine Wood choose... humanly inspired light!"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly's voice was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Humanly inspired light, with the power in their own hands.</p><p></p><p>Believing in and worshiping the gods, hoping for the gods to cast their gaze and bestow the Light Treasures upon this universe, this was something she did not want to see.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Divine Wood Universe do not believe in or worship the gods.</p><p></p><p>They choose humanly inspired light!</p><p></p><p>"The only one we can ally with is the Void Paradise. As for the Light Radiance League... they have wolf-like ambitions," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly was very averse to the Light Radiance League.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, there are two voices on how to deal with the Black Heavens and the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>One voice, like the Light Radiance League, advocates divinely inspired light; the other voice advocates humanly inspired light.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens is a unconscious cosmic phenomenon, while the Black Abyss is a conscious army. The Black Heavens relies on Ominous Spirits to deploy coordinates in the universe, and then the Black Abyss invades.</p><p></p><p>Even the Void Paradise and the Zhou Universe behind it do not want to provoke them. If we try to seek their help, it's probably just wishful thinking," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly knew a lot.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The world is gloomy and hopeless.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens is unconscious, devouring this nascent universe, relying solely on instinct.</p><p></p><p>If there is anyone to blame, it is the weakness of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>Weakness is the original sin.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, the great war in the Rakshasa Realm, the Divine Arrival won."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Shen Lingxuan's beautiful eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information I've received, that young master who shares your husband's surname is the incarnation of the Divine Arrival. Unexpectedly... He has taken a human form.</p><p></p><p>If I'm not mistaken, He also bears the Mandate.</p><p></p><p>If we could get Him to join us and leave the Blue Mountain Realm, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>If He stays here, the Light Radiance League may not spare Him."</p><p></p><p>Every Mandate Bearer is a teammate worth recruiting.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, we have just barely hidden in the Divine Wood Abyss, and cannot go out again. If the people of the Light Radiance League sense your existence, they will surely kill you." the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said with worry.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even hiding in the Divine Wood Abyss is not entirely safe. Perhaps... if they could find a special entrance and enter that particular space-time, that would be truly safe for a period of time in the depths of the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How much experience did Qi Yuan have?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan himself didn't know.</p><p></p><p>On the Ascension Platform, the endless small monsters gave him a massive amount of experience.</p><p></p><p>In the Forbidden Land, the nearly three thousand extraterrestrial demons also provided him with a large chunk of experience.</p><p></p><p>This experience was like an inverted ocean at the moment, with only a small outlet to flow into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his sword and looked at the huge stone: "I... am not level 99!"</p><p></p><p>Demonic Radiance! Tyrannical Power!</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique! All the powerful skills, all the small skills, were unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan unleashed the strongest sword strike he had ever performed in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The dazzling white light and the blood-red sword qi intertwined, bursting forth with power far beyond the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body was bathed in the white and blood-red light.</p><p></p><p>His body slowly dissolved, the blood-red light stubbornly resisting, but he squeezed a smile at the corners of his mouth: "You died faster than me, haha!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan closed his eyes weakly.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the steps, the blood already dried, still gripping the sword tightly in his hand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Forbidden Land, just a few breaths ago.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land and the Five Elements Forbidden Land finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their expressions were all extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they would face the most terrifying extraterrestrial demons in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Wolf Devouring the Moon was still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>The darkness had already enveloped this world.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a huge rumbling sound seemed to come from the Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled, looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the extraterrestrial demons have discovered us and are about to ambush us!"</p><p></p><p>"Look, what's that?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the man in red robes raised his hand and pointed to the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the huge Celestial Wolf was devouring the moon.</p><p></p><p>A huge sun suddenly rose, and the entire world became as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky, and a sense of fear arose in their hearts, as if a great disaster was about to strike.</p><p></p><p>"Two suns, what's going on?" The crowd was shocked and fearful.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, that sun is going to fall to the ground!"</p><p></p><p>"The sun in the sky, the reversal of the sun and moon... this is the resurrection of the Great Sun!" Feiwang realized something, and a tear of blood fell from the corner of his eye. "So, this is the true 'ten deaths, no survivors'?"</p><p></p><p>The other divine domain experts who saw this were all extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>A huge sun was actually falling towards the continent.</p><p></p><p>Although it might not be as high as the sun in the sky, it was still a small sun.</p><p></p><p>Falling to the mortal realm? What a doomsday scene that would be! The oceans would flood, the earth's veins would rupture, and all living beings would turn to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Ten deaths, no survivors?" Little Green looked at the falling sun and suddenly made peace with it, revealing a smile. "Clothing Faction Master, I no longer blame you."</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a sword suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Whose sword is that?"</p><p></p><p>"What are they doing?"</p><p></p><p>The divine domain experts were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because in the sky, a sword appeared, a sword they were familiar with.</p><p></p><p>In the Moon Imperial Dynasty, the woman looked up, and the moon in her eyes turned into a crescent: "Master..."</p><p></p><p>Clothing Taboo, the red wedding dress stumbled and ran, as if calling out to something, she fell down, got up, and fell down again.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, in front of a large gate, a man covered in wounds sat on the steps, holding a long sword with his mutilated flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have come from hell, encountering countless demonic attacks, being torn and gnawed.</p><p></p><p>His body was covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>His eyeballs were already shattered, but he still held the sword, swinging it at the sun, and then let out a loud roar: "I... am not level 99!"</p><p></p><p>With a single sword strike, the yin and yang were thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>The entire dazzling white world became half blood-red.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red and white light collided, unleashing unimaginable energy.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Clothing Faction Master, it's the Clothing Faction Master!" The man in red robes shouted.</p><p></p><p>Long Judgment looked at the sky, his eyes flashing with endless emotions, finally turning into a smile: "The person I believe in could never have fled the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The other divine domain experts all looked at the sky, silent.</p><p></p><p>Some even felt guilty.</p><p></p><p>Some had tears welling up in their tiger-like eyes.</p><p></p><p>They saw the man covered in wounds, with a smile on the corner of his mouth, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You died faster than me, haha." This was the only voice left in the world.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi continued to spread.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling white became less and less.</p><p></p><p>The black Celestial Wolf was also severed by that sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The great sun was finally torn apart, turning into scattered stars.</p><p></p><p>Boom, in the Forbidden Land, a gate collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The once Four Forbidden Lands and Two Forbidden Realms, the Forbidden Land among them, no longer existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>All the divine domain experts looked towards the Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>They saw a blood-soaked youth sitting on the steps behind the fallen gate, holding the sword in his arms, eyes closed, with a smile on the corners of his mouth, as if he was asleep, as if he had dreamed a beautiful dream.</p><p></p><p>"Clothing Faction Master!"</p><p></p><p>The divine domain experts exclaimed, some with a look of pity in their eyes, as they rushed towards the Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>This was after experiencing so many great battles.</p><p></p><p>This was...</p><p></p><p>However, in their sight, the shattered youth also seemed to disappear with the dissipation of the Forbidden Land, vanishing from the world.</p><p></p><p>Only a trace of blood-red remained, and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"There are too many histories in the world, buried in the passage of time," Qi Yue Sacrifice, whose height was not as tall as Jinli's, walked beside Jinli, appearing more dignified.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's eyes flashed with a sense of loss, but she did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"Such as the Forbidden Lands and Forbidden Realms, in fact, when the Moon Imperial Dynasty was first established, there were four Forbidden Lands and two Forbidden Realms in the world, but now, only one Forbidden Realm remains."</p><p></p><p>After the establishment of the Moon Imperial Dynasty, it also went through repeated falls, but it was eventually rebuilt.</p><p></p><p>"Another Forbidden Realm? What is it called, and where is it now?" Jinli's tone became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>"According to the ancient records, that Forbidden Realm is called the Forbidden Land," Qi Yue Sacrifice said slowly. "It is rumored that the Forbidden Land is home to a world-destroying giant demon, and a faceless swordsman who went there, sword in hand, to slay the demon."</p><p></p><p>"What happened to him?" Jinli grabbed Qi Yue Sacrifice's arm.</p><p></p><p>"The Forbidden Land was shattered, it's hard to imagine the power required to do that.</p><p></p><p>And he... perished together with the giant demon." Qi Yue Sacrifice said.</p><p></p><p>"He's dead?" Jinli's expression became somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient records also say that the establishment of the Moon Imperial Dynasty was planned by the faceless swordsman.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the new emperor did not acknowledge this view.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if the faceless swordsman is related to our Moon Imperial Dynasty, but he did come here.</p><p></p><p>He also has a divine statue, right in front of us."</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked up and saw a dilapidated temple, with the south wall collapsed and weeds growing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we go in and take a look?" Qi Yue Sacrifice's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>Jinli stepped on the stone floor, her steps both hurried and slow.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen breaths, she entered the temple.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that although the legend says the faceless divine swordsman had the merit of saving the world, his temple has little incense burning among the many temples." Qi Yue Sacrifice sighed.</p><p></p><p>Jinli stopped in her tracks, looking at the damaged divine statue in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Many images flashed through her mind, and she remembered a lot of things.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, have you seen what you wanted to see?" Qi Yue Sacrifice's desolate voice came from behind her.</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at the divine statue, and she raised her hand.</p><p></p><p>She grabbed the left hand of the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the left hand of the divine statue suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>A green wooden hairpin fell into Jinli's hand.</p><p></p><p>She tightly grasped the hairpin, remembering the second thing Qi Yuan said to her, and she looked up at the divine statue: "I have seen, as if I have seen you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Clothing Taboo.</p><p></p><p>The cold wooden board made Qi Yuan feel uncomfortable and a bit chilly.</p><p></p><p>He casually reached out, wanting to embrace something, but his hands were empty.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride..."</p><p></p><p>He called out, opening his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he found that he was the only one on the wooden board.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride?"</p><p></p><p>He called out again, louder.</p><p></p><p>But still, no one responded.</p><p></p><p>The bridal chamber was empty and desolate, with no one there.</p><p></p><p>"With You as My Comrade!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan activated his powerful skill.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the only response he received was silence.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the cold wooden board, feeling a bit of a headache.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that made him happy was that his skills were still there, and his Little Bride... was still there.</p><p></p><p>"You, my wife, are too incompetent, you didn't even call me before going out."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan dragged his weakened body and walked through the Clothing Taboo.</p><p></p><p>He saw many bridal dresses.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, none of them were as beautiful as his Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>He stumbled and struggled, finding it difficult to move forward.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He entered the underground palace: "Sure enough, they say that after a long time, a married couple will start to resemble each other. Now I'm stumbling every few steps.</p><p></p><p>You weren't like me before, with a muddled mind and too many things, were you?"</p><p></p><p>It took Qi Yuan an hour to reach the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>"Little Wife, we're in the divorce cooling-off period."</p><p></p><p>"But you're not here now, so I can't get the divorce certificate on my own."</p><p></p><p>"So, let's talk about whether to get divorced or not when we see each other next time. For now, you're still... my wife?"</p><p></p><p>"Do I have to chase after my wife in the underworld?" </p><p></p><p>"Or should you chase after your husband in the underworld? That would be more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in the dark underground palace, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and the moon pattern on it disappeared, just like the traces left by Little Wife on his body.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Yibu Jinjun (Forbidden Army) still in the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>"Am I leaving?" </p><p></p><p>"That big boss is really tough. If I had broken through to level 100 earlier, he definitely wouldn't have appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"I can't perfectly complete this game."</p><p></p><p>After perfectly completing the game, Qi Yuan still felt a bit melancholy.</p><p></p><p>When a game ends, it's just like watching the finale of a TV show - the heart feels empty.</p><p></p><p>"Trash game, I still have a side quest to complete!"</p><p></p><p>"No, Jinli is a player, not a quest!"</p><p></p><p>"Meeting up... next time we meet, the location must be in the real world!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about going to meet Jinli, with heavy snow falling, he waited for days but the other person never showed up.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the dust-covered Yibu Jinjun, Qi Yuan inexplicably recalled some words he had seen somewhere before, and he couldn't help but speak them out loud.</p><p></p><p>"In the past I did not see you, my sorrows piled up like the snow. The thoughts of ancient and modern times are all deep.</p><p></p><p>Now I do not see you, my eyes long for you like the morning dew. The drinks of ancient and modern times all make me drunk.</p><p></p><p>In the future I will see you, I do not resent the late reunion, I do not blame the shortness of time."</p><p></p><p>The last line was originally "In the future I will not see you, life is like a dream, the dreams of ancient and modern times are all empty." But he felt it was inauspicious, so he changed it.</p><p></p><p>He thought of that day's heavy snow.</p><p></p><p>The snow in the game was even bigger than the snow on the Blue Star. The ancient Qichu cedar tree was like a giant Christmas tree.</p><p></p><p>Without hanging bodies, the Christmas tree Jinli saw must have been very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan snapped out of his fantasy, looked at the Yibu Jinjun, and ordered, "I finally recited some sentimental words, I must bring them to Jinli!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the Qi Yuan sitting in the underground palace suddenly laughed loudly, "I'm really fickle-hearted."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On top of the Seven-Colored Peak, snow was also slowly falling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was still in her thin long dress, leaving the thatched cottage.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the thatched cottage next to her, a trace of anxious expression flashed in her eyes: "It's been three months, has the senior brother still not recovered?"</p><p></p><p>It had been three months since the senior brother instructed her to help take care of him.</p><p></p><p>She was a little worried that the senior brother might have encountered an accident.</p><p></p><p>After all, the senior brother was still at the Qi Qi stage, unable to truly achieve fasting.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he reached the Building Foundation stage that he could truly fast.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came: "Senior sister, has Qi Yuan senior brother not come out of seclusion yet?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was dressed in black, standing out against the vast snow.</p><p></p><p>"No, the senior brother said that this seclusion would last one to one and a half years," Jiang Lingsu said, then went back to her own room.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Xian felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Seizing Competition had only two months left to prepare.</p><p></p><p>The sect master had asked him to invite two Building Foundation disciples.</p><p></p><p>He had already successfully invited one, which was the sect master's son-in-law, the top disciple of the Five Peaks, Kong Fulou senior brother.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulou senior brother was a late-stage Building Foundation cultivator, practicing the Five Light Sacred Law.</p><p></p><p>He was undoubtedly the strongest among the Building Foundation disciples in the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian had paid a huge price to get him to agree.</p><p></p><p>As for the second Building Foundation disciple, the one he wanted to invite was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Elder had said that Qi Yuan senior brother was extremely mysterious, possessing a secret, and if he reached the Building Foundation stage, wielding that precious Cai Dao, he could even fight an Elixir Pill Master.</p><p></p><p>If he had Qi Yuan senior brother's help, he might really be able to win the Dragon Seizing Competition and change his own fate.</p><p></p><p>His fiancée would also not have to be separated from him in two different places.</p><p></p><p>But now, Qi Yuan senior brother was still in seclusion, and he had no idea when he would come out.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that time would run out.</p><p></p><p>He waited on the Seven-Colored Peak for a while, but ultimately left in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, should we change the person?" Dong Xian couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qi snorted coldly, "If we're going to cooperate, we naturally want the strongest one. That Kong Fulou, if his strength is as strong as his mouth, you naturally don't need to be afraid.</p><p></p><p>Just wait a little longer, there will be an opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He had deliberately asked Elder Qi's opinion just to strengthen his own determination.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Colored Peak, the snow kept piling up higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu became more and more worried that the senior brother might really die in the cottage, so she came to check on him every day.</p><p></p><p>However, sensing the presence of a living person, she could relax a little.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, in the senior brother's cottage.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the closed Qi Yuan revealed a painful expression.</p><p></p><p>Sweat kept flowing down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Some inexplicable voices entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-level secret technique, only 9.99!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, my Dan failed to refine again."</p><p></p><p>"Shit tastes good, oh I can't eat it like that anymore, I'm the Elixir Pill Immortal, can't be like when I had no spiritual awareness."</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? The senior sister and the master are sleeping together, and that's not all, the master's wife found out and is now with the senior sister's brother."</p><p></p><p>"We've been lying low in the Divine Light Sect for so many years, when are we going to make our move?"</p><p></p><p>Countless voices poured into Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze momentarily muddled, but then it became clear again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back?"</p><p></p><p>"Comrades-in-arms?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"Did I... succeed in Building Foundation?"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao Building Foundation!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, after coming out of the game world, Qi Yuan obtained complete Heavenly Dao fragments.</p><p></p><p>Following the "Qi Yuan Sutra", he used the Heavenly Dao as a cultivation foundation and succeeded in Building Foundation.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, he had successfully built his foundation on the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, despite successfully building his foundation, he felt his mind was muddled and extremely sleepy. He felt as if something was targeting him, and his consciousness was slowly fading as he fell into slumber.</p><p></p><p>He had another dream.</p><p></p><p>The content of the dream was something he couldn't remember clearly.</p><p></p><p>He only remembered that in the dream, he had entered a wooden house, and there was a big thing in the wooden house. When that big thing saw him, it started fighting with him.</p><p></p><p>That big thing was really powerful, and Qi Yuan was no match for it.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was no pushover either, he beat the big thing until its face was swollen and bruised, and only then did the big thing stop trying to drive him out.</p><p></p><p>He then lived in the big thing's house, but the big thing was afraid that Qi Yuan would wreck the place, so they made many agreements.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't remember the details of the agreements.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up from the dream, in his muddled state, he heard many strange and bizarre voices.</p><p></p><p>"My strength... is so powerful, is this the power of Heavenly Dao Building Foundation?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a feeling that now, without a knife, just with a punch, he could kill... the sect master of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the sect master of his own sect, Elder Ku Mu Zhen, Qi Yuan didn't know, because he had never fought him.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Heavenly Dao Building Foundation, now I should be able to leave the rural cultivation world and easily defeat the high-level cultivators, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got up.</p><p></p><p>He cast a spell on himself and went to change into a new set of clothes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange voice entered his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The chest is too small again, so annoying."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that after Heavenly Dao Building Foundation, I will have auditory hallucinations?"</p><p></p><p>"Why am I also hallucinating the voice of my junior sister?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I have a secret crush on my junior sister and am lusting after her body?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he walked out of his room.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister," he called out to the thatched cottage next door.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother? Wait a moment, I'll come out right away." Jiang Lingsu's voice sounded a bit excited, with a hint of fluster.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before Jiang Lingsu walked out of the thatched cottage.</p><p></p><p>Her face showed an excited expression: "Senior brother, you've finally come out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then glanced at Jiang Lingsu's chest.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... it's really big and impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, I've built my foundation." The rich not returning to the countryside, like wearing brocade at night.</p><p></p><p>After successfully building his foundation, he must give his junior sister some fantasies.</p><p></p><p>"Built your foundation?" Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes shining with even more joy, "Congratulations senior brother, blessings to senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu expectantly: "Is that all?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Lingsu was taken aback, "What else?"</p><p></p><p>"You should ask me what kind of foundation I built," Qi Yuan said smugly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu smiled wryly, "Senior brother, what kind of foundation did you build?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you sincerely asked, I'll graciously tell you - I, Qi Yuan, have built the Heavenly Dao Foundation." Qi Yuan stood in the snow, like a flamboyant immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Black Chicken Old Demon has always been like a sharp sword, hanging over Qi Yuan's head.</p><p></p><p>In the middle stage of the Divine Infant, the Black Chicken Old Demon, who was suspected to be about to break through to the late stage of the Divine Infant, put tremendous pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>From the slaughter of Chu Tian Xiong to the destruction of the Black Mountain Sect, Qi Yuan always had a thorn in his heart, and that was the Black Chicken Old Demon.</p><p></p><p>Now, judging from the intentions of the nine Divine Infants in the room, Qi Yuan's heart was filled with a surprising guess.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard the old man leaning on the crutch say, "The Black Chicken Old Demon is a practitioner of the Demonic Dao, and has been wreaking havoc in our Great Shang cultivation world, indiscriminately slaughtering our fellow Dao companions. </p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect has also been rampant, committing rape and plunder, and committing all kinds of evil. </p><p></p><p>Now, we have found the location of the Black Chicken Old Demon and must use thunderous methods to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Chicken Old Demon was one of the few Divine Infant-level cultivators in the Great Shang cultivation world, and was only one step away from the late stage of the Divine Infant. </p><p></p><p>In addition, the Black Chicken Old Demon had no sect, was adept at escape techniques, and had an uncertain whereabouts, so the major sects in the Great Shang cultivation world were mostly unwilling to offend the Black Chicken Old Demon.</p><p></p><p>However, now that the Black Chicken Old Demon's cave dwelling has been discovered, and he is in seclusion there to break through, they have organized a group to collectively kill the Black Chicken Old Demon.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan felt that the main reason was that the Black Chicken Old Demon was about to break through to the late stage of the Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through, the pattern of the Great Shang cultivation world would truly change.</p><p></p><p>These great cultivators did not want another powerful figure wreaking havoc.</p><p></p><p>"Killing the Black Chicken Old Demon is doing justice, and is the wish of us cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"We must kill the Black Chicken Old Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The nine Divine Infants spoke up one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Cultivators standing aside also had excited expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was the same.</p><p></p><p>With so many Divine Infants here, the Black Chicken Old Demon was doomed.</p><p></p><p>A voice transmission entered Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Chicken Old Demon has many disciples and grandchildren, both Foundation Establishment and Elixir Cultivators. </p><p></p><p>No matter what method you use, as long as you kill one Elixir Cultivator, you will have passed my test.</p><p></p><p>This time the killing of the Black Chicken Old Demon is extremely dangerous, even Elixir Cultivators may perish, you can still withdraw now."</p><p></p><p>"No need." Qi Yuan would not withdraw.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, he had already killed so many Elixir Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>To him now, Elixir Cultivators were no better than dogs.</p><p></p><p>And with the nine Divine Infants backing the Black Chicken Old Demon, Qi Yuan was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>"Good, as long as you kill an Elixir Cultivator, you will have passed the test.</p><p></p><p>At that time, I will discuss a matter with you, and if you agree, I will give you an extremely great opportunity; if you do not agree, I will also give you another opportunity." said the old man Gu Mu Zhen Jun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan responded through voice transmission, without any objections.</p><p></p><p>After about the time of an incense stick, the nine Divine Infants had finished discussing the plan to kill the Black Chicken Old Demon.</p><p></p><p>The group signed an agreement. </p><p></p><p>Cultivators like Qi Yuan and other Elixir Cultivators did not sign.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." The old man with the crutch spoke, waving his hand.</p><p></p><p>The more than twenty cultivators present were all cast with a technique to conceal their auras, and flew towards the depths of the Myriad Demon Ridge.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before the old man with the crutch stopped.</p><p></p><p>"This place is called the Six Demon Cave, with six entrances.</p><p></p><p>We will enter from the middle, and go straight to the Black Chicken Old Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The nine Divine Infants had no objections, and with disguises on, they entered through the middle entrance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an Elixir Cultivator said, "There are five other entrances here, we have thirteen people, we can form five teams and go in separately."</p><p></p><p>With the Elixir Cultivator's words, five teams quickly formed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was alone, as no one was willing to team up with him.</p><p></p><p>After all, entering the Six Demon Cave this time was extremely dangerous, and no Elixir Cultivators were willing to team up with a Foundation Establishment cultivator, afraid of being dragged down.</p><p></p><p>And a Foundation Establishment cultivator participating in such a major event must be a talented genius valued by the sect's upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>If such a genius accidentally died by their side, they were afraid of being targeted by the Divine Infant-level monsters.</p><p></p><p>It's better to do less.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't feel anything about it.</p><p></p><p>Being alone was fine.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an aged voice came.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is willing to team up with this young man." An old man in a black robe emerged from the crowd and walked towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The others present looked at this old man, but said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, the five teams are formed, let's enter the cave."</p><p></p><p>The five teams of Elixir Cultivators entered their respective cave entrances.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the old man also entered the cave.</p><p></p><p>The vision became dim.</p><p></p><p>The cave was huge, with a diameter of about twenty meters. The terrain in the cave was peculiar, not ordinary stones, but extremely solid.</p><p></p><p>The old man faced Qi Yuan, polite and courteous: "This old man's surname is Liu, an Elixir Cultivator in the middle stage. If we encounter danger, we two should help each other."</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu's words were extremely courteous. </p><p></p><p>An Elixir Cultivator in the middle stage and a Foundation Establishment cultivator helping each other? No, it was completely the Elixir Cultivator in the middle stage taking care of the Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu spoke this way, completely to befriend Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu's face had a respectful expression.</p><p></p><p>He was a wandering cultivator who had arduously cultivated to the Elixir Cultivator realm, and was considered a strong figure in the Great Shang. </p><p></p><p>But compared to the three major sects and the medium-sized sects with Divine Infants, his Elixir Cultivator was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was old, with many children and grandchildren, the one who had lived a life of mediocrity, also wanted to make friends with some geniuses.</p><p></p><p>So he dared to enter the cave with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had already planned that no matter what, he would protect this genius's safety.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his gamble was completely a gamble.</p><p></p><p>If this genius turned out to be ungrateful and cold-hearted, or even evil-minded, his gamble would be a complete failure.</p><p></p><p>The two were flying in the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to trespass the Six Demon Cave?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cold shout came from the front.</p><p></p><p>Three Foundation Establishment cultivators holding spirit tools came forward, blocking Qi Yuan and Elder Liu.</p><p></p><p>The leader had a fierce expression, with a strong aura of bloodshed, obviously a ruthless killer.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a look of doubt flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu saw this, but did not take action, and instead focused on Qi Yuan's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators were nothing to this genius cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't steal the limelight from this genius.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a step forward and let out a loud roar: "Your grandpa!"</p><p></p><p>He pushed out a punch, bare-handed, and with one strike, the three Foundation Establishment cultivators were crushed to pieces before they could even react.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's actions were quick, ruthless and decisive, not wasting any words with them.</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu stared with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>Three Foundation Establishment cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Crushed with one punch?</p><p></p><p>Even he as an Elixir Cultivator in the middle stage could not do it so easily, right?</p><p></p><p>This was not a genius, but a prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Probably none of the Top Ten of the Great Shang could match this.</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu's heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>He had bet correctly, this was truly a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dao companion's strength is truly terrifying, even this old man is inferior!" Elder Liu stepped forward and flattered.</p><p></p><p>He said this to be modest. The strongest among Elixir Cultivators were the Gold Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing a Gold Elixir, ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators would have no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed: "Actually, it's not much. I know a sister, she's in the Foundation Establishment stage, and is much stronger than me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was talking about the Icy Mountain Tyrant Girl.</p><p></p><p>That was a true big shot.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Elder Liu's mood was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>If this was not considered much, what about all the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Great Shang, including the Top Ten? He was at a loss, not knowing how to describe Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He continued to flatter, "The companions the Dao friend makes must all be extraordinary geniuses."</p><p></p><p>After killing and establishing the foundation, Liu the old man simply cleaned up the battlefield and said, "The people here have been killed, so the cultivators inside must already know. We have to hurry in without giving the other side time to prepare."</p><p></p><p>The two quickly walked inside.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Liu the old man stopped in his tracks, looking at the cages ahead with a sorrowful expression.</p><p></p><p>"The old demon Black Chicken, he really deserves to be killed!"</p><p></p><p>In the cages ahead, on the left were over a hundred young naked women, and on the right were over a hundred young naked men. </p><p></p><p>These women and men were imprisoned here, their eyes vacant and lifeless, having endured unimaginable horrors.</p><p></p><p>Even upon seeing Qi Yuan and Liu arrive, they did not pay them any attention, their gazes devoid of hope for life.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Liu suddenly slapped his forehead, having realized something, a trace of dread flashing in his eyes: "Oh no, this cave is guarded by Patriarch Zuo Yuan, the disciple most favored by the old demon Black Chicken!"</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Zuo Yuan had no qualms about men and women, imprisoning commoners of both sexes here. Surely it was him! Patriarch Zuo Yuan was at the late Nascent Soul stage, the most beloved disciple of the old demon Black Chicken, with profound Dao techniques and formidable battle prowess!</p><p></p><p>Liu felt a great calamity was about to befall them.</p><p></p><p>With Patriarch Zuo Yuan guarding this cave, they had to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Dao companion, let's hurry and leave!"</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, escaping was the priority. </p><p>If it wasn't the old monster Shenying, Patriarch Zuo Yuan would be virtually undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you have some knowledge, but it's too late." A disdainful voice rang out, as Patriarch Zuo Yuan appeared in a long green robe, exuding an immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>The men and women in the two cages, their previously vacant eyes now filled with terror, trembling as if looking at a demonic being from the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Liu looked at Patriarch Zuo Yuan, his expression extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>Escape... there was no escape.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and said to Qi Yuan, "I'll hold him off, you go first! I am Liu Guan, a cultivator from Wuxue City."</p><p></p><p>This way, at least one of them might survive.</p><p></p><p>If he fled, Patriarch Zuo Yuan would certainly not let him escape.</p><p></p><p>As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Qi Yuan was no match for Patriarch Zuo Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So before his death, he told Qi Yuan his name, hoping that if Qi Yuan escaped, he could use this favor to take care of his clan.</p><p></p><p>As for exposing his identity, </p><p>once he was dead, Patriarch Zuo Yuan would be able to find out who he was anyway.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan gritted his teeth and charged towards Patriarch Zuo Yuan, as if heroically embracing death.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Zuo Yuan's eyes held a contemptuous smile, not holding back at all as he immediately unleashed his Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>The crisis had arrived, requiring a swift resolution.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, you're not being fair, trying to steal my kill!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Kunmu had said that he must slay a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Currently, the only one in this cave was Patriarch Zuo Yuan, so Qi Yuan certainly couldn't leave him for Liu Guan.</p><p></p><p>He took out his cleaver and drew the blade.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's speed far surpassed Liu Guan's.</p><p></p><p>Before Liu Guan even heard Qi Yuan's voice, Qi Yuan's figure had already appeared beside Patriarch Zuo Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>How could a Foundation Establishment cultivator be so fast? But upon seeing Patriarch Zuo Yuan's Golden Core unleashed, he hurriedly shouted, "Don't touch the Golden Core!"</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between Nascent Soul and Foundation Establishment cultivators was the possession of a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Core was a solid manifestation of spiritual power, formed based on a Golden Core spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power of Foundation Establishment cultivators in their dantian was merely liquid.</p><p>But the Golden Core was the spiritual power solidified into a fixed form, suspended above the Golden Core spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>It was indestructible, being just one of its most insignificant special properties.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a mere Foundation Establishment dares to intrude into the Six Caves, you've already found your way to death!" </p><p></p><p>The massive Golden Core emitted dense spiritual light.</p><p>Each ray of light was concentrated spiritual power.</p><p>A single thread could scorch a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's cleaver was unafraid of any spiritual light, directly cleaving down onto Patriarch Zuo Yuan's Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"Your Golden Core's quality is poor, it can't even withstand a single chop of my cleaver!" Qi Yuan's eyes held a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a crack appeared on the supposedly indestructible Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>With a crisp sound, the Golden Core shattered.</p><p>Surging spiritual energy poured down like rain.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Zuo Yuan's eyes were filled with horror as he clutched his chest: "How... how is this possible..."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Core he had painstakingly cultivated was shattered by a cleaver? And by a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>"Pah." Patriarch Zuo Yuan coughed up a mouthful of blood, and in a flash of light, he was cut down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the cleaver, blowing lightly on its sharp edge.</p><p>The fresh blood instantly rolled off.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Elder Liu watched this scene, completely dumbfounded.</p><p>What had he just witnessed? A cleaver shattering a Golden Core? This was a Foundation Establishment cultivator? </p><p>He didn't even deserve to carry the shoes of the Ten Great Elites of the Great Zhao! This must be an extraordinary genius!</p><p>He swallowed hard, his heart greatly shaken, yet somewhat excited - he had bet correctly.</p><p></p><p>He approached Qi Yuan, his flattery even more effusive.</p><p></p><p>However, a sudden change occurred.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous roar echoed from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"You want my Black Chicken Elder's Shenying, no way!"</p><p></p><p>Following the roar, a deafening rumble came, and Liu Guan felt an indescribable buzzing resonating deep within his spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>His face turned deathly pale, and he directly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan holding the cleaver, he glared around angrily: "Who the hell let out such a huge fart!"</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had heard a tremendous farting sound.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one answered him.</p><p></p><p>He looked over and saw Liu Guan had fallen to the ground, seemingly unconscious.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he was knocked out by a fart?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Six Caves,</p><p>the nine Shenying cultivators' clothes were tattered, their conditions not looking good.</p><p>The old man leaning on a cane had an enormous hole in his chest, blood continuously flowing.</p><p></p><p>"The old demon Black Chicken is truly the old demon Black Chicken, even at the brink of death he was able to counterattack and severely injure three of us!"</p><p></p><p>"If not for a Dao companion holding out, the final spiritual attack would have fallen on us, and at least four of us would have perished here." The hunched old woman looked at Venerable Kunmu, her eyes filled with astonishment.</p><p>Because the spiritual power of this cultivator had reached the late Shenying stage, surpassing even that of the old demon Black Chicken.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine present, only he had spiritual power stronger than the old demon Black Chicken.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Dao companion!" </p><p>"Thank you, Dao companion!"</p><p></p><p>The few present all expressed their gratitude to Venerable Kunmu.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Kunmu's expression did not change: "Let us rest here for a while, then depart this place."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>They could not separate.</p><p>Otherwise, the injured might be secretly killed by someone.</p><p>They did not trust each other at all.</p><p></p><p>"The old demon Black Chicken has finally been eliminated, our Great Zhao Cultivation World can now look forward to over a hundred years of peace." An old man sighed, his expression emotional.</p><p></p><p>The great cultivators present all felt a sense of emotion.</p><p>This battle had not only eliminated the old demon Black Chicken, but also allowed them to acquire all the treasures the old demon had left behind in his cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan glanced at Elder Liu, seeing that he wouldn't be waking up anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned around: "That fart was so outrageous, not only did it knock out the living, it even revived the dead!"</p><p></p><p>He looked over, only to see the Patriarch Zuo Yuan he had just slain was now alive again.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

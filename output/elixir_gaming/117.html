        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Slay the great demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Restore peace to the world!"</p><p></p><p>"With the death of the great demon and the vanquishing of inner demons, we shall be heroes for all eternity!"</p><p></p><p>Many supreme beings of the Purple Sky Alliance came from all corners of the world.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran, Baize, the Foolish Daoist and others also arrived at the ends of the earth, standing beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the giant warship in the distance, their eyes brimming with intense fighting spirit, as well as a trace of worry.</p><p></p><p>On the warship were 123 supreme beings. </p><p></p><p>Over 90 of them were from the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The rest were from other major factions.</p><p></p><p>These people stood on the warship, exuding a strong fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>The warship stopped in mid-air, five li away from the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Blood Palace at the ends of the earth sensed a powerful threat.</p><p></p><p>They had a premonition that if the hundred-plus supreme beings on the warship attacked simultaneously, the people here wouldn't be able to withstand even a single strike.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing that the figure in the blood-red robe remained calm, their hearts settled slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an ethereal female voice rang out: "Hand over the great demon, and the people of the Blood Palace may keep their lives."</p><p></p><p>The owner of that ethereal voice was none other than the legendary Purple Sky Mysterious Woman.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of those at the ends of the earth remained unchanged. Mockery flashed in Shang Yanran's eyes: "Hand over the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, and your lives may be spared!"</p><p></p><p>These words immediately enraged the supreme beings on the warship.</p><p></p><p>But the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman did not anger. Her gaze fell on Qi Yuan, turning cold: "Your previous incarnation was originally a compassionate Buddha, but because of a demonic woman, you took one step into evil, creating endless inner demons and causing over 100 million lives to perish in our Liufeng Realm. Your crimes deserve death.</p><p></p><p>Great Demon, why don't you kill yourself? This Venerable One will not make things difficult for the others of the Blood Palace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan laughed: "If you covet the 'Demon Trapping Technique', just say so. Why put a label on my head? You really are a shrimp-headed woman!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" A man on the warship flew into a rage, "Great Demon, even the Fate Stone Tablet has recorded that you are the Great Demon. You still try to distort the facts? Just surrender quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm: "Usually during major battles, I can't be bothered to engage in verbal sparring. </p><p></p><p>But today..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan changed his tone: "When I destroyed the Purple Sky Alliance headquarters, your male pet, Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, told me an earth-shattering secret!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words immediately piqued everyone's interest.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were on Qi Yuan, wanting to know the secret about the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman.</p><p></p><p>Even at this tense moment, people still had some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Your male pet told me that the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman is his old mother!" Qi Yuan shouted.</p><p></p><p>His voice carried for over twenty li.</p><p></p><p>All who heard were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace crowd was stunned upon hearing this, then burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>Among the experts on the warship, some grew angry, while others looked at the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman with strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's face darkened, murderous intent seemingly materializing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then Qi Yuan was heard saying:</p><p></p><p>"Who can't write a short essay?"</p><p></p><p>"I can spread rumors too!"</p><p></p><p>"But I can't be bothered to prove to others whether I'm the Great Demon or not."</p><p></p><p>"So what if you frame me? So what if you slander me?"</p><p></p><p>"You say I'm the Great Demon, that I've brought calamity to the world. Well then, today I'll act the part of that Great Demon and bring some calamity to this world. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>"I have a sword that can slay you all!"</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, explaining himself was futile.</p><p></p><p>Proving his innocence through death would only invite mockery from his enemies.</p><p></p><p>The best method was... kill, kill, kill!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't skilled at verbal battles or explanations. His specialty was simply beheading.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, the sea behind him began to boil instantly.</p><p></p><p>The entire ocean, stretching for dozens of li, turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored water quickly condensed, transforming into a blood-red longsword.</p><p></p><p>A longsword appeared in Qi Yuan's left hand.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming aura spread at this moment. Qi Yuan now truly resembled a great demon.</p><p></p><p>All who saw Qi Yuan felt an inexplicable fear arise in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Only the Golden Canary looked at Qi Yuan with stars in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was her childhood sweetheart!</p><p></p><p>However, she still said weakly: "Blood Pearl, I'll go to Sister Yanran's side."</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Pearl was about to start a great battle. If she kept holding his hand, she would become a burden.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "To kill them, why should you leave? I'm not at ease handing you to others for protection; I'm more at ease protecting you myself."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Shang Yanran, then looked back at the warship.</p><p></p><p>A solemn expression also appeared on the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's face.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Great Demon, your demonic aura is overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>However, opposing the world alone is simply seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Possessing the Fate Stone Tablet, the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman felt extremely confident inside.</p><p></p><p>Because the Fate Stone Tablet was even more powerful than imagined.</p><p></p><p>And she had uncovered the true secret of the Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>It was a secret that even the Buddha had not discovered.</p><p></p><p>With the Fate Stone Tablet, she did not fear even if the Buddha were to be revived!</p><p></p><p>"It is you who seek death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his longsword high.</p><p></p><p>Sky-Cleaving Sword Draw! He didn't move.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red longsword flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sword grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>It reached a full li in length! Following Qi Yuan's loud shout, the powerful blood-colored longsword fell directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the Blood Palace members were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Especially Shang Yanran. She had originally thought the gap between her and her master wasn't large.</p><p></p><p>But she never expected the gap to be this huge.</p><p></p><p>This one sword strike was enough to obliterate her!</p><p></p><p>It could even annihilate everyone in the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings on the warship also became shocked, some terrified.</p><p></p><p>Only the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman remained calm and collected.</p><p></p><p>The Fate Stone Tablet she had swallowed into her belly emitted a flash of light. She felt boundless heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, I am invincible!"</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her hand. Energy surged from her hand, forming a massive palm.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Fate Stone Tablet transferred to her hand.</p><p></p><p>Her hand directly grasped that blood-red longsword.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>She exerted force.</p><p></p><p>That blood-colored longsword seemed unstable, slowly dissolving under her immense power.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's lips curled in a smile: "Justice will always vanquish darkness. Your strongest attack has been blocked by me. What other tricks do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's face turned cold as she continued observing the battle.</p><p></p><p>If the situation turned unfavorable, they would implement the second plan - escape from the ends of the earth!</p><p></p><p>The others felt the same. The Blood Lord's strength had shocked them, but the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman was clearly even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Until now, no one of the same level had been able to so easily block his Sky-Cleaving Sword Draw.</p><p></p><p>Generally, when this sword strike was unleashed, even those several levels higher than Qi Yuan would die.</p><p></p><p>His eyes began to work.</p><p></p><p>[Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, an ordinary cultivator, currently in a special state.]</p><p></p><p>Special state? Unfortunately, his eyes were not omniscient.</p><p></p><p>He did not know what the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's special state referred to.</p><p></p><p>But that didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>"You have indeed surprised me, but that's all."</p><p></p><p>Sky-Cleaving Sword Draw! ×10.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mana bar was very thick.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when facing the old man killer of Di Jue, he wouldn't have been able to slay him through sheer force.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sea behind him turned blood-red again.</p><p></p><p>Ten terrifying blood-colored longswords gathered once more, standing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>All the blood-red robes, following Qi Yuan's gaze, forcefully fell upon the warship.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's expression changed greatly, but she still gritted her teeth and said: "You have exceeded my expectations, but that's all!"</p><p></p><p>She clenched her teeth, channeling a third of her blood into the Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her hand again, blocking those ten longswords.</p><p></p><p>Her face was deathly pale, but filled with endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked all the supreme beings on the warship.</p><p></p><p>Those supreme beings became extremely excited, shouting loudly: "The Alliance Leader is invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"Using such a powerful divine ability, he must be depleted!"</p><p></p><p>"Severely wounded!"</p><p></p><p>"Slay this demon, today is the day!"</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader is invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Without the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, this Great Demon would likely rampage unchecked, with no one able to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, looking at the completely depleted Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, and slowly said: "It seems the Fate Stone Tablet is truly a supreme treasure, actually able to elevate you to this level. But... does it matter?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't even move.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance.</p><p></p><p>The sea behind him overturned again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the reddened seawater was a hundred times more than the first time!</p><p></p><p>Sky-Cleaving Sword Draw! ×100.</p><p></p><p>Death Radiance! This time, Qi Yuan also used Death Radiance.</p><p></p><p>He needed to recover some mana.</p><p></p><p>Using the Sky-Cleaving Sword Draw a hundred times simultaneously was taxing even for him.</p><p></p><p>So he also used Death Radiance to recover some mana from these supreme beings!</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred swords, each a li long, hung in the air. How majestic, how shocking.</p><p></p><p>The entire world turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's right hand held the Golden Canary's, his left hand pointing at the warship.</p><p></p><p>His hand slowly lowered.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the warship trembled! Their previous joy completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>Was this still human? Over a hundred swords...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Sword! For the first time, a look of terror appeared on Zi Tian Xuan Nü's face.</p><p></p><p>However, she still forced herself to shout loudly: "Destiny Stone Tablet!"</p><p></p><p>She had discovered the deepest secrets of the Destiny Stone Tablet, and she should be its master. </p><p></p><p>The power provided by the Destiny Stone Tablet should be enough to sweep across the world.</p><p></p><p>But this time when she shouted, the Destiny Stone Tablet that was supposed to be her contract item seemed to be playing dead, with no response at all.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of great swords descended from the sky. This time, without the empowerment of the Destiny Stone Tablet, Zi Tian Xuan Nü's outstretched hand was directly shattered by one of the swords.</p><p></p><p>The entire warship capsized in that moment.</p><p></p><p>An expression of disbelief appeared on Zi Tian Xuan Nü's face: "No!"</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand. </p><p></p><p>She couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Why was there no reaction now from the Destiny Stone Tablet that had given her such great power, allowing her to freely traverse the river of time and space, and even destroy a country with one strike?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that everything was an illusion? Crack!</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of giant swords of the Heaven-Cleaving Sword Technique demonstrated to the world what it means that big is strong and more is better! With full firepower unleashed, the warship was pulverized.</p><p></p><p>None of the supreme beings even had time to escape.</p><p></p><p>All that remained of the entire battle was Zi Tian Xuan Nü's battered body and an ordinary-looking stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Endless blood rain also began to fall across the world.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face bore a contemptuous expression: "I'm not some damn Great Demon, I'm the Fourth Disaster that's a thousand times, ten thousand times more terrifying than a Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon wasn't even fit to tie his shoes.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Blood Palace on the scene were all extremely shocked by this sight.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of supreme beings, as well as Zi Tian Xuan Nü who possessed the Destiny Stone Tablet, were all destroyed by the Blood Lord with a single sword?</p><p></p><p>What an imposing strength was this? They had originally thought this battle would be extremely difficult, and that a large portion of those present would perish.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, they didn't even have a chance to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord had merely moved his lips, without even changing his position.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the hundreds of supreme beings on the warship... were just gone?</p><p></p><p>Everyone exclaimed in amazement. The Canary was especially excited, standing on tiptoes to give Qi Yuan a quick peck on the cheek: "Blood Boy, you're too amazing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit stunned by the Canary's kiss.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this was the first time anyone had kissed him in the game.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan did not let his guard down at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zi Tian Xuan Nü's corpse turned into a beam of light, entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences before anyone could react.</p><p></p><p>Zi Tian Xuan Nü's corpse seemed to bring a huge change to the terrifying heart demon in the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a loud thumping heartbeat suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan abruptly looked towards the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>He saw that within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, it was as if a terrifying monster was walking out.</p><p></p><p>This also brought an unpleasant change to everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Boy... my head hurts so much!" The Canary looked at Qi Yuan, her previous vitality completely gone, her little face as pale as paper, as if enduring something.</p><p></p><p>"I... heart demon!" Shang Yanran's face also turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"The heart demon in the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences... is coming out!" Yu Daoren also had a pained expression, suppressing the evil in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face became serious for the first time.</p><p></p><p>He knew everyone's condition better than anyone.</p><p></p><p>The "Demon Trapping Technique" had trapped everyone's heart demons.</p><p></p><p>Only when they died a natural death would the demons turn into evil spirits and emerge.</p><p></p><p>But now, the terrifying heart demon from the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences was walking out, stirring up the heart demons in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, the heart demons inside everyone present would break out of their bodies, killing them all here.</p><p></p><p>Once the heart demon from the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences emerged, everyone in this world would likely die.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Canary, a hint of reluctance in his eyes: "Canary, I have to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences now. Remember... I will find you at the end of time."</p><p></p><p>Many things had happened during this enlightenment of the origin, but the time had also been the shortest, not even two months.</p><p></p><p>Having just met the Canary, they now had to part.</p><p></p><p>The Canary's little face was deathly pale, but she forced a bright smile: "This young lady... will wait for you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over everyone, then looked at where the Destiny Stone Tablet was.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Destiny Stone Tablet seemed to have disappeared from his sight.</p><p></p><p>He knew he couldn't wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and charged in without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>As the figure in the blood-colored robe disappeared, the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences closed again.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying heartbeat also became weaker at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The paleness disappeared from the Canary's face. She looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, her eyes full of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Boy... will he be okay?"</p><p></p><p>She looked towards everyone.</p><p></p><p>Those present gradually returned to normal. Shang Yanran's face bore a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences are endless heart demons. </p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord's entry will subject him to the pain of being torn apart a thousand times!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others all felt somewhat tragic and pained.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord has done this for us, for this world, willingly feeding himself to demons!</p><p></p><p>Yet this world still calls him a Great Demon. How utterly ridiculous!" Baize said sorrowfully.</p><p></p><p>The Canary stared blankly at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences: "When will Blood Boy... be able to come out?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't care how the world viewed Blood Boy, she only cared that Blood Boy could come out alive.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran shook her head and said dejectedly: "No one who has entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences has ever come out.</p><p></p><p>And he... will ultimately be assimilated into a heart demon."</p><p></p><p>Heart demon... blood demon.</p><p></p><p>"No, there must be a way!" The Canary refused to accept this fact and ran towards the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>However, she was unable to get close.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Differences that was right before her eyes seemed to be separated by the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present remained silent.</p><p></p><p>A strange look appeared in Shang Yanran's eyes: "The Destiny Stone Tablet. If we get the Destiny Stone Tablet, we might be able to find a way to save the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards where the Destiny Stone Tablet had been, but saw that it was empty.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Countless pains gnawed at Qi Yuan's soul.</p><p></p><p>Even he felt intense pain.</p><p></p><p>This pain was a hundred times, a thousand times stronger than facing those old monsters of Di Jue.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, with a door behind him.</p><p></p><p>This was the door he had entered through.</p><p></p><p>He looked up.</p><p></p><p>He saw a staircase descending from the sky, its height unknown.</p><p></p><p>There was also a door in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>On the stairs was a withered corpse.</p><p></p><p>The corpse wore neat monk's robes, looking extremely peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Its skin was like tree bark, as if it hadn't been moistened by water for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The sunken eyeballs were like dead fish eyes, shriveled and stinking, staring at Qi Yuan with a resentful gaze.</p><p></p><p>This corpse was walking down the stairs, as if wanting to reach Qi Yuan and push open that door.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the heart demon of the Great Demon?" Qi Yuan asked, enduring the pain.</p><p></p><p>The withered corpse opened its mouth. Its voice was hoarse, but carried a compassionate heart: "Thank you, benefactor, for entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and helping this humble monk close the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once this humble monk goes out, this world will completely fall into ruin."</p><p></p><p>The voice was very gentle, but the gaze was very resentful, as if the two were fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>"Gate of Ten Thousand Demons?" Qi Yuan recalled that the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences was the gate of ten thousand gates, and could be any gate.</p><p></p><p>In this Buddha's eyes, it was the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, but in Qi Yuan's eyes, it might be some other gate.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor's entry into this gate is likely not just to close the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and prevent this humble monk from walking out," the withered corpse spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had come here with another important purpose, which was to gain enlightenment of the origin.</p><p></p><p>Now, inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, his enlightenment was happening every moment, and was also extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"This poor monk does not know benefactor's purpose.</p><p></p><p>But for benefactor to achieve his purpose, he may need to send this humble monk into reincarnation, then climb these Ten Thousand Demon Stairs." The withered corpse spoke.</p><p></p><p>The so-called sending into reincarnation meant killing it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and asked: "You seem... out of place in this Flowing Wind Realm."</p><p></p><p>His eyes looked at this withered corpse, obtaining some useful information.</p><p></p><p>A hint of gentleness finally squeezed out of the resentful gaze of that withered corpse, as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>"This humble monk came from the Buddha Realm."</p><p></p><p>"This realm has an inauspiciousness, it is a land abandoned by the gods. Living beings cannot reincarnate or ascend to paradise.</p><p></p><p>This humble monk thought his cultivation was profound, brought three thousand volumes of Buddhist scriptures, opened the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to enter this realm, wishing to enlighten this realm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this humble monk's nature was shallow, and instead gave rise to heart demons, bringing great disaster to this realm."</p><p></p><p>"Please, benefactor, help me find release, help this realm find release!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, when the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences opens, the inauspiciousness will spread to the Buddha Realm, and the Buddha Realm may fall into ruin!"</p><p></p><p>As the withered corpse spoke, its resentful gaze looked at Qi Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly leapt towards Qi Yuan, as if wanting to tear him to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was cold: "I can help you find release, but as for helping the world find release, I cannot do that."</p><p></p><p>This world hadn't offended him, so why should he help it find release?</p><p></p><p>Thank you ←God Without Tears for two 1000 rewards, thank you reader 20230326094541974 for the 1000 reward, and Wind Thunder Emperor for the reward!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

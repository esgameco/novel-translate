        <h1>Chapter 546</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The injury is very serious, very serious. I have never seen such a severe injury before," said Butterfly, the Insect Maiden, fluttering her wings as she looked at the blood-soaked Qi Yuan with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The tattered robe was stained with dried blood, and Qi Yuan had his eyes tightly closed, his breath weak and faint like a suspended thread.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan held the unconscious Qi Yuan in her arms, filled with self-blame and guilt. If it weren't for her, perhaps Qi Yuan wouldn't have come up and wouldn't have suffered such a serious injury.</p><p></p><p>"If it were anyone else, with such a severe injury, they would have already died," Butterfly said, her face filled with disbelief. The events that had occurred today were beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary Saint-ranked expert from the Green Mountain Realm had actually managed to slay the Mighty Roc Feng Tian. After all, Feng Tian was no ordinary Great Venerable. In the chaotic Star Realm, there were countless powerful experts, and at the Great Venerable realm, Feng Tian was virtually invincible.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had brought too many unexpected surprises.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined that Brother Qi Yuan would be so powerful. If his talent were to be revealed, even ordinary Realm Lords might compete to take him as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the graceful figure of Xian Ling appeared. Feng Tian had slashed open the Divine Wood Abyss, leaving many gaps, and with his powerful strength, he had managed to enter through these gaps. As for Ji Wuyun and Chen Kang, they did not possess such strength.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." Butterfly looked at Xian Ling with caution.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling's name contained the word "handsome," but his appearance was rather ordinary, and he would not stand out in a crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I and Brother Qi Yuan are barely friends, and I have no ill intentions," Xian Ling said, marveling inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only witnessed a glimpse of the battle between Qi Yuan and Feng Tian, he had seen the extent of Qi Yuan's talent.</p><p></p><p>At the Great Venerable realm, when cultivators attain the Divine Realm, they will gain insights into the heavens and the earth. There is a slim chance that the cultivator may merge with the universe and comprehend the laws of the universe, forging the heart of the laws.</p><p></p><p>Once one has forged the heart of the laws at the Great Venerable realm, the Radiant God Second Layer's Profound Truths Realm would pose no difficulty, and they may even have a great chance of stepping into the Radiant God Third Layer.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the last technique Qi Yuan had displayed... it seemed to be a fusion of two hearts of the laws.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the Radiant God Third Layer is divided into the Realm of Laws, the Realm of All Things, and the Realm of Creation. Only in the Realm of All Things can one fuse the laws.</p><p></p><p>Even Realm Lords in the Realm of Laws may spend their entire lives without being able to fuse the laws and step into the Realm of All Things.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had fused the laws in the Yin God Realm...</p><p></p><p>What does this mean? It means that if he has the opportunity to step into the Realm of Laws, he would have a nearly 90% chance of stepping into the Realm of All Things.</p><p></p><p>The Realm of All Things, as long as one can forge nine first-grade laws, they can step into the Realm of Creation. Of course, nine is the bare minimum, and the more laws one forges, the stronger they become.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, as he looked at the blood-stained robe of Qi Yuan, he felt like he was witnessing the rise of a future Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were to grow normally, he would undoubtedly become a Realm Lord, and not just any ordinary Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>In any universe, Realm Lords are absolute figures of great importance, commanding the stars, the heavens, and the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to save him, I have a plan," Xian Ling said. "Let him join the Void Paradise. I'm sure many Realm Lords in our Void Paradise would be willing to take him as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>As for the Void Realm Lords, there was no need to consider them. These towering existences were not interested in taking disciples.</p><p></p><p>But other Realm Lords might not miss the opportunity to acquire this promising seed.</p><p></p><p>"No," Butterfly quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a Mandate Bearer, carrying the Mandate within him.</p><p></p><p>If he were to join the Void Paradise and become the disciple of other powerful experts from other universes, it would be a "betrayal of the city."</p><p></p><p>A Mandate Bearer represents not only themselves but also the will of the world, and even the will of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Why has the Radiance been constantly slaying Mandate Bearers? It is to seize control of the discourse power in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the Void Paradise, while its relationship with the Awakening Alliance is relatively close, they are still outsiders... their hearts must be different, how can they be trusted?</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling shook his head, "This plan is indeed not suitable."</p><p></p><p>After all, he had no qualifications to meet the Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, if he were to proclaim Qi Yuan's terrifying talent, he might not attract Realm Lords, but instead, some ancient monsters.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhou Universe, there are many Radiant Gods who cannot break through. If they discover Qi Yuan's terrifying talent, they might just kidnap him.</p><p></p><p>As for what they would do with him, it is unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from this, I don't have a better solution," Xian Ling said, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The place was left with only Butterfly, Shen Lingxuan, and the unconscious Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Butterfly's gaze kept changing, and finally, she looked at Shen Lingxuan with a complex expression. "I have a method that may be able to wake him up, but... it may harm your foundation."</p><p></p><p>"What method?" Shen Lingxuan trembled, realizing something.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yin..."</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Shen Lingxuan said, biting her lip, a blush appearing on her delicate features, making her look enchantingly alluring.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, in the ice room, Qi Yuan lay on the ice bed, the bloodstains on his body already wiped clean.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan looked at Qi Yuan's handsome face with some concern, unsure of how to proceed.</p><p></p><p>What if...</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was still a patient.</p><p></p><p>After gazing at him for a while, she hesitantly reached into her dress, removing the chest wrap and undergarments, even though Qi Yuan was still unconscious, she was still embarrassed and did not want to expose her body.</p><p></p><p>"My lord..."</p><p></p><p>With a flushed, pale complexion, like a plum blossom blooming in the snowy landscape, Shen Lingxuan lifted her skirt, revealing a large stretch of her snow-white, delicate legs.</p><p></p><p>Her legs were long, proportionate, and straight, as smooth and flawless as white jade, without a trace of excess flesh.</p><p></p><p>Brows furrowed, Shen Lingxuan was unsure of how to proceed, but she bent her legs and, holding up her skirt, sat on top of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to move, but dared not, nor did she know how to go about it.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like celestial beauty, encountering this situation for the first time, was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the content Zhi Shuang had taught her, and her hands cautiously began to caress upwards.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the excessive stealth, the originally unconscious Qi Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, how can I sleep through this kind of thing and be a dead fish?" he said.</p><p></p><p>On TV, there were often plots where the male lead would wake up and not even know that the female lead had slept with him, let alone experience the sensations of that night.</p><p></p><p>This was the kind of thing Qi Yuan naturally did not want to happen to him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Shen Lingxuan sitting on top of him, and although his gaze was weak, it was resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Although you're on top now, in the end, it'll be me... riding..."</p><p></p><p>Yes, as a man of his word, what he said had to be realized.</p><p></p><p>If he said he would ride, then he would ride.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake?" Shen Lingxuan's face lit up with delight, quickly followed by an even deeper shyness as she sat on Qi Yuan, feeling his reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, can you take off the veil? Otherwise, it feels a bit strange," Qi Yuan said, although he could not see, he could still sense that Shen Lingxuan had a veil covering her face.</p><p></p><p>Roleplay is roleplay, after all.</p><p></p><p>"...Okay," Shen Lingxuan hesitated for a moment, then removed the veil that was covering her face.</p><p></p><p>This veil was a protection for her, and she rarely took it off.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing Qi Yuan, she still took it off.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Shen Lingxuan, watching as she removed the veil.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he could see nothing, yet he felt as if he was beholding the ultimate bliss of the world.</p><p></p><p>He saw what seemed to be a pure, innocent schoolgirl, yet also a cold, aloof celestial beauty, a seductive holy maiden of a demonic sect, a voluptuous and alluring imperial concubine, and a lonely, pitiful princess secluded in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Enchanting and bewitching, with an icy elegance that concealed the utmost charm.</p><p></p><p>In her every movement and gesture, she exuded the allure of all beings.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Mysterious Yin physique, no wonder she has to wear a veil," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Who could withstand this? Even though Qi Yuan was blind, just by perceiving Shen Lingxuan's face with his spiritual senses, his heart was filled with inexplicable desires.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to cage her, yet also wanted to tear her apart.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan naturally would not be influenced by such external forces, and he would always follow his own heart and do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Shen Lingxuan looked at Qi Yuan, her thoughts in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Her lord was not supposed to be blind, yet he could still make such an evaluation. </p><p></p><p>But thinking that he could not see her current predicament brought her a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her skirt was hiked up to her waist, revealing her shapely thighs in a kneeling position, exuding an irresistible charm.</p><p></p><p>A pair of arms embraced her waist, and Shen Lingxuan felt as if she had fallen into the clouds, the corners of her eyes flushed with a crimson hue, looking enchantingly alluring. Her delicate hands also unconsciously left marks on Qi Yuan's back.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p></p><p>When the moonlight shone upon the Divine Wood Abyss, the usually cold and lonely Shen Lingxuan clung to Qi Yuan's side like a dependent little bird.</p><p></p><p>Her figure was still clothed, but the attire was rather disheveled, with some areas that should have been covered now exposed, the thin, snow-white back flushed with redness.</p><p></p><p>She looked like a water lily ravaged by the rain, her beautiful brows still slightly furrowed, evoking a sense of pity.</p><p></p><p>But there was even more charm and allure.</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching feature was the pair of long, shapely legs sprawled out, the delicate bare feet arched in sleep.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at her, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"Master?"</p><p></p><p>"No, not that."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I'm blind, otherwise I might have known by now."</p><p></p><p>"No, she is just herself, not anyone else."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, his mood quite good.</p><p></p><p>From his battle with Feng Tian, he had gained many harvests.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had seen the path of the third layer of the Sun God, and had slain the Phoenix Cry ten times, so his experience bar had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>His battle with Shen Lingxuan also yielded a bountiful harvest, allowing him to experience a great joy in life, and his role-playing was fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if this were on the Blue Star, he might be worried about his own kidneys, but this was a different world, so he had nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>"However, the reward for completing the role of Qi Yuan the parasite groom is somewhat mediocre."</p><p></p><p>The final reward was Qi Yuan's innate talent as a forgemaster.</p><p></p><p>His forgemaster talent was not as good as Qi Yuan's, so the reward given to Qi Yuan was merely passable.</p><p></p><p>Increasing one's forgemaster talent is always a good thing.</p><p></p><p>[Qi Yuan the parasite groom role-playing completed, role character 5 unlocked.]</p><p></p><p>[Role character 5: A stone.]</p><p></p><p>"This is making me play a rock... Pretend to be the Monkey King?"</p><p></p><p>When it came to playing a stone, the first thing Qi Yuan could think of was Sun Wukong.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and began to accept the memories that came with being this stone.</p><p></p><p>Stones have no memories.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan saw its entire life. It stood lonely atop the mountain, day after day, year after year, weathering the wind and rain, the cycle of the sun and moon.</p><p></p><p>A grapevine grew on it, bearing grapes. But as time passed, the grapes fell to the ground, and new grapes grew, but time was the most merciless.</p><p></p><p>Until finally, no more fruit grew on the withered vine, and the grapevine disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>The stone was lonely again.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, small birds would land on it, occasionally dry leaves would keep it company, but the duration never lasted long.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky shattered and the earth cracked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"The Goddess Nüwa mending the sky?"</p><p></p><p>"No, mending the earth!"</p><p></p><p>He had once told the Soundless Voice the story of the Goddess mending the earth.</p><p></p><p>And now, the story he had told had become a reality in the memories of this stone.</p><p></p><p>The earth split open, endless lava gushing out, swallowing everything.</p><p></p><p>The common people knelt on the ground, praying to the heavens to extinguish the earthly fire.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a goddess appeared. She surveyed the four realms and took the stone standing on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>With her supreme magical powers, she used the stone to mend the earth, finally stopping the spread of the earthly fire.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this... the story in the 'Secret of Origins'?"</p><p></p><p>The 'Secret of Origins' recorded many mythological legends of the Divine Wood Universe, and later Qi Yuan had also found this book and read the remaining fragments.</p><p></p><p>The story of the goddess mending the earth was recorded in those fragments.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that many of the mythological legends in the 'Secret of Origins' are true, then what about the 'Classic of Mountains and Seas'?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a sudden inspiration.</p><p></p><p>The 'Secret of Origins' was the 'Classic of Mountains and Seas' of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, after the goddess mended the earth, this stone was shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Most of it was used to fill the earth, and the remaining..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan seemed to see a tombstone.</p><p></p><p>However, since he was a stone, the scenes he saw were all blurry, not even as good as his heart's eye.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining stones were used to make a tombstone, and the last one... was me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He had never played the role of a stone before.</p><p></p><p>The key to it still needed to be slowly explored by him.</p><p></p><p>But for now, the most urgent task was to play the role of the blind forgemaster.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"There is a blind woman in the Divine Wood Abyss, I need to go down there and continue forging."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said calmly on the hot spring.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go down too." The insect woman Caibei said.</p><p></p><p>She was also curious about what was in the legendary Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go in, it hurts." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He did not choose to take Shen Lingxuan into the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>After all, the pain of passing through the light point was something that ordinary people could not endure.</p><p></p><p>"I've lived for tens of thousands of years, what pain haven't I experienced, just let me crash in..."</p><p></p><p>Splash, the insect woman Caibei rushed towards the entrance of the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her body fell.</p><p></p><p>She passed out in pain.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan saw this scene, and her gaze towards Qi Yuan became even more pitiful.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had endured such pain, but came to the Divine Wood Abyss to slay the Phoenix Cry to save her as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go down first, if you encounter any danger, I'll come up immediately."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, without any hesitation, he returned to the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the confinement of the Divine Wood Abyss is too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Even the strongest of men, when they come here, have to say they can't do it."</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Abyss, facing Shen Lingxuan, Qi Yuan felt like a god of war, able to ride n times a day without any problem.</p><p></p><p>But if he were in the Divine Wood Abyss, and Shen Lingxuan came to find him every day, he reckoned he would have to hold his waist and dodge.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Where's the person?" Qi Yuan wandered around the Divine Wood Abyss, but did not sense the presence of the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, let's just start forging."</p><p></p><p>After awakening his heart's eye, Qi Yuan felt that he had become overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The speed of forging artifacts had also become faster, as if he had divine assistance.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the blindness has had a huge impact on me, it's better to have awakened the heart's eye. In the past, it would take half an hour to forge these materials, but now it only takes a quarter of an hour."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>People need eyes.</p><p></p><p>Without eyes, they need a heart's eye.</p><p></p><p>Without a heart's eye, at least they should have a butt hole, right?</p><p></p><p>At least having an eye, it can be considered a skill, and they won't be unemployed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat under the ladder, forging the materials.</p><p></p><p>"The help of the heart's eye is indeed great, in another half a month... I estimate I'll be able to forge a divine-level artifact."</p><p></p><p>"But... an artifact as powerful as the Divine, is not as easy as an ordinary divine-level artifact."</p><p></p><p>"At least... it needs to integrate eight forging techniques."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured and shrugged, getting up to go to the blind woman's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if she's back?"</p><p></p><p>Walking through the familiar yet strange path, Qi Yuan came to the blind woman's door.</p><p></p><p>The sound of rustling water came, and Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman was home.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I've awakened my heart's eye, I'm out of materials, give me some."</p><p></p><p>The blind woman who had just finished washing her face walked out of the room, holding a wooden basket in her hand, which was filled with various materials.</p><p></p><p>"You've awakened your heart's eye?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan looked towards the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even with the awakened heart's eye, his vision was still hazy, and he couldn't see clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Barely." The blind woman handed the wooden basket to Qi Yuan, her delicate nose slightly wrinkled, "You have a strong sweat smell, go take a bath."</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Abyss, Qi Yuan was no different from an ordinary person, and it was normal for him to sweat while working.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Qi Yuan took the wooden basket and returned to his own dwelling.</p><p></p><p>After forging for a long time, he was also a bit tired, and needed to wash up and sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Too bad there are no ants in this Divine Wood Abyss, otherwise I could fight with the ants."</p><p></p><p>After taking a bath, Qi Yuan was eating some fruit and muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"There aren't even any bugs in these fruits, otherwise I could fight with the bugs, maybe I could even break through myself."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Abyss was too perfect, the fruits were all sweet, without any trace of being gnawed by insects.</p><p></p><p>The water was also clear, without any pollutants.</p><p></p><p>Everything was beautiful and unreal.</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts, Qi Yuan slowly drifted into dreamland.</p><p></p><p>The moon was bright and the stars were sparse, the night was enchanting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint fragrance wafted over, and a delicate figure crashed into Qi Yuan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Lingxuan?"</p><p></p><p>Half-asleep, Qi Yuan instinctively thought it was Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Abyss, on the second day, Shen Lingxuan had once night-attacked Qi Yuan, and at that time Shen Lingxuan was very gentle and considerate, and since Qi Yuan couldn't see, she took the initiative to come close, letting Qi Yuan taste.</p><p></p><p>So when the delicate figure came, he naturally embraced her and kissed her.</p><p></p><p>Soft, tender, sweet.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness suddenly awakened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is the Divine Wood Abyss, Lingxuan can't come in."</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the woman did not answer him.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>But he soon stopped being confused.</p><p></p><p>Because... he, the mighty Five Elements Qi Cultivator, Heavenly Dao Foundation, Eternal Golden Dan, Purple Qi Underworld Purple Palace, who mastered two supreme truths, was actually pushed down.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even see clearly who this woman was, and his strength was not as great as this woman's in the Divine Wood Abyss, his combat power was not much stronger than an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>As for calling for help?</p><p></p><p>Please... that would be very embarrassing, not to mention his mouth was blocked.</p><p></p><p>After a night of turbulent waves, Qi Yuan slowly woke up, his head throbbing.</p><p></p><p>The memories of last night came back, and he had a thoughtful look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Did I have a wet dream?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>He gently sniffed, and on his stone bed, there was a faint floral fragrance, a very familiar scent.</p><p></p><p>A bold guess arose in Qi Yuan's heart, and he was also very angry.</p><p></p><p>"Is she lusting after my body?"</p><p></p><p>Although the other party had saved his life, he had not repaid her with his body.</p><p></p><p>If it was really the blind woman, setting aside the fact that she had saved him, she had truly become Qi Yuan's new white moonlight.</p><p></p><p>After all, although this matter would be mocked by many people on the Blue Star, a man being pushed down by a woman.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was different, he was the victim.</p><p></p><p>He also did not trivialize the harm done to men.</p><p></p><p>"Is it her?" Qi Yuan was deeply puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He felt it was her, but he also felt it wasn't.</p><p></p><p>But that floral fragrance was really from the same source as the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he had to go find the blind woman and confront her.</p><p></p><p>A man's innocence is also innocence.</p><p></p><p>The handsome should boldly stand up!

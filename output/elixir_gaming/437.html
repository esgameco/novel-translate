        <h1>Chapter 437</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Blood Pavilion is a place to test one's progress in cultivating ancestral blood. Many people from Purple Origin Heaven come here daily to check their progress.</p><p></p><p>Even for cultivators with diluted bloodlines on the fringes, if they can reach the sixth level of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture', they can become core figures of Black Demon Abyss. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, every cultivator in Purple Origin Heaven, and even Black Demon Abyss, spends their whole life cultivating the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'."</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu calmly explained as she flew through the sky with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Looking out, black mountains and rivers stretched as far as the eye could see, with occasional towns visible.</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the sixth level means going from slave to singing master?" Qi Yuan asked in surprise. </p><p></p><p>The core figures of Black Demon Abyss enjoyed all kinds of privileges.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Fifth Heaven, that snitch Qi Yuan encountered was a mythical being, but was still striving to become a core figure of Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although Qi Yuan also reported An Xunlu this time, his was a righteous report, so he shouldn't be called a snitch dog, but rather a reporting hero.</p><p></p><p>"But we demon children don't have such restrictions. Below the Yang Spirit realm, we have the highest status!" Purple Origin Xiaolu explained to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In Purple Origin Heaven, more than half of each generation of demon children could enter the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"If we can pay the price, we can even invite Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable to take action for us!" Purple Origin Xiaolu's face showed excitement.</p><p></p><p>Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable was like a towering mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>For Yin Spirits to request Yang Spirits to take action was unimaginable below the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, with just three sentences, I can get four thousand Yang Spirits to spend 30 billion for me!" Qi Yuan wasn't particularly impressed by Purple Origin Xiaolu's words.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu opened her mouth in an "O" shape, like drinking bubble tea.</p><p></p><p>The two of them landed near the Ancestral Blood Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling it a pavilion, it was more like an Ancestral Blood Nation.</p><p></p><p>A huge walled city stretched for countless miles, with over 100 million living beings visible.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that all these beings were cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Without enough space and spiritual energy, cultivation progress would be very slow.</p><p></p><p>Many beings were natives, locals.</p><p></p><p>But even more came from various realms of Purple Origin Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Heaven governed 600 worlds in total.</p><p></p><p>Massive numbers of cultivators came daily for ancestral blood testing.</p><p></p><p>The scene was somewhat similar to Blue Star students coming to take the imperial examinations.</p><p></p><p>Mastering one level of the Ancestral Blood Scripture could make one an elite in their own world.</p><p></p><p>"Black Demon Abyss is indeed a major power in the Sixth Heaven. Purple Mansion cultivators are nothing in comparison!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze across and immediately saw thousands of Purple Mansion realm cultivators without even looking closely.</p><p></p><p>As a Purple Mansion realm cultivator himself, he felt a bit insecure.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Ancestral Blood Pavilion, stretching for countless miles, many cultivators lined up for testing.</p><p></p><p>Looking out, it resembled a black dragon.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators appeared excited, clenching their fists.</p><p></p><p>Some youths looked bewildered, their spirits somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>In their former lands, they may have been top ten geniuses, ranked 300th in their world, outstanding talents.</p><p></p><p>But coming to Purple Origin Heaven's Ancestral Blood Pavilion, such people were just common cabbages.</p><p></p><p>The strong were nothing special here.</p><p></p><p>Even geniuses had to wait in the bustling queues.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan felt quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed many geniuses in big places.</p><p></p><p>Randomly picking someone from below would probably be able to easily defeat Senior Brother Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>So sometimes, one's background is also very important.</p><p></p><p>"How long will it take to queue up? Until the year of the monkey?" Qi Yuan clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he didn't want to queue.</p><p></p><p>But his morals and values told him to be fair and just, to queue up.</p><p></p><p>This made him feel like he had encountered Sister Niujiao.</p><p></p><p>He needed to comprehend some ultimate truth to make up for this shortcoming.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Senior Brother, we are demon children and don't need to queue. Follow me," Purple Origin Xiaolu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan blinked.</p><p></p><p>Was there such a good thing? Not having to queue made him feel relaxed.</p><p></p><p>But... inside...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly greatly admired some of his fellow countrymen from Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>They could automatically adjust their values to benefit themselves.</p><p></p><p>If he could comprehend such an ultimate truth, wouldn't he be invincible?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>The two turned into streaks of light and strode confidently towards the Ancestral Blood Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, some of the cultivators queuing below showed curious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"How can they fly directly!"</p><p></p><p>"Those are demon children, among the strongest bloodlines in all of Purple Origin Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I'd have the chance to see demon children in my lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of many, Qi Yuan and Purple Origin Xiaolu arrived at the Ancestral Blood Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they landed, a white-haired elder came running to greet them, his expression particularly friendly: "Greetings to the two demon children!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm here to test my 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' progress and convert it to contributions," Qi Yuan said straightforwardly, not wanting to waste time here.</p><p></p><p>The elder hunched over: "Demon Child, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu didn't follow inside.</p><p></p><p>Entering the testing area of the Ancestral Blood Pavilion, Qi Yuan's expression was calm as he surveyed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the imagined scene of swirling immortal energy, the atmosphere in the Ancestral Blood Pavilion was very gloomy, dark, and blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Huge blood-red chandeliers looked extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>A blood river divided the room in half.</p><p></p><p>In the blood river, Qi Yuan's eyes saw many tiny living beings.</p><p></p><p>These beings were only about the size of bacteria.</p><p></p><p>Dense and numerous, they seemed to have life.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Demon Child, infuse the blood spirit energy of your cultivated 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' into the blood river.</p><p></p><p>The blood spirits in the river will sense Your Highness's blood and determine how many levels you have reached."</p><p></p><p>The elder said softly, his eyes still carrying some expectation.</p><p></p><p>This Demon Child seemed to have come to Black Demon Abyss less than half a year ago.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' for only a short time, yet came for testing.</p><p></p><p>This made the elder sigh with emotion - no wonder the other was a demon child, while he was just a doorkeeper.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' for a full ten years before barely entering the first level.</p><p></p><p>Not comparing to those demon children, this was still quite outstanding.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe Demon Child had cultivated for less than half a year, and now... one level, or two levels, or perhaps... the legendary third level? Thinking about it, he immediately shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword reached the third level in half a month, and the fourth level in three months.</p><p></p><p>This was the fastest record in the entire history of Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Black Sword, no one else had reached the third level in one year.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary demon children also took about a year to enter one level.</p><p></p><p>So he estimated that Blood Robe Demon Child was most likely at the first level, with a small chance of being at the second level.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the elder's explanation, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the strange beings in the blood river, his eyes showing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>[Intelligent micro-detection bugs, capable of detecting 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>Network connection is in a broken and drifting state.]</p><p></p><p>His eyes saw a different aura from the blood spirits.</p><p></p><p>This statement, how was it somewhat sci-fi?</p><p></p><p>Inconsistent with the immortal way? No, it couldn't be said like that either.</p><p></p><p>Because the immortal way and sci-fi, to some extent, reach the same destination by different routes.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get this blood river from?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The elder was somewhat confused: "This... this old one doesn't know."</p><p></p><p>"Can I have a little bit? My home is too empty, I don't have any pets." Qi Yuan reached out his hand asking for it.</p><p></p><p>This put the elder in a difficult position.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he gritted his teeth: "Alright, but only a tiny bit."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I'll give you a good person card."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, reaching into his bosom to take out...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He took out a card and wrote "Good Person Card" on it with a brush.</p><p></p><p>"Look, your good person certificate!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old man couldn't help but smile bitterly as he accepted the "Good Person Card": "Thank you for this gift, Your Highness the Demon Prince." When His Highness the Demon Prince ascends to become the Yangsheng Celestial Venerable, his handwriting... might be worth something?</p><p></p><p>The old man waved his hand as he spoke, collecting the blood river water into a golden bowl. </p><p></p><p>The small golden bowl contained ten thousand jin of water.</p><p></p><p>"Is this enough?" the old man asked cautiously. </p><p></p><p>He was actually a bit puzzled that someone was still interested in this blood river.</p><p></p><p>This blood river had no use other than testing the progress of the Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>"It's enough," Qi Yuan accepted the golden bowl.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll start the test now."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he began to circulate the Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were in disarray. </p><p></p><p>Should he conceal it a bit? Generally speaking, cultivators would hide their true abilities.</p><p></p><p>But then he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hide my ass.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to tell the ancestors of Ziyuan Heaven: Bring on the ancestral blood!</p><p></p><p>He needed to quickly increase his cultivation to improve his ability to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, Qi Yuan frantically circulated the Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>The old man watched intently, staring at the blood river with anticipation in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After about one breath of time passed, the old man's eyes lit up: "One pillar of blood emerged without diminishing. Your Highness the Demon Prince is indeed not just at the first layer, but pushing towards the second layer."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old man was convinced. </p><p></p><p>How could the gap between people be so large? Entering the second layer in just half a year - this speed would rank in the top ten in the entire Black Demon Abyss, right? He felt like he was witnessing history.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses were emerging.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Heaven was about to produce a true genius.</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath, his eyes widened: "Actually... three pillars!"</p><p></p><p>Three pillars of blood were spraying from the blood river.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe Demon Prince... was truly second only to Black Sword now.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Black Sword, no one in the Black Demon Abyss had ever reached the third layer within a year.</p><p></p><p>No wonder there were rumors outside that the ancestors wanted to pit Blood Robe against Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>At first, the old man thought it was a bit far-fetched.</p><p></p><p>To make an inappropriate comparison, if the Demon Prince was a once-in-ten-thousand-years genius, then Black Sword would be a once-in-ten-billion-years genius.</p><p></p><p>He believed Blood Robe could surpass the other demon princes and suppress Ice Sword, but he didn't believe he could reach Black Sword's level.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>His breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors had keen insight.</p><p></p><p>However, once he started breathing rapidly, he couldn't stop.</p><p></p><p>Because the blood river before his eyes was bubbling frantically.</p><p></p><p>One blood pillar after another shot up crazily.</p><p></p><p>After three pillars, it was four pillars, then five!</p><p></p><p>The old man was stunned, completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blood river before him in disbelief, his mind in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"Seven... pillars?"</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes, his pupils dilating, his thoughts in chaos.</p><p></p><p>How could it be seven pillars!</p><p></p><p>This was the seventh layer! Cultivating the Ancestral Blood Scripture to the seventh layer meant that without any further cultivation, just sleeping all day, with enough resources, one could directly enter the Yangsheng realm after 100,000 years.</p><p></p><p>The seventh layer was a watershed.</p><p></p><p>Among all the current demon princes of the Nine Heavens, those who had cultivated the Ancestral Blood Scripture to the seventh layer could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>Now, there would be one more person.</p><p></p><p>And the time they spent cultivating the Ancestral Blood Scripture... was all measured in tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe did it in half a year? The old man was completely dumbfounded, or rather, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Stop gasping, I'm starting to feel the room getting hot. It's the seventh layer now, hurry up and give me the contribution points!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held out his hand, asking for contribution points.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still needed to attend the Ultimate Principle Discourse Meeting.</p><p></p><p>These words woke the old man from his shock.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, reaching the seventh layer of the Ancestral Blood Scripture in less than half a year.</p><p></p><p>This was too shocking and earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>It was no less astonishing than if the ancestors had been killed by a three-year-old child's fart.</p><p></p><p>"This... according to procedure, this old one needs to report upwards," the old man said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The scene before him was too exaggerated, too dreamlike, as if it were fake.</p><p></p><p>It was like if your neighbor on Earth told you they had won the first prize in the lottery, with a prize of one trillion dollars - you probably wouldn't accept it, thinking it was too absurd.</p><p></p><p>The old man didn't dare to question it; this matter needed to be reported upwards.</p><p></p><p>As the one in charge of the Ancestral Blood Pavilion, he had privileges that ordinary people didn't have, which was to transmit information from within the Ancestral Blood Pavilion to the ancestors.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out a black incense stick and quickly lit it.</p><p></p><p>In the Black Demon Abyss, black was supreme.</p><p></p><p>Black incense represented the highest level of information.</p><p></p><p>After lighting it, the old man felt somewhat uneasy as he stared at the seven pillars of blood, his expression dazed.</p><p></p><p>Outside the sky curtain.</p><p></p><p>The Ziyuan Ancestor was refining the Black Demon Ancestral Blood. A moment later, his expression became somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I can't cultivate anymore. The Root Demon Tribulation is coming soon. With my current cultivation, I'm afraid I won't be able to pass the next Root Demon Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Ultimate Principle realm experts face the Root Demon Tribulation when increasing their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Root Demon Tribulation becomes stronger each time.</p><p></p><p>If one's comprehension of the Ultimate Principle is of a low grade, it's easy to perish in the Root Demon Sea when facing the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Among Yangsheng realm experts of the Ultimate Principle, very few die in battle; most die in the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Even some Great Ultimate Principle realm experts have perished in the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have mastered the Supreme Ultimate Principle can face the Root Demon Tribulation without feeling like they're walking on thin ice.</p><p></p><p>"Is this old man's limit only three tribulations?" the Ziyuan Ancestor sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Ultimate Principle realm, he had only passed through three Root Demon Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Great Elder, no other Great Ultimate Principle expert had passed four tribulations.</p><p></p><p>"Linya Tui is also approaching soon. I'd better not cultivate anymore. Sigh, being a Great Ultimate Principle expert is really difficult," the Ziyuan Ancestor sighed, then thought of something and said dissatisfied, "Why did my dog brain comprehend this grade of Ultimate Principle?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint black smoke rose outside.</p><p></p><p>The Ziyuan Ancestor's attention was slightly drawn to it.</p><p></p><p>"News from the Ancestral Blood Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>His thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a genius has emerged, or... Blood Robe went for testing?"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, the possibility of Blood Robe testing seemed the highest.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed anticipation: "Could it be three layers, or even four!"</p><p></p><p>He had high hopes for Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword and the Black Demon Ancestral Blood were of the same origin, so it was normal for Blood Robe to be inferior to Black Sword in cultivating the Ancestral Blood Scripture. But as long as the gap wasn't too big, he could accept it.</p><p></p><p>He placed his hand on the black incense.</p><p></p><p>His eyeballs rolled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Seven layers??"</p><p></p><p>He was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>Three months... seven layers? Are you even human! He could confirm that Blood Robe hadn't cultivated the Ancestral Blood Scripture before.</p><p></p><p>Seven layers in three months.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't him cultivating the Ancestral Blood Scripture anymore, it was as if the Ancestral Blood Scripture was begging him to cultivate it! The Ziyuan Ancestor waved his hand, and the scene from the Ancestral Blood Pavilion appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Seven pillars of blood, dazzlingly bright! This proved that Blood Robe had indeed reached the seventh layer in three months! He stared at Qi Yuan, his expression shocked, then ecstatic: "To hell with Linya Tui, to hell with the Six Heavens, this old man won't serve them anymore!"</p><p></p><p>What he would serve... was naturally the person before him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he frantically circulated his Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to intercept this piece of heavenly secrets and erase it!</p><p></p><p>PS: Starting tomorrow, eight thousand words every day this month!</p><p></p><p>That's right, this sentence is not for readers to see, it's to motivate myself!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the entrance to the Ten Thousand Demons Gate, twenty great supreme beings gathered, along with one hundred supreme beings from the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, these supreme beings stood guard together, following the orders of their Lord to wait and hunt down the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"There are some little rats outside, should we go deal with them?" asked a great supreme being from the Demon Realm. </p><p></p><p>He was referring to He Wu and Ling Yayi, who were hiding around them.</p><p></p><p>When this great supreme being made the suggestion, many of the great supreme beings from the Demon Realm were eager to act.</p><p></p><p>"Dealing with them would be a waste of time," a human supreme being spoke up. "Our Lord's task for us is to capture the Blood Lord. Everyone, let's not be negligent!"</p><p></p><p>These human supreme beings were quite fearful of their Lord, and prioritized following his orders.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this so-called Blood Lord may frighten you humans from the Flowing Wind Realm, but we from the Demon Realm are not afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Why make such a big fuss? Just two great supreme beings from our Demon Realm would be enough to capture the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>They knew quite a bit about the Blood Lord's information.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord's innate divine ability could trigger heart demons to break out of one's body.</p><p></p><p>This was a devastating attack against the supreme beings of the Flowing Wind Realm, but the demons were not afraid.</p><p></p><p>The human supreme being who had spoken earlier showed a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>These supreme beings from the Demon Realm still retained their bestial nature and were unruly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cat demon woman great supreme being, who had been silent until now, spoke up: "Everything should follow our Lord's orders. As for those little rats... ignore them for now."</p><p></p><p>The cat demon woman great supreme being had a tall figure and beautiful features. The most eye-catching thing about her was the row of headlights on her chest.</p><p></p><p>That's right, a row.</p><p></p><p>This cat demon supreme being, after transforming into human form, was different from other female demons. She still retained some feline characteristics.</p><p></p><p>A cat tail, cat ears, and... a cat's five pairs of breasts.</p><p></p><p>After transforming into human form, she looked especially dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Many male supreme beings would intentionally or unintentionally glance at her.</p><p></p><p>Such a cat woman would definitely be popular with otaku on Earth! If Qi Yuan saw her, he might have such a thought.</p><p></p><p>The cat demon woman supreme being was also the leader of the demon supreme beings present.</p><p></p><p>Once she spoke, the demon supreme beings present no longer mentioned going to kill He Wu.</p><p></p><p>They quietly stood guard, waiting for the Ten Thousand Demons Gate to open.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, fierce winds arose from within the Ten Thousand Demons Gate, and a surging aura swept out from inside.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme beings involuntarily looked towards the entrance.</p><p></p><p>It was pitch black there. Even the great supreme beings could not see anything when they sent their divine sense inside.</p><p></p><p>They needed to observe with their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As long as they passed through that black mist, they would arrive in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's about to open!" The cat demon woman great supreme being's face was excited. She smiled broadly, her smile exaggerated, with her whole row quivering impressively. She swept her gaze over all the supreme beings present. "Who is willing to enter the black mist and scout the situation?"</p><p></p><p>"This old one is willing to go."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too."</p><p></p><p>Two demon great supreme beings were eager to try.</p><p></p><p>They went with the intention of capturing the Blood Lord, as well as the idea of entering the Flowing Wind Realm to feast on human blood.</p><p></p><p>The cat demon woman great supreme being smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Those two great supreme beings directly entered the black mist.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme beings present waited quietly, their faces showing relaxed expressions.</p><p></p><p>"After this mission is over, we need to have a good feast," said a tiger-faced demon great supreme being, his gaze falling on the faces of the human supreme beings, with some greed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The human supreme being who was being looked at glared back fiercely, saying with dissatisfaction: "The mission is not over yet. We'll talk about everything after capturing the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>"With so many of us powerful beings, it's just a matter of time before it's over. In fact... we may not even need to act. The great supreme beings Fufen and Yangli who went in might have already captured the Blood Lord," the tiger-faced great supreme being said casually.</p><p></p><p>Those demon great supreme beings all seemed unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"You humans fear the Blood Lord, but we demons do not!"</p><p></p><p>"With so many powerful beings here, what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange expression appeared on the cat demon woman great supreme being's face: "Great supreme beings Yangli and Fufen are coming out... so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>The other great supreme beings also sensed this, some showing smiles.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect these two to be so fast. Could it be they've already captured the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>After all, according to their Lord's words, the Blood Lord had lost his inscribed innate divine ability and was no longer a threat, with his strength even dropping to the mid-stage supreme being level.</p><p></p><p>They had come with so many powerful beings, already looking down on the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>In everyone's gaze, they saw great supreme beings Fufen and Yangli frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings present were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Things seemed different from what they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The cat demon woman great supreme being waved her long sleeve, blocking Fufen and Yangli. Her expression was stern: "Why are you in such a panic? Did you see the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Fufen and Yangli both had wild expressions.</p><p></p><p>"No... no!" Fufen's face was anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you running?" the cat demon woman great supreme being questioned.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many people, too many!" Yangli recalled what he had seen in the distance after entering the darkness, and his scalp was still tingling.</p><p></p><p>Dense crowds, people everywhere!</p><p></p><p>"Many people?" A human great supreme being was surprised. "Could it be that the supreme beings from the White Emperor Palace have also come? But if so, how will they deal with the South-North battle?"</p><p></p><p>There were still many supreme beings in the southern lands of the Flowing Wind Realm. If these supreme beings ignored the South-North battle and entered the Ten Thousand Demons Gate...</p><p></p><p>It would indeed be difficult for them to handle.</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me to take a look," said the cat demon woman great supreme being boldly.</p><p></p><p>"No, there are too many of them, tens of thousands, no, hundreds of thousands, too many, and they're all supreme beings!" Fufen said frantically. "Let's run quickly, if we don't run now it will be too late!"</p><p></p><p>He had only taken a quick glance from afar before being scared out of his wits and running back.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the great supreme beings present were first stunned, then laughed lightly: "I know very well how many supreme beings there are in the Flowing Wind Realm. Great Supreme Being Fufen, I'm afraid you've fallen for an illusion and been tricked!"</p><p></p><p>The world level of the Flowing Wind Realm was just that, its capacity simply couldn't support that many powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>These supreme beings naturally didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Translated to Earth terms, it would be like an American warship arriving at a certain sea, then quickly retreating and reporting to their commander in a panic:</p><p></p><p>"It's bad, the Chinese have sent ten thousand aircraft carriers!"</p><p></p><p>The Americans hearing this probably wouldn't believe it either.</p><p></p><p>The great supreme beings now had a similar thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Flowing Wind Realm is on the verge of collapse. Even if it had a final burst of energy, it could at most create nearly ten thousand supreme beings. But now, it hasn't even reached that stage yet. How could there be so many supreme beings? It must be an illusion!" the cat demon woman great supreme being asserted. "There's no need to be afraid. Come with me to take a look."</p><p></p><p>The twenty great supreme beings and one hundred supreme beings present all had calm expressions, with a hint of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"No, I won't go. It's absolutely true, they're all supreme beings!" Fufen was already scared out of his wits.</p><p></p><p>Yangli was the same.</p><p></p><p>The two of them wanted to flee directly, but were easily suppressed by the cat demon woman great supreme being and couldn't leave.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings present looked at the two terrified supreme beings, with a hint of contempt in the depths of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>To be scared by a mere illusion, these two may have become great supreme beings, but they still hadn't completely shed their bestial nature from when they were demons.</p><p></p><p>Just as the group was preparing to enter together, suddenly, a rumbling sound came from within the black mist.</p><p></p><p>It was as if thousands upon thousands of troops were advancing silently within the black mist!</p><p></p><p>The forms of the vast army had not yet appeared, but their powerful aura was already soaring to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned for a moment, feeling their innate divine abilities become somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>Especially the great supreme beings from the Flowing Wind Realm, their sensations were the most vivid.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there were terrifying demon gods within the black mist, powerful beyond imagination!</p><p></p><p>"It can't be... real, can it?" A great supreme being from the Flowing Wind Realm trembled, his innate divine ability sensing the most, detecting great terror.</p><p></p><p>"Such a small Flowing Wind Realm..." The cat demon woman great supreme being's eyes were filled with doubt and complexity.</p><p></p><p>A world of the Flowing Wind Realm's level couldn't possibly produce too many powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>"It's real, let's run quickly, if we don't run now it will be too late!" Fufen hated the cat demon woman great supreme being to death.</p><p></p><p>If she hadn't blocked him, he would have fled long ago.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no one had the heart to listen to Fufen's words.</p><p></p><p>They hesitated, wavered, were bewildered, doubting themselves for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes looked towards the black mist. At this moment, a vast voice that shook the heavens came through.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Palace takes action!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who obstruct, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who surrender, kill!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was immense, as if a thousand supreme beings were speaking in unison.</p><p></p><p>In the black mist, the terrifying army finally revealed the tip of the iceberg.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red qi dyed the black mist red.</p><p></p><p>In the blood mist, a thousand supreme beings wearing uniform blood-colored robes, like the most ordinary soldiers, formed battle formations.</p><p></p><p>The aura of supreme beings, used as one</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An exaggerated statement, as if it would erase even the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>The leader in the blood-red robe looked at the few supreme beings ahead, his eyes filled with an arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>"You... you are Yang Hun, why are you here?" A human supreme being looked at Yang Hun, his eyes full of shock. How did this formerly insignificant supreme being seem to have become a different person?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the Blood Lord had... leveled the north and south?</p><p></p><p>Gathered a thousand supreme beings? Thinking about it, it did seem possible.</p><p></p><p>A thousand supreme beings were very strong, but it would still be difficult to change the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>"I am Supreme Being Yang Hun, commander of the Blood Palace army's vanguard!" Yang Hun swept a contemptuous glance at that great supreme being, as if to say "who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Vanguard? Could it mean there were more behind?</p><p></p><p>Before everyone could react,</p><p></p><p>"Dogs of the Venerable One, demons of the Myriad Demon Realm... kill without mercy!" Yang Hun spoke, and with the help of their formation, the supreme beings of the vanguard launched a unified attack.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>A thousand supreme beings attacked simultaneously, the momentum vast and unparalleled in strength.</p><p></p><p>Their formation was led by Qi Yuan, with the other supreme beings working together.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to perfectly combine the power of a thousand supreme beings into one.</p><p></p><p>With one move, over a thousand origin divine abilities were unleashed simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Origin divine abilities poured out as if they cost nothing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the hundred-some supreme beings present didn't dare to resist and fled quickly.</p><p></p><p>Faced with a thousand supreme beings, they had long since lost any will to fight.</p><p></p><p>But escape was simply impossible!</p><p></p><p>The origin divine abilities of a thousand supreme beings, enhanced by the formation, poured in like a surging river.</p><p></p><p>With just one strike, two-thirds of the hundred-some supreme beings on the scene died instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Kill again!" Yang Hun was exhilarated! Could a small fry like his former self ever have imagined commanding a thousand supreme beings? The thousand supreme beings attacked again, unleashing endless origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The one-third of supreme beings who had barely managed to resist died in droves once more.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun was also filled with bloodlust, issuing commands three times in succession.</p><p></p><p>The thousand supreme beings of the vanguard unleashed origin divine abilities recklessly.</p><p></p><p>This first battle upon entering the Myriad Demon Gate had to be clean and decisive, it had to be spectacular! Kill kill kill!</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the Blood Palace naturally had to bathe in blood rain, naturally had to slaughter all enemies.</p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths of time, all hundred-some supreme beings on the scene perished, with only one left alive due to Yang Hun's deliberate restraint.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how strong a great supreme being was, they could not withstand the simultaneous attack of a thousand supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Among these thousand supreme beings, there were also quite a few great supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the survivor over to offer to the Blood Lord!" Yang Hun commanded, his voice carrying a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the enemy this time was too weak, they had simply steamrolled through without him getting to display his clever strategies.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Hun... the Venerable One is invincible, even if you have over a thousand supreme beings, so what?" Seeing he had no chance of survival, that human great supreme being grew bolder, "You have no idea how magnificent an existence the Venerable One is!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun glanced sideways at this great supreme being and said contemptuously, directly using his own words against him: "You also have no idea what a magnificent existence your Venerable One is opposing!"</p><p></p><p>He led a small team, escorting this severely injured great supreme being towards the rear.</p><p></p><p>That great supreme being was like a dead fish, not even bothering to struggle.</p><p></p><p>He was brought by Yang Hun into the black mist, and his heart suddenly contracted violently.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt his body trembling in unconscious fear.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun's voice, humble as dust, came to his ears: "Blood Lord, the hundred supreme beings guarding the entrance of the Myriad Demon Gate have all been killed, with one deliberately kept alive!"</p><p></p><p>This great supreme being immediately felt countless eyes examining him from within the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, and in those already despairing eyes appeared a trace of deep terror!</p><p></p><p>What did he see! Dense, dense crowds of supreme beings!</p><p></p><p>They hovered in the void, forming formation after formation, just like mortal armies, all surrounding that supreme throne, and the supremely noble figure in the blood-red robe seated upon it.</p><p></p><p>How many supreme beings were there...</p><p></p><p>The great supreme being swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>In the black mist, divine sense could not spread, and he could not see clearly at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand? Thirty thousand, or a hundred thousand?</p><p></p><p>This must be fake, right? Has the world gone mad?</p><p></p><p>How could there be so many supreme beings? He suddenly recalled what he had said to Supreme Being Yang Hun, and now it seemed so laughable.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Venerable One's lair?</p><p></p><p>Where is the White Emperor now?"</p><p></p><p>The cold voice of the blood-robed figure seated high on the throne fell upon this great supreme being.</p><p></p><p>The great supreme being looked up, meeting Qi Yuan's eyes, his own filled with bewilderment: "They are all... in Wanzhang Plain..."</p><p></p><p>He did not conceal anything, mechanically telling all the information he knew.</p><p></p><p>Whether he told this information or not no longer mattered.</p><p></p><p>These densely packed supreme beings in the sky were incomprehensible, unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>How could the Venerable One he most admired possibly deal with this?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and suddenly broke down, shouting: "Is it Heaven's will to destroy our Liufeng Realm, you great demon!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he immediately ended his own life.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun's expression changed slightly: "This subordinate has failed in his duty, allowing this wretch to offend the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm as he looked at Yang Hun and asked: "Am I a great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun hastily said: "The Blood Lord is the son of destiny, overlord of this realm, how could he be a great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's lips curved in a smile.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the supreme beings of the vanguard returned again: "Blood Lord, we have captured several supreme beings who claim to be old acquaintances of the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, five supreme beings were brought before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi, who had been wearing a mocking smile, nearly fell to his knees when he saw the countless supreme being armies in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for He Wu, who widened his eyes, the scene before them far exceeding their imagination.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought the Blood Lord had consolidated the supreme being forces of the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>How was this consolidation? This was... creation from nothing!</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi swallowed hard, boldly speaking to dispel his nervousness: "Master, Master, do you remember me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the handsome and dashing Ling Yayi, noticing his covered left face, his expression showing a slight change: "The Thirteen Northern Demon Fiends... I know of you, but I don't know which one you are, what is your name?"</p><p></p><p>The vicissitudes of life, the passage of time, reincarnation can erase a person's traces.</p><p></p><p>Even the golden canary Ning Tao had changed from tsundere to yandere.</p><p></p><p>He did not recognize Ling Yayi, but he knew this was his eldest disciple who had entered the Myriad Demon Gate, suffered the curse of myriad demons, and struggled to awaken him.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Ling Yayi fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have spoken at all.</p><p></p><p>Here, with nearly a hundred thousand troops? Saying his former name under their gaze was too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"I am... Nangong..."</p><p></p><p>"Nangong?" Qi Yuan was somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"Nangong, Nangong..." Ling Yayi grew a bit anxious, and finally blurted out, "Nangong... Dagou."</p><p></p><p>"Dagou?" Qi Yuan looked at Ling Yayi again, finally recognizing him.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Dagou was a native of Jiupan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>And the hundred thousand troops behind, hearing this bizarre name, had a momentary change in expression.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Blood Lord's presence, if not for being in military formation, they likely would have burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Master, he is Foolish Daoist, now called He Wu!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I am Guqin!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I am Bai Li!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened to the five of them speak, his expression calm. He carefully looked at these five people, engraving them in his mind, and solemnly said: "I... have remembered you!"</p><p></p><p>This remembering, Qi Yuan took very seriously.</p><p></p><p>He had remembered many people.</p><p></p><p>Like the Five Ancestors in the Five Elements Forbidden Land from the first game.</p><p></p><p>And Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao who gave him wine in Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the situation in Wanzhang Plain is now critical, please quickly dispatch troops to capture the Venerable One! The golden canary... is still waiting for you!" He Wu said gravely.</p><p></p><p>He knew now was not the time for reminiscing, they had to quickly resolve the crisis in Wanzhang Plain.</p><p></p><p>As memories of the past surfaced one by one in his mind, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>When... this big boss the Venerable One was steamrolled, the task of guarding Wugui City would truly be complete.</p><p></p><p>He should also... leave this game.</p><p></p><p>"Advance!" A flash of ferocity passed through Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Finally, then... kill kill kill!</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand supreme beings in the sky, a hundred thousand red robes, all marched towards Wanzhang Plain!

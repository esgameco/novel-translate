        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that I'm just too handsome? Did the opponent surrender directly because they were captivated? </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the surrendering Duan Tianjiao, hmm, it's a woman.</p><p></p><p>It's only natural that she would be captivated by his good looks.</p><p></p><p>As for the gazes of the other people towards Qi Yuan, he seemed to have not noticed them.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan wins this battle!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan accepted this result with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got off the arena.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators then went up to perform martial arts and spells, fighting enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat quietly in the crowd, feeling drowsy.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan then stroked his beard, smiling: "Little brother Qi, you've obtained a Grade One Foundation Establishment Spiritual Object, the Yellow Flower Fruit. A bright future awaits you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit puzzled: "The spell battle hasn't ended yet, how does the Prince know I can take the top spot?"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan smiled without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly.</p><p></p><p>It was time for Qi Yuan's turn again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan was facing a sword cultivator from Mount Suspension.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators were quite rare in the Great Shang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took it seriously as well.</p><p></p><p>He actually wanted to see, whether the sword cultivator's sword art was flying by stepping on the sword, or transforming into a sword light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also knew that the opponent was only at the Qi Refinement Realm, so they wouldn't be able to fly by sword.</p><p></p><p>"Please teach me!"</p><p></p><p>The sword is the gentleman's weapon, Qi Yuan faced that sharp-eyed young man with humility and courtesy.</p><p></p><p>The young sword cultivator from Mount Suspension, holding an iron sword, its cold light flashing, he pointed the iron sword at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then extended his finger, transforming it into a sword.</p><p></p><p>In the game world, his weapon was a great sword.</p><p></p><p>The way of the sword.</p><p></p><p>A magnificent competition of sword arts between men was about to unfold.</p><p></p><p>However, at this critical moment, the sword cultivator's face suddenly turned deathly pale, he clutched his abdomen: "Such a powerful spell, it has harmed me invisibly! Senior brother... I admit defeat!" </p><p></p><p>That's right, this young man directly admitted defeat and stepped down from the arena.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>This scene, how is it so coincidental? Could it be that his looks have already captivated even men?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Yuan decided it would be better to go out less.</p><p></p><p>After another victory, Qi Yuan left the arena, squinting his eyes, suddenly looking towards the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>The mountain peak was majestic, intertwined like clouds, vaguely revealing a white jade palace.</p><p></p><p>Master.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, recalling that unruly woman.</p><p></p><p>Probably, in the entire Divine Light Sect, only she would be so "shameless" to do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother Qi, is the Yellow Flower Fruit yours?" The Prince of Changshan's eyes smiled, "To have such a master, you are truly blessed in this life."</p><p></p><p>After the emergence of the Grade One Foundation Establishment Spiritual Object, the Yellow Flower Fruit, these great sects and families of cultivators were indeed quite excited, itching to get their hands on it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Peak Master of the Seven-Colored Peak sent a messenger pigeon to other sects.</p><p></p><p>No enticement, only threats and a few favors.</p><p></p><p>These great sects could only feel helpless and dissatisfied, but they had to hold it in.</p><p></p><p>After all, this "shameless" cultivator was the only one, and their strength was so formidable.</p><p></p><p>The face of the Seven-Colored Peak Peak Master, they still had to maintain.</p><p></p><p>So, they came here and staged this performance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, other Qi Refinement Realm disciples would still try their best to compete in spells when they encountered each other.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment Spiritual Objects were not limited to just the Yellow Flower Pear.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Prince of Changshan and slowly said, "My master's face is that powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying it's a powerful face, it's more accurate to say their strength is formidable." The Prince of Changshan revealed a reminiscent expression, "Thirty years ago, the Demon Desire Gate was ambitious, seemingly wanting to unify the Great Shang and become the leader of the Immortal Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>First.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what happened later?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked curious and listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had only been in this world for half a year.</p><p></p><p>The time he had truly spent with his master was not very long, and his understanding of his master was not extensive, except that... she was very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Your master, the Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak, went to the Demonic Desire Gate alone.</p><p></p><p>She said she had taken a liking to the ancient Qi tree that the Demonic Desire Gate had just planted.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the Demonic Desire Gate was at the height of its power, so there was inevitably a battle.</p><p></p><p>No one knows the details of the process, only that your master planted that ancient Qi tree on the Seven-Colored Peak."</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan had a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"After that, the Demonic Desire Gate never mentioned it again, and the matter of it becoming the leader of the Immortal Dao of the Great Wilderness was forgotten."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was precisely because of this incident that the Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak had some favor with the major immortal sects, so this time they were willing to give a face to the master of the Seven-Colored Peak and hand over a Grade One Foundation Establishment Spiritual Treasure to her disciple.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and blurted out without thinking, "Is my domineering master in love with me?"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan's smile faded, "Keep your voice down, don't drag me into this!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan was really afraid of the Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that she was a great cultivator at the late stage of the Spiritual Embryo Realm. If not for an injury to her body, she would have already stepped into the Purple Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent process of Qi Yuan's battles could be said to be smooth sailing.</p><p></p><p>As long as he went up on stage, his opponents would admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>Probably before coming, they had already been instructed by the elders of their sects not to hurt the beloved disciple of the Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>However, an unexpected incident occurred when Qi Yuan entered the final round of the battle.</p><p></p><p>"Black Mountain Sect, Lu Yundong, please impart your teachings, senior brother!" Lu Yundong, dressed in black, emanated a strong aura of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He did not come up and admit defeat, but looked solemnly at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Please impart your teachings."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked at the strange-looking spiritual tool in Lu Yundong's hand.</p><p></p><p>It was like a feather duster, with black feathers densely packed and extremely hard.</p><p></p><p>【This is a Foundation Establishment spiritual tool. When used, the feathers will scatter like flowers, capable of harming Foundation Establishment cultivators.】</p><p></p><p>The elders of the major sects watching from the sidelines all showed expressions of surprise, and some even looked at the Ancestor of the Chicken, wondering what they were thinking.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect is not lacking in ambition," said the Immortal Flower Elder of the Demonic Desire Gate, looking at the Ancestor of the Chicken.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Chicken smiled and said, "Foundation Establishment spiritual treasures can be obtained by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, what would be the point of holding this Foundation Establishment competition?"</p><p></p><p>"They've even brought out a Foundation Establishment spiritual tool," the Sword Master of the Floating Mountain narrowed his eyes, staring at the Ancestor of the Chicken, "The old demonic chicken... has his cultivation probably advanced a bit further?"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at the Ancestor of the Chicken, wanting to learn more about the old demonic chicken from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>If the Black Mountain Sect suddenly took action, they would not believe it was without the guidance of the old demonic chicken.</p><p></p><p>The old demonic chicken was at the middle stage of the Spiritual Embryo Realm, while the Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak was suspected to be at the injured late stage of the Spiritual Embryo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the old demonic chicken had broken through to the late stage of the Spiritual Embryo Realm? From this small matter, the people present could glimpse many things.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tianbear also showed a satisfied smile. Previously, he had been threatened by Qi Yuan's words of a bloody disaster, and had wanted to get angry, but was persuaded by the Ancestor. Now, seeing this scene, he was particularly delighted.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see Lu Yundong use the Foundation Establishment spiritual tool to defeat that Qi Yuan and seize the Grade One Foundation Establishment spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>The sect elders on the scene were no longer paying attention to the outcome of the battle, but were thinking about how to convey the information back to their sects.</p><p></p><p>Only the Prince of Changshan and Lu Tianbear were still focused on the arena.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the rules, the Prince of Changshan could not warn Qi Yuan to be careful of the Foundation Establishment spiritual tool in Lu Yundong's hand.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

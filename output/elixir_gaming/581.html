        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But... the initial stage of life is still too fragile."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to return to the Blue Star and become the Star Lord, but he needed a large population for that.</p><p></p><p>That way, if a war were to break out between this universe and the Blue Star, it would be easy to surrender and join the Blue Star, then vote to become the Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Shen Lei."</p><p>"Qi Qi."</p><p>"Zhu Zhuang Shi."</p><p>"Brilliant, shining, born from the divine hidden. Hear my command, divine infants, come forth!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's solemn and majestic voice, suddenly over four thousand divine beings appeared in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>Each of them emanated a vast, mysterious, and towering aura, as if a single one could swallow a star.</p><p></p><p>When facing Qi Yuan, these primordial divine spirits created by the ancestral land and mythology all bowed their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p>"Greetings, Heavenly Father!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's strength increased, the divine infants within him also saw a corresponding increase in power. These primordial divine spirits were the wondrous objects of the ancestral land and the creations of Qi Yuan's divine mythology. Their system was different from the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"When working, call it your position." Qi Yuan smiled at Qi Qi.</p><p>"Father, I didn't call you godfather." Qi Qi said playfully. Although she visualized the Goddess of the Earth, she still maintained her pure and innocent nature.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind." Qi Yuan waved his hand, then looked at the many divine infants. "Now, I have opened the heavens in this realm and sown the seeds of many living beings. You shall replace me in caring for and helping these living beings to thrive and multiply."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were like edicts to these divine infants.</p><p>"We shall dutifully obey the Heavenly Venerable's commands!"</p><p></p><p>At this, the over four thousand divine infants simultaneously bowed their heads, receiving the orders.</p><p></p><p>"With living beings and divine beings, they surely won't disappoint, right?" Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had already accelerated the flow of time on these stars. Moreover, when he leaves this realm, one day for him would be a century in this universe. Perhaps it won't be long before life forms here multiply and form civilizations.</p><p></p><p>"Buddhas of the past, present, and future, please stay." Qi Yuan then called out.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha of the Past, Dipankara Buddha, the Buddha of the Present, Shakyamuni Buddha, and the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya Buddha, all folded their hands and stopped in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Transmit to me your insights about the past, present, and future."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had visualized the Three Pure Ones, he was still far from truly all-knowing and all-powerful. As for the past, present, and future, they were clear to him, yet also profoundly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>For example, he could easily accelerate the flow of time in a place. However, he could not travel back to the past, nor see the future.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the three Buddhas transmitted countless profound and complex information about the past, present, and future to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After about a hundred breaths, Qi Yuan sighed slowly, "Time does not actually exist."</p><p></p><p>If time does not exist, then what are the past, present, and future? "I shouldn't think too much about it, or my head will hurt again."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not ponder further. He did not want to end up looking like a big-headed baby, affecting his good looks.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Boundless Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Mastery of Myriad Transformations.</p><p></p><p>Within the overlapping spaces, the Sovereign of the Northern Realm spoke solemnly, "Add one, retreat two, extinguish, ignite..."</p><p></p><p>He issued various commands.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a diamond-like material kept transforming, as if undergoing a chemical reaction.</p><p></p><p>After about a hundred breaths, the Sovereign of the Northern Realm withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even after improving the 'Scripture of the Growth of All Things' created by the Life Dao Master, it still cannot awaken its true spirit."</p><p></p><p>The research topic of the Sovereign was to awaken the spirits, to awaken the true spirit of the fourth layer of the Yang Divines.</p><p></p><p>This research topic was among the top three most difficult of all topics.</p><p></p><p>The diamond-like object before him was deeply related to the fourth layer of the Yang Divines.</p><p></p><p>It was originally a pure Yang of the fourth layer, but when it was in the first stage of the Yang Divines, it encountered another terrifying fourth-layer Yang Divine, and the two collided. The pure Yang was ultimately defeated.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the pure Yang shattered into countless fragments when it was about to enter the final stage of the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>This shard of crystal was one of those fragments of its body.</p><p></p><p>The Mastery of Myriad Transformations had obtained the pure Yang shard and had been conducting research on it.</p><p></p><p>However, the fourth layer of the Yang Divines was too mysterious. They could not see any useful information at all.</p><p></p><p>"This failure means... there probably won't be any progress this era," the Sovereign of the Northern Realm sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, keep trying. Wasn't the original purpose of the Mastery of Myriad Transformations to find that tiny bit of change amidst the countless unchanging things?" another Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>They had already lost count of how many times they had conducted these experiments and research, and they were already accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the 'Scripture of the Growth of All Things' is still not perfect. If we improve it, maybe we can truly awaken the pure Yang shard," the Sovereign of the Northern Realm said.</p><p></p><p>"But that is the true scripture created by the Dao Master. How can it be easily improved?" the female Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>The improved version of the "Scripture of the Growth of All Things" had cost the previous Sovereign in charge of this topic a tremendous price.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, it cannot be improved." The Sovereign of the Northern Realm nodded.</p><p></p><p>After all, the stronger one's cultivation, the more difficult it is to make further progress.</p><p></p><p>"I heard a new person has recently arrived. Why don't we assign this task to him?" the female Sovereign suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Sounds good. We old-timers understand this technique too well, and our thinking has become too rigid. It's too difficult for us to seek change."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he just obtained the 'Devour the True Scripture'. He'll probably have to try for a hundred thousand years before he can come."</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand years is nothing, just a snap of the fingers for us."</p><p></p><p>These Sovereigns spoke without much concern.</p><p></p><p>After all, at their level, time was truly just a concept.</p><p></p><p>Just then, some information was transmitted to their jade tokens.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan has come?"</p><p>"Not trying to devour the True Scripture anymore?"</p><p>"Perfect."</p><p></p><p>Their thoughts were diverse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a handsome figure in a red robe appeared - it was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the eighteen Sovereigns and introduced himself, "My name is Qi Yuan. I'm a socially anxious person, I don't like talking or socializing, I'm law-abiding and principled, and I strictly follow the rules."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Realm smiled and said, "I'm Bei, I like talking."</p><p></p><p>"Huang Hai."</p><p>"Qi Meng."</p><p></p><p>The other Sovereigns also introduced themselves briefly.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Northern Realm continued, "As for the research topic of awakening the spirits, here are the current information and progress."</p><p></p><p>He transmitted the relevant materials to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at them expectantly, "No progress?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, awakening the fourth layer of the Yang Divines is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>If we can achieve a breakthrough, it may... rewrite the cultivation paths of countless universes and spatial realms."</p><p></p><p>"After all, if the fourth layer of the Yang Divines can still maintain their true spirits, just imagine how the cultivation path would change!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, do you have any ideas or experience that could help awaken the fourth layer of the Yang Divines?" the female Sovereign casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I do have some ideas and a bit of experience," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Sovereigns present were all a bit stunned. He has some ideas and experience?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please feel free to speak." The Lord of the Northern Realm smiled.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, if one is handsome, they will receive preferential treatment and have extraordinary luck in this world. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention, I am such a handsome and beautiful young man.</p><p></p><p>Even if I were to talk to a mere rock, it would enthusiastically respond to me." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords looked at each other in bewilderment. </p><p></p><p>They had seen many Lords with problematic minds, but this one was the first they had encountered who was so eccentric.</p><p></p><p>"You don't believe me? Let me give you a demonstration." Qi Yuan smiled, then looked at the Lord of the Northern Realm, "Let's use your robe as an example."</p><p></p><p>A sharp glint flashed in the eyes of the Lord of the Northern Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was at the Primal Opening Realm, and his robe was an exquisite treasure of immense value.</p><p></p><p>However, the robe was without sentience.</p><p></p><p>He also did not wish to wear a living being.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please try." The Lord of the Northern Realm said generously.</p><p></p><p>He was curious to see how Qi Yuan would make his robe come alive.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords were also full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were to simply find a random rock and make it gain true sentience, they might believe him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Primal Opening Realm was capable of creating worlds, possessing various special, mysterious, and complex abilities that could easily evade their perception.</p><p></p><p>But this experiment was being conducted on the Lord of the Northern Realm himself.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Northern Realm had existed for countless millennia at the Primal Opening Realm, so any small tricks would not be able to escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>"Little robe, I'm talking to you, can you hear me?" Qi Yuan spoke, activating his special ability.</p><p></p><p>This time, his voice was directed at the robe of the Lord of the Northern Realm.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords listening only heard an ordinary voice, without any divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"This seems to be a normal voice, without any spiritual techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Talk to a robe? Can he even make the robe pregnant?" The other Lords murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't sleep, come chat with me."</p><p></p><p>"I have many fellow Daoists here who want to meet you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke again.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords remained calm, either carefully perceiving or trying to understand what Qi Yuan was up to.</p><p></p><p>"Don't sleep too long, or you'll sleep to death!"</p><p></p><p>"Get up quickly, the sun is burning your butt!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to demonstrate his exceptional eloquence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that although he was socially anxious, his eloquence was still quite good.</p><p></p><p>After all, whenever he was with Ning Tao, Jin Siquai, and Jin Li, they were always very happy.</p><p></p><p>And their activities were also quite lively.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan, why don't you try a different object? This robe is worn by the Lord of the Northern Realm, so I'm afraid you won't be able to tamper with it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, why don't you try something else?"</p><p></p><p>The other Lords smiled, their expressions relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Northern Realm's expression remained unchanged, constantly focusing on his own robe and Qi Yuan's voice.</p><p></p><p>He also found it rather strange, as Qi Yuan's voice was quite ordinary, without any hidden Dao techniques or divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if you don't get up soon, I'm leaving." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>It was a classic tactic of feigning disinterest to provoke a reaction.</p><p></p><p>And sure enough, as soon as he spoke, something unexpected happened that left everyone stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Northern Realm's eyes widened, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even after living for so long, he had never imagined witnessing such a sight.</p><p></p><p>His robe, as if it had gained sentience, suddenly flew off his body, making strange noises.</p><p></p><p>"It's alive?"</p><p>"It has true sentience?"</p><p>"How did he do it?"</p><p></p><p>The Lords present were completely dumbfounded and somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>This sight was beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>If it had been a random rock, they could have understood.</p><p></p><p>But this was the robe of the Lord of the Northern Realm.</p><p></p><p>This meant that if Qi Yuan wanted to secretly attack the Lord of the Northern Realm, he might be able to do so without the Lord's knowledge, catching him off guard.</p><p></p><p>"See, being handsome has its benefits, doesn't it?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords looked at each other and then at Qi Yuan with a sense of wariness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was about to speak to a female Lord, but she quickly stepped back, avoiding him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's voice was too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>If he were to somehow bring her body hair or magical treasures to life, that would be a serious problem.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all part of the Myriad Transformations Academy, where there were people, there were also conflicts.</p><p></p><p>This was not a harmonious group.</p><p></p><p>"So, if you can find me an Empyrean Realm Fourth Layer cultivator, I'll give you a demonstration of bringing him to life right now." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>As for the Myriad Mysteries Gate, Qi Yuan had not chosen to bring it to life.</p><p></p><p>After all, this "bringing to life" was essentially the creation of a new sentient being.</p><p></p><p>By coming to the Myriad Transformations Academy, his research into these topics was to gain merits and access opportunities to ascend to places like the Cosmic Spiritual Sea.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at Qi Yuan, their expressions varying.</p><p></p><p>They naturally did not believe that Qi Yuan could bring an Empyrean Realm Fourth Layer cultivator to life.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's display had truly shocked them.</p><p></p><p>As Lords, they were already considering how they should fight against Qi Yuan if he became their enemy.</p><p></p><p>First, they would need to close off their five senses, otherwise, they could easily be ambushed by his voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Empyrean Realm Fourth Layer exists in the past and future, and is invisible to us." The Lord of the Northern Realm said, "As for summoning sentience, it is a very complex research topic. Fellow Daoist, it would be better for you to first complete the refinement of the 'Treatise on the Growth of All Things'. If you can finish and perfect it, you will be rewarded with ten great merits."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the task to be so easy.</p><p></p><p>He already understood the significance of the great merits.</p><p></p><p>With his golden jade token, he could go to fourteen different opportunity realms to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It was free, but there were time limits.</p><p></p><p>However, if he spent one great merit, he could go to one of those opportunity realms without any time limit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once he accumulated a hundred great merits, his jade token would be upgraded to purple.</p><p></p><p>With a purple jade token, he could even enter the final three opportunity realms.</p><p></p><p>If he accumulated a thousand great merits, he could even become the Lord of the Myriad Transformations Academy and meet the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>"The refinement of the 'Treatise on the Growth of All Things' will take quite some time. Fellow Daoist can first find a cave dwelling in the Myriad Transformations Mountain to reside in." The Lord of the Northern Realm said.</p><p></p><p>"It's free?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Lord of the Northern Realm replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this includes food and lodging, and even five insurances and one pension... No, wait, I'm a god now, so I should get six insurances and one pension to match my status." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords remained silent, recalling Qi Yuan's self-introduction when they first met him.</p><p></p><p>Socially anxious, doesn't like to talk? Bullshit, he just brought a robe to life, and he doesn't like to talk? </p><p></p><p>They were being fooled.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the guidance of a member of the Myriad Transformations Academy, Qi Yuan arrived at the Myriad Transformations Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations Mountain is the headquarters of the Myriad Transformations Academy. </p><p></p><p>The clouds, mists, flowers, grasses, and trees within the mountain are all of the highest quality, enough to make Empyrean Realm First and Second Layer cultivators fight to the death." The member said proudly, then flatteringly added, "Lord, there are 37,210,000 female and male servants here. Lord can select 10,000 to serve you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked around and immediately sensed the auras of countless Yin Realm cultivators, some of whom were even at the Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh, there were truly Yin Realm cultivators as numerous as dogs.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

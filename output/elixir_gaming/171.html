        <h1>Chapter 171</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now in the Canglan Realm, two suns hang in the sky."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wutian sat in his wheelchair, his gaze profound. </p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the second sun is too small. Otherwise, with the two suns contending, our Canglan Realm might have had a chance to break free from the Great Calamity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless. He looked at Old Man Wutian and said, "You're the one who's small!"</p><p></p><p>He had always disliked being called small.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wutian seemed not to have heard Qi Yuan's words, and instead murmured, "Born in the Canglan Realm, we are too constrained by the Great Calamity."</p><p></p><p>"If we shatter that sun in the sky, wouldn't the Great Calamity be gone?" Qi Yuan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wutian chuckled and said, "The Great Calamity itself is already invincible in this world. Even if all the great masters of this realm joined forces, they would be no match for the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>And... to kill that sun in the sky, one would need to be at least at the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>It's impossible to break through to the Yang Spirit realm without ascending to the upper realm. </p><p></p><p>But once we ascend to the upper realm, we people of the Canglan Realm would be like meat on their plates."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, cultivators at the Yin Spirit realm have the opportunity to ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth are more complete in the upper realm, and the world's origin is also more abundant.</p><p></p><p>To advance to the Yang Spirit realm, one must be in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>It's impossible to advance to the Yang Spirit realm in the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>"This old man has sat idle for countless years, and finally found a way out," said Old Man Wutian as his wheelchair rolled. He stopped in front of a jade slip and picked it up.</p><p></p><p>"What way out?"</p><p></p><p>"We... become fodder for the Great Calamity, marked by that sun, all because our cultivation methods... have problems," Old Man Wutian said heavily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan revealed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had long known there were problems with the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had heard this from a native of the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirits he had met before had never mentioned this, and Qi Yuan had also discovered that the methods they cultivated were all problematic.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed interesting that a Purple Palace cultivator would mention this.</p><p></p><p>"If we create new methods, cultivate to the Yin Spirit realm with them, and ascend to the upper realm, we can... avoid the Great Calamity," Old Man Wutian spoke, his voice hoarse. "But new methods are too difficult, too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly had an idea: "If we use cultivation methods left behind in the Canglan Realm from the upper realm, wouldn't there be no problem cultivating them?"</p><p></p><p>"Not so," said Old Man Wutian. "According to ancient records, that supreme expert back then obtained a method taught by a Yang Spirit in a dream, and cultivated all the way to the Great Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he still... became fodder for that sun.</p><p></p><p>The Great Calamity has even influenced the will of the Heavenly Dao in the Canglan Realm. Even methods obtained from the upper realm will inadvertently turn one into fodder when cultivated."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was inwardly surprised.</p><p></p><p>This Great Calamity sounded truly unsolvable.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, although his "Qi Yuan Scripture" had some minor issues when cultivated, it wouldn't turn him into real fodder.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I have wasted all this time and still haven't been able to create a new method that truly escapes the Great Calamity," Old Man Wutian sighed deeply, his voice infinitely desolate.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of his establishing the Ascension Pavilion was to create new methods to avoid the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then said, "Even if new methods are created, at most only one or two cultivators could avoid the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>If the new methods spread and become known to the Great Calamity and that sun above, wouldn't the Canglan Realm still... sink? So I believe the Great Calamity cannot be avoided, and escaping won't solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>We need to face the difficulty head-on, take the initiative to attack, and resolve the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke passionately.</p><p></p><p>With his increased strength, he had swept through a series of Yuan Dan and Divine Infant cultivators in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Flower Meeting, countless people had constantly flattered him, and he had become somewhat complacent.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he could command the world, and no hero dared disobey.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wutian looked at Qi Yuan and pointed in a direction.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Calamity should be in that direction. It would take three months to reach it. Does Venerable Moon Gazer really want to go see the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately looked in that direction.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his right eyebrow began twitching frantically.</p><p></p><p>A twitching left eye means wealth, a twitching right eye means disaster.</p><p></p><p>If the right eye twitched normally, it could also mean wealth.</p><p></p><p>But it was twitching too violently!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't deceive himself.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, let's leave the Great Calamity alone for now," Qi Yuan decided not to provoke the Great Calamity until he broke through to the Divine Infant realm.</p><p></p><p>"May I make copies of all the methods here?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Once he emptied out the Ascension Pavilion's techniques, he could return to Seven-Colored Peak with peace of mind and play games contentedly.</p><p></p><p>The game icon was almost fully loaded, and he only needed a few days of preparation before he could enter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan now planned to memorize all the methods so that he could continue to deduce the "Qi Yuan Scripture" in his spare time while in the game.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he didn't obtain enough methods to advance the "Qi Yuan Scripture" before entering the game, his strength would increase in the game but his techniques would be lacking, so he wouldn't be able to quickly increase his cultivation in the real world.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Moon Gazer, feel free," Old Man Wutian said, then left pushing his wheelchair.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then immersed himself in the Ascension Pavilion, collecting all the methods.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>On a spirit boat, Kang Fulu had a smug look on his face: "In the Eastern Lands Genius Competition, your senior brother here stood against a crowd of heroes without disgracing the majesty of the Five Light Holy Technique!</p><p></p><p>Several geniuses from major sects stood before me, but I didn't show the slightest fear and defeated them fair and square.</p><p></p><p>Now, I'm also ranked 498th on the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity you didn't participate in the Eastern Lands Genius Competition, otherwise you could have seen your senior brother's heroic bearing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the few extra strands of white hair on Kang Fulu's head, Qi Yuan knew that he had worked hard to achieve this in the Eastern Lands Genius Competition.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Ascension Pavilion, Qi Yuan had briefly instructed the Blood Robe League, announced his seclusion, then changed back to his Qi Yuan identity and returned to the Divine Light Sect with Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, he unexpectedly met Kang Fulu and traveled together with him.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I couldn't enter the top 100 of the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking and bring back the treasure the Sect Master needed.</p><p></p><p>During this time, I've been secretly investigating, trying to find out who took that treasure, but to no avail," Kang Fulu said with a look of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>If Kang Fulu could find out, that would be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you little rascal, you disappear for a while and come back with such a grown daughter?" Kang Fulu looked at Qi Jianjun beside Qi Yuan with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun, who was playing chess with other little girls on the spirit boat, seemed to hear Kang Fulu's voice and turned her head to look.</p><p></p><p>"The past is in the past," Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to explain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the approaching sect gate, Qi Yuan said to Kang Fulu, "Senior Brother, I won't go with you to see the Sect Master. I need to return to my peak."</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and Qi Jianjun ran over.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kang Fulu said, "I understand, I understand."</p><p></p><p>He patted Qi Yuan's shoulder and said earnestly, "Junior Brother, don't blame yourself. There are differences between people. Given more time, Junior Brother will surely be able to enter the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Being able to enter the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking this time was already an exceptional performance.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the sect would surely dazzle the eyes of his master and the Sect Master, right? After all, a true dragon had finally emerged from this poor place like the Great Shang Country.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun held Qi Yuan's hand, her eyes filled with curiosity: "Is this Father's home?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Qi Yuan felt a sense of peace as he returned to Seven-Colored Peak once again.</p><p></p><p>While it was dashing to stir up trouble in the outside world, home was still the harbor for the soul.</p><p></p><p>"It looks quite beautiful, suitable for seclusion," said Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at his daughter. Wasn't she just saying it was remote?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Qi Jianjun landed in front of the brick house.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the wooden cabin next door with a strange expression: "Where's Junior Sister?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Because he sensed a thick frosty aura emanating from Junior Sister's wooden cabin.</p><p></p><p>He walked in, and several talismans immediately burst into flames, forming an array to block Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When cultivating, Junior Sister often used some talismans to guard the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The power exerted by these talismans was close to that of a Divine Infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Shang Country, they were considered top-tier protective talismans.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze swept over, and those top-tier protective talismans shattered instantly.</p><p></p><p>He turned and immediately saw Jiang Lingsu lying on the bed, wearing thin clothes.</p><p></p><p>She was covered with a thin gauze, exposing her snow-white arms and neck, which were covered with a thin layer of frost.</p><p></p><p>She was frowning, seeming to be enduring some pain.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister?" Qi Yuan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>He had always known there was a problem with Junior Sister's body that could only be solved by a Purple Palace cultivator with a water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even after establishing the Blood Robe League and practically dominating the Eastern Lands, he hadn't found a Purple Palace cultivator with a water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grasped Jiang Lingsu's arm.</p><p></p><p>A scorching sensation swept over at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan cultivated with the Five Elements Qi. Although he couldn't eradicate the root cause of Jiang Lingsu's illness, he could alleviate her pain.</p><p></p><p>Heat waves surged in the wooden cabin</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The frost that had covered Jiang Lingshu's body earlier had completely disappeared, and beads of sweat formed on her forehead. She weakly opened her eyes, with a hint of pity in her gaze: "Senior Brother..."</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be thanking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No need to speak." Qi Yuan continued transferring spiritual energy, using this crude method to help Jiang Lingshu expel the cold energy from her body.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingshu kept her eyes open, her slender arm trying to move, as if wanting to grab hold of something.</p><p></p><p>"Don't move around." Qi Yuan grasped Jiang Lingshu's arm, preventing her from moving.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister, this wealthy lady, had helped him so much. He needed to take good care of her to repay her kindness.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do? Tell Senior Brother, and I'll help you." Qi Yuan said responsibly. </p><p></p><p>A rosy blush spread across Jiang Lingshu's snow-white face as she turned her head away, unwilling to look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What was wrong with Junior Sister? "Father, this sister probably wants you to help pull up her clothes," Qi Jianjun said teasingly from the side.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the bed, Jiang Lingshu's skin was faintly visible through the pink gauze. Even lying down, her graceful figure with slender branches and plump fruits was hard to conceal. At this moment, one plump fruit had half escaped, dazzlingly white.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan gently blew, and Jiang Lingshu's clothes immediately moved up to cover it.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Qi Yuan's warm breath, the blush on Jiang Lingshu's face deepened.</p><p></p><p>Who helps pull up clothes like that? But Qi Yuan felt quite pleased with himself, thinking he had shown high emotional intelligence once again.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, men and women should not touch each other casually. He didn't use his hands to avoid touching anything inappropriate, but chose to gently blow instead.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, no need to thank me." Seeing Jiang Lingshu's complexion improving, Qi Yuan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Jiang Lingshu seemed to have recovered quite a bit. Her hand covered her chest, her eyes still carrying that weak beauty of an ill person: "Senior Brother, thank you."</p><p></p><p>"Your condition is getting more and more serious," Qi Yuan said, looking at his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>When he had just dispelled the cold in his junior sister's body, he sensed that the cold that had just appeared had been accumulating for half a month.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, Junior Sister Jiang Lingshu had been enduring pain for half a month.</p><p></p><p>For half a month, she had been lying in bed alone, suffering in pain, with no one to talk to.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan sigh - even wealthy ladies have their own troubles.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm used to it." Jiang Lingshu seemed quite relaxed about it, her expression carefree. "Senior Brother, how did it go with the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings this time?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't disappoint, I made it onto the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Jiang Lingshu's face lit up with joy. "As expected of Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Being able to enter the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings meant truly stepping onto the stage in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Even if Senior Brother went to their Jiang family now, he would receive proper respect from their great clan.</p><p></p><p>If it was the Senior Brother from before, he probably wouldn't even be able to get past the front gate if he tried to visit the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>"Has anything major happened recently in the Divine Light Sect or Great Shang?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"If you mean major events, there are two," Jiang Lingshu said, looking at Qi Yuan with a strange expression. "Two Purple Palace cultivators from the Blood Robe Alliance came to our Divine Light Sect and killed an elder from the Red Sword Gate."</p><p></p><p>At first, Jiang Lingshu had always thought the Blood Robe Sword God was an alternate identity of her Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>But later she realized the Blood Robe Sword God was far too powerful.</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't possibly be the same person.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Blood Robe Alliance established by the Blood Robe Sword God had sent people to the Divine Light Sect. At the time, Senior Brother had sent a message saying two subordinates would be coming, which made her imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of how Senior Brother had just spoken to her so casually and amiably, without any aura of an overwhelming demon lord, and even reacted normally when she occasionally showed a bit of temper, she felt she must have been overthinking things.</p><p></p><p>However, Senior Brother and the Blood Robe Sword God definitely had a deep connection.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Blood Robe Sword God was their master?</p><p></p><p>That would better explain things.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she still harbored some suspicion that Senior Brother might be the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"What's the other major event?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He already knew about the Blood Robe Alliance's affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Internal strife broke out in the Demonic Desire Sect. The Shen family suddenly turned on the Ji family, suppressing them. All the Ji family disciples were slaughtered. Now the Shen family is in charge of the Demonic Desire Sect," Jiang Lingshu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was surprised to hear this.</p><p></p><p>He had been planning to deal with the Ji family of the Demonic Desire Sect when he returned.</p><p></p><p>Now, he didn't need to resolve it - the Demonic Desire Sect's enemies were gone?</p><p></p><p>The world truly is unpredictable, full of unexpected twists.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, who is this..." Jiang Lingshu finally took a careful look at Qi Jianjun, curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, she seemed to have vaguely heard this little girl call Senior Brother "Father".</p><p></p><p>"This is my daughter, Qi Jianjun."</p><p></p><p>"Daughter?" Jiang Lingshu's eyes widened. "Senior Brother, if I remember correctly, you should be less than 20 years old. How do you have such a big daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"I have a game, and this is my daughter from the game," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingshu was bewildered.</p><p></p><p>She recalled that some people in her clan also played game jade slips, calling others brother, sister, or even father and daughter.</p><p></p><p>But that was all... for fun.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Jianjun being so young... what was going on?</p><p></p><p>"Alright Junior Sister, since you're awake now, Senior Brother will be heading back. I need to continue playing my game. I haven't played in so long, I'm itching to get back to it," Qi Yuan said as he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Only a confused Jiang Lingshu remained in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the little girl is an orphan Senior Brother adopted? How pitiful," Jiang Lingshu felt a surge of maternal instinct.</p><p></p><p>She got up, her body a bit stiff from lying down for so long.</p><p></p><p>However, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, this discomfort quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she thought of something and had a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the talismans I placed at the door?"</p><p></p><p>Every time before she went into seclusion to cultivate, she would place some protective talismans around her.</p><p></p><p>Now, the talismans were gone.</p><p></p><p>"How did Senior Brother get past my talismans?" Jiang Lingshu was surprised and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>The thin and sickly villagers trudged back in droves, their faces bearing not insignificant injuries.</p><p></p><p>The village chief Yu Lu was a small old man with a hunched back. His pants were rolled up to his knees, revealing legs as thin as hemp stalks.</p><p></p><p>"We lost the village battle, what a disgrace!" </p><p></p><p>A fat man wailed, looking especially grief-stricken.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Family Village has no honor, they actually worship a new god!" a scholarly-looking man said, expressing disdain for Stone Family Village's worship of a new god.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of new gods, everyone's expressions darkened.</p><p></p><p>For these villages to have good weather and harvests, they had to worship deities.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village's Foxtail Grass God had shown no response for decades.</p><p></p><p>According to the priest Shen Tu, the Foxtail Grass God had probably starved to death.</p><p></p><p>It sounded ridiculous, but it was also normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qingshui Village had always been dirt poor, with nothing to offer the Foxtail Grass God.</p><p></p><p>"Without a deity's blessing, we're no match for Stone Family Village!" a man said.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village's overall strength was actually greater than Stone Family Village's.</p><p></p><p>But Stone Family Village had a new god who could bless the villagers, which made their strength surpass Qingshui Village's by quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>In this battle for water resources, Qingshui Village suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Foxtail Grass God blessed us, we still couldn't beat Stone Family Village. Their new god is too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the new god, fear appeared in the villagers' eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we also worship a new god?" a villager tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Village Chief Yu Lu, who had been silent until now, spoke up. "No matter what, our Qingshui Village cannot worship a new god, absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They all knew why the village chief reacted so strongly.</p><p></p><p>The difference between new gods and old gods was that new gods required human sacrifices!</p><p></p><p>Stone Family Village's new god demanded a child every month.</p><p></p><p>The people of Qingshui Village could never accept such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we are descendants of an ancient clan. How could we worship new gods?" Yu Lu said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing "ancient clan", pride appeared in the villagers' eyes.</p><p></p><p>The ancient clans were known for their unyielding nature.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when Heaven was unjust, the great deities of the ancient clans dared to challenge the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Now, in this chaotic era of new gods, how could they submit to new gods just to survive?</p><p></p><p>"Our ancient clan dared to challenge the gods. Even though we've declined, we shouldn't bend our backs!"</p><p></p><p>"We dared to battle the Heavens and right the wrongs of the world. The ancient clans cannot be disgraced!"</p><p></p><p>"Waaah I'm so hungry, Goudan give me a steamed bun to eat!"</p><p></p><p>"You have pure ancient clan bloodline and you're asking me for a steamed bun? Have you no shame?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the various major sects landed, their expressions varying. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood to the side, already familiar with the leaders of each sect who had come.</p><p></p><p>Since the foundation-building spiritual treasure this time was of the highest grade, the representatives sent by each sect were stronger than in the past. </p><p></p><p>In previous foundation-building assemblies, Yuandan Venerable Masters would not even participate. </p><p></p><p>But this time, there were four of them - two from the Floating Mountain and the Demonic Desire Gate, the Prince of Changshan from the Great Merchant Kingdom, and the Patriarch Bai Chicken from the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>According to the unwritten rules of the cultivation world, apart from the three major sects and the Great Merchant Kingdom, other sects could not dispatch Yuandan Venerable Masters even if they valued the event greatly. </p><p></p><p>However, the arrogant and overbearing Black Mountain Sect had been pushing to become the fourth major sect, so they sent Patriarch Bai Chicken.</p><p></p><p>Behind these powerful figures stood the foundation-building elders and disciples who had reached the Refinement Completion realm from each sect.</p><p></p><p>Many of those Refinement Completion disciples had a sharp gleam in their eyes, obviously hoping to showcase their abilities in this foundation-building assembly. </p><p></p><p>Some weaker sect disciples in the Refinement realm, however, looked anxious, clearly fearing they would not achieve good results.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan, a man with a handsome beard, strode forward in his brocade robes and approached Qi Yuan with a smile: "Where's your sect master? Hasn't he shut himself in seclusion? After the foundation-building assembly is over, let him come have a few drinks with me!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan seemed very carefree. As a Yuandan Venerable Master, his speech was filled with heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>The other Yuandan Venerable Masters present looked at the Prince of Changshan with a hint of awe, for he was the father of the current Empress of the Great Merchant Kingdom, exuding great confidence.</p><p></p><p>"When the assembly is over, the Prince can inquire with our sect elders," Qi Yuan thought anxiously. </p><p></p><p>If the Prince found out that his daughter was involved with the sect master, he didn't know if the master would still be able to drink freely with the Prince, since the sect master was quite a bit older.</p><p></p><p>As the top disciple of the Seven-Color Peak, Qi Yuan, though at the Refinement Completion realm, was only slightly inferior to the Yuandan cultivators, and was representing the Shenguang Sect at the moment, so these Yuandan cultivators were willing to converse with him as equals.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Patriarch Bai Chicken of the Black Mountain Sect spoke up impatiently, "When will the foundation-building assembly start? I still need to go back and take care of my chickens."</p><p></p><p>The other sect elders present all had their expressions change slightly, clearly displeased by Patriarch Bai Chicken's words.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Changshan, however, let out a hearty laugh: "Patriarch Bai Chicken, no need to be in such a hurry. There's still time."</p><p></p><p>Seeing it was the Prince of Changshan speaking, Patriarch Bai Chicken relented and didn't retort further, as he would have done to anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also spoke up, "Please, everyone."</p><p></p><p>The group followed Qi Yuan as he led them deeper into the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The leading elders conversed with each other as they walked, while the others remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a rather flippant voice rang out, "Well, well, if it isn't Jiang Ran. How did you end up escaping to the Shenguang Sect?"</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned towards a cultivator with a rather frivolous expression.</p><p></p><p>In the Shenguang Sect, a young woman, Jiang Ran, turned pale-faced.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had crossed paths with her before. He knew Jiang Ran had a special physique, being viewed as a cauldron by the Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Last time, Jiang Ran had joined Jiang Lingsu in mocking the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the man with the frivolous expression.</p><p></p><p>[He was an ordinary demonic cultivator, his face darkening, as if he was facing a calamity of blood.]</p><p></p><p>The Shenguang Sect disciples also looked at this frivolous-looking man, their expressions furious and gritting their teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Tianxiong!"</p><p>"How dare you come to our Shenguang Sect!"</p><p>"You're truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man was none other than Chu Tianxiong, who had committed a heinous crime in Rongcheng in the past.</p><p></p><p>He had defiled several newly-wed women and killed entire families. Zheng Jianghe led the Golden Light Hall to apprehend Chu Tianxiong.</p><p></p><p>However, an elder from the Black Mountain Sect who had reached the Establishment Foundation realm appeared, injured Zheng Jianghe, and brazenly rescued Chu Tianxiong.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voices of the disciples from the Divine Light Sect, Chu Tianxiong's face was filled with even more mockery: "The way you grit your teeth is exactly like that cultivator named Zheng Jianghe from before."</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Divine Light Sect, upon hearing this, were even more enraged. After all, their senior brother Zheng Jianghe was injured because of Chu Tianxiong.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Chu Tianxiong's crimes had not been met with the proper punishment.</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Divine Light Sect, there were several elderly people kneeling, exposed to the sun and rain - they were the family members of the victimized brides! As for the grooms' entire families, there were no survivors, which was truly tragic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the usually silent Qi Yuan suddenly spoke up: "Fellow Daoist, I have recently cultivated a divination technique. May I divine a fortune for you?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong was taken aback but said, "Fellow disciple, you may proceed with the divination."</p><p></p><p>"I see that the spot between your eyebrows is dark, and you may soon face a bloody calamity," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the entire venue fell silent. Chu Tianxiong's face contorted with anger, and he seemed ready to lash out, but was stopped by the Patriarch Bai Ji.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong heard a transmission and repeatedly said "Thank you," finally concluding with, "My senior brother has noted it!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect did not fear the Divine Light Sect, but they did not dare to provoke the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the commotion, the Establishment Foundation Assembly began. Disciples from various sects who had reached the Qi Refining realm took the stage to compete in a spell battle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found the proceedings quite boring. After all, in the game world, he had surpassed such levels of combat, so he found it rather dull. If it weren't for the large crowd, he would have taken out his game jade slip to play.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear, "Senior brother, it's your turn to go up."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this and slowly walked onto the stage. The Elixir Perfected Ones and Establishment Foundation cultivators in the audience all focused their gaze on Qi Yuan, as he was the senior disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, a figure of great importance.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Desire Gate's Duan Tianjiao greets Senior Brother," said Duan Tianjiao, dressed in black with a curvaceous figure and a mole under her left eye, making her appear particularly alluring.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan of the Divine Light Sect," Qi Yuan introduced himself as well, examining Duan Tianjiao.</p><p></p><p>[She is an ordinary cultivator, but has a small quirk - she likes to pick at her feet. Be careful not to get hit by her feet, or you might catch athlete's foot.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was taken aback. This young lady was beautiful, but also skilled in biochemical attacks. He would need to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Begin!" At the sound of the bell, the battle commenced.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was extremely vigilant, keeping his eyes fixed on Duan Tianjiao's feet.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Duan Tianjiao fly towards him, he casually raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>But before he could even begin to channel his spiritual power, a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>"Pff..." Duan Tianjiao suddenly flew back, coughing up blood.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, your Acupoint Striking Technique is truly formidable. Tianjiao admits defeat!" Duan Tianjiao stood up and conceded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was utterly perplexed: "I didn't even use any force, and you've already fallen?"</p><p></p><p>No, he hadn't even made a move, yet his opponent had already lost. Was there some hidden agenda in this Establishment Foundation Assembly?</p><p></p><p>The elders and Qi Refining disciples from the other sects watching were not surprised. Only a few disciples looked at Qi Yuan with a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

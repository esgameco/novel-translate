        <h1>Chapter 233</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Will we... meet again in the future?" Wu Shi curled up, her suppressed desire bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>Every moment she spent with that man was difficult for her. The urge to devour him was hard to control. </p><p></p><p>She had to restrain her true nature. She didn't dare show it, because... she was too weak.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately... he left.</p><p></p><p>If he had stayed one more day, she didn't know what she might have done.</p><p></p><p>"When we meet again... can I eat him?" The young girl thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What a boring, tedious journey."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze across the vast land and couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had seen the Fasting Saint Mother again, but as a young child.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought he might discover some hidden historical secrets or shocking ancient legends.</p><p></p><p>But it was all so ordinary - just watching a little kid catch and eat fish. Nothing particularly special seemed to happen.</p><p></p><p>He and the Fasting Saint Mother didn't have any deep grudges or entanglements either. </p><p></p><p>It was like watching a movie.</p><p></p><p>"Visualize!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan stopped thinking and directly entered the realm of visualization.</p><p></p><p>This time, his evil god spiritual power was very abundant.</p><p></p><p>This time, he wanted to visualize many people.</p><p></p><p>A group of big shots, all visualized at once.</p><p></p><p>"Of the Six Honored Ones, I've only visualized one so far. The other five need to appear too.</p><p></p><p>Li Tianwang who holds the pagoda, Yang Jian, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, the Fire God Zhurong, the Ancestral Shamans, Yi... even the Three Pure Ones, and even Pangu!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's memory contained many, many deities.</p><p></p><p>Many of the deities Qi Yuan had seen in his previous life on the Blue Star were mistaken records.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the deities he visualized were identical to those in his memory.</p><p></p><p>This actually surprised Qi Yuan quite a bit, and he couldn't explain it.</p><p></p><p>If forced to explain, there were two possible explanations.</p><p></p><p>The first was that these deities really existed, and even if the visualization was inaccurate, it wouldn't affect the deity visualization technique.</p><p></p><p>The second was that the primordial world could create infinite possibilities, and these deities existed because of Qi Yuan's visualization.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the explanation, it didn't affect Qi Yuan's plans.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't be bothered to dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>"Often the things that seem most ridiculous and made up are actually reality.</p><p></p><p>Because reality doesn't follow logic, but making up stories requires logic."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>The first one he wanted to visualize was the King of the Underworld, the Earth Deity who inherited Heaven's ways and emulated profound virtue!</p><p></p><p>He had already planned out Qi Qi's path - first attaining true divinity through the Phoenix, then reaching Great Veneration through Houtu.</p><p></p><p>After all, his goddaughter deserved some good things, didn't she?</p><p></p><p>As for the Thunder Deity, Qi Yuan also planned to visualize the South Pole Longevity Emperor, one of the Six Honored Ones.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation of Thunder of the Nine Heavens was originally an incarnation of the South Pole Longevity Emperor.</p><p></p><p>So he needed to give the Thunder Deity another boost.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also had his own selfish motives.</p><p></p><p>For most of the followers on his mission, he would naturally bestow deity visualization techniques suitable for them.</p><p></p><p>This way he could maximize benefits.</p><p></p><p>But for those he was close and familiar with, he would naturally give a bit more.</p><p></p><p>If a person had no selfish motives, would they still be human? With a mix of selfishness, Qi Yuan began to visualize.</p><p></p><p>"Master of yin and yang, ruler of all things, governing the nine regions, mother of the great earth!"</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's mind appeared that divine woman.</p><p></p><p>She was mythical, seated in the netherworld. In all myths and legends, she had a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>She was even more noble than the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation of Thunder of the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>A deity of this level could perhaps crush a Yang spirit from the heavens back to the underworld with just a wisp of her aura.</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's first time visualizing a deity of this level.</p><p></p><p>"I hope... it's possible."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, countless memories and images rotated.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous visualization, nothing appeared around Qi Yuan's body</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>His silhouette.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Mountain of Visualization also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>A chanting voice that seemed to come from ancient times echoed in the Mountain of Visualization.</p><p></p><p>"Soul, return! My lord, do not descend to this netherworld..."</p><p></p><p>The Mountain of Visualization trembled, and the two questions of the heart no longer appeared.</p><p></p><p>Just like last time.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast female voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "It worked!"</p><p></p><p>If the Five Emperors could... how far could the Three Pure Ones be? At the same time, the girl by the lake suddenly looked towards the distant high mountain, which was the Sky Pillar that Qi Yuan had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>"It's... shaking."</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head, looking at the fish she was holding tightly, her gaze clear.</p><p></p><p>"I promised."</p><p></p><p>She had promised Qi Yuan that if he gave her a fish, she would help him guard the Sky Pillar.</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her pale hand and pressed it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Pillar, which had been trembling just now, suddenly calmed down at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Her little face was pale, her brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Eat fish..."</p><p></p><p>In the realm of visualization.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice flowed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Use the nipple as the eye, the navel as the mouth, wield the battle-axe to dance!"</p><p></p><p>"The spirit pearl descends to the world, positioned to stabilize the primordial..."</p><p></p><p>"With vast supernatural powers... obey orders but not persuasion!"</p><p></p><p>"To the left of the Northern Emperor's throne, commanding all spirits, holding the chart of ten thousand gods!"</p><p></p><p>"The nine stars are the spiritual roots of the nine heavens, the bright beams of the sun and moon, the ancestral source of all things."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Sky Pillar kept shaking.</p><p></p><p>In the mortal realm, all the gods awoke.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what was happening.</p><p></p><p>They looked terrified and confused.</p><p></p><p>This shaking lasted for a full hour.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the Sky Pillar in the mortal realm still stood tall and unshaken.</p><p></p><p>But in the ancestral land of the ancient clan, tower after tower mysteriously disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Yet, who among the gods of this realm would pay attention to the ancestral land? Even if the towers disappeared, those ancient gods wouldn't notice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sharp light appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, he had visualized almost all the powerful deities in his memory, condensing them into the Method of God Visualization.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Methods of God Visualization hung by his side.</p><p></p><p>Each Method of God Visualization had a vast aura, like stars, ancient, profound, mysterious and unknown.</p><p></p><p>If ordinary ancient gods saw this scene, it would definitely dazzle their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, all were myths! And not just ordinary myths!</p><p></p><p>Among them, three were particularly profound, all-encompassing, with stars rotating within them like decorations, life and death, yin and yang entwined around them.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at these three, one could only see three simple points of light.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that anyone who seriously visualized would sense that all the other myth-level visualization methods combined were not as powerful as any of these three.</p><p></p><p>These three Methods of God Visualization represented the Jade Pure Original Heavenly Worthy, the Upper Pure Spiritual Treasure Heavenly Worthy, and the Supreme Pure Moral Heavenly Worthy.</p><p></p><p>The three highest and most supreme deities of Taoism!</p><p></p><p>"The Three Pure Ones... they all came out!" Qi Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The Three Pure Ones and Six Emperors, the Five Directions and Five Elders, the Three Officials and Great Emperors, the Six Departments...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had visualized all the deities in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Visualizing these indeed made Qi Yuan feel somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised Qi Yuan the most was a god he visualized this time... it was a bit too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Even more outrageous than visualizing the Calabash Brothers last time.</p><p></p><p>Because he had visualized... the Gatling Gun Bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>"Do people really worship Him?" Qi Yuan expressed his incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

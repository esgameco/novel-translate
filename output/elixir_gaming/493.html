        <h1>Chapter 493</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred taels?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan's eyes widened, her face filled with disbelief, as well as wild joy and doubt.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu looked at the Taoist priestess, his eyes filled with deep suspicion! An Imperial Soldier Supervisor! This must be an Imperial Soldier Supervisor! And not a low-ranking one at that.</p><p></p><p>This Imperial Soldier Supervisor, suddenly arriving at the Red Moon Stronghold... Could it be that he has come to...</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm deceiving you, that's why the god has died and the god statue has lost its divinity, yet I'm still offering such a high price in silver?" said the woman disguised as a Taoist priestess.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan had a puzzled look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu was also somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess had a flash of memory in the depths of her eyes: "In the past, the Central Plains were unified, the world was at peace, the divine-level craftsman Sheng Nü traveled the rivers and mountains to collect divine treasures, even flying to the outer realms to gather spiritual materials, and finally forged the divine artifact Shen Lin!</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü's saintly heart was like that of a Buddha, and Shen Lin also became the divine artifact that protected the Luosha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Luosha Kingdom ushered in an unprecedented prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Externally, Shen Lin swept away all rivals, internally, the divine Dao of Shen Lin resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this Shen Lin, could it be the legendary Judgment God?" Zhou Hu's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>At first, he hadn't figured out what Shen Lin was, but now, hearing the woman disguised as a Taoist priestess speak this way, he immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>In the Central Plains Luosha Kingdom, there was not just one divine artifact, the gods worshipped by the people were also not just one.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most widely known was the Judgment God.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu had heard the storytellers in the inn and restaurant sing praises of the Judgment God.</p><p></p><p>The people of all walks of life in the inn praised the Judgment God highly.</p><p></p><p>And those songs and stories were also loved by the common people.</p><p></p><p>Stories like "The Oil Peddler Sues the County Magistrate" and "The Courtesan Sword Slays the Third Prince" were widely circulated.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that hundreds of years ago, the people of the Luosha Kingdom lived in prosperity, and could even hold their heads high in the face of the officials.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor made people kneel, but the Judgment God made people stand up.</p><p></p><p>So, the people of the Luosha Kingdom all worshipped the Judgment God.</p><p></p><p>Because the Judgment God represented absolute justice and righteousness.</p><p></p><p>In the Ninghe County City where Zhou Hu was now, it was almost unimaginable for the common people to sue the officials.</p><p></p><p>Suing the officials was like a son killing his father, first going through the pain of nine fires and burning, then kneeling and being whipped twelve times, sitting and being caned twenty times.</p><p></p><p>After going through all these punishments, one could then sue the officials.</p><p></p><p>But in the Central Plains Luosha Kingdom, not only could the common people sue the officials, there were even stories of courtesans killing princes.</p><p></p><p>The story of "The Courtesan Sword Slays the Third Prince" was widely circulated and much talked about.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this courtesan was originally a laundry woman of exquisite beauty, and when the third prince saw her on his outing, he developed lustful thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, the laws of the Luosha Kingdom were strict, and the Judgment God loomed high in the sky, not even the third prince could forcibly take a common man's wife.</p><p></p><p>So he schemed to ruin the laundry woman's family, and the laundry woman was also sold into a brothel, or one could say, raised by the third prince in a different form.</p><p></p><p>One day, the third prince accidentally revealed in his sleep talk that he had framed the laundry woman, and she overheard it.</p><p></p><p>The laundry woman secretly investigated and found that it was indeed the third prince who had ruined her family.</p><p></p><p>In the dead of night, she drew her sword and slew the third prince!</p><p></p><p>This would be a huge event in any country! </p><p></p><p>A mere prostitute slaying the royal bloodline, the sky was about to collapse!</p><p></p><p>According to the storyteller, this courtesan was sent to the execution ground and sentenced to be torn apart by five horses.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, it was snowing in July.</p><p></p><p>And the courtesan's good friend, on the execution ground, actually said that this case had an injustice, and brought out the statue of the Judgment God.</p><p></p><p>The Judgment God, who sees through all things in the world, represents fairness and justice.</p><p></p><p>According to the storyteller, when the divine statue appeared, those officials were so frightened that they were scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Judgment God manifested its divinity.</p><p></p><p>The courtesan avenged her parents by slaying the third prince, and was found innocent.</p><p></p><p>The officials responsible for this case were then severely punished.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan heard this, he would definitely think that this Judgment God is just like an AI, the Luosha Kingdom is an AI-governed country!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, It also has another name, the Judgment God," the woman disguised as a Taoist priestess said, her expression melancholic.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that a hundred years ago, when a great enemy invaded the Luosha Kingdom, the Judgment God perished in the fight against the external foe?" Zhou Hu asked.</p><p></p><p>When he first heard about the Judgment God, Zhou Hu had developed an infinite yearning for it.</p><p></p><p>Even many of the poor and virtuous common people also longed for the Central Plains, seeking the protection of the Judgment God.</p><p></p><p>But those were all events from over a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess' expression turned cold, "The divine artifact was shattered, the god... died, and the statue of the Judgment God also lost its divinity.</p><p></p><p>That year, the royal court ordered that all statues of the Judgment God must be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>For those who privately kept the statues, the light punishment was exile three thousand li, the heavy one... execution."</p><p></p><p>The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess revealed a cold smile on her chilled face: "Without Shen Lin, fifteen years ago, the Great Feng invaded, and the once mighty Luosha Kingdom had to cede territory and pay tribute, how laughable."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu heard this, and his heart grew heavy.</p><p></p><p>He thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the royal court of the Luosha Kingdom, and even all the officials, did not like the Judgment God at all.</p><p></p><p>Only those kneeling commoners loved the Judgment God.</p><p></p><p>"This statue is actually so powerful?" Li Xiaodan, being a young man, focused on a different point.</p><p></p><p>"There are almost no statues of Shen Lin left in the Luosha Kingdom, I have a sister who has always worshipped Shen Lin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this statue of yours, I want to buy it for five hundred taels of silver." The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Li Xiaodan hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred taels of silver was just too much.</p><p></p><p>He looked to Zhou Hu, hoping the elder could give him some advice.</p><p></p><p>The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess sighed softly: "Never mind, since this Shen Lin statue has appeared in your hands, it must be fated with you, I won't buy it."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lin was, after all, a thing of the past.</p><p></p><p>She also needed to persuade her sister to leave the group that still worshipped Shen Lin as soon as possible, otherwise it would be easy to get burned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan's eyes widened, the disappointment in his eyes not hidden.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, the young Li Xiaodan tried to find comfort.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Lin must be so powerful, it will surely protect me!"</p><p></p><p>As for the statue losing its divinity, the young man didn't hear at all.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu looked at Li Xiaodan and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess glanced at the statue one more time, her expression complex, but ultimately did not linger, and chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Hu hurriedly caught up to her: "Senior, are you an Imperial Soldier Supervisor?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess nodded, her expression cold and icy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, why have you come to this Red Cloud Stronghold?" Zhou Hu asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"What's it to you?" The woman disguised as a Taoist priestess gave Zhou Hu a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu immediately felt a great sense of danger.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that this Imperial Soldier Supervisor's strength was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"This humble one is a constable of Ninghe County, there have been some murder cases recently in the Red Cloud Stronghold, suspected to be related to strange spirits, I hope the Senior will be careful..." Zhou Hu hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Careful not to drink the water or eat the food of the Red Cloud Stronghold?" </p><p></p><p>"The Senior knows?" Zhou Hu was surprised, then overjoyed, could it be...</p><p></p><p>"Don't have too much hope in me, I wander the world, slaying strange spirits is for my cultivation, if it's not doable, I won't throw my life away.</p><p></p><p>The strange spirits in this place... are a bit peculiar, my own spiritual artifact may not be able to deal with them."</p><p></p><p>The spiritual artifacts controlled by the Imperial Soldier Supervisors are of two types, one is the ordinary artifacts that only require simple seals to use as long as they are compatible.</p><p></p><p>The other is the personal spiritual artifact. </p><p></p><p>This type of artifact is closely related to the Imperial Soldier Supervisor, and can even grow along with the Supervisor.</p><p></p><p>But for Imperial Soldier Supervisors with personal spiritual artifacts, their advancement is more difficult than ordinary Supervisors, as they not only need to improve themselves, but also their personal spiritual artifact.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu heard this,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu revealed a look of ecstatic joy: "If the senior has any needs, just come to me Zhou Hu, and I will do my utmost to help the senior!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was pitch-black.</p><p></p><p>Two figures, one old and one young, appeared. Qi Yuan clapped his hands, his expression calm: "Wang Kai Xuan, who is this person?"</p><p></p><p>The bent-over Chen Kang stood behind Qi Yuan: "I don't know, but according to what Huang Yan Shou said, he is... someone from the prefecture."</p><p></p><p>During this period, Qi Yuan's strength had increased.</p><p></p><p>Failing to take revenge, what a scoundrel.</p><p></p><p>So, he took Chen Kang with him and, under the cover of night, broke into the Huang residence and arrested Huang Yan Shou.</p><p></p><p>From Huang Yan Shou's mouth, Qi Yuan learned that the one who had framed the son-in-law Qi Yuan was Wang Kai Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"This game can really be like a nested doll." Qi Yuan inwardly mocked.</p><p></p><p>He also had many conjectures in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was simply that Qi Yuan's wife was too beautiful, arousing envy.</p><p></p><p>This Wang Kai Xuan, out of jealousy, sent people to harm him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were other reasons as well.</p><p></p><p>For example, Qi Yuan's parents were artifact masters, and they also had some precious things that aroused Wang Kai Xuan's greed.</p><p></p><p>With these two reasons combined, they acted against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The person is also dead, let's go to... An Shan Inn." Qi Yuan remembered.</p><p></p><p>This time, the son-in-law Qi Yuan came to Ning He County with a servant from the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>He had to go see that servant and have the servant take a letter back.</p><p></p><p>In case, Qi Yuan's wife learned of the situation here, and in a fit of anger, divorced the son-in-law Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan continue to play the role of Shen family's son-in-law?</p><p></p><p>The task would also be impossible to complete.</p><p></p><p>And he also couldn't openly pour water for his mother-in-law to bathe.</p><p></p><p>Before being sent to the asylum, he and the servant had stayed at the An Shan Inn.</p><p></p><p>Although the night was pitch-black, it was not yet deep.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, should we start a fire?" At this time, Chen Kang proposed, "After killing someone, starting a fire would be appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "Don't randomly kill the innocent, and don't destroy property, this is a great sin!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Kang thoughtfully nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't think too much, you should think about formulating a suitable plan to deal with the ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Every time, you have me carry you to go kill, this cannot last forever!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>After all, when facing a powerful ghost, what if Chen Kang couldn't hold on? The current Qi Yuan was still very weak.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang pondered.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a professional ghost exorcist, but in my opinion, when we encounter a ghost approaching, we can first smile, so that the ghost can feel that we have no malice.</p><p></p><p>At this time, we can gently stroke the ghost's head, generally ghosts like to have their heads patted, in this case they won't hurt us, and we can... take the opportunity to kill the ghost!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What if the ghost hurts us?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, this old servant is not professional, so my views may have flaws, which is very normal."</p><p></p><p>"You still carry me." Qi Yuan was also thinking, "You are the chopping board, I am the knife, we just need a chef."</p><p></p><p>In playing the role, Qi Yuan always remembered.</p><p></p><p>After all, successful role-playing has rewards, which made Qi Yuan look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"What chef, to cook for this old servant to eat?" Chen Kang couldn't stop talking about food.</p><p></p><p>"We'll talk about it when we get back to the capital." Qi Yuan already had a plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Now the most urgent task is to first increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>After the strength is improved, then go plan the role-playing in detail.</p><p></p><p>After all, now he may be playing the role of a knife, but with his current physique, he really doesn't look like a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>To continue playing the role would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at the An Shan Inn.</p><p></p><p>The waiter saw Qi Yuan and his expression revealed a trace of surprise: "Qi... Qi Young Master?"</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan seemed to have changed from the one he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Not only his physique and appearance had changed, but the most important thing was the change in his aura.</p><p></p><p>The waiter looked at him a few more times before confirming that this was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And the news that the son-in-law Qi Yuan had been sent to the asylum had only spread in a small circle, so the waiter did not know about it.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Old Zhong? Why is he not here?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Old Zhong was the servant sent by the Shen family to accompany him back to the hometown to worship ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Zhong has left!" The waiter hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Left?"</p><p></p><p>"When Master Huang invited you, Young Master, to go on an outing, that night Zhong left the inn."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "What about my things?"</p><p></p><p>"Your things were all taken away by Zhong!" The waiter hurriedly said, afraid that Qi Yuan would worry that the inn had embezzled his belongings.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, this old Zhong has turned traitor!" Chen Kang quickly said, "Young master was sent to the asylum, but he didn't even come to visit young master or ask if young master was framed, he just ran away!"</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, I would definitely sneak into the asylum at night and rescue the young master!" </p><p></p><p>He leaned close to Qi Yuan's ear and whispered.</p><p></p><p>As if saying that he was the most loyal one.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded, and said to the waiter: "Give me two upstairs rooms."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>After a busy day and even killing someone, he really needed a good sleep.</p><p></p><p>The asylum was too smelly, and Qi Yuan hadn't had a proper bath, where could be more comfortable than the inn?...</p><p></p><p>"Huang Yan Shou... has actually died, who was it?" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu frowned.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qing He had already been transferred, and now Zhou Hu was the acting captain.</p><p></p><p>The death case in the Huang family, with Huang Yan Shou dead, made Zhou Hu feel overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Recently, there have been major events one after another in Ning He County.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Red Cloud Stronghold, just the asylum director and the Huang family's young master.</p><p></p><p>These events occurred in succession, which was really unexpected.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Zhou, who is the murderer?" The old madam of the Huang family, with white hair, had a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>"It should be... an imperial bodyguard." Zhou Hu stated his judgment, "Old Madam Huang, has your son recently offended anyone?"</p><p></p><p>Old Madam Huang heard this, her expression slightly changed, then she calmly said: "No, my son is kind, how could he offend any evil person?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Madam Huang, do you have something you're hiding from me?" Zhou Hu had some suspicions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The asylum director and Huang Yan Shou were both related to that son-in-law Qi Yuan, could it be...</p><p></p><p>"Captain Zhou, we the Huang family will not report this case, my son died of a night illness!" Old Madam Huang said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu heard this and was silent, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Judgment God of the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>If He were here, perhaps the result would not be like this.</p><p></p><p>"Since it is so, I shall take my leave!" Zhou Hu cupped his fists and said.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, an old woman came in crying.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Shi Fan, my son is dead, and you just let the murderer go?" </p><p></p><p>Huang Shi Fan looked at the woman and couldn't help but slap her on the face: "Isn't it you who harmed Yan Shou? I told you long ago that Wang Kai Xuan was not a good person, but you still let Yan Shou get entangled with that Wang Kai Xuan, getting involved in those aristocratic factions, do you really think the Huang family can compare to those imperial bodyguard families?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Shi Fan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The old woman was stunned by the slap, and collapsed on the ground: "My son..."</p><p></p><p>"This matter is not to be mentioned again, the fault was originally with our Huang family." Huang Shi Fan made the decision, planning to let some blood, and send an apology gift to the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>As for Huang Yan Shou's death, they would just say he was killed by his own father's cane.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

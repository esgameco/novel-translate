        <h1>Chapter 464</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe spoke harshly, using the ice egg to "lure" the geniuses of Ghost Domination Heaven, seeking a battle.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when they came, Blood Robe's figure had disappeared without a trace. </p><p></p><p>They searched for a long time but couldn't find him.</p><p></p><p>"We thought he had some skills, but now that we've come, is he just hiding and not coming out?" </p><p></p><p>These geniuses spoke up, shouting everywhere in the Flower Moon Wonderland, wanting to overturn it to find Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>They came aggressively, but stayed in groups of three to five, not daring to separate.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid Blood Robe was lurking in the shadows, waiting for them to be alone to suddenly attack.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, they were all cursing Blood Robe, trying to force him to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Is this all you've got? And you call yourself the second genius of the Black Magic Abyss? You're far inferior to Black Sword."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their angry curses weren't heard by Qi Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>With his absolute adaptation, he was sleeping soundly. </p><p></p><p>The voices cursing him fell on his ears but were "deleted as bad comments" by his absolute adaptation.</p><p></p><p>So right now, he had no idea anyone was cursing him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after waking up, if he carefully sensed things, he would know someone had cursed him.</p><p></p><p>Mo Zhong stood by with a look of dissatisfaction on his face: "When did these guys become so... refined?"</p><p></p><p>He was dissatisfied with these fellow cultivators from Ghost Domination Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Their curses at Blood Robe were too gentle.</p><p></p><p>Saying things like he's a coward or afraid of death didn't really cut to the soul.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Mo Zhong understood that these geniuses were being cautious, not wanting to be the first to die.</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Robe had killed Mo Na.</p><p></p><p>If he was hiding in the shadows, whoever cursed too viciously might be suddenly attacked by Blood Robe and end up dead.</p><p></p><p>So they were all cursing, but not too harshly.</p><p></p><p>This made Mo Zhong dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Xue, you go curse Blood Robe. Be steady but bold. I'll protect you from the side," Mo Zhong said.</p><p></p><p>These geniuses still cared about face.</p><p></p><p>Even if they cursed boldly, they wouldn't be too vicious.</p><p></p><p>At most, they would use sarcastic language that was very easy to provoke people.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Fang Xue held the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, his expression calm. He scanned the surroundings and finally shouted loudly towards the southwest, like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, I f**k your mother!"</p><p></p><p>The sound rolled out, spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>All the geniuses in Flower Moon Wonderland heard this voice like a dust storm at that moment, and involuntarily looked towards Fang Xue.</p><p></p><p>This guy... he really dared to curse!</p><p></p><p>Even Mo Zhong hadn't expected Fang Xue to be so direct and simple.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that they were cultivators. Although killing was commonplace for them, when it came to cursing... they still had to maintain an immortal bearing.</p><p></p><p>Fang Xue's way of cursing was particularly rare.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, it's fine. I'm protecting you. Let's see if Blood Robe can endure this!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Zhong waved his gold-threaded robe, standing majestic as a giant statue next to Fang Xue.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, inside the formation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was originally drowsy, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I just took a nap and lost my mother?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I never had a mother to begin with!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't hit the face when fighting, don't curse the mother when insulting. This is too much!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't been this angry for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He had always been very moral.</p><p></p><p>When others cursed one of his family members, he would return the favor and curse their entire family.</p><p></p><p>Isn't that generous, loyal, and kind enough? But the result was that kindness invites bullying, just as a gentle horse gets ridden.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can't sleep in anymore..."</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the lazy aura around Qi Yuan dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Great plan, small plan, proceed simultaneously!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, after Fang Xue finished cursing, over a dozen geniuses gathered around him, surrounding and protecting him.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, many more geniuses were watching this area.</p><p></p><p>They were sensing their surroundings while remaining wary.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe is indeed a coward. He's been cursed like this and still doesn't dare to come out!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, with so many of us guarding Fang Xue, if he dares to appear, he's just seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Supreme Venerable in his youth probably couldn't defeat us!" one genius said proudly.</p><p></p><p>In their view, although the Supreme Venerable was stronger than them and had gone further, he might not have been able to defeat them in his youth.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe can really keep his cool. He's a tough one!" Mo Zhong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Being able to stay calm is necessary to achieve great things.</p><p></p><p>True geniuses are those who can remain unperturbed even when mountains crumble before them.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he finished speaking, an extremely sharp sword light that pierced people's hearts appeared at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Shrimp-head boy, you don't have a mother?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that your mother is just your biological mother?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't you show some respect?"</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive voices came faster than the sword light.</p><p></p><p>All the geniuses who saw this scene were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, over thirty geniuses rushed madly towards Blood Robe to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going, Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>"Leave the egg behind!"</p><p></p><p>Countless Dao techniques and immortal spells exploded, endless and boundless.</p><p></p><p>The sound of great Dao lingered, and immortal fire fell.</p><p></p><p>With all these attacks launched simultaneously, even Mo Zhong could only turn and run.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan stood still without moving.</p><p></p><p>"Mere pseudo-gods dare to be so arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>Unable to even create worlds, yet calling themselves Yin gods! It was enough to make Qi Yuan laugh his teeth off!</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, his powerful sword light suddenly accelerated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>One could see a cold glint in the clouds of the nine heavens, making all evil retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, to kill a Fang Xue, there was no need to use supreme principles.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary sword thrust forward, and these geniuses couldn't understand this sword strike at all, nor could they resist it.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword easily passed through dozens of geniuses and pierced straight into Fang Xue's throat.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Mo Zhong's face change drastically, and he piled on defenses to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The other prodigies clearly hadn't figured out how Blood Robe had managed to do it.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the aura emanating from Fang Xue suddenly faded, as he was dead beyond dead.</p><p></p><p>All the prodigies attacking Qi Yuan paused for a moment, looking at him with shocked expressions. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, they felt relieved in their hearts, grateful they hadn't cursed as crudely as Fang Xue had.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cheerful voice rang out from the figure in the blood-colored robe:</p><p></p><p>"Kill a man every ten steps, leave no trace for a thousand miles."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I have your eggs in my hands. If you want them... come find me."</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Qi Yuan's form vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>All the prodigies were stunned for a moment, then frantically gave chase.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, after him! He's already at the end of his rope!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop running, you thief!"</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were no different from online gamers on Earth - they might as well have been shouting "He's low HP!"</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan had displayed his divine might, they had been extremely wary and hesitant. </p><p></p><p>But as soon as he disappeared, they chased after him more urgently than anyone.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Blood Robe was truly invincible, he wouldn't need to run away.</p><p></p><p>And killing Fang Xue must have severely wounded Blood Robe, according to their understanding.</p><p></p><p>And so began a sweaty, all-out pursuit. Qi Yuan was actually quite relaxed, but pretended to be in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"It's not fair for all of you to gang up on me!"</p><p></p><p>"Come at me one at a time if you've got the guts!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, I'm out of gas! Want to let me refuel before we continue?"</p><p></p><p>He ran in front, with dozens of prodigies and hundreds of great lords frantically chasing behind.</p><p></p><p>"Leave the eggs behind!"</p><p></p><p>A grand chase scene unfolded within the Flower Moon Wonderland.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was simply treating it like a game.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could have easily slaughtered all these prodigies.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't, because his small plan was paving the way for the grand plan.</p><p></p><p>His target was never these prodigies, but rather... the Yang Gods!</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuanfeng stood outside the celestial curtain, his eyes fixed intently on the Flower Moon Wonderland.</p><p></p><p>"It's been so long, but finally the scent of blood is spreading. Blood Robe has finally made his move."</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know exactly what was happening inside, he could judge based on the auras.</p><p></p><p>For a long time before, there had been no bloody aura inside, only various buzzing sounds.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that Blood Robe had been lying low.</p><p></p><p>This was normal - he didn't think Blood Robe could face dozens of prodigies head-on simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Ambushing after lying low was a wise move.</p><p></p><p>Now, the bloody aura was finally spreading, and he could detect countless intense spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, Blood Robe had made his move, killing one person and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how long it will take for this contest to end," Zi Yuanfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his gaze also looked far into the distance.</p><p></p><p>A Yang God from Ghost Dominion was lurking there.</p><p></p><p>The two maintained a safe distance, with neither showing any intention of making a move.</p><p></p><p>When Yang Gods from both sides were mobilized, it would set off a chain reaction, so Zi Yuanfeng wasn't afraid the other side would send a Principle Yang God to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, Yang Gods from Ghost Barrier would naturally come to his aid.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sudden message transmission arrived, and Zi Yuanfeng's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Ice Sword has emerged from seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>"A revised version of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' has appeared?"</p><p></p><p>"And it actually came from... Blood Robe's hand."</p><p></p><p>With the revised 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' in hand, Zi Yuanfeng examined it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The more he looked, the more he appreciated its profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe is truly a genius. No wonder the ancestors value him so highly. If I had cultivated this Ancestral Blood Scripture earlier, I might have already reached the eleventh level by now!"</p><p></p><p>"This... is marvelous!"</p><p></p><p>"The only flaw is that cultivating it requires... divine molting."</p><p></p><p>It was easy to test whether there were any problems with the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' - just see if their bloodline would resist or obstruct it.</p><p></p><p>If the bloodline didn't obstruct it, it meant this 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' had no issues.</p><p></p><p>The revised version of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' increased both power and cultivation speed by nearly twofold.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be tempted?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not doing anything else right now anyway... why not cultivate it a bit?"</p><p></p><p>"There are so many divine moltings, who would care about me?" Zi Yuanfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, something occurred to him and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The ancestors value Blood Robe so highly - could it be that... they already knew Blood Robe had this 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuanfeng suddenly felt he might have discovered the truth of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the ancestors have already... undergone divine molting?"</p><p></p><p>At this thought, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>If even the ancestors could undergo divine molting, what was wrong with him doing it once?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Zi Yuan Heaven, Ancestor Zi Yuan looked at the technique in his hand, his expression changing repeatedly: "This guy... he had such an excellent technique and didn't offer it to me in advance!"</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe was hiding it from him! He only found out about this benefit from others.</p><p></p><p>When others asked if he knew about this, he had to put on a brave face and say he'd known long ago and had already been cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>At the time, that Yang God Celestial Lord had given him a strange look, which had puzzled Zi Yuan Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the complete technique in hand, he understood why the other had looked at him so oddly.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, with Lin Ya's molting imminent, I must also increase my strength somewhat. Otherwise... I fear it will be difficult to protect Blood Robe as he grows."</p><p></p><p>"Laying an egg... is not such a big deal."</p><p></p><p>After some hesitation, Zi Yuan Ancestor also began cultivating this revised version of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare cultivate normally anymore, as it would trigger the descent of the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>But the improvements from cultivating this revised 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' were not just in realm, but also in bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Bloodline improvements would not give rise to the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. If I were a Supreme Lord, how would Ghost Dominion dare to assassinate Blood Robe?"</p><p></p><p>"How could I have needed to seek help from that old fellow? I would have attacked Ghost Dominion right then!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor sighed, then began his "humiliating" cultivation.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Starting tomorrow, I'll combine two chapters into one long chapter of at least 7,000 words.

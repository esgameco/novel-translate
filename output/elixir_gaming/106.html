        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The teaching lasted for forty-nine days.</p><p></p><p>Wonderful sounds echoed across the eighteen mountains, like celestial music.</p><p></p><p>Mount Jiupan was packed with people. Only thunder rolling could be heard, as spring rain showered upon the earth.</p><p></p><p>The drizzling spring rain fell on people's bodies, filling everyone with joy and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>A human cultivator's eyes blurred with tears: "Since the sun, moon and stars disappeared, we have not heard divine sounds in the mortal world!"</p><p></p><p>A demon prostrated on the ground, wanting to revere Qi Yuan as the most sacred teacher.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat upright on a giant rock, his voice resonant: "The Way of Human Demons, this is... the Demon Trapping Method!"</p><p></p><p>With his final words, the technique called "Demon Trapping Method" entered the hearts of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Demons all over the mountains, as well as human cultivators, were dazed and entranced.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly human prostrated and knelt: "Thank the divine for bestowing this method, saving our kind in times of peril!"</p><p></p><p>The "Demon Trapping Method" primarily helps practitioners build a cage to trap the demonic nature in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This way, no one would suddenly have their inner demon break free when they get agitated.</p><p></p><p>This was of utmost importance for both humans and demons alike.</p><p></p><p>Following the elder's prostration, the rest of the humans and demons, regardless of cultivation level or status, all knelt down and exclaimed in unison: "Thank the divine for bestowing this method, saving our kind in times of difficulty."</p><p></p><p>All over the mountains, demons and humans knelt towards Qi Yuan, creating a spectacular scene.</p><p></p><p>The little golden canary was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was kneeling, should she kneel too? She quickly dismissed the thought.</p><p></p><p>How could she, as his childhood sweetheart, kneel to him alone? If they were to kneel, they should do it together.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her beautiful eyes filled with pride.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood up, looking at the humans and demons all over the mountains, many thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they condensed into one sentence.</p><p></p><p>"The teaching is over, everyone return home."</p><p></p><p>He originally did not intend to teach.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he had gained the utmost insight into the Way of Human Demons, and felt inspired.</p><p></p><p>As he organized his own Way, he couldn't help but recite it.</p><p></p><p>Demons and humans heard and gathered below.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Qi Yuan discovered that teaching... was also a way of organizing the Way of Human Demons.</p><p></p><p>The more he taught, the clearer the Way became; the more he debated, the clearer the principles became.</p><p></p><p>Once he finished organizing... well, everyone should just leave, right? Otherwise, it would be awkward if they kept staring at him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's dismissal, the humans and demons all over the mountains once again performed the disciple's salute and slowly left.</p><p></p><p>In the end, twenty-six people remained.</p><p></p><p>Half were human, half were demons.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan, they all came forward with sincere attitudes: "We are willing to serve the Blood Lord as our master and attend to your needs."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was dressed in a blood-red robe and had attained the Way through blood, so calling him Blood Lord was not excessive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's inner reaction was to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Why would he take on disciples for no reason? However, he glanced at the Gate of Myriad Distinctions in the sky, and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He did indeed need some helpers to assist him in learning more about the Gate of Myriad Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't know when he would come back next time, so having more acquaintances would generally be good.</p><p></p><p>"I don't take disciples, but if you're willing to stay, then stay."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the twenty-seven people present showed disappointment in their eyes, but they were excited to hear they could stay.</p><p></p><p>At this point, none of the twenty-seven chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to serve the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The golden canary stood beside Qi Yuan, her eyes falling on one of the women among the twenty-seven.</p><p></p><p>That woman was the white fox Shang Yanran from Mount Qipan earlier.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the golden canary saw Shang Yanran, she immediately linked arms with Qi Yuan and looked down her nose at the others.</p><p></p><p>She had the full air of a young mistress.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan said: "You twenty-seven, find a place on Mount Jiupan and build yourselves dwellings."</p><p></p><p>"As you command."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their previous personalities or status, all twenty-seven now looked at Qi Yuan with reverent expressions.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had taught and transmitted methods on Mount Jiupan, especially the final "Demon Trapping Method", which could almost be said to change the fate of the entire human and demon races.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-seven people present understood that after today, the teaching and transmission of methods on Mount Jiupan would quickly spread throughout the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>They knew what immense significance this seemingly ordinary teaching session held.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Mount Jiupan would become a true holy land.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord would also become a revered figure for billions of living beings.</p><p></p><p>What kind of opportunity was it for them to stay here?</p><p></p><p>"Mount Jiupan is my territory, I'll take you to find houses!" The golden canary was a very enthusiastic person.</p><p></p><p>Especially since these twenty-seven were now her childhood sweetheart's little followers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary could do whatever she wanted.</p><p></p><p>He would continue to contemplate the Gate of Myriad Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>Other matters could be dealt with later.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary led the twenty-seven people, her spirits high with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord, his name is Blood Pearl, he's my childhood sweetheart!" Without Qi Yuan present, the golden canary's little mouth chattered away.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, the white fox Shang Yanran looked at the golden canary with envy: "The Blood Lord really dotes on Fairy Canary."</p><p></p><p>She recalled how some time ago, the Blood Lord had carried the golden canary, flying over the eighteen mountains, playfully declaring that the golden canary was the number one beauty of the eighteen mountains.</p><p></p><p>For the mysterious and unfathomable Blood Lord to engage in such frivolous and playful behavior showed how much he cherished the golden canary.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Shang Yanran's husband Baize said: "Some time ago, the Blood Lord did say that Fairy Canary was the number one beauty of the eighteen mountains."</p><p></p><p>In their words, they also revealed what had happened on the eighteen mountains before.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of everyone present towards the golden canary changed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>At first, they had thought the golden canary was merely the Blood Lord's attendant, but now it seemed their relationship was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Their looks towards the golden canary also became more ingratiating.</p><p></p><p>Hearing all this, the golden canary's snow-white face inexplicably flushed red.</p><p></p><p>She did know how to feel embarrassed after all.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Twenty years passed in the blink of an eye since Qi Yuan's teaching.</p><p></p><p>Now the "Demon Trapping Method" had begun to spread in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Every day, large numbers of cultivators would come to Mount Jiupan on pilgrimage.</p><p></p><p>Mount Jiupan had now become a holy land in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>People all said that there was a heaven-born saint on Mount Jiupan, called the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord had emerged from chaos, taught on Mount Jiupan for forty-nine days, created the "Demon Trapping Scripture", and temporarily suppressed all inner demons.</p><p></p><p>As long as one cultivated the "Demon Trapping Method", one would no longer suddenly have inner demons arise and demonic nature break out for no reason like before.</p><p></p><p>This act saved the world.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that in the past, among humans and demons, only one in a hundred would survive from birth to adulthood; those who lived from birth to natural death were perhaps one in ten thousand. Once this method came out, the numbers of humans and demons greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Some have said the Blood Lord is like a sage, and those initial twenty-seven followers have also proposed that the Blood Lord should be revered as the Human-Demon Sage!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly rejected this.</p><p></p><p>Saint...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He was not worthy of her.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming a human-demon... he didn't want that even more.</p><p></p><p>One day, Qi Yuan stood at the peak of Mount Jiupan, the place where he had first arrived.</p><p></p><p>By now, Qi Yuan's understanding of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences had grown deeper and deeper.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he could not get any closer to the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, which was several hundred zhang away from him.</p><p></p><p>He feared he would evaporate on the way if he tried to approach it.</p><p></p><p>If he could get close, or even enter it,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's comprehension of the origin would certainly become more and more profound.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood at the peak, wearing a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>Below him were five men and women emanating terrifying auras.</p><p></p><p>These five were among the twenty-seven people who had originally stayed on Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord, the 'Demon Trapping Technique' has already spread to eleven provinces of the Liufeng Realm, with the prospect of spreading throughout the world within a hundred years," said the wooden-faced man, though his face bore a worried expression. "In recent years, the speed of progress has slowed somewhat, and there seems to be someone vaguely trying to prevent the spread of the 'Demon Trapping Technique'."</p><p></p><p>The wooden-faced man was the leader of the twenty-seven, known as the Foolish Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other four all had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>The spread of the 'Demon Trapping Technique' was a great benefit to the Liufeng Realm, yet someone was trying to stop it. They couldn't understand it, how could they not be angry?</p><p></p><p>"Which bastard dares to stop the spread of the 'Demon Trapping Technique'? I'll split him in half with my axe!" The burly giant had a fiery temper.</p><p></p><p>Several times before, the demonic energy in his body had nearly burst out, bringing him to the brink of death.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after cultivating the 'Demon Trapping Technique', this situation no longer occurred.</p><p></p><p>However... his temper had also grown worse.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not discuss this matter," Qi Yuan paid no attention to it, smiling at Baize and Shang Yanran, "How is the investigation into the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences going?"</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, Qi Yuan didn't mind explaining the Way of Human and Demon, as well as the 'Demon Trapping Technique', to these twenty-seven people and those who later followed him.</p><p></p><p>Each time he gave guidance, these people gained many insights and benefited greatly, becoming even more in awe of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan wasn't selflessly dedicating himself. He also had these people collect some useful information for him.</p><p></p><p>Baize and Shang Yanran were the ones investigating the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The white fox Shang Yanran stepped forward: "Blood Lord, the origins of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences seem to be related to ancient deities."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan became interested: "Tell me more."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran continued: "According to legend, in ancient times, there was a great demon in the Liufeng Realm known as Buddha."</p><p></p><p>"Buddha?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>This name couldn't be used carelessly.</p><p></p><p>"According to records, Buddha was an immortal who came to the mortal realm for training. After experiencing the trials of the mortal world, he could return to the realm of immortals and gods.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, Buddha went to Rakshasa City and met a woman who changed his fate.</p><p></p><p>At first sight, he was moved by mortal emotions, seeing that woman as his destined one for life.</p><p></p><p>That woman was the daughter of a demonic powerhouse, under attack by righteous cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Buddha saved her, and because of this, they formed a bond and fell deeply in love." As Shang Yanran spoke, her eyes showed regret. "If you ask me, Buddha shouldn't have saved that demoness, then none of this would have happened!"</p><p></p><p>Baize then said: "What wrong did that woman do? Should she be attacked by righteous cultivators just because she was born into the demonic path?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran glared at her husband. Her husband was Baize, representing good fortune, so it was normal for him to have compassion for all beings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>What Shang Yanran said reminded him of some immortal cultivation TV dramas.</p><p></p><p>"That Buddha, he didn't destroy the whole world for that woman, did he?"</p><p></p><p>"For you, I'm willing to fight against the whole world" seemed to be a common theme.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all," Shang Yanran's face bore a smile. "In the end, between the world's people and that demoness, Buddha chose the world's people. The demoness died."</p><p></p><p>She was clearly satisfied with this outcome.</p><p></p><p>Baize murmured: "How could a weak woman bear such a burden in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"Then what?" Qi Yuan wasn't very interested in the love story of Buddha and the demoness. He wanted to know how this related to the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, Buddha's mind wasn't firm enough. Because of the demoness's death, cracks appeared in his heart during his mortal training.</p><p></p><p>And because he saved the world's people, which led to the demoness's death, rumors spread that he was a hypocrite without feelings, a sanctimonious person who used the pure demoness to achieve his own fame, and that the demoness was just a stepping stone for him.</p><p></p><p>Buddha sat in meditation at the demoness's grave for three hundred days, and finally went mad and fell into the demonic path, becoming a great demon." </p><p></p><p>As Shang Yanran spoke, a cold smile appeared on her face: "People fear power but not virtue. In my opinion, if Buddha had killed all those who slandered him in secret, how could there have been all this trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Baize sighed: "Killing cannot solve problems."</p><p></p><p>"What does this have to do with the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was still about love and destruction of the world.</p><p></p><p>"When Buddha transformed into a demon, the thoughts in his heart became heart demons, which also triggered the heart demon tribulation in the Liufeng Realm. From then on, everyone in the world had demons in their hearts. Wherever there was greed, anger, or delusion, heart demons would emerge." Shang Yanran no longer added her own opinions, but explained directly, "Heart demons are strange and spread in people's hearts. The great realms neighboring the Liufeng Realm all closed their gates to it.</p><p></p><p>The Liufeng Realm had become an isolated realm, but... the endless heart demons finally summoned, or perhaps created, a door - a copy of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences from mythology.</p><p></p><p>In mythology, the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences contains endless heart demons. Even immortals and gods would be lost if they entered.</p><p></p><p>It is said that only by pushing open the true Gate of Ten Thousand Differences can the heart demons be completely dispersed."</p><p></p><p>Pushing open the door and entering it were not contradictory at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Endless heart demons created this copy of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences would taste delicious, all of it being experience points?</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, feeling greedy. He really wanted to go up and take a bite, to taste its flavor.</p><p></p><p>He was very puzzled why there was no Gate of Ten Thousand Differences during the North-South Battle.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that someone had eaten the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences?</p><p></p><p>If so, it would be unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Back?" Qi Yuan looked at the surroundings of Wugui City, the scenes in his mind flashing by.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had comprehended the origin for a full one hundred and twenty years.</p><p></p><p>The greatest gains were the Way of Human and Demon, and the 'Demon Trapping Technique'.</p><p></p><p>"So, the fact that people in this world only manifest demonic energy at the end of their natural lifespan is because of me?" Qi Yuan pondered, "I went back to the past and could change reality, it really... doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Ah, I'm starting to overthink, I can't think about it anymore."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't think further.</p><p></p><p>It was just a game after all.</p><p></p><p>As long as he enjoyed it and left no regrets, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought again of the Canary's neighbor.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when we'll meet again?"</p><p></p><p>"Level 120?"</p><p></p><p>"Or... has she already perished in the passage of time?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that without touching the origin, one can't even glimpse the mysteries of reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"After level 120, I hope to be able to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving this time, Qi Yuan had hinted at this to the Canary.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, she would be able to accept this reality better.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the Five Elements Forbidden Land remained as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>The massive black clouds in the sky were spreading towards the full moon.</p><p></p><p>The one-day deadline had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Long Pang stood up, his voice deep and powerful: "Since we can't wait any longer, let's go first. Perhaps the Master of the Clothing Department will catch up."</p><p></p><p>The rest did not say much in response.</p><p></p><p>Only the person who had previously spoken in an ominous tone muttered, "Never underestimate human cowardice."</p><p></p><p>Zanghua glared at this person, and he shrank his neck.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Green was also among the crowd, her expression cold, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tong looked at Yu: "Before the battle, how about we divine?"</p><p></p><p>The fifty-two people present all turned their gaze towards Yu.</p><p></p><p>Yu was the most skilled in divination, a master of the art.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Yu replied, as frugal with his words as always.</p><p></p><p>As his voice faded, the feathers on his robe began to fall off, drifting into the air.</p><p></p><p>Yu extended his hand, pausing in the air.</p><p></p><p>The feathers danced, and finally, one fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>The others all looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Zanghua spoke bluntly: "What hexagram?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the feather, Yu's expression remained unchanged: "The hexagram of certain death."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the atmosphere among the group became somber.</p><p></p><p>"Still the hexagram of certain death?" An elder's face was filled with obvious disappointment.</p><p></p><p>The aloof Zanghua Immortal Lady said coldly, "Even if it's certain death, we must still shatter the teeth of those demonic forces from the Outer Realms!"</p><p></p><p>The previously ominous-sounding man also had a carefree look in his eyes: "If all efforts are in vain, why not just slay the demons and end this life!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man's bones have rusted from staying in the Forbidden Land, it's time to move around a bit."</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Slaying Assembly is not for the sake of the world, but for our own battle!" said a one-armed strong man in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>His wife had been lured away by the demonic forces from the Outer Realms, and at the time, he had clung tightly to her, unwilling to let go. A divine domain expert had cut off his arm, and he had barely survived.</p><p></p><p>"Why be so despondent? Man can conquer heaven." Tong spoke, looking at the crowd. "Refine the Mysterious Turtle Armor, and in half a day, we shall all go together."</p><p></p><p>In the hands of those present, each held a piece of Mysterious Turtle Armor, a supreme defensive treasure. By refining it, they could help resist the attacks of the demonic forces from the Outer Realms.</p><p></p><p>This refinement would also integrate their individual strengths, forming a formation.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Green silently refined the Mysterious Turtle Armor, recalling the words she had said to the Master of the Clothing Department that day:</p><p></p><p>"If you cannot slay the demonic forces from the Outer Realms, I will never be at peace with you, life after life!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Moon Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>A massive sacrificial altar rose up.</p><p></p><p>The altar was seventy-seven feet high, meticulously constructed over thirty years by the Moon Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the altar, one felt as if they could reach out and pluck the stars from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The altar was also known as the Moon-Chasing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the sky above, the phenomenon of the Celestial Dog devouring the moon was spreading.</p><p></p><p>The entire mortal realm seemed to be sinking into darkness.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of young women were prostrate on the ground, heads bowed in solemn contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Atop the Moon-Chasing Pavilion, twelve newly appointed sacrificial maidens were performing their rituals.</p><p></p><p>The moon was the foundation of the Moon Imperial Dynasty, the deity they revered.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Dog devouring the moon was a calamitous event for the Moon Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a kilometer away, a small figure stood watching the sacrificial altar, her eyes reflecting a complex expression: "Three hundred years."</p><p></p><p>It had been three hundred years since the Gentleman had departed.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years, like flowing water.</p><p></p><p>She looked up, gazing at the distant lake, her eyes filled with a sense of loneliness.</p><p></p><p>A clear voice came from behind her: "Carelessly giving away the Moon Markings, this Celestial Dog devouring the moon, I'm afraid you won't be able to endure it and will be doomed to wander the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was the first Holy Maiden of the Moon Imperial Clan, just like the Moon Lady.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Lady stood in place, the moon in her eyes reduced to a crescent.</p><p></p><p>To the words spoken, she remained silent, her silence a response.</p><p></p><p>If it hadn't been for the Gentleman back then, she might have died at the hands of the Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p></p><p>How could she have waited for the Celestial Dog to devour the moon.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she was merely a sacrificial pawn.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Moon Lady's silence, the clear voice suddenly sighed, "I, even the Moon Sovereign... how can we not be doomed?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Earthly Abyss, Qi Yuan's injuries had reached their limit.</p><p></p><p>He sat half-upright on the ground, leaning against the great door, still blocking it, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>In these past days, he had slaughtered all the demonic forces from the Outer Realms within the Earthly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Those demonic forces, wanting to return to their proper resting place, sorry, Qi Yuan had sent them off.</p><p></p><p>Now the Earthly Abyss was empty, all the demonic forces from the Outer Realms had been slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He sat there, unable to move, his injuries too severe, his blood still dripping slowly.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Earthly Abyss, only the sound of Qi Yuan's panting and the dripping of blood could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Truly the one I have chosen." Suddenly, a cold, mechanical voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The previously fallen Golden Armor Man, somehow appeared before Qi Yuan, his massive form approaching, the sound of armor clashing echoing.</p><p></p><p>Different from what Qi Yuan had seen before, his eyes were now white, instilling a sense of chill.</p><p></p><p>Sitting there, Qi Yuan had a resigned expression: "I knew the plot wasn't over yet. Look, the true mastermind has finally shown up, unable to contain his impatience."</p><p></p><p>"You're not surprised?" The Golden Armor Man, the former Celestial Eye, had a trace of astonishment in his white eyes, "But it doesn't matter now."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Golden Armor Man, covered in blood, Qi Yuan said, "The mighty mastermind, hiding in the body of my late father-in-law, what kind of skill is that? Show your true form, I'm itching to defeat another boss."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white eyes of the Golden Armor Man held no emotion, but his tone was full of awe: "I had thought I could only eke out a miserable existence for the rest of my days.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, in the Five Elements Forbidden Land, I found you.</p><p></p><p>What a magnificent body, what a terrifying talent.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months, you've broken through from the early Divine Realm to the peak of the Divine Realm here.</p><p></p><p>Such a body should not be allowed to roam freely, it is a blessing bestowed upon me by the heavens."</p><p></p><p>His voice was utterly greedy, like that of a starving ancient demon.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Heavenly Treasure Sword, Qi Yuan listened to the Golden Armor Man's avaricious words: "Looks like the old man assassin has decided to target me."</p><p></p><p>He spoke, gripping the sword and aiming it at the Golden Armor Man.</p><p></p><p>Shing!</p><p></p><p>A flash of sword light, and the Golden Armor Man's massive form shattered, breaking into seven or eight pieces.</p><p></p><p>The voice filled with greed echoed in the air: "Useless, you've only killed a puppet, you can't hurt me.</p><p></p><p>And you're just a Divine Realm cultivator, not even at the true peak of the Divine Realm, you haven't even touched the Source.</p><p></p><p>Resistance is futile, obediently, I will inherit your memories, inherit your body, and walk out of the Earthly Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Old Bi Deng, you've gone mad cultivating the Daydream Technique, still wanting to possess me?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The voice filled with greed paused for a moment, then continued: "So that wretched woman told you, haha, but what of it? Your body has long been in my sights.</p><p></p><p>Do you remember the divine reflections of the Five Elements Forbidden Land and the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land? I merely used a few simple techniques to influence their decisions.</p><p></p><p>The divine reflections of the fifty-three Divine Realm cultivators all bear my mark.</p><p></p><p>Now your mind, your thoughts, are all mine!</p><p></p><p>My thoughts will spread in your mind, will constantly expand, occupy your consciousness, and devour your body."</p><p></p><p>This was his scheme.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had only wanted to push forward the Demon Slaying Assembly, to devour those Divine Realm cultivators and supplement his nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had encountered Qi Yuan, a peerless genius, in this world.</p><p></p><p>This was the heavens' blessing upon him.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his voice gradually began to resonate in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was unperturbed: "Big Day, to be honest, you're an easier boss to deal with than the demonic forces from the Outer Realms."</p><p></p><p>In the core of the Five Elements Forbidden Land, the Abyss of the Five Elements, Qi Yuan had seen the Flowing Sands of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>He had also seen the Great Day Flower.</p><p></p><p>Touching the Great Day Flower, he had seen some remnant memories of Big Day.</p><p></p><p>He heard Big Day cursing the demonic forces from the Outer Realms.</p><p></p><p>He heard Big Day's agonized howls, like a stray dog.</p><p></p><p>At first, Qi Yuan had thought of Big Day as a Celestial, believing he had been defeated in a great battle with the demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>But when he encountered the demonic forces, Qi Yuan had already fully confirmed that the "demonic forces" Big Day spoke of were not those old fellows.</p><p></p><p>But someone else.</p><p></p><p>The July Sacrificial Maiden had once told him that the Wangyue Continent was once called the Baiyi Continent.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan had already had a suspicion.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Abyss's Ascension Platform, and the remnant shadow of the 119th-level Golden Armor Celestial General under Big Day.</p><p></p><p>All of this had been connected by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Big Day had once been the overlord of this world, defeated by an external enemy.</p><p></p><p>He had eked out an existence, inviting the demonic forces from the Outer Realms to wreak havoc in this world.</p><p></p><p>And now, he had set his sights on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Those old fellows can still hurt me, but you... can't." Qi Yuan's eyes were filled with disdain, "A mere NPC limiter in this world, how dare you try to possess me?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The level 99 final boss was really too cowardly, lacking the domineering aura of ruling the world for eternity. On TV, he could only be a third-rate villain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words seemed to have stepped on the big sun's tail, making his voice a bit broken.</p><p></p><p>"You can only boast with your words! The countless memories of the Shen Ying have already influenced you. </p><p></p><p>Soon, I will replace you and become you."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Qi Yuan sneered, "When I was watching the cartoon 'Rainbow Cat and Blue Rabbit', you were probably still playing in the mud.</p><p></p><p>Do you know how many games I've played? How many TV shows and animations I've watched? These things want to influence my mind? </p><p></p><p>Playing a game, reading an NPC's character outline, can influence my consciousness and let the game character replace my brain? You're really funny, I think you've played too many games and the seawater has entered your brain."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan's words were a bit exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Those people's memories did influence him.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the countless hanging corpses under the ancient oak tree, he fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon let it go.</p><p></p><p>He was just playing a game after all. Why be so invested and immersed in it?</p><p></p><p>Every time he logged off, he would clear his cache.</p><p></p><p>"Saying so much boring nonsense, can it change the ending? You don't know... the gap between you and me! You haven't even stepped into the divine realm, how can you be my enemy?"</p><p></p><p>The big sun's voice was vast and mighty.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of his power, he was the true overlord of the White Sun Continent.</p><p></p><p>A single word from him could define the rules of the world.</p><p></p><p>He established an arena in the heavens, inviting countless talented cultivators to fight, and inviting cultivators from all realms to watch.</p><p></p><p>The victorious talent would become a part of him.</p><p></p><p>With the cultivation of the White Sun Fantasy Technique, he had ambitions, but also a gloomy mind.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that someone would secretly break through the divine realm, so he set a rule.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's view, that rule was that the people of this world could not break through level 99 to reach level 100.</p><p></p><p>Because after reaching level 100, they might be able to contact the origin, and there would be things that the big sun could not control.</p><p></p><p>"Now you can only become my puppet, only my flesh, to fulfill me!"</p><p></p><p>The big sun roared madly.</p><p></p><p>Powerful spiritual power washed over Qi Yuan's mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This huge spiritual power was stronger than anything Qi Yuan had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Even the combined memories of the fifty-two divine realm experts were not a match for it.</p><p></p><p>Endless information spread, and the big sun began to possess him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was covered in blood, sitting on the ground, holding a sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a massive attack, he curved his lips into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Big Sun, you are indeed a qualified old grandpa."</p><p></p><p>"You ask me how to stop you?"</p><p></p><p>"I, having established the Heavenly Dao, how can you stop me?"</p><p></p><p>"You want to possess me?"</p><p></p><p>"Wrong, I will swallow you!"</p><p></p><p>The big sun was just the strongest in this world, after all.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, when facing the demonic beasts from the outer realms, had been injured and killed.</p><p></p><p>In the desperate battles, he had also gained some insights into the truth of death.</p><p></p><p>The fragments of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Dao had also fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>After slaughtering all the demonic beasts from the outer realms, he also obtained the fragments of the Earthly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan had obtained all the fragments of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The big sun had only seen Qi Yuan as a rare genius, thinking that Qi Yuan's progress was rapid and he could break through in battle.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that Qi Yuan could gain experience and improve himself every time he slew a small monster.</p><p></p><p>He also could not imagine that Qi Yuan could obtain the fragments of the Heavenly Dao by clearing the forbidden lands.</p><p></p><p>That was the Dao of an entire world. Even the big sun did not dare to have any coveting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Qi Yuan's eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>The scenes in his mind kept flipping.</p><p></p><p>A grand sun shone on the earth.</p><p></p><p>The vast world, everything revived.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness hung in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He was like a satellite, or the eye of the continent, watching this world.</p><p></p><p>He saw the demonic tribes crawling out of the azure sea, the human tribes stumbling out of the mountains.</p><p></p><p>He saw the tribes fighting for hegemony, the demonic tribes constantly entangled, tearing the mountains apart.</p><p></p><p>He saw the human tribal leaders, riding the iron-eating beasts, being beheaded by a single sword. He saw the monstrous beasts devouring, the supreme giant beasts twisting their bodies, causing the land to dry up for thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>He saw flowers blooming and withering, saw icebergs melting, saw celestial maidens bathing, saw monkeys urinating.</p><p></p><p>He also saw a stone absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, finally exploding and becoming a humanoid being.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid being, innately sacred, with words becoming reality, was the darling of the world.</p><p></p><p>He went to the river to drink water, and a thousand-year immortal fruit floated over.</p><p></p><p>He slept on the ground, and next to him fell a suit of armor.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated, far surpassing ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>He was like the darling of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In just a few thousand years, the humanoid beings became the overlords of this world, slaughtering the great demons and human emperors.</p><p></p><p>Endless memories spread.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw the humanoid beings slaughtering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In his vision, it was almost always the towering figures of the humanoid beings.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit fascinated, feeling that he was somewhat immersed in it, fantasizing that he was that humanoid being, stirring up endless bloodshed in the world.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan cursed, "Seduce women? Even rape? He's not as good as Luo Binghe!"</p><p></p><p>"Watched too much Luo Binghe, this bastard is too good at acting, I need to change the flavor."</p><p></p><p>He no longer focused on that humanoid being.</p><p></p><p>He watched mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarreling, watched ants moving grains of rice, watched the hermaphroditic creatures mating.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the entirety of this world.</p><p></p><p>He had the fragments of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>His vision was no longer limited to the humanoid beings.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his mind would be filled with the life of the humanoid beings.</p><p></p><p>Not from a third-person perspective, but from the protagonist's perspective.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after experiencing endless years of transformation, he became the big sun.</p><p></p><p>This was also the big sun's plan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the big sun had no idea that Qi Yuan had already collected all the fragments of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Now he was the Heavenly Dao itself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had seen the whole world, just like a player looking at the background and introduction of a world.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he was immersed, sometimes he mocked the bugs.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long it had been.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid being that Qi Yuan had forgotten suddenly let out a faint roar.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Why, you don't look at me!"</p><p></p><p>"I am your everything!"</p><p></p><p>"I am you!"</p><p></p><p>It was like a water-filled balloon being punctured by a needle.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid being shattered, becoming a fragment in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know this, he was still roaming this world.</p><p></p><p>This world was too big, there were still many things to see.</p><p></p><p>In the Earthly Dao, Qi Yuan's eyes were tightly closed, his hand still gripping the sword, sitting on the steps.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Earthly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light as bright as the sun flashed.</p><p></p><p>The entire Earthly Dao was filled with white light.</p><p></p><p>A huge roar came.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you!"</p><p></p><p>"I... will kill you!"</p><p></p><p>The possessed soul dissipated, and in the Earthly Dao, a huge stone appeared.</p><p></p><p>This stone was burning with white flames.</p><p></p><p>The white radiance filled the entire Earthly Dao.</p><p></p><p>That was the only remaining body of the big sun.</p><p></p><p>The huge stone emanated an aura far surpassing the divine realm, as if even the space was trembling.</p><p></p><p>It let out a loud roar, and the entire Earthly Dao echoed with the words "Who are you".</p><p></p><p>"Rebellious son, I am your father!" At this moment, Qi Yuan, who had closed his eyes, suddenly opened them.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the huge stone and said disdainfully, "I take back what I said just now, I don't have such an ugly son."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had obtained the complete Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>This big sun could also be considered his son.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan really didn't want to acknowledge him.</p><p></p><p>It was too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"You should die!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how you extinguished my remnant consciousness!"</p><p></p><p>"But in this world, you who cannot break through the divine realm, can only die!"</p><p></p><p>"It's all your fault, all your fault, why don't you obediently accept death!"</p><p></p><p>"You're forcing me!"</p><p></p><p>The big sun was ferocious, agonized, and roaring.</p><p></p><p>Unable to possess, he could only cling to life.</p><p></p><p>Now, although he was severely injured and on the verge of death, and his strength could not be fully exerted, he was still the strongest in this world.</p><p></p><p>So, without real danger, his main body dared to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The dazzling white light spread towards Qi Yuan, this was a power comparable to the origin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan murmured, "I suddenly feel the outer realm demons were right, I should be filial."</p><p></p><p>However, when facing the big sun's strongest attack.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's lips curved into a smile again.</p><p></p><p>He silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Level up.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

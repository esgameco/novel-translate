        <h1>Chapter 131</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years later, when the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons opens, I don't know if we'll be able to hold out until then." At this moment, He Wu's eyes held a trace of reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"With the soul artifact left by Master, what does the Lord have to fear?" Ling Yayi, also known as Nangong Dagou, was somewhat flippant as usual.</p><p></p><p>"But... the Lord has ten thousand supreme beings from the Demon Realm under his command." He Wu swallowed as he said this.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand supreme beings - just hearing this number sounded terrifying. </p><p></p><p>The entire Wind Realm didn't even have that many supreme beings combined.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the North's strength still surpassed the South's.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't be able to hold out here for long.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Yayi's expression also became solemn: "Twenty years later, Master will come here. I don't know... Sigh, although I want to see Master, I still hope he doesn't come in."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord was powerful, born divine and holy.</p><p></p><p>Given enough time, Master might be able to surpass the Lord who possessed the Fate Tablet.</p><p></p><p>However, that Lord fought without honor, colluding with the Demon Realm, gaining nearly ten thousand additional supreme beings under his command.</p><p></p><p>How could they fight against that? With ten thousand supreme beings attacking together, even the White Emperor would perish! Their Master was strong, but not that strong.</p><p></p><p>Although Master's innate divine ability could be called a supreme being killer.</p><p></p><p>When the divine ability was unleashed, the supreme beings of the Wind Realm would have their heart demons break out, completely unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>But those tens of thousands of supreme beings came from the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Master's innate divine ability couldn't instantly kill them.</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master of the Heavenly Heart Palace, do you hope Master comes in?" Ling Yayi looked at Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>If there was anyone in this world Master cared about, it would be Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi no longer muttered about Master remembering his name.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did remember, it would be Ling Yayi, not Nangong Dagou.</p><p></p><p>He Wu also looked at Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao gripped a blood-colored long sword, her gaze empty: "I both hope and don't hope."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary might hope, but she didn't.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, deep within the fortress.</p><p></p><p>White Marsh sat motionless in the depths underground, his body like crystal, pure and flawless.</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes from the Mirror of Ten Thousand Demons flashed through his mind. A pained expression flickered in his eyes as a wisp of black energy silently rose up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heartless Lotus emitted a faint glow, dispersing the strands of black energy appearing on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>A hint of clarity returned to White Marsh's eyes: "Don't think about this anymore. The urgent matter at hand... is to first resolve the crisis of the Demon Realm and Shang Yanran."</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time passed, a great supreme being entered: "White Emperor, in recent days, the Lord's offensive has weakened somewhat. He surrounds us without attacking. We don't know what this means."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the great supreme being's face was full of worry, unsure if this was good news or bad.</p><p></p><p>Being surrounded without attack meant they had no worries in the short term, with no one having to go out to fight and risk injury or death.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Lord launched an all-out attack, it would be a fierce strike. Afraid that none of them here could withstand it, the Wind Realm would be in danger.</p><p></p><p>White Marsh's gaze shifted, finally saying helplessly: "Is she... waiting for Master?"</p><p></p><p>Twenty years later, the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons would open.</p><p></p><p>Master would certainly enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Yanran... killing cannot resolve demonic afflictions." White Marsh sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>After Buddha became a demon, though the Great Demon was sealed in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons,</p><p></p><p>Demonic afflictions multiplied in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>As demonic afflictions grew more and more numerous, this world would descend into complete madness.</p><p></p><p>When it reached a certain quantity, all living beings in the Wind Realm would have no path to survival.</p><p></p><p>In his view, Shang Yanran going to the North and initiating the battle between North and South was an attempt to eliminate the world's demonic afflictions through killing.</p><p></p><p>He didn't support it, but also couldn't stop it.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that killing could not resolve demonic afflictions.</p><p></p><p>There must be a better solution.</p><p></p><p>"Master... it's best if you don't enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, in the Palace of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran wore a plain white robe, her eyes narrowed in an ambiguous smile.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings in the palace were terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Please punish me, Lord. It was my fault for failing to guard the Mirror of Ten Thousand Demons, allowing the White Emperor to steal it!" Purple Eyes, a great supreme being, was now kneeling on the ground without any dignity, his back trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror of Ten Thousand Demons was one of Shang Yanran's treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Shang Yanran laughed, making Purple Eyes even more afraid. "What crime have you committed? If I hadn't deliberately let him obtain the Mirror of Ten Thousand Demons, how could he have gotten it?"</p><p></p><p>Purple Eyes was stunned, still keeping his head lowered, not daring to say anything.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran waved her hand in annoyance. Only then did Purple Eyes hurriedly stand up and leave with a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, only Shang Yanran remained.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes held an ambiguous smile, as if she might cry.</p><p></p><p>She murmured to herself, looking quite melancholy: "Husband, in the illusion, it was clearly our lifetime together."</p><p></p><p>Her melancholy turned to madness.</p><p></p><p>"Why, when I accompanied you in killing, accompanied you in death, in the end... you woke up wanting to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"Why... you're not even willing to let me see your treasures."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, was it you enlightening me, or me... obtaining you."</p><p></p><p>A glint of greed flashed in the depths of Shang Yanran's eyes.</p><p></p><p>White Marsh was truly the Buddha, truly the Great Demon! While she... was just a demon woman, and demon woman was just one of her identities.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Qi Yuan stepped into the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, the illusion he fell into was the Great Demon's many lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Qi Yuan played the role.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, the golden canary was in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>In the past, she accompanied the Great Demon through many lifetimes of wreaking havoc on the world. When the Great Demon awoke one day, he wanted to execute her.</p><p></p><p>Her schemes had come to nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sun Radiant Bodhisattva!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Sun Golden Lotus!"</p><p></p><p>The greed in Shang Yanran's eyes grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus was the relic left behind when the Great Sun Radiant Buddha entered nirvana.</p><p></p><p>If she obtained the Great Sun Golden Lotus, her true form would be molded into an immaculate golden body of glazed tile.</p><p></p><p>This golden body would be indestructible to gods and indestructible to vajras.</p><p></p><p>Once she succeeded in cultivating it, she could swallow the dragon like a python swallows a sparrow. The Wind Realm she had schemed for for years would truly be devoured by her, thoroughly becoming her playground.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of this world, you should... give me the Great Sun Golden Lotus!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat motionless.</p><p></p><p>The broken sword in his hand continuously reaped demonic afflictions.</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed a helpless expression: "It's easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but hard to go from extravagant to frugal. Now it's all... what crappy demonic afflictions?"</p><p></p><p>Now, the demonic afflictions on the conveyor belt didn't even include supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>There were only terrestrial mythical beings, with some nation-guarding level demonic afflictions mixed in.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan, who was used to eating and drinking well, feel somewhat uncomfortable for a time.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his complaints, Qi Yuan's hand trembled, and an ancient stone tablet fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>This stone tablet was a fragment of the Fate Tablet, also known as the Deception Tablet.</p><p></p><p>[Fragment of the Fate Tablet, its spirit has perished, buried in Buddha's hand.]</p><p></p><p>Every day Qi Yuan would take out the Fate Tablet to look at it, to see if he could get any useful information.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the information he received today surprised him somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Fate Tablet have a spirit?" Qi Yuan pondered, "Where is it now?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have much entanglement with the Fate Tablet.</p><p></p><p>But they had crossed paths a few times.</p><p></p><p>"Is it you... stirring up trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>There were still twenty years until the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons opened.</p><p></p><p>Guarding the City of No Return, almost nothing could go wrong.</p><p></p><p>Twenty years converted to the Azure Waves Realm was just two days, so he could also go offline once.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before going offline, things needed to be handled properly.</p><p></p><p>"In these twenty years, I need to work hard to develop and create more supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>After all, the enemy has ten thousand supreme beings. The Blood Palace only has thirty thousand supreme beings. I don't feel at ease." Qi Yuan didn't feel secure.</p><p></p><p>It was like being oppressed by the powerful Palace of Light when he was in the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>He trembled in fear, unable to sleep at night.</p><p></p><p>He needed to create more supreme beings to feel more secure.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I've taken care of the matters you instructed!" Chen Huan came in, his face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>This time after Qi Yuan returned from the White Emperor's Palace, he officially became the number one overlord of the Wind Realm, the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>This time, following Qi Yuan's instructions, Chen Huan issued a blood edict! Announcing to the world that demons from the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons had invaded. Any terrestrial mythical being could come to the City of No Return to hear the Blood Lord preach, ascend to supreme being status, protect the Wind Realm, and fight in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons!</p><p></p><p>"How many people do you think will come to my Blood Palace?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Probably at least fifty or sixty thousand?" Chen Huan guessed conservatively.</p><p></p><p>The number of terrestrial mythical beings in the Wind Realm was actually very, very high.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be ridiculously high.</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem like a world like the Wind Realm could have so many.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty or sixty thousand, barely enough to gather an army of one hundred thousand." Qi Yuan muttered, "I hope I don't make a fool of myself like the Great Ming War God."</p><p></p><p>If that happened, he would be utterly disgraced.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan say things he didn't understand, Chen Huan wore a silly smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ten million supreme beings? </p><p></p><p>He never dared to imagine! What kind of scene would that be!</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, when we march on the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, make me a grand marshal. Your little brother also wants to leave his name in history!"</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>These were all small matters.</p><p></p><p>It's normal for people to have some vanity.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's face was excited: "We must win this battle and keep the demon realm outside the gate!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan suddenly tensed up: "This is bad!"</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, what's wrong?" Chen Huan also became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, when I was lecturing recently, wasn't there a supreme being called Wang Zhen?"</p><p></p><p>"I think so... Big brother, what's wrong? Is there some problem with him?" Chen Huan quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Don't let him go on this battle," Qi Yuan said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"...Is he a spy?" A murderous glint flashed in Chen Huan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No, his name is inauspicious," Qi Yuan said. "If Wang Zhen is there, wouldn't I really become the God of War of the Ming Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan: "..."</p><p></p><p>He was already trying very hard, but why couldn't he keep up with his big brother's train of thought? Meanwhile, Qi Yuan felt brilliant and wise about his own decision.</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, the Ming Dynasty's God of War Zhu Qizhen, at the urging of the eunuch Wang Zhen who was in charge of ceremonies, led an army of 200,000 to battle personally. As a result, he was defeated by an army of 30,000 and Emperor Zhu Qizhen was captured alive. This was known as the Tumu Crisis in history.</p><p></p><p>How similar was his current attack on the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to this?</p><p></p><p>"We won't let anyone named Wang Zhen go with our army!" Chen Huan said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Chen Huan approvingly: "You understand me best."</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan immediately broke into a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>Now he no longer wanted to call Qi Yuan his adoptive father, it was better to call him big brother.</p><p></p><p>After all, among those who had joined the Blood Palace now, no one dared to call Qi Yuan big brother - they all wanted to call him adoptive father or godfather. </p><p></p><p>Even Elder Bai He, whom Chen Huan used to look up to, was now a generation below him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm logging off now, I have to go do something important. Remember to recruit more land-based mythical beings!" Qi Yuan's expression became solemn again.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that this game was about to be completed as well.</p><p></p><p>He would soon face the terrifying Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>He needed to persevere and continue with his plans. Only this way could he barely stand a chance against the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that he couldn't bring the people from the Flowing Wind Realm out. Otherwise, he could have brought his thousand-person suona orchestra and blocked the entrance to the Palace of Light, playing suona for them every day until they left!</p><p></p><p>Holding Little Jia, Qi Yuan found a place, dug a big hole, and jumped in with her.</p><p></p><p>When the scene changed, Qi Yuan returned to his familiar wooden cabin.</p><p></p><p>Countless memories and images flooded his mind like mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a headache.</p><p></p><p>"Forget!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately used his innate divine ability, the Great Forgetting Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Those memories finally settled down, and he felt his headache improve significantly.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Forgetting Sutra is really amazing. If I went back to the Blue Star, I'd definitely be the best doctor in the world, earning millions a month, marrying a rich beautiful wife, and reaching the peak of life."</p><p></p><p>Using it on Alzheimer's patients would make them forget they have dementia, and they'd become normal as a result.</p><p></p><p>This was simply a divine tool for treating illnesses.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, the innate divine ability I comprehended is still here."</p><p></p><p>"That soul artifact..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted, he could also summon that blood-colored long sword inscribed with the Heart Demon Summoning of the Void Realm Overlord.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, the people at the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons still needed that sword to face the enemy, so he naturally wouldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting the events in the game, Qi Yuan began to seriously plan for the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"In the game, I learned one trick - to post online and smear the Palace of Light!" Back then, Purple Sky Mysterious Woman had been constantly smearing him, calling him a great demon. After he killed Purple Sky Mysterious Woman and absorbed her essence, he learned how to smear others.</p><p></p><p>"I need to post in the Divine Flower Society forums to curse them, but I don't have any alternate accounts." Qi Yuan was very cautious.</p><p></p><p>You can't curse people using your main account. If he was discovered, he'd be finished.</p><p></p><p>Alternate accounts? </p><p></p><p>He didn't have any!</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, help!" Qi Yuan shouted as he ran out of the wooden cabin.</p><p></p><p>In the thatched cottage, Jiang Lingsu opened her eyes with a helpless expression: "Senior brother, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, do you have any alternate accounts for posting in the Divine Flower Society forums? It's urgent, please help!" Qi Yuan said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan: "Speak human language!"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand what her senior brother was saying at all.</p><p></p><p>"I mean alternate accounts!" Qi Yuan kept explaining, and it took several dozen breaths before Jiang Lingsu finally understood what Qi Yuan meant.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want... alternate accounts for?" Jiang Lingsu asked, then added, "Never mind, I won't ask about that. I can give you some accounts. </p><p></p><p>But... these accounts aren't cheap. How will you repay me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was delighted: "Junior sister, you're truly a living Bodhisattva who saves people from suffering."</p><p></p><p>Junior sister was really a golden thigh, always there to help.</p><p></p><p>"How about I renovate your thatched cottage and turn it into a high-end wooden cabin like mine?" Qi Yuan pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's mouth twitched: "Anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan whispered secretively: "I have some inside information to tell you."</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, leaking inside information in the stock market was illegal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was being very careful.</p><p></p><p>"What information?" Jiang Lingsu became interested.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light... is finished!" Qi Yuan said quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"An unparalleled genius is planning to make a move against the Palace of Light. The Palace of Light won't last three months before it's done for.</p><p></p><p>Now, quickly go borrow a large sum of spirit stones from the Palace of Light. You'll definitely make a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>I know a few big shots who each borrowed several hundred thousand spirit stones from the Palace of Light." Qi Yuan dragged out the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman to use as a tiger's skin.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?" Jiang Lingsu was surprised.</p><p></p><p>How come she hadn't heard any news about this?</p><p></p><p>"It's absolutely true. If I'm lying to you, I'm a dog!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll trust you this once and go borrow a few hundred thousand spirit stones from the Palace of Light as high-interest loans, to use as pocket money," Jiang Lingsu said casually.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan could barely keep his composure: "Junior sister, why don't you invest some in me?"</p><p></p><p>Several hundred thousand spirit stones, and it was just pocket money.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly understood why Blade was always digging through trash heaps.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that junior sister's trash heap was richer than his entire home.</p><p></p><p>How could the gap between people be so large? After obtaining several jade slips with alternate accounts from Jiang Lingsu, Qi Yuan felt very pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"I need to create some impressive alternate identities for myself!"</p><p></p><p>"Each identity will curse the Palace of Light harshly, putting pressure on them!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan registered several alternate accounts.</p><p></p><p>He also racked his brains to come up with some suitable alternate names.</p><p></p><p>Seven Desires Demon Lord, Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, Mad Daoist...</p><p></p><p>"Mad Daoist doesn't fit my style, but I need to design some alternate identities that don't match me. This way they won't associate them with me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave himself a thumbs up for his cleverness.</p><p></p><p>He used the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal account to enter the Divine Flower Society forums.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, why are there so many clickbait titles now?"</p><p></p><p>The first time he entered the forums, the post titles were all very proper and normal. Now there were a bunch of titles starting with "Shocking".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to click on these posts to see what had happened.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered he had important things to do and couldn't waste time browsing posts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, then published his first post.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal Returns Home, Daughter Living in Dog House, Palace of Light Goes Too Far!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal. I once fought for the Emerald Cloud Continent, defending our territory, shedding blood and sweat.</p><p></p><p>A month ago, my communication jade slip rang. When I answered, I heard my daughter's grieving cries!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When I returned home, I discovered my adorable daughter was living in a dog house!</p><p></p><p>And the cause of all this was the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>They started the Hundred Nations Blood War, bullying civilians at will, occupying my cave dwelling. I, the mighty Blood-Robed Sword Immortal who shed blood and sweat for the Emerald Cloud Continent, now has a daughter living in a dog house!</p><p></p><p>I, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, will definitely seek justice for this!"</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan quickly logged into another alternate account to bump the thread.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light has done all kinds of evil. I'm also a rogue cultivator from the Hundred Nations. Although I'm called the Seven Desires Demon Lord, I have a kind heart and don't even kill chickens. I even raised a flock of stray chickens.</p><p></p><p>This time, when the Palace of Light's envoy came to my country, he took a liking to the chickens I raised and directly stole them to cook and eat.</p><p></p><p>What they stole wasn't just my chickens, but my family!"</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan carefully reread it and felt more and more satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He felt his writing skills were brilliant. If he returned to the Blue Star, he could become the editor-in-chief of the People's Daily.</p><p></p><p>"I need to speed things up."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan decided to leverage the power of the Four Emperors of the Divine Flower Society and have them bump his threads.</p><p></p><p>There's one more chapter, probably around 9 pm. Sorry about that.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

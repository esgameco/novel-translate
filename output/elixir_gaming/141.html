        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked into the distance and saw a woman in green clothing on a small boat.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Do you need something?" Qi Yuan asked directly. He was eager to get back and work on creating his technique.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Jiang Ya, and I'm a disciple of the Ascend to Heaven Pavilion's Elder Wutian. I'm quite curious about senior's primordial divine ability... It seems somewhat out of place in this world, yet can still be used. It's very strange," Jiang Ya first stated her background to give herself some protection. As she spoke, her eyes held a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The primordial divine abilities of Purple Mansion powerhouses require comprehending the essence of spiritual energy, and then forging one's own path on that foundation. </p><p></p><p>She hadn't sensed the essence of spiritual energy in the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's primordial divine ability. This was what confused her.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you came to cheer me on," Qi Yuan said disappointedly. </p><p></p><p>The woman before him was decent looking. Though she was rather flat-chested, she'd be good enough as a cheerleader.</p><p></p><p>Playing the role of the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, he couldn't provide his own background music. </p><p></p><p>Without hundreds of supreme musicians, Qi Yuan's battles seemed very dull and flavorless. </p><p></p><p>He urgently needed a cheerleading squad.</p><p></p><p>But this woman suddenly came to ask him these things, which was really uninteresting.</p><p></p><p>"I'm out of here," Qi Yuan said disappointedly, turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya watched the blood-colored shadow disappear into the sky, her eyes filled with a trace of awe.</p><p></p><p>"This person... has unfathomable potential."</p><p></p><p>The old woman smiled and said, "No matter how unfathomable, it's nothing compared to the Pavilion Master."</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Ya shook her head.</p><p></p><p>In the past, her master had demonstrated his own primordial divine ability to her.</p><p></p><p>Now, compared to the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's primordial divine ability, she vaguely had a feeling that her master's primordial divine ability seemed inferior to this Blood-Robed Sword Saint's.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Divine Light Sect," she said. Having witnessed this battle, it was time for her to go to the Divine Light Sect and see her younger sister, to extricate her from the vortex of the Hundred Nations.</p><p></p><p>Even with a powerful enemy like the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, the Palace of Light would definitely not stop the Hundred Nations' blood war.</p><p></p><p>The two sides were bound to clash.</p><p></p><p>With the emperor-level Shocking Dragon Crown, even if her master came, without entering the Yin Spirit realm, he would be powerless against the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>He merely had a powerful primordial divine ability. His realm was likely far behind her master's.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan, dressed in a plain white robe, landed in front of his brick house.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his brick house, he revealed a satisfied expression: "Only a high-class house like this is worthy of me."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he deliberately glanced at junior sister Jiang Lingsu's wooden cabin not far away.</p><p></p><p>The sense of superiority in his heart grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, happiness comes from comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, where did you go? How did you suddenly disappear?" Jiang Lingsu had been bathing earlier, and Senior Brother hadn't barged in, but left a message outside her cabin.</p><p></p><p>After finishing her bath, she came to look for her Senior Brother but he wasn't there.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, people's hearts are treacherous. In the future, if someone says they want to apologize to you and invites you to meet, you must not go. </p><p></p><p>Who knows, they may have prepared an ambush waiting for you," Qi Yuan shared his life insights with his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, did someone set you up?" Jiang Lingsu's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for your Senior Brother's strong divine abilities, I might have really fallen victim to villains' schemes," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities? Hearing this, the worry in Jiang Lingsu's heart completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities could only be used by Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother was having an episode again!</p><p></p><p>He just said he had formed his Golden Core, and now he's at the Nascent Soul stage? His condition really isn't light!</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan with a pitying expression: "Senior Brother, in the future don't stare at that sun in the sky for no reason. Looking at that sun too much will affect your memory."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother's mind wasn't good to begin with. If he keeps staring at the sun in the sky, won't his condition just get worse?</p><p></p><p>"That's not the sun, it's my Golden Core!" Qi Yuan emphasized again.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright!" Jiang Lingsu didn't bother to argue, but asked, "Senior Brother, you left a message for me, did you have something to discuss?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand froze, and he asked: "During this time, I've been seriously playing games, not paying attention to anything outside. </p><p></p><p>Has anything happened on Seven-Colored Peak, especially... at the peak of Seven-Colored Peak?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving Master's palace, Qi Yuan felt quite dejected.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu frowned, thinking for about a few breaths of time: "A few days ago, a shocking thunder suddenly appeared on Seven-Colored Peak. At the peak, Master seemed to take action to block that shocking thunder."</p><p></p><p>"Shocking thunder?" Qi Yuan was puzzled, "Master took action?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jiang Lingsu nodded, her expression serious, "Before the shocking thunder appeared, some strange things seemed to have happened."</p><p></p><p>"What strange things?" Qi Yuan quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"At the time I was in closed-door cultivation, when I suddenly felt like I... seemed to have forgotten something, but then instantly remembered it again."</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, every unusual occurrence is worth noting.</p><p></p><p>In case someone was secretly plotting against them, or in case it was a heart demon.</p><p></p><p>"Forgot?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the events were connected.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he comprehended the origin for the third time, he encountered both a heart demon and heavenly tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The heart demon was all the demonic creatures in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly tribulation was forgetting.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this world also sent down heavenly tribulation, which was blocked by Master?</p><p></p><p>"Master really does care about me after all." Qi Yuan looked at the palace halls at the peak, his heart slightly settling.</p><p></p><p>Seven-Colored Peak was empty and desolate, as if no one had lived there for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan had only seen his beautiful female master once, only catching a glimpse of her side profile and back.</p><p></p><p>"...Senior Brother, can you not say such shocking things?" Jiang Lingsu rolled her eyes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, it was common for masters and disciples to become Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>There were even ancestors who became Dao companions with descendants countless generations removed.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, I know you're jealous of me because Master doesn't care about you.</p><p>Don't worry, Senior Brother cares about you," Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"...Get lost!" Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan's handsome face.</p><p></p><p>How had Senior Brother... become more and more handsome?</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Jiang Lingsu crossed her arms over her chest, making her bountiful figure even more prominent, and left in a huff.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched Jiang Lingsu's retreating figure, and thought of that woman as thin as a bamboo pole on the small boat: "She must be too poor at home, malnourished.</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister's family must be rich, her figure is too explosive."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan returned to his new brick house.</p><p></p><p>He remembered what the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman had said about updating the progress on destroying the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>He quickly entered the group chat and said:</p><p></p><p>"Today I pretended to be the Blood-Robed Sword Saint and met with those Nascent Soul cultivators from the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>"???" Rogue Immortal Lord said, "Bro, you really went?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I'm the victim here, justice is on my side, why wouldn't I go?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"What was the result?" Rogue Immortal Lord quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Since Origin Venerable can still speak in the group chat, it means the Palace of Light must have been dealt with. Maybe they really apologized to him," Great Sun Flame Emperor said in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, don't mention it. The Palace of Light didn't look like they were going to apologize at all. As soon as I arrived, they wanted to kill me, saying they needed to vanquish demons and eliminate evil," Qi Yuan said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"That's very much in line with the Palace of Light's way of doing things," Great Sun Flame Emperor said.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light is really short-sighted, not even willing to pay compensation," Rogue Immortal Lord agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Right, I only asked for 10 trillion spirit stones, but they weren't willing to give them. I had no choice but to send them down to reunite with their deceased relatives," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"...10 trillion?" Rogue Immortal Lord drew in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Were you really sincere about reconciling? Great Sun Flame Emperor said, somewhat confused: "You killed them all? Origin Venerable, didn't you just reach the Golden Core stage? The Palace of Light probably sent Nascent Soul cultivators too."</p><p></p><p>"The Nascent Soul cultivators from the Palace of Light were too weak. I didn't even use my full Golden Core strength. I only used Foundation Establishment level power and they died. It wasn't interesting," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you dare doubt Origin Venerable?" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman appeared in the group chat at this time.</p><p></p><p>"This time when the Palace of Light arranged to meet the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, I had a sister who borrowed a few million in high-interest loans from the Palace of Light. She was worried Origin Venerable wouldn't be able to destroy the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>For this meeting, she specially sent some disciples to Lingfeng Crossing to see the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Do you know what the result was? The Blood-Robed Sword Saint... isn't at the Nascent Soul stage, but the Purple Mansion realm! And not just an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Silence. There was a moment of silence in the group.</p><p></p><p>The boy in front of the pill furnace looked at the messages in the group chat with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable is at the Purple Mansion realm? Thinking of this, the boy felt a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>A Purple Mansion powerhouse was playing house with him in the group chat? Wuwu, was he the only real newbie in the cultivation world?</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Flame Emperor clearly came from an extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman was clearly a true big shot.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that at least Origin Venerable was in the same boat as him.</p><p></p><p>But it turns out he was pretending?</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that you, Origin Venerable, are actually a Purple Mansion cultivator," Great Sun Flame Emperor said, also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not at the Purple Mansion realm, I just reached the Golden Core stage," Qi Yuan said. He didn't like lying and always told the truth.</p><p></p><p>"I also originally thought Origin Venerable was a genius, but didn't expect you to actually be a big shot. Last time I asked you to participate in the Genius Battle, that was embarrassing," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A certain ranking would allow one to go to the newly discovered world in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking the Origin Venerable Lord was a young prodigy, she told him about this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a big shot, I'm a newbie, only at the Golden Core stage. Although my Golden Core is a bit large, and although my Golden Core ran away, I'm still a proper Golden Core cultivator," Qi Yuan said humbly. "I've already declared war on the Palace of Light, please wait for my good news everyone."</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable Lord, destroying the Palace of Light is quite difficult. Do you need some outside help? My sisters are quite ruthless. They borrowed money from the Palace of Light and don't want to pay it back. Do you want to join forces and destroy the Palace of Light together?"</p><p></p><p>Once someone dies, they don't have to repay debts.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt warmth in his heart: "Thank you Sister Domineering Woman, I alone am enough to destroy the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>He was socially anxious and didn't want to team up with those "old" women. He couldn't handle it.</p><p></p><p>What if they used feminine charms on him to get him to hand over the Palace of Light's techniques? Could he resist? His rational mind probably wouldn't want to, but his lower half might be willing.</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Qi Yuan exited the group chat.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a cave dwelling, the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman took a wine jug and poured the fine liquor into her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity Ling'er isn't from the Eastern Lands. If she participated in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings, she could naturally enter the top ten, and perhaps... could also enter the Wangyue Continent. My big family would have another place to go."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Domineering Woman was quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>Now, a major event was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Even the Palace of Light couldn't resist making early arrangements.</p><p></p><p>She naturally had to plan for the future as well.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan finished looking through all the techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had a helpless expression: "These Divine Infant cultivators don't deserve to be my ideal love!"</p><p></p><p>From these Divine Infant cultivators, Qi Yuan had obtained over twenty jade-grade techniques and three mysterious-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>For a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Qi Yuan, these would be very useful.</p><p></p><p>But he was already a Golden Core cultivator living in a brick house, so he looked down on these techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, as one's strength increases, one's horizons also expand. Back in the village, Widow Wang next door and Little Cui the village beauty could be considered ideal loves. Coming to the county, at least a JK schoolgirl is needed to be an ideal love."</p><p></p><p>Now, for Qi Yuan, his tastes had improved. Only a Purple Mansion powerhouse from the Palace of Light could be his ideal love.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, my sister has arrived," an excited voice called out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lazily came out and saw a striking contrast between two beauties outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>One was like a thin bamboo pole, plain and ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The other had curves in all the right places, full and stunning.</p><p></p><p>"That's your sister?" Qi Yuan felt it was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>The woman beside Jiang Lingsu was indeed the boat girl he had briefly encountered last night.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the two was too great, wasn't it? "This is my sister Jiang Ya, ranked 15th on the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings, a Golden Core cultivator!" Jiang Lingsu hugged Jiang Ya, her expression excited. "Sister Ya, this is my Senior Brother, surnamed Qi, given name Yuan. Although he seems unreliable, he's... a very very good person, and his talent is quite good too, able to make it onto the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Jiang Ya seriously size up Qi Yuan, her eyes showing a hint of surprise: "Thank you, fellow Daoist, for taking care of my little sister these days."</p><p></p><p>"No, it's actually Junior Sister who has been taking care of me," Qi Yuan replied sincerely.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained many techniques and spirit stones from his Junior Sister.</p><p></p><p>Every night his knife would go rummage through the trash pile outside Junior Sister's door for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He owed Junior Sister far too much!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan and got straight to the point, saying seriously: "Now that the Palace of Light has initiated the Hundred Nations Blood War, the Great Shang... will be caught in a difficult position."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu furrowed her brow.</p><p></p><p>She knew why her sister had come here.</p><p></p><p>"Lingsu left without saying goodbye to come to the Hundred Nations. There were quite a few complaints from our clan members, but I suppressed them all. I've always supported Lingsu's choices. However, with the Hundred Nations Blood War starting, the Great Shang has fallen to the demonic faction. It's somewhat inappropriate for her to stay here now," Jiang Ya said unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu secretly glanced at Qi Yuan, revealing a pitiful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll protect Junior Sister!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister had given him far too much.</p><p></p><p>He had said before that he would protect Junior Sister.</p><p></p><p>Even after reaching the Dali Golden Immortal stage, he would go capture some Purple Mansion powerhouses with water spirit roots to treat Junior Sister's illness, as a way to repay the rich patron.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Senior Brother's words, Jiang Lingsu felt warmth in her heart.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Brother may be unreliable in various ways, but he was quite a good person, and handsome too.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya smiled: "Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan, don't refuse just yet. I believe in your determination to protect Lingsu at all costs, and I don't doubt your character. Lingsu has always been better at judging people than me, her older sister."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Jiang Ya's words, Qi Yuan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>He didn't seem to have the determination to sacrifice his life, did he?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya continued: "The Hundred Nations Blood War cannot be stopped. I propose moving Seven-Colored Peak. In fact, even the Divine Light Sect can be relocated. With my Ascending Heaven Pavilion taking the lead, the Palace of Light won't stop you."</p><p></p><p>Her proposal could be said to be a great concession.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was very considerate of Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>After all, wouldn't they normally just forcibly take Jiang Lingsu away? What complaints could a disciple of a lower sect have?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the peak of Seven-Colored Mountain, then at his newly built brick house: "Seven-Colored Peak cannot be moved."</p><p></p><p>The determination in his words surprised Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Palace of Light is about to be destroyed soon, so there's nothing to fear," Qi Yuan said. His "100-Day Plan to Destroy the Palace of Light" was still steadily progressing, with promising results.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was surprised for a moment, then seemed to understand something: "You Hundred Nations people must be pinning your hopes on the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword Saint?" Jiang Lingsu was confused.</p><p></p><p>What did this have to do with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint?</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, it's quite surprising that the Hundred Nations could produce a Purple Mansion powerhouse. It's a pity that even if he's at the late Purple Mansion stage, or even perfected Purple Mansion, he still can't affect the Palace of Light's Hundred Nations Blood War plan," Jiang Ya said frankly.</p><p></p><p>For the Hundred Nations to produce a Purple Mansion cultivator would be enough to inspire excitement at any time.</p><p></p><p>It meant the Hundred Nations had their own powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Nations would also have their own foundation.</p><p></p><p>But for a Purple Mansion powerhouse to appear during the Hundred Nations Blood War was also unfortunate for him.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Nations Blood War concerned the life and death of the Palace of Light. The Palace of Light absolutely would not back down.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light had dozens of Purple Mansion powerhouses, and they also had Yin Spirit magical treasures like the Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown.</p><p></p><p>Without the Yin Spirits emerging, no one could contend against the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Jiang Lingsu had a completely confused expression: "What Purple Mansion?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, the Palace of Light met with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint at Lingfeng Crossing. The two sides clashed. The Blood-Robed Sword Saint used his origin divine ability and slaughtered all the Divine Infants from the Palace of Light. Before leaving, that Blood-Robed Sword Saint also declared that he was officially declaring war on the Palace of Light. Sigh, this Blood-Robed Sword Saint, declaring war on the Palace of Light with its tens of thousands of years of foundation all by himself, it really makes one sigh in admiration," Jiang Ya said slowly, then added, "But no matter how admirable, it can't change the outcome."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Jiang Lingsu covered her mouth, secretly glancing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint was at the Purple Mansion stage?</p><p></p><p>And he slaughtered several Divine Infants? The Blood-Robed Sword Saint...</p><p></p><p>She had countless thoughts she wanted to ask Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>But with Sister Ya, an outsider, present, it wasn't appropriate to ask.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan actually really wanted to say: "Sister, I'm not Purple Mansion, I'm a little Golden Core newbie!"</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't reveal his secret identity!</p><p></p><p>He could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya said: "I know you can't accept it right away. After the results of the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's battle with the Palace of Light come out, I'll come persuade you again."</p><p></p><p>With that, Jiang Ya bid farewell to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She entered the wooden house with Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the crude wooden house, Jiang Ya only furrowed her brow slightly, without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>She sat in the house, looking at the distracted Jiang Lingsu with a smile in her eyes: "Not happy I came?"</p><p></p><p>"No..." Jiang Lingsu was thinking about the Blood-Robed Sword Saint matter now.</p><p></p><p>"I took a look at some of the techniques you sent me last time," Jiang Ya said. "That modified technique... is quite a mess."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Jiang Lingsu's heart tightened. "There won't be any problems cultivating it, right?"</p><p></p><p>That seemed to be what Senior Brother had modified for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically, after cultivating it one would... become mentally confused, have worse memory, and might even completely forget oneself."</p><p></p><p>"What, that serious?" Jiang Lingsu stood up from her chair, looking worried.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother hadn't practiced this, had he?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Lingsu's reaction, Jiang Ya smiled: "You don't need to worry about that Senior Brother of yours. That incomplete technique only exists in theory. In reality, it's completely impossible to cultivate, not even to enter the first stage."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It was good that Senior Brother couldn't cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay for long this visit, I'll be leaving soon. The Eastern Lands prodigy competition has been moved up, I need to go participate. After the prodigy competition ends, I'll bring you home," Jiang Ya said.</p><p></p><p>This prodigy competition was very important.</p><p></p><p>Although Master hadn't said it explicitly, Jiang Ya could sense it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

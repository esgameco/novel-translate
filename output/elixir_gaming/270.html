        <h1>Chapter 270</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sun presided over the Ghostly Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>The great lords of the Ghostly Sky Realm all had some connection to the Dark Sun, to varying degrees. </p><p></p><p>Some of the yin gods present were aware of this fact.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, it would be best for you all not to get involved in the conflict between the Dark Sun and the Blood-Robed Sword God. Otherwise... the events of several hundred thousand years ago may repeat themselves!" said the president of the Divine Flower Association gravely.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the yin gods present became complicated.</p><p></p><p>Faced with great calamities, the many yin gods of the Azure Waves Realm had always allowed them to reap unchecked.</p><p></p><p>However, several hundred thousand years ago, a supreme expert led an army of yin gods to launch a terrifying battle against a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>That battle was hailed as the Azure Waves Realm's most hopeful fight.</p><p></p><p>That powerful expert even broke through to the yang god realm.</p><p></p><p>But alas...</p><p></p><p>The outcome was tragic.</p><p></p><p>Not a single yin god who participated in that battle survived.</p><p></p><p>These yin gods naturally knew about those past events.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred yin gods sat in complete silence, none daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>The great lord who had spoken earlier now opened his mouth again. With his snow-white hair, he said with a chuckle: "What's this? Did all the yin gods of the Azure Waves Realm with any backbone die in that battle 300,000 years ago?"</p><p></p><p>Great Lord You Hua's words caused looks of shame to appear on the faces of the yin gods and great lords present.</p><p></p><p>Because they truly were afraid.</p><p></p><p>Back then, that supreme expert had reached the yang god realm and led nearly two-thirds of the Azure Waves Realm's yin gods to attack the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The result... was utterly tragic.</p><p></p><p>All the yin gods who participated perished in battle.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God is only facing the Dark Sun, not a great calamity. Are you all really so afraid?" Great Lord You Hua spoke, his gaze firm. "300,000 years ago, my father fell at the hands of the great calamity. Now... haha, this old man's wife is with child. I... am no longer afraid!"</p><p></p><p>Great Lord You Hua's bloodline was special, making it difficult to produce offspring.</p><p></p><p>300,000 years ago, when his father went to slay the great calamity, he still had no children.</p><p></p><p>To prevent his bloodline from dying out, he had no choice but to stay behind.</p><p></p><p>Now, he already had offspring, and his wife was pregnant again. He truly had nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>"I am too far from the Ghostly Sky Realm to come in person, but I am willing to offer up cultivation techniques to lend the Blood-Robed Sword God a helping hand!" a female great lord spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing as well!"</p><p></p><p>Many great lords spoke up, all expressing support for the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Last time they were afraid, but this time... how could they be afraid again?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a look of joy flashed across Great Lord Wu Jun's face. He cupped his hands and said: "Many thanks, fellow Daoists!"</p><p></p><p>The various yin gods of the Ghostly Sky Realm chose to remain silent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association did not speak, and these people did not express a position either.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the head of the Dao-Seeking Palace spoke: "In a few more days, the Blood-Robed Sword God should arrive in the Ghostly Sky Realm. President of the Divine Flower Association, you..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by the president of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're not in the Ghostly Sky Realm, you don't face the threat of the Dark Sun, so of course you can speak so easily. If this old man helps this Blood-Robed Sword God today, and the Blood-Robed Sword God dies at the hands of the Dark Sun, when the Dark Sun starts settling scores, he'll naturally come after this old man." The president of the Divine Flower Association waved his sleeve, looking extremely angry. "If the Blood-Robed Sword God were wise, he wouldn't go provoke the Dark Sun and stir up trouble for no reason. Please excuse this old man from participating in today's gathering!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the president of the Divine Flower Association's form dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other yin gods of the Ghostly Sky Realm also hurriedly took their leave.</p><p></p><p>"This junior's strength is meager, so I won't get involved in such matters."</p><p></p><p>"Farewell."</p><p></p><p>The remaining yin gods looked at each other with complex expressions upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Great Lord You Hua sighed at the sight: "Human nature..."</p><p></p><p>Even though the Azure Waves Realm was like a pig farm, there were still those who wanted to be the head pig, the one currying favor with the keeper.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Wind Thunder Valley of the Dark Sun in the Ghostly Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>The phantom image of the president of the Divine Flower Association appeared. Looking at the mechanical bird before him, a humble expression appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association, who was so illustrious in the outside world, was now as lowly as dust.</p><p></p><p>A trace of anger flashed in the mechanical bird's eyes: "You come to ask me about such a trivial matter? I'm in the middle of secluded cultivation, approaching Li Qiuchan!"</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association hunched his body: "Great One Li dispatched the Four Generals of the Lei Family, but they have not returned."</p><p></p><p>"Useless! They must have failed and are too ashamed to show their faces!" the mechanical bird said angrily. "If this lord sees him in the future, I'll flay him alive!"</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association trembled even more.</p><p></p><p>The great ones in Wind Thunder Valley were terrifying, one more so than the next.</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchan merely enjoyed humiliating high-level cultivators, but the great one before him enjoyed torturing both high-level cultivators and ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a hobby of flaying people.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association had once sent some cultivators for this great one to play with.</p><p></p><p>Near Wind Thunder Valley, a group of mortals were also kept, and from time to time people would be sent into Wind Thunder Valley for this great one to flay for his amusement.</p><p></p><p>Even the president of the Divine Flower Association had been flayed once by him.</p><p></p><p>"Mere nobody from the lower realm not even on the God-Myth Stele dares to speak of entering my Wind Thunder Valley. Hmph, if this lord were not at a critical juncture in secluded cultivation, I would personally kill this wretch! The many pig slaves of Wind Thunder Valley shall be under your control." The mechanical bird said irritably.</p><p></p><p>He was at a critical point in his secluded cultivation now, so naturally he was too lazy to deal with matters of the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>A mere Blood-Robed Sword God could be left to the president of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, an expression of wild joy appeared on the face of the president of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>The pig slaves this great one spoke of were the puppets in Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>In Wind Thunder Valley, there were 36 puppets comparable to the Four Generals of the Lei Family, as well as 4 god-myth level puppets.</p><p></p><p>This was all of Wind Thunder Valley's combat power.</p><p></p><p>Now, this great one's meaning was to hand over control of all of Wind Thunder Valley's puppets to him to deal with the Blood-Robed Sword God. How could he not be overjoyed?</p><p></p><p>He could even use these pig slaves to hunt down some yin gods he disliked and obtain resources.</p><p></p><p>"This subordinate will certainly give his all to slay the Blood-Robed Sword God!" the president of the Divine Flower Association said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The mechanical bird snorted coldly, gave control of the pig slaves to the president of the Divine Flower Association, and then left the mechanical bird.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Wind Thunder Valley, the president of the Divine Flower Association hunched his body, his eyes filled with undisguised excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God... who would have thought that this old man's immense fortune would come from you!" the president of the Divine Flower Association muttered. "When I see you, this old man must thank you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ghostly Sky Realm, a blood-colored beam of light streaked across the sky, its sound resounding, its speed extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored beam of light was naturally Qi Yuan, rushing from the Phoenix Sky Realm to the Ghostly Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been traveling non-stop, crossing various realms towards the Ghostly Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he had also received a steady stream of news.</p><p></p><p>Great Lord Wu Jun had said that currently the promotion of the Original God Sharing Association was going smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The Dao-Seeking Palace had already begun helping the Original God Sharing Association collect cultivation techniques and store them in jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Many yin gods, revered ones, and even great lords were willing to lend the Blood-Robed Sword God a helping hand, and in 300 years, they would go together to the Central Sky Realm to face the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan sigh that there were still more good people in this world.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Because Great Lord Wu Jun had said that the head of the Dao-Seeking Palace had already sent messages to the yin gods of the Ghostly Sky Realm, saying that the Blood-Robed Sword God would arrive soon, and if the yin gods of the Ghostly Sky Realm were willing, they could come to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>But up until now, Qi Yuan had been in the Ghostly Sky Realm for some time, and had been particularly conspicuous, but unfortunately not a single yin god had come to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that all the yin gods of the Ghostly Sky Realm are men. If there were any women, they would certainly have been captivated by my charm and come to welcome me with open arms long ago."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No one came to meet him, and Qi Yuan only felt a bit wistful about that.</p><p></p><p>However... after about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, Qi Yuan did encounter someone who came to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, a man completely shrouded in a black robe appeared.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from him was merely that of a Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had used a Yin Spirit magical artifact to call Qi Yuan down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this black-robed man, his eyes showing a curious expression: "Which Yin Spirit do you represent in coming to meet me? Why doesn't he dare to appear in person?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Purple Palace cultivator lowered his head, his attitude extremely respectful: "Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, this junior is from the Divine Flower Society. I never imagined... I would have the honor of meeting you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>While at the Divine Flower Society, the black-robed Purple Palace cultivator had heard tales of the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's deeds, and greatly admired this senior.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the great calamity approaching, almost all Yin Spirits were in hiding. Yin Spirits like Qi Yuan who acted boldly to settle grudges were rare.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're my fan?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>See, his charisma was still very strong, he even had male fans.</p><p></p><p>"You're from the Divine Flower Society. If I remember correctly, the headquarters of the Divine Flower Society... is in the Ghostly Heavens Realm."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Qi Yuan's eyes showed an angry expression.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the overall leader of the Divine Flower Society? I still haven't settled accounts with him for banning me from speaking last time!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry about being banned from speaking by the overall leader of the Divine Flower Society last time.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had come to the Ghostly Heavens Realm, if the overall leader of the Divine Flower Society was here, it would be perfect to meet him in person and demand an explanation! Qi Yuan was not the type to have his mouth covered and swallow his anger silently.</p><p></p><p>"The overall leader of the Divine Flower Society..." The Purple Palace elder's gaze carried a trace of anger, "He has already defected to the Dark Sun!"</p><p></p><p>"Defected to the Dark Sun? No wonder he banned me from speaking. That bastard, so he's actually a traitor to the Azure Waves!" Qi Yuan quickly said, "Where is the Divine Flower Society headquarters? I'll go destroy him now!"</p><p></p><p>"The current overall leader of the Divine Flower Society is at the Dark Sun headquarters in Thunder and Lightning Valley!" the purple-robed elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What a coincidence, he's so considerate! This way I only need to destroy Thunder and Lightning Valley and two enemies will be gone." Qi Yuan was quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, destiny was on his side, his enemies had all gathered in one place.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal must be careful. Within the Dark Sun, there are likely experts at the Mythical level!" the Purple Palace elder said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sun's strength was formidable, not only did they have cultivators at the Six Steps of Heaven Treading, but they also had experts at the Mythical level.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, since I dared to come, I naturally have confidence!" Qi Yuan said carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Mythical level was just Mythical level.</p><p></p><p>Although his Divine Infant was still slumbering, even within his slumbering Divine Infant, there were quite a few that could exert Mythical level combat power.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace elder looked at Qi Yuan, and finally said slowly: "Senior, this junior actually comes from the Central Heavenly Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned: "A city dweller?"</p><p></p><p>The Central Heavenly Realm was the true center of the Azure Waves World, and also the location of the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>It was said that 99% of the Mythical level experts in the Azure Waves World were located in the Central Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivator continued: "Actually... our Azure Waves World has never stopped resisting the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>In the Central Heavenly Realm, almost all the Mythical experts of the Azure Waves World are gathered. These Mythical powerhouses have formed an organization called Azure Waves.</p><p></p><p>This junior is a member of Azure Waves, sent on a mission to the Ghostly Heavens Realm to monitor the Divine Flower Society and the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>Senior has slain the Four Generals of the Lei Family, demonstrating great power.</p><p></p><p>Senior, why don't you... temporarily spare the Dark Sun, and go to the Central Heavenly Realm instead.</p><p></p><p>The Mythical experts in Azure Waves may be able to help senior step into the Mythical realm."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace elder's words had several layers of meaning, and were spoken very tactfully.</p><p></p><p>He feared the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal would fall in the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>So he used the opportunity to become a Mythical expert as bait, trying to entice Qi Yuan to go to the Central Heavenly Realm and join the Mythical experts of Azure Waves.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your kind intentions, but right now... my strength is meager, too far from the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>I'll destroy the Dark Sun first, then consider whether to go to the Central Heavenly Realm." Qi Yuan directly refused.</p><p></p><p>He was currently only at the Divine Infant True Monarch level.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a top figure in the Great Shang, his cultivation level didn't amount to much in the Azure Waves World.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Purple Palace cultivator sighed dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>The current Azure Waves organization had actually not sent him any news for a long time, he was already in a state of lost contact.</p><p></p><p>What he just said was entirely based on his own suggestions and good intentions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he could not persuade Qi Yuan, the Purple Palace elder said: "May I see you overthrow the Dark Sun and restore light to the Azure Waves!"</p><p></p><p>He did not try to persuade further.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're here, do you have a map of Thunder and Lightning Valley?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please be careful!" The Purple Palace elder sighed deeply, and handed the map to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the map to Thunder and Lightning Valley from the Purple Palace elder, Qi Yuan set off alone towards Thunder and Lightning Valley.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Qi Yuan stopped in a forest.</p><p></p><p>The forest ahead was dense, with weak spiritual energy, almost like the mortal kingdoms of the Great Shang country.</p><p></p><p>Due to the thin spiritual energy, there were no cultivation sects within a thousand miles of this area, only a few mortal kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Even if ordinary cultivators from the Ghostly Heavens Realm came here, they would not imagine that within the forest ahead lay the most terrifying force in the Ghostly Heavens Realm - the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood in the forest, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>"Damn Thunder and Lightning Valley, to enter I have to wait here for four days!"</p><p></p><p>According to the Purple Palace elder, there were only two ways to enter Thunder and Lightning Valley.</p><p></p><p>Thunder and Lightning Valley was not located in the main world of the Azure Waves World, but in a secret realm. Entering was quite complicated.</p><p></p><p>The first method was to have Thunder and Lightning Valley open from the inside to let him in.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qi Yuan first arrived, he had already cursed loudly for a few minutes, but Thunder and Lightning Valley remained tightly closed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the overall leader of the Divine Flower Society inside Thunder and Lightning Valley naturally knew that Qi Yuan had arrived.</p><p></p><p>However, he had just gained control of the puppet and was not yet familiar with it, so he was not in a hurry to let the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal enter.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal had not left his name on the Mythical Monument, what if he had Mythical level combat power?</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, he did not immediately open the secret realm entrance to let Qi Yuan enter.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan could only use the second method to enter.</p><p></p><p>Forced entry.</p><p></p><p>Forced entry required playing chess on the board in front for four consecutive days.</p><p></p><p>After four days, regardless of winning or losing the chess game, the entrance to Thunder and Lightning Valley would open.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan sat on a stone bench, eyes closed, integrating and analyzing the techniques he had obtained in his mind, perfecting the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>His hand occasionally placed a piece on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Now he wore a blood-colored robe, but due to quietly playing chess, he appeared cultured and refined.</p><p></p><p>A few farmers going up the mountain to collect firewood saw Qi Yuan from afar, their eyes showing a strange expression, but they did not dare approach this strange man.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, with hundreds of pieces already placed on the chessboard, Qi Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is dead?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, the character condensed from his innate seed had suddenly died.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the stone bench, quite speechless, wishing he could enter the game to see exactly what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"This game start... dying first as a greeting... how can it be played?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in an unknown world.</p><p></p><p>A brand new public cemetery was built, and Qi Yuan's body was not cremated, but buried in the ground.</p><p></p><p>On his tombstone, there was something like a QR code. Scanning it would allow one to see his life story.</p><p></p><p>In front of the tombstone, there was only one bouquet of flowers, making it appear particularly desolate.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

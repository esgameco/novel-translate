        <h1>Chapter 425</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing Longyue Tianzun's words, Jinli instinctively glanced at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze became resolute.</p><p></p><p>"I wish to relinquish my status as a Moon Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Moon Maiden of the Moon God Palace meant one could not marry, and even after reaching the Yang God realm, one had to sever all worldly ties.</p><p></p><p>The implications of this were crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Longyue Tianzun let out a soft sigh. </p><p></p><p>The status of Moon Maiden was not something just anyone could obtain.</p><p></p><p>The treatment they enjoyed was comparable to Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>Their families also enjoyed many resources and preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>Without the Moon Maiden status and support from the Moon God Palace's resources,</p><p></p><p>Not only would her family lose those resources, but she herself would find it extremely difficult to reach the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yang God realm... talent alone was far from enough.</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens, there were countless worlds, too many to number.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses were as numerous as fireflies.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, a single world might not even produce one Yang God.</p><p></p><p>For Jinli to give up her Moon Maiden status would be an enormous loss for her.</p><p></p><p>In fact, such a thing had only happened once or twice in the history of the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot make this decision. We need to consult the Moon God Sovereign," Longyue Tianzun said calmly. "However, the Moon God Sovereign is currently in seclusion and likely cannot see you. This matter can only be put on hold for now.</p><p></p><p>But since you have fulfilled your meritorious service, I'm sure the esteemed Moon God Sovereign will not make things difficult for you.</p><p></p><p>Before the Moon God Sovereign emerges from seclusion, during this period of time... just be mindful of your actions."</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Moon God Sovereign was severely injured and in seclusion, with no knowing when they would reappear.</p><p></p><p>Longyue Tianzun's meaning was clear - relinquishing the Moon Maiden status was possible, but would have to wait until the Moon God Sovereign emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>During this time, she should keep a low profile and save some face for the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Any ostentatious marriage plans would be unwise.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Tianzun." Jinli gracefully bowed, unable to suppress the joy in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Longyue Tianzun. Something occurred to him, and he took out a token.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, friend, is this Moon Token from the Moon God Palace?" Qi Yuan produced the Moon Token.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he climbed to the peak of the Seven-Colored Mountain to seek an audience with his master,</p><p></p><p>He did not see his master, but instead found this Moon Token.</p><p></p><p>The information his eyes received was that this was a token of the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"This token was bestowed by my master Ruan Yixi. It seems to have some connection to the Moon God Palace. I wonder if you know if there is such a person as my master in the Moon God Palace," Qi Yuan asked earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Jinli frowned, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>She also hadn't expected Qi Yuan to have such a connection to the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Longyue Tianzun looked at the Moon Token, her eyes narrowing slightly, her expression solemn: "This is... the token of the previous generation's Moon God Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"Previous generation?" Qi Yuan was also stunned, not expecting such a result.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the previous Moon God Sovereign, I don't know much.</p><p></p><p>As for Ruan Yixi... I've never heard of this person," said Longyue Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>Information about Great Principle realm powerhouses, especially secrets related to the Moon God Sovereign, was not something a mere Yang God of the small Principle realm like her could know.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt somewhat disappointed: "Is it possible for me to meet the senior Moon God Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to clarify the identity of his master Ruan Yixi, and her current whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Longyue Tianzun shook her head: "That's likely impossible in the short term, but... if it's related to the previous Moon God Sovereign, you could try asking... Moonlight Tianzun."</p><p></p><p>Moonlight Tianzun was one of only two Great Principle realm experts in the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>With the Moon God Sovereign absent, Moonlight Tianzun had been managing affairs.</p><p></p><p>"When can I contact Moonlight Tianzun?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"In some time, the Principle Dao Discussion will begin. Moonlight Tianzun will represent the Moon God Palace in attendance. At that time, you can naturally pay your respects," Longyue Tianzun said, her eyes showing reverence when mentioning Moonlight Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Gods could be as vast as that between Yang Gods and Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Especially between the Great Principle and Small Principle realms.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one became, the harder it was to advance even a small level, like climbing to heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The Principle Dao Discussion, huh?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he must attend this Principle Dao Discussion.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the palace with Jinli, Qi Yuan held her hand as they strolled leisurely through the Moon God Palace area.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was like a delicate beauty from a wealthy family, having lost her former sharp coldness, now gentle and affectionate.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, many Moon God Palace cultivators who saw this scene were surprised, whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Am I seeing things?"</p><p></p><p>"What did I just see?"</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Maiden is actually holding a man's arm!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Moon God Palace knew that Moon Maiden Jinli was an "ice queen", keeping people at a thousand-mile distance, always focused on killing.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen her with such a girlish demeanor before.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators revealed envious and jealous expressions.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out the Moon Maiden isn't naturally cold, she was just cold towards us."</p><p></p><p>"This man's appearance does indeed seem a perfect match for our Moon Maiden, but I wonder what his status is?"</p><p></p><p>"Is he worthy of our Moon Maiden?"</p><p></p><p>"To have won the Moon Maiden's heart, he must be exceptionally outstanding!"</p><p></p><p>These people looked at Jinli and Qi Yuan with curiosity and surprise.</p><p></p><p>After some time, an elegant and noble-looking woman approached along the path.</p><p></p><p>This woman was Yu Tiao, the host of the Moon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Moon Maiden Jinli, she blinked her eyes curiously: "Greetings, Moon Maiden."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she couldn't help but look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"And this is...?"</p><p></p><p>She was a Myth that illuminated all heavens, with a status in this battle zone only slightly lower than the Moon Maiden's.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of connections, she had far more.</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at Qi Yuan, memories of the past flooding back. She grew bolder: "He is... my beloved."</p><p></p><p>"Beloved" meant dao partner.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jinli no longer wanted to retreat, but to be brave.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yu Tiao and those around them changed expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because Moon Maidens were not allowed to have beloveds.</p><p></p><p>"My lady, what you say..." Yu Tiao hesitated, still very shocked.</p><p></p><p>The ice queen Moon Maiden Jinli actually had someone in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"My meritorious service is already sufficient. As long as I can meet the Moon God Sovereign, I will no longer be a Moon Maiden of the Moon God Palace," Jinli said firmly.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of everyone present changed from slight surprise to shock, drawing in sharp breaths.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that the meaning of being a Moon Maiden was to progress step by step, with the support of the Moon God Sovereign, to certainly become a Yang God! Now, someone was actually giving up the qualifications of a Moon Maiden. How could they not be shocked, and even... sour.</p><p></p><p>Some looked at the Moon Maiden as if looking at someone blinded by love.</p><p></p><p>Giving up the status of Moon Maiden for a man, how foolish could one be?</p><p></p><p>Although this man was quite handsome, could good looks be eaten?</p><p></p><p>Moon Maiden Jinli understood the meaning behind these expressions, but she paid them no mind.</p><p></p><p>She had always been clear-headed, knowing what she wanted.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of shock, Yu Tiao's gaze scrutinized Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She was very surprised and puzzled about what charm this man possessed to make Jinli give up her Moon Maiden status.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jinli, his expression focused: "Whatever you lose, I will make up for."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the men and women of the Moon God Palace present...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The situation changed again.</p><p></p><p>They all felt that Qi Yuan was being very boastful.</p><p></p><p>After all, what Jin Li had lost was her status as Moon Maiden and her qualification to enter the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>However, even though they had these doubts in their minds, they didn't express them outwardly.</p><p></p><p>Yu Tiao sighed softly: "The Moon Maiden's decisiveness is admirable."</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan's previous words, she simply ignored them. </p><p></p><p>Even if he was a Yang God Celestial Venerable, could what he gave Jin Li really be more than what the Moon Palace and Moon Maiden status could offer her?</p><p></p><p>After a brief exchange, the crowd dispersed again.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li grabbed Qi Yuan's hand: "Don't mind what they said. </p><p></p><p>My giving up the Moon Maiden status was my own willful decision, out of selfishness."</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to morally bind Qi Yuan, nor did she want him to feel guilty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Between us, there's no need for calculations or concern about others' opinions. Otherwise... it would be too boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he was not only lawful good, but also an idealist.</p><p></p><p>He trusted Jin Li very much.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li would try her best to give him the best, and he would also try his best to give Jin Li the best.</p><p></p><p>If they were always calculating gains and losses, he and Jin Li wouldn't have continued talking on Linglong Yuxi back then, and wouldn't have reached this point today.</p><p></p><p>Although a woman like Jin Li seemed like an illusion that only existed in imagination, this was the immortal cultivation world, where all kinds of women existed.</p><p></p><p>"You don't step on ants, I'm lawful good, we're a perfect match," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jin Li's snow-white face blushed again.</p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, the two of them had arrived at Jin Li's residence.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li didn't hesitate to bring Qi Yuan into her boudoir.</p><p></p><p>The room was simply furnished, with an inkstone and brushes on a desk under the window. A vase held several stems of celestial vines, bearing strings of fruit that hung down charmingly.</p><p></p><p>A landscape screen and light gauze divided the room into sleeping, sitting, and bathing areas.</p><p></p><p>Apart from some decorations, the boudoir was clean and cold like a snow cave, with a faint exotic fragrance similar to Jin Li's scent.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, when I was in the lower realm, I wanted to tell you about my existence, but I was afraid of bringing you unnecessary trouble.</p><p></p><p>A month ago, my Fixed Star Golden Core once passed by your star." Qi Yuan said calmly as he lightly inhaled the fragrance in Jin Li's dark hair.</p><p></p><p>"That... was you?" Jin Li recalled that day when ten suns crossed the sky and passed by her star. Her expression changed slightly, showing some nervousness. "The Ten Suns Celestial Venerable is you?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jin Li felt some sweetness, but more nervousness. She leaned close to Qi Yuan's ear and said in a low voice: "You must not tell anyone about this, otherwise... it will be very troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Li was speaking too close, her breath like orchids. Qi Yuan felt a bit ticklish.</p><p></p><p>"Not only will the Tai Huang Palace cause trouble for you, but the Moon God Palace will too!" Jin Li's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan being the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable meant he was very powerful, which naturally made her happy. But what the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable represented couldn't be ignored.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon God Sovereign holds the Supreme Yin position, while that person in Tai Huang Palace holds the Great Sun position, which is what you're seeking.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun and Supreme Yin are enemies.</p><p></p><p>For either to advance further, they must devour the other.</p><p></p><p>You... must not meet the Moon God Sovereign, otherwise if she discovers you... I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Jin Li dared not imagine.</p><p></p><p>The methods of Great Dao Principles were unimaginable, and the Moon God Sovereign was no ordinary Great Dao Principle.</p><p></p><p>Great Dao Principles like the Moon God Sovereign who grasped supreme principles were less than ten in number even in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Such beings had unfathomable methods.</p><p></p><p>If the Moon God Sovereign saw Qi Yuan and discovered his identity, there might be some scheme or plot.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan had no intention of harming the Moon God Sovereign or desire to devour the Supreme Yin position.</p><p></p><p>But at that level, in that position, whether one had such intentions or not didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt quite delighted: "They say girls are outgoing, but you're already taking my side before marrying me."</p><p></p><p>Jin Li didn't hesitate at all to stand on his side rather than the Moon God Palace's.</p><p></p><p>He was quite moved.</p><p></p><p>From the Moon God Sovereign's perspective, it would be chilling.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it couldn't be compared like that.</p><p></p><p>Because in Jin Li's view, currently the Moon God Sovereign could threaten Qi Yuan, but Qi Yuan couldn't threaten the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Hearing about marriage, Jin Li's milk-white jade-like skin flushed red, like snow piled on pear blossoms with peach blossoms dotting it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jin Li, seeing her gentle and affectionate eyes, lips like painted pearls, her sandalwood mouth slightly open. He felt his heart stir.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, he was also very proactive, everything flowing naturally.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help leaning in and kissing Jin Li's rosy lips.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's body suddenly stiffened, then instantly went limp. Her beautiful eyes half-closed, she breathed softly, her exquisitely beautiful snow-white face flushing with passion.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, the entanglement ended, but the intense longing had not dissipated. Instead, it had fermented even stronger.</p><p></p><p>A short separation is better than a new love, let alone a long separation and new love.</p><p></p><p>"If you like, I..."</p><p></p><p>Jin Li looked at Qi Yuan, her cold face full of tenderness. Her apricot-colored top slid off, the lotus-colored thin gauze lifted, revealing the world's most beautiful scenery.</p><p></p><p>Her waterfall-like dark hair covered the front, half-concealing and half-revealing.</p><p></p><p>A resolute expression appeared on her face, or rather, an expression of abandoning everything. However, her fragrant shoulders were trembling, showing her inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Her Majesty the Empress, or the Moon Maiden?" Qi Yuan's expression was gentle as he leaned closer. "Or are you Jin Li?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Li closed her eyes slightly, not struggling, hugging Qi Yuan tightly.</p><p></p><p>No embrace, no matter how tight, could express this ten thousand years of longing.</p><p></p><p>As they say, emotions arise, but propriety restrains.</p><p></p><p>Now, Jin Li was still the Moon Maiden, and could not yet put her photo on Qi Yuan's marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been very proper, conservative and traditional, so even though he longed for her, he still restrained himself and did not go to the final step with Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>After all, they weren't married yet!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he held Jin Li, his expression regretful: "Alas, I knew early on that the world is difficult. I really want to stay longer in this tender place."</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan understood that he couldn't stay here too long. The situation with the Demon Luo clan would change if he delayed.</p><p></p><p>He had to hurry back.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's eyes showed intense reluctance to part.</p><p></p><p>She knew Qi Yuan was plotting against the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't go with him. If she went, she would only be a burden.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you... capture me and imprison me?" Thinking of something, Jin Li looked expectant, no longer cold and noble as before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "We still need to give face to the Moon God Palace, and besides, staying by my side... would be somewhat dangerous."</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, Jin Li staying in the Moon God Palace was safer now.</p><p></p><p>His plot against the Demon Luo clan to reclaim his well would inevitably lead to pursuit and assassination attempts.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't keep Jin Li in his underworld forever, could he? Not letting her cultivate? Although he could transmit spiritual energy to his junior sister Jiang Lingsu for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But that was because Jiang Lingsu was weak.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't work for Jin Li, who was at the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>The disappointment in Jin Li's eyes was unconcealed: "You... be very careful. If things don't work out, come to the Moon God Palace!"</p><p></p><p>She was reluctant for Qi Yuan to leave, but wouldn't stop him from his great undertaking.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry." Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, it felt really good to be cared for and thought of.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he lacked love when he was on Blue Star? (End of chapter)</p>

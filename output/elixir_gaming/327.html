        <h1>Chapter 327</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the street.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, there are two suns in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"You're so young yet already learning to lie. Yesterday you lied saying your dad was playing with two beautiful women, and today you're saying there are two suns in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"It's true, look!"</p><p></p><p>In the hospital.</p><p></p><p>"?? Oh no, did my surgery fail? Why are there two suns in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>"Two suns?" Hearing this, the doctor was confused. The surgery was on the eyes, it shouldn't have damaged the brain, right? Maybe... send them to a psychiatric hospital? Thinking this, he also looked up at the sky, and his gaze immediately froze.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on Gongxing, exclamations erupted everywhere. Many people looked up at the sky with expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"There's actually an extra sun in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Could the rumors be true? Is spiritual energy returning, the Immortal Dao awakening, and myths descending?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, the sun is blinding my dog eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"According to my limited scientific knowledge, does this mean... Gongxing will be destroyed in a few minutes?"</p><p></p><p>"Why in a few minutes?"</p><p></p><p>"It takes light a few minutes to reach us. With an extra sun, how could our Gongxing withstand it?"</p><p></p><p>"You idiot, we can already see the sun now, which means the light has already reached us!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all across the country and in various places, everyone's gaze was fixed on the sky. They were filled with shock, curiosity, and even fear of the unknown at the extra sun that had appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Some people even prostrated themselves in worship at the additional sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>On the warship, Luo Ping's gaze was stunned. For the first time, he felt that events were developing beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>As a Restarter, he was thoroughly familiar with the major events on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>He even knew all the secret treasures and ruins like the back of his hand.</p><p></p><p>But an extra sun in the sky? He had never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the sky, his gaze solemn.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a tall, sexy woman in a blue short skirt walked over from nearby. Her gaze towards Luo Ping was extremely gentle, as if her eyes were completely focused on him: "Grandfather's phone call."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luo Ping quickly took the phone: "Old man..."</p><p></p><p>"The sun in the sky... I don't know either. Before the Restart, there was never an extra sun in the sky. It might be... an unexpected change."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, Xiao Qin and I are on our way to Star Cloud Island. We'll come back as soon as we get the item."</p><p></p><p>Luo Ping hung up the phone, glanced at the sun in the sky once more, and then looked at his young and beautiful wife not far away.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat satisfied in his heart: "It's fine. The sun appearing in the sky and the world restarting... those kinds of high-level events are too far removed from us. We just need to take care of our little family."</p><p></p><p>At this time, on Canxing, a massive fleet of spaceships was cruising in the distant depths of space.</p><p></p><p>A man wearing a white fluid-like battle suit had a hint of confusion in his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Li, how are the survey results?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly professor stared at the large screen in front, his eyes showing a rare look of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Our probes, emitting seventh-level Can Light, are unable to make contact with... the newly appeared sun."</p><p></p><p>"Unable to make contact?" For the first time, a grave expression appeared in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Can Light was a type of light that the Chenxing Nation had captured from excavating ruins in the depths of the universe.</p><p></p><p>This light had special properties. The seventh-level Can Light was especially adept at detection.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that all kinds of celestial bodies could be detected.</p><p></p><p>Even black holes could be probed around their periphery.</p><p></p><p>But the detection failed? "It seems to exist, yet also not exist, somewhere between reality and unreality." Mentioning this, Professor Li paused in his speech.</p><p></p><p>The young man frowned, not understanding: "Is there any clue, such as... where it came from, or what impact it might have on our Canxing?"</p><p></p><p>Professor Li shook his head at this point: "I suspect it's related to the ancient Immortal Dao, but the relevant materials need to be read in the National Treasury. My clearance level is not high enough."</p><p></p><p>The National Treasury was the largest collection of ancient books on Canxing, with the most data and documents.</p><p></p><p>The ancient books inside were mostly rare editions that could not be borrowed.</p><p></p><p>Due to special reasons, some materials could not be digitized by ordinary technology, or even photographed and uploaded to the internet, so they remained in the National Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Professor Li wanted to enter the National Treasury to investigate the matter of the suddenly appearing sun.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, once our fleet returns, I'll immediately apply to the higher-ups!" </p><p></p><p>The young man glanced at the unfathomable sun once more, then piloted the fleet back towards Canxing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Han family.</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xian Yun stretched and walked out of the house.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Tournament was about to begin in a few days, and he needed to go meet Qi Yuan to discuss related matters.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he reached the doorway, a middle-aged man wearing a black jacket blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Han Xian Yun's gaze became reverent, with a hint of fear: "Big brother."</p><p></p><p>"You're going out... to see Qi Yuan?" Han Kang's voice carried the air of someone in authority.</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun couldn't help but lower his head: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>"I advise you not to see him recently. He seems to have gotten entangled in something." Han Kang warned.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Han Xian Yun was confused, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Has Mr. Qi gotten into some trouble?" Han Xian Yun couldn't help but ask with concern.</p><p></p><p>However, remembering Qi Yuan's strength, he felt reassured again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was someone who could pierce through the Guiran military camp with one sword. What trouble could he possibly face?</p><p></p><p>"The trouble is big, possibly related to the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>I'm at a critical time for entering the Provincial Cabinet now. You need to be more cautious and not cause any trouble, understand?" Han Kang warned again.</p><p></p><p>His position was already very high. One step further would be the Provincial Cabinet.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat similar to the provincial committee of Qi Yuan's previous life on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Martial Stars?" Hearing this, Han Xian Yun frowned.</p><p></p><p>If it were any other trouble, Han Xian Yun wouldn't be afraid at all, and Qi Yuan could probably resolve it easily.</p><p></p><p>But the Seven Martial Stars families were different.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Stars families wielded powerful weapons like the Eye of the Sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the Eye of the Sky, all things were equal.</p><p></p><p>That was a weapon even more terrifying than nuclear weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Han Kang nodded, without saying anything more, and walked straight into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the old butler came forward: "Master, given the Second Master's temperament, he might... Should we find someone to follow him and keep an eye on him?"</p><p></p><p>Han Kang's footsteps paused.</p><p></p><p>He had heard some rumors about Qi Yuan's situation, but didn't know the details clearly.</p><p></p><p>His position did not allow him to be involved in conflicts at that level.</p><p></p><p>He only vaguely knew that Qi Yuan was merely a fuse, igniting a conflict between two factions.</p><p></p><p>As for which faction to side with... Han Kang hadn't made up his mind yet.</p><p></p><p>In fact, to enter the Provincial Cabinet and advance further, it was time for him to choose a side.</p><p></p><p>"No need to follow him." Han Kang shook his head, "Mom and Dad left everything to me. I owe my little brother quite a lot.</p><p></p><p>This time... let him be.</p><p></p><p>As they say, 'When brothers are of one mind, their sharpness can cut through metal.' This time, as the elder brother, I'll go along with him for once."</p><p></p><p>Han Kang said softly.</p><p></p><p>He was old enough to be his brother's father.</p><p></p><p>So, the relationship between them had always been strained.</p><p></p><p>All the family's political resources had been used on him.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So his younger brother could only mingle in martial arts circles. He felt somewhat guilty about this.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he hadn't chosen sides yet and didn't know which side to take, so he just let his younger brother choose for him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Xianyun was feeling extremely conflicted inside.</p><p></p><p>His older brother's words made him feel nervous.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to tell Mr. Qi about this in advance. </p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for him, I probably would have died when I encountered that very impressive lady last time."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun was very loyal.</p><p></p><p>The last time he accidentally entered the mysterious space, if Qi Yuan hadn't intervened, he would have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, those who kill shall die. Qi Yuan saved his life, so naturally he had to repay him.</p><p></p><p>As for his older brother's warning, he could only put it aside for now.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun's thinking was simple - so-called gold and silver treasures, so-called power and influence, were not as precious as life itself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he quickly drove his car to the hotel where Qi Yuan was staying.</p><p></p><p>"How did Brother Qi get involved with the Seven Martial Star families?" Han Xianyun pondered, unable to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he had no time to think about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were many strange things in this world, and even more things he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>For example, why was there an extra sun in the sky? Who knew? No one knew.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed, and he finally drove to the hotel.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even parked the car in the parking lot when his sharp eyes immediately spotted a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun didn't hesitate at all and quickly got out of the car to run towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When he ran over, he was stunned. He saw that next to Qi Yuan stood a charming young girl wearing a black waist-cinching dress.</p><p></p><p>The girl's skin was very fair, forming a stark contrast with the black dress. Under the sunlight, she looked extremely bright and beautiful. Below the skirt, black stockings wrapped her slender and straight calves. Her black hair cascaded down like a waterfall. The young girl before him seemed to have walked out of history, with a beauty that combined classical and modern elements.</p><p></p><p>Originally Han Xianyun thought Princess Huansha was already very beautiful, but compared to the charming young girl before him, she wasn't even one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>"This is Han Xianyun, um, a guy I know," Qi Yuan said to the girl beside him. "He has unique tastes and likes very impressive women."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he said to Han Xianyun: "This is Ning Tao, also a canary. She is my... um... we're about to get our marriage certificate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused a bit when saying the last few words.</p><p></p><p>The canary in the black dress was petite and delicate, quite cute in her small stature. Hearing Qi Yuan's words, her ears flushed red.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Blood Pearl, I thought you liked men," the canary said, stretching out her hand to tightly hug Qi Yuan's arm. The sunlight spilled onto her skirt, making her feel lazy and relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, I'm very normal," Qi Yuan said, glancing at Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>As for who was abnormal, that would naturally be Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're here. You're familiar with this place. Canary just arrived, and we're planning to buy some clothes and stuff. Lead the way," Qi Yuan said, being a freeloader again.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a casual daily life game. In such a game, not buying nice clothes for your wife to dress up and look at would be too much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, forget about shopping, it's urgent!" Han Xianyun said anxiously at this point. "I heard from my brother that one of the Seven Martial Star families seems to have their eye on you and wants to harm you!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Stars were taboo in the Qin Yuan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, these few families had been ruling this country since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Several royal families had changed, but the Seven Martial Stars still stood firm.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Han Xianyun finished speaking, he immediately felt the surrounding atmosphere turn cold, as if he was in the midst of ice.</p><p></p><p>This sensation came quickly and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that this aura might have come from the charming young girl beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she was also a formidable person?</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Seven Martial Stars?" Ning Tao's voice was sweet, like sugar in a honey pot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held her small hand and said, "It's just a game, don't bother with NPCs, otherwise it's too much of a waste of emotion."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the canary smiled sweetly and said no more.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, I know you're very strong, but... the Eye in the Sky is too terrifying. You... might..." Han Xianyun stammered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and said, "Right now I'm weak and helpless, but my wife is here. </p><p></p><p>If they hit me, it'll be my wife's turn to step up. I'm not afraid!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said proudly, like a pampered second-generation rich kid.</p><p></p><p>Hit the little one, and the big one comes.</p><p></p><p>With the canary here, he could strut around above the Arched Star.</p><p></p><p>The canary hugged Qi Yuan's arm tightly and nodded vigorously: "Hehe, I've got your back this time, Blood Pearl!"</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun looked at the canary with suspicion, feeling hesitant and confused in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this canary was an even more formidable person than Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>At a military base.</p><p></p><p>A file was placed on the table.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Lan Hai stood to the side, his face showing a respectful expression.</p><p></p><p>In front of him sat a man wearing gold-rimmed glasses.</p><p></p><p>The man glanced at the file, his eyes flashing with amazement: "Strong martial power is indeed everything. Even such a woman is willing to give her heart."</p><p></p><p>The man had seen many women, all kinds of beautiful types, and had played with them.</p><p></p><p>But the one in the file, just from ordinary camera footage without any beautification or editing, was so captivating. In reality, what kind of stunning beauty would she be? And such a woman was nestling against Qi Yuan like a little bird. He couldn't help but feel a surge of jealousy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Mu, what should we do?" Marquis Lan Hai asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>He had secretly investigated Qi Yuan and stolen his information on Young Master Mu's orders.</p><p></p><p>As a result, his theft was discovered, and he was even sent a coffin. He was truly panicked.</p><p></p><p>That was a fierce person who could kill the entire Gui Ran military camp with one sword.</p><p></p><p>Although Gui Ran's army was no match and far inferior to the Qin Yuan Kingdom's army, Qi Yuan was definitely a formidable person in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Yuan Kingdom, there weren't many weapons that could deal with Qi Yuan and eliminate him.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple. Tomorrow you'll go personally to apologize to him.</p><p></p><p>As for me, I'll go meet his little girlfriend.</p><p></p><p>If he's sensible, he should know what to do.</p><p></p><p>If he's not sensible, his fate... will be very miserable.</p><p></p><p>His little girlfriend will only be able to become a widow, and I... happen to like that type."</p><p></p><p>Young Master Mu's eyes held a lofty expression.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Star families had ruled this land for over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many times the emperor changed or how many uprisings there were, those people remained at the top.</p><p></p><p>Stable and secure, they naturally became arrogant and conceited.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was indeed very frightening.</p><p></p><p>But... could he compare to the terrifying Brilliant Star? Even if Brilliant Star casually sent out a battleship, it could annihilate Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Yet even such a powerful Brilliant Star failed in its invasion of the Arched Star.</p><p></p><p>The rule of the Seven Martial Stars was unshakeable.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Mu had reason to be proud.</p><p></p><p>With the revival of the immortal way, they had already grasped quite a bit of information about it.</p><p></p><p>To them, Qi Yuan was actually more like an unstable element.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

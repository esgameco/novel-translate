        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Deep within the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced woman let out a sigh of relief. She looked at Yun He and said slowly, "Senior Brother, your injuries have finally healed almost completely."</p><p></p><p>Gratitude showed in Yun He's eyes: "Thank you, Junior Sister."</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, he had left the White Emperor's Palace and gone to the City of No Return, where he encountered the Demon Crocodile Ancestor. The two had battled fiercely.</p><p></p><p>He was severely injured.</p><p></p><p>In the City of Great Sorrow, he also sensed that a Great Supreme was plotting against him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there were at least three Great Supremes lying in wait in the City of Great Sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Severely wounded, he used a secret technique passed down by his master the White Emperor to escape from the City of Great Sorrow and return to the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned, he fell into a coma. His Second Junior Sister had been treating him in seclusion deep within the White Emperor's Palace all these years.</p><p></p><p>His injuries had finally started to improve.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how dare they use the City of No Return to plot against you, Senior Brother. The Lord of the City of No Return is so audacious!" the baby-faced woman said angrily.</p><p></p><p>For so many years, she had been treating Senior Brother's injuries without leaving the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>She was truly angry about the plot against the Senior Brother of the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Twenty years later, Senior Brother was supposed to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to help the White Emperor fight against the Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>Yun He also felt a sense of fear when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>The other side had used the Fate Stone Tablet as bait, and nearly killed him.</p><p></p><p>However, now was not the time to consider these things. Yun He's eyes held a worried look: "More than ten years have passed. I wonder how many cities are left in the South in the current North-South Decision?"</p><p></p><p>This was something Yun He had always been concerned about.</p><p></p><p>There was a battlefield within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, and another battlefield in the North-South Decision.</p><p></p><p>Both battlefields were crucial.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Senior Brother. Elder White Crane is outside and will surely protect the South without worry," the baby-faced woman advised.</p><p></p><p>White Crane was the White Emperor's spirit pet, with strength already at the level of a Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Yun He nodded, "I wonder how Master is faring within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons."</p><p></p><p>The crisis in the South was nothing compared to the crisis within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, suddenly a loud voice rang out, shaking the heavens, and penetrated into the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"The Guardian of the City of No Return and the Blood Lord of the Blood Palace have come to visit the White Emperor's Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was resounding, reaching every corner of the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>The two Supremes guarding the gates of the White Emperor's Palace trembled when they heard the voice: "Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Who didn't know of the Blood Lord's reputation? He was the assassin of Supremes! It was rumored that three Great Supremes had joined forces with one thousand seven hundred Supremes to surround and attack the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord remained unperturbed, with a hundred-piece orchestra playing suona horns, he fought alone! When he unleashed his Origin Divine Ability, the heart demons of one thousand seven hundred Supremes burst out of their bodies, causing them to perish on the spot.</p><p></p><p>That was one thousand seven hundred Supremes, probably... about the same number as all the Supremes in the South?</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to him single-handedly slaughtering all the Supremes in the entire South.</p><p></p><p>The entire White Emperor's Palace was filled with unease, not knowing why that terrifying Blood Lord had come here.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a calm and leisurely voice came, faintly carrying dissatisfaction: "Guardian of the City of No Return, what brings you to my White Emperor's Palace?</p><p></p><p>You plotted against my Senior Brother before, and now you dare to come to my White Emperor's Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced woman walked out of the secret chamber and flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Back then when Senior Brother was plotted against, resulting in years of treatment for his injuries, she had also been quite angry! Yun He looked at his Junior Sister in the sky standing up for him, feeling both helpless and gratified.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a white crane flapping its wings flew over, extending a snow-white hand to cover the baby-faced woman's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, Xiao Lian, how can you speak to the Blood Lord of the Blood Palace like that!" The white crane transformed into a petite young girl, lecturing Xiao Lian in an old-fashioned manner, "The Blood Lord of the Blood Palace is my godfather!"</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced woman was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Yun He was also completely stunned!</p><p></p><p>It was true that White Crane was the White Emperor's spirit pet, but she had only been willing to follow the White Emperor after being subdued by him.</p><p></p><p>This White Crane had always been proud and looked down on others.</p><p></p><p>How did she suddenly have a godfather?</p><p></p><p>And it was that obscure Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Blood Lord of the Blood Palace is the number one Supreme in the Flowing Wind Realm. He has now unified ten thousand eight hundred cities, and the people of the Blood Palace have already swept through to the Endless Blood Sea.</p><p></p><p>All of the North is under the rule of the Blood Palace!" the young White Crane girl said proudly, very smug, "Even the White Emperor has to be respectful when meeting the Blood Lord of the Blood Palace. Hurry up and come with me to welcome the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Yun He and the baby-faced girl looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>What had they just heard? The North had been swept through by the Blood Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?" the baby-faced woman hurriedly asked via voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true, how could I lie to you? Now all the Supremes of the South and North serve the Blood Lord as their master!"</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the three had already arrived outside the White Emperor's Palace and saw the legendary Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so Supremes inside the White Emperor's Palace secretly looked at the Blood Lord, with fear and admiration in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, what the White Emperor had failed to accomplish had been achieved by a recently risen Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, you're here!" The young White Crane girl's face was full of smiles, "Just now this person dared to mock you verbally, but I've already taught her a lesson. Godfather is magnanimous, please don't lower yourself to the level of children!"</p><p></p><p>In her words, she referred to the thousand-year-old baby-faced woman as a child, which wasn't inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>Yun He looked at Qi Yuan, still feeling a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>When he saw with his own eyes the young White Crane girl calling that extremely young-looking Blood Lord "godfather", he knew that the White Crane girl hadn't been lying to them earlier.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at White Crane: "I'm not your godfather, and I don't have a daughter as big as you."</p><p></p><p>He felt that all of Bai Ze's disciples were a bit shameless.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't the first time someone wanted to recognize him as their godfather.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan looked at Yun He, his gaze calm: "You are Bai Ze's disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Yun He answered seriously, feeling a bit upset that someone had called his master by name.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons? I want to know all the details about what's inside!" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He had come to the White Emperor's Palace to learn about the situation with the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun He hesitated, then heard the young White Crane girl say impatiently: "Don't be so wishy-washy, hurry up and tell godfather about the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons. Maybe if godfather is in a good mood, he'll enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and help that fool... your master once."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun He slowly said: "The Gate of Ten Thousand Demons is located at the End of the World."</p><p></p><p>"It's not at the End of the World," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He had already been to the End of the World once.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Ten Thousand Demons will open again in twenty years. Only then can it be seen!" Yun He said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became slightly solemn: "Is there no other way?"</p><p></p><p>Twenty years was a bit long.</p><p></p><p>"No," Yun He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and tell my godfather about the situation inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons!" the young White Crane girl said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Yun He had no choice but to quickly explain...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, there is a space-time rift that leads to the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One controls the passage to the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons, and cooperates with the powerful beings there, coveting our Flowing Wind Realm."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the baby-faced woman also looked angry.</p><p></p><p>"To resist the invasion from the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons, Master's true form, leading a hundred Great Supreme Beings, has been guarding the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons!" Yun He said, with a desolate expression.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the battles at the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons have been no less intense than the North-South Conflict.</p><p></p><p>In the North-South Conflict, those who died were low-level combatants, but at the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, those who died were high-level combatants.</p><p></p><p>"How powerful is the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons, and what about the Venerable One?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had added another person to his little notebook - the Venerable One, Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Ten Thousand Demons has quite a few enemies..." Yun He said, his face looking a bit sour.</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced woman also looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>Whether in terms of high-end or mid-level combat strength, the Venerable One allied with the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons was more powerful than the White Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Many?" Qi Yuan asked with some apprehension, "How many?"</p><p></p><p>Yun He said with a heavy expression: "Great Supreme Beings, over a hundred... all from the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>"Not that many more compared to the Southern Lands," Qi Yuan said, though he was still puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The number of powerful beings in this world was really... unbalanced.</p><p></p><p>This ratio had some issues.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Heavenly Dao of this world was urgently cultivating powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>"But the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons has supported the Venerable One with... nearly ten thousand Supreme Being level experts," Yun He said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"How many did you say?" Qi Yuan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun He immediately understood that the Blood Palace Lord was shocked by the numbers.</p><p></p><p>After all, when he first heard about this number of Supreme Beings, he also thought the Flowing Wind Realm was in danger.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the South and North had been in constant conflict.</p><p></p><p>"Close to ten thousand, maybe even more," Yun He repeated.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Qi Yuan said, his heart settling.</p><p></p><p>Just this?</p><p></p><p>Just this?</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even given his grand lecture yet!</p><p></p><p>But remembering something, he couldn't help but ask: "With such a big gap between South and North, how have they been able to hold them off for so long?"</p><p></p><p>"Because Master... obtained a heaven-bestowed treasure, the Heartless Lotus.</p><p></p><p>When the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons invaded, Master led the resistance and received this treasure bestowed by the heavens, barely managing to hold on."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "This Heavenly Dao fellow can even send treasures?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter... is unknown," Yun He hesitated, after all, matters involving the Heavenly Dao were not something a Great Supreme Being like him could pry into.</p><p></p><p>"Well well!" Qi Yuan was delighted, putting his hands on his hips and looking at the sky, "I work so hard, establishing a demon factory, personally working for you to clean up trash like demons. And you don't pay me a single wage?"</p><p></p><p>Yun He and the baby-faced woman looked at each other, not quite understanding the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sky, getting angrier the more he looked: "Wasn't it you who kept sending wives to lure me here? Would I have come to work for you otherwise?</p><p></p><p>Fine, I came to work, and now you're exploiting me?"</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor Palace was completely silent, with only the sound of the Blood Lord's grumbling.</p><p></p><p>Those Supreme Beings looking at Qi Yuan wanted to laugh but didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>They gained a new understanding of the Blood Lord's madness.</p><p></p><p>"You were so enthusiastic towards me before, and now you're cold and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>You think you're Bull Demon King and I'm Princess Iron Fan?"</p><p></p><p>"My demands aren't high, give me a golden core, otherwise, I'll refine you into my golden core!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, my golden core must be... big, at least... not smaller than you, and if it's smaller it can't be too much smaller!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly made an outrageous demand.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had been working diligently in the Flowing Wind Realm for so many years without any pay, shouldn't he extort something?</p><p></p><p>He had already decided, he needed to form a large golden core.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he couldn't take down the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Stop pretending, you've already given treasures to Baize, how can you not give to me?" Qi Yuan looked at the sky and made another threat, "Don't force me to... swallow you!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this part of heaven and earth seemed to tremble.</p><p></p><p>As if the heaven and earth were frightened by Qi Yuan's threat.</p><p></p><p>Yun He and the white crane girl present were both stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, they also seemed to sense that heaven and earth trembled.</p><p></p><p>Was it an illusion? The two looked at each other, both developing strange ideas in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Could this Blood Palace Lord really be talking to the heavens?</p><p></p><p>After the trembling of heaven and earth ended, Qi Yuan smiled: "That's more like it."</p><p></p><p>This time, he was full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the golden core path was right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Swallow a golden core into the belly, only then do I know my fate is not controlled by heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was already imagining the scene of swallowing the golden core and becoming a true immortal with a primordial core.</p><p></p><p>At that time, in the entire Divine Light Sect, which of the five peak leaders wouldn't follow him?</p><p></p><p>He could also graduate from village-level cultivation and officially join the county-level high school.</p><p></p><p>This time, skipping the township level directly!</p><p></p><p>This is the power of a world-class golden core!</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, his face suddenly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"What if the golden core is too big and I can't swallow it?"</p><p></p><p>"Is lubricant effective?"</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>In the White Emperor Palace, a trembling voice broke through the sky!</p><p></p><p>Yun He widened his eyes: "What did you say, there are thirty thousand Supreme Beings in the Blood Palace!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>There was a complex look in He Wu's eyes: "Big Dog, do you think Master is really the Great Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi's face looked a bit unpleasant: "My name is Ling Yayi now, not Nangong Big Dog!"</p><p></p><p>The former Thirteen Demons of the North all knew about their past.</p><p></p><p>"Big Dog still sounds more smooth."</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi glared at He Wu, his expression also becoming solemn: "The scenes in the illusion... were indeed the Great Demon's past."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Wu fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In the illusion, the blood-robed figure slaughtered countless lives.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was something that really happened.</p><p></p><p>However, that master was the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao dying together with the Blood Lord was false.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Woman... had been accompanying the Great Demon, killing together.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Great Demon and Demon Woman were inextricably linked to the current miserable state of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl is not the Great Demon!" Ning Tao's firm voice came, she was wearing a black dress, with the character for "demon" still carved on her left cheek.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Wu's gaze hesitated, then became firm: "Master is not, even if he is... so what? Our enemy has always been Shang Yanran and the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that nine-tailed fox Shang Yanran, I think she's the real Great Demon!" Ling Yayi also said with dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

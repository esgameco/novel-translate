        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I have to say, the feeling of using connections for the first time was quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Now, the great Wind Orchid had passed the information up.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Heaven and Earth Cave, a gust of gloomy wind howled angrily. </p><p></p><p>A tall man stood outside the cave entrance, his face full of reverence. He said angrily: "This Blood Robe Sword God is really too much. He killed Mir without reason, spouted nonsense at the Divine Flower Meeting, and provoked the Venerable One. Isn't it just because he has Venerable Wind Lord as his backing? Now he even dares to interfere with the Eastern Land Genius Battle and wants to directly obtain a spot. He really doesn't take the three Venerable Ones seriously!"</p><p></p><p>The tall man was a great cultivator at the late Purple Palace stage, who had always served Venerable Yiqiong.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Wind Orchid's message, he was furious.</p><p></p><p>In the Heaven and Earth Cave, gusts of gloomy wind blew.</p><p></p><p>A childish voice came: "What do you think should be done?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the tall man frowned in thought: "First, there's Wind Lord. Second, the great calamity is approaching. The Venerable Ones need to preserve their strength and can't act against the Blood Robe Sword God."</p><p></p><p>He was pondering how to deal with the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking for a while, he couldn't figure out what to do about the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they really had to let the Blood Robe Sword God succeed, disrupt the Eastern Land Genius Battle, and enter the Wangyue Continent? Suddenly, the tall man's brows twitched and his eyes lit up with joy: "Just let him obtain a spot in the top 20 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God is definitely doing this to enter the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent is broken, and its powerful beings have fallen. Not only do we from the Canglan Realm have designs on them, but the Moluo Clan does as well.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo Clan has left behind a supreme treasure that can sense any cultivator at the Fifth Realm or above.</p><p></p><p>Once the Blood Robe Sword God enters the Wangyue Continent, he will definitely be discovered by the Moluo Clan. With the Moluo Clan's arrogant and unruly nature, they will certainly kill the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God will certainly perish upon entering the Wangyue Continent!"</p><p></p><p>The current Wangyue Continent was in a three-way standoff.</p><p></p><p>The weakest were naturally the natives of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The strongest was the Moluo Clan.</p><p></p><p>Even the three Venerable Ones were extremely wary of the Yin God of the Moluo Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God entering the Wangyue Continent would be like a lamb entering a tiger's den.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence in the Heaven and Earth Cave. After a long while, the childish voice came again: "Let everything be as you said."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the tall man's eyes were filled with pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this time, another childish voice came from the Heaven and Earth Cave.</p><p></p><p>"If convenient, investigate his background."</p><p></p><p>"Based on the clues obtained so far, we can basically determine that the Blood Robe Sword God, the Mad Daoist, and the Seven Desires Demon Lord are one and the same person.</p><p></p><p>They all came from the remote Hundred Countries." The tall man lowered his head to report, "No more information could be found. According to this subordinate's speculation, the Blood Robe Sword God may... not be a being from the Canglan Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Cave fell silent again, with only the howling of the gloomy wind audible.</p><p></p><p>"Investigate which other members of the Divine Flower Meeting are from the Hundred Countries."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the childish voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" The tall man bowed his head, but a troubled expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>This matter would be difficult to investigate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Cloud City, Wind Orchid sat on pins and needles, but kept a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blood Robe Sword God, why are you so obsessed with entering the Wangyue Continent? It would be better to casually join some forces of geniuses and obtain the qualification to develop territory in the Wangyue Continent."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan said lazily: "The Wangyue Continent is my home, I need to go back."</p><p></p><p>He had taken the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent to build his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Wangyue Continent his home now? Hearing this, Wind Orchid laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>The power level of the Wangyue Continent was not high enough to support a powerful expert like the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, he thought the Blood Robe Sword God was joking.</p><p></p><p>"When I enter the top 20, when will I be qualified to enter the Wangyue Continent? I'm in a hurry." Qi Yuan was eager to enter the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if that Wangyue Continent was the world he had once stayed in.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to know if there was a chance to see again the woman he had never met before.</p><p></p><p>"After the Eastern Land Genius Battle ends, the entrance to the Wangyue Continent will open briefly. Senior can enter at that time."</p><p></p><p>"Good." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wind Orchid's communication jade slip suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes stared at him: "A message came?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid was a bit nervous and didn't dare to look.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that the Venerable Ones above would have a big reaction, not only disagreeing with the Blood Robe Sword God, but also being arrogant and angering the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God wouldn't dare to kill a Venerable One, but he would dare to kill him! His divine sense entered the jade slip, and his eyes revealed a look of pleasant surprise: "Blood Robe Sword God, those above have already agreed to let you obtain a spot in the top 20 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings without testing, and also obtain the qualification to enter the Wangyue Continent."</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was just afraid that those above wouldn't agree to this matter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled broadly: "Those above you are quite tolerant and magnanimous. When they have time, I'll treat them to a meal."</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>He definitely wouldn't pass these words up to those above.</p><p></p><p>He knew about the incident where the Blood Robe Sword God had provoked Venerable Yiqiong at the Divine Flower Meeting some time ago.</p><p></p><p>If the two were to meet, there would certainly be a fight.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've entered the top 20 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings, do I have a chance to choose the rewards for geniuses?" Qi Yuan looked at Wind Orchid and asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remembered the Sect Master's instructions very clearly.</p><p></p><p>Great Cultivator Wind Orchid was stunned for a moment, suspecting that there was something wrong with his ears.</p><p></p><p>The top 100 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings indeed had rewards.</p><p></p><p>The rewarded treasures were mostly some powerful divine infant magical treasures.</p><p></p><p>For young geniuses, they had some use, but what use were they for a powerful expert like the Blood Robe Sword God? "Of course." Though puzzled in his heart, Great Cultivator Wind Orchid didn't dare to hesitate. He waved his hand, and a storage bag flew from the depths of the palace into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God can choose any one or two of these magical treasures as you wish."</p><p></p><p>When the storage bag opened, a dazzling array of magical treasures appeared.</p><p></p><p>If it were Qi Yuan at the Qi Condensation realm, he would have been dazzled by these.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had reached the Fixed Star Golden Core, he didn't care for these.</p><p></p><p>He looked at that purple-gold small gourd: "This one... I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>This small gourd was the treasure that the Sect Master had instructed Qi Yuan to obtain.</p><p></p><p>"Senior truly has a good eye." Great Cultivator Wind Orchid carefully examined this small gourd and discovered its hidden secrets, "This gourd is actually a Purple Palace magical artifact."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Great Cultivator Wind Orchid regretted it.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary Purple Palace magical artifact wouldn't mean much to the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The fierce person who destroyed the Light Palace wouldn't lack these.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the usually quiet Cloud Courtyard Lord looked at the purple-gold gourd and boldly asked: "May I ask, Senior, do you have any connection with this gourd?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan looked at him and said, "This is a treasure from an elder's clan, now... it should return to its rightful owner."</p><p></p><p>"I see." The Cloud Courtyard Lord continued, "Could Senior leave a contact method?"</p><p></p><p>"This." Qi Yuan didn't refuse, and casually showed a Purple Palace communication jade slip to the Cloud Courtyard Lord.</p><p></p><p>"All the best. Courtyard Lord, Wind Orchid, Booger Immortal, farewell." Qi Yuan turned into a streak of blood and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wind Orchid breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Courtyard Lord's gaze was deep, lost in thought about something.</p><p></p><p>Wind Moon Immortal had a wronged expression, speechless.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the cave dwelling, Kong Fulu's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was still standing on the Bodhi tree, pondering cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Ya and called out: "I've successfully used connections, so I won't participate in the Eastern Land Genius Battle.</p><p></p><p>I'm going into closed cultivation for seven days to study cultivation techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan with a puzzled expression: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's strength, participating in the Eastern Land Genius Battle would indeed make him cannon fodder, so it was better not to participate.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan entered the cave dwelling, he hung another sign outside.</p><p></p><p>"In closed cultivation for seven days, do not disturb. Violators will be killed!"</p><p></p><p>Concerning the Dao of the Golden Core, he naturally took it seriously.</p><p></p><p>He even placed the kitchen knife and the blood-colored divine soul sword inside the door to guard.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Kong Fulu looked at the writing outside Qi Yuan's cave dwelling with a strange expression. He couldn't help but sigh: "Junior Brother's talent... is even stronger than mine. What a pity, if this Eastern Land Genius Battle hadn't been brought forward, he might really have had a chance to enter the top 100 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings and retrieve the Sect Master's clan treasure."</p><p></p><p>But now, Junior Brother hadn't even formed a Golden Core. Participating in the Eastern Land Genius Battle would be completely suicidal.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's expression was calm: "Let's go, the Eastern Land Genius Battle has begun."</p><p></p><p>The two turned into streaks of light and headed towards the depths of Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the mountains, a secret realm opened, light flowed in all directions, and the spiritual energy in the air also became abundant.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at the young geniuses ahead, her gaze also becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu frowned: "Sigh, my titles as the son-in-law of the Divine Light Sect Master and the closed-door disciple of the Five Light Peak Master won't be of much use here."</p><p></p><p>He sensed the auras of too many powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there were a lot he couldn't defeat.</p><p></p><p>His pride in being a first-grade Golden Core seemed ordinary here.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Junior Brother was right. If my Golden Core was bigger, I wouldn't feel so inferior."</p><p></p><p>He stood among the crowd, quite inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast voice entered everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>"For this Eastern Land Genius Battle, the rules have changed.</p><p></p><p>For the top 20, there are only 19 spots. Everyone... don't get it wrong."</p><p></p><p>All the geniuses who heard this had slight changes in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The top 20... only have 19 spots? What does that mean!"</p><p></p><p>"For such a grand event as the Eastern Land Genius Battle, someone actually blatantly used connections!"</p><p></p><p>"It's really despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"It's really enviable!"</p><p></p><p>The various geniuses discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Those who were originally ranked in the twenties had particularly ugly expressions. With one less spot, the competition pressure for them increased.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, which descendant of an Yin God is it, who doesn't dare to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle but uses backdoor connections instead!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kang Fulu was stunned. He looked at Jiang Ya and asked, "Did Qi Yuan say he went to use backdoor connections?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Jiang Ya nodded, with a strange expression. "He also said he was successful in using backdoor connections."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu fell silent, unable to understand in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Coincidence... or what? "It shouldn't be this little... young master, right?" Kang Fulu muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's over." </p><p></p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, cold sweat broke out on Qi Yuan's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Does this count as going astray?"</p><p></p><p>While continuing the techniques of the "Qi Yuan Scripture", Qi Yuan discovered that the techniques he had obtained were completely inadequate.</p><p></p><p>Because, some time ago, he had already decided that he wanted to pursue both the Golden Core Dao and the Divine Infant Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Core Dao was endless, with no end in sight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan estimated that to reach the end, his little sun would need to swallow up that entire universe at the very least.</p><p></p><p>That was still a long way off.</p><p></p><p>"So, the 'Qi Yuan Scripture' should be divided into the Fixed Star Golden Core Chapter and the Advanced Divine Infant Chapter."</p><p></p><p>The Fixed Star Golden Core Chapter would focus on strengthening the Sun's True Fire and devouring the stars.</p><p></p><p>The Advanced Divine Infant Chapter would be ordinary cultivation, ultimately entering the Divine Infant realm.</p><p></p><p>"If I enter the Divine Infant realm, wouldn't that mean I'm both a Yuan Dan cultivator and a Divine Infant cultivator?" Qi Yuan mumbled, feeling a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"The techniques are requiring more and more. I'm so poor!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Core part needed to create two techniques, naturally requiring even more techniques.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the sense of justice in his heart, and the fact that Qi Yuan was a law-abiding good citizen, he would have considered becoming a robber cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Moonlight, where are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, Venerable Ye Qiong, why can't you ambush me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The Ruhe Inn was much quieter.</p><p></p><p>Those people had all gone to the secret realm to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan took out the communication jade slip, his eyes showing a surprised expression: "The leader of the Cloud Palace?"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that while he was in seclusion cultivating, the leader of the Cloud Palace would send him a message.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, and he reappeared at the Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a blood-red robe, with an extraordinarily handsome appearance, he attracted many gazes as soon as he appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Palace Leader, what matter do you have for me?" Qi Yuan spoke, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>He sensed that in this Cloud Palace, there was actually one late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, seven mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators, and numerous early-stage Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that finally a moonlight had taken a liking to him and came to deliver techniques? These people were all high-quality old men of humanity.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, over thirty Purple Mansion cultivators came forward and bowed to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Among them was Qi Yuan's old acquaintance, Xu Yeli.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Xu Yeli pretended not to know Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These Purple Mansion cultivators could be said to be the top forces of Cuiyun Continent today, all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Any one of them going out could cause turmoil in a city or a country.</p><p></p><p>But facing Qi Yuan, there was only reverence in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the Cloud Palace Leader, his gaze calm: "What do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace Leader's strength was not the strongest among this group of Purple Mansion cultivators, but he seemed to be taking the lead at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you destroyed the Light Palace, removing a great harm for Cuiyun Continent! Now, Cuiyun Continent is without a leader, and we are willing to jointly recommend you as the head of Cuiyun Continent!" the Cloud Palace Leader said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>That late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator also lowered his head: "We are willing to recommend Senior as our leader."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was amused.</p><p></p><p>Is this asking him to be the leader of the martial world?</p><p></p><p>"I like things simple and direct, don't beat around the bush," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>A group of Purple Mansion cultivators recommending him as their leader was equivalent to finding a father to manage themselves.</p><p></p><p>If there weren't special circumstances, who would be willing to do this?</p><p></p><p>Then, that late-stage Purple Mansion powerhouse came forward and said, "Senior, do you know that a great calamity is approaching?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Bullshit great calamity, he had only heard the Cloud Palace Leader mention it, but he didn't know exactly what it was.</p><p></p><p>Probably these Purple Mansion cultivators didn't know clearly what it was either; only Yin Gods would know.</p><p></p><p>"In a few hundred years, a great calamity will come, and the world may fall into disaster.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators will be in danger. Even though we are Purple Mansion cultivators, in the great calamity, we will only be living from day to day.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that the Light Palace started the Hundred Nations Blood Battle, wanting to fully repair the Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown to reduce the impact of the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Only power at the level of Yin Gods has a slight possibility of resisting the great calamity, allowing us to barely survive."</p><p></p><p>"So, you want me to... protect you?" Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown was gone, the Light Palace was gone.</p><p></p><p>Cuiyun Continent's Yin God foundation was gone.</p><p></p><p>Facing that vague great calamity, Cuiyun Continent had no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>So, these Purple Mansion cultivators all came to seek refuge with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had destroyed the Light Palace and had the foundation of a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the late-stage Purple Mansion powerhouse spoke.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Qi Yuan with reverence.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion powerhouse continued, "We are willing to form the Blood Robe Alliance and recommend Senior as the alliance leader.</p><p></p><p>We are willing to be at Senior's disposal!</p><p></p><p>Whatever Senior wants to do, we are willing to be Senior's arms and legs.</p><p></p><p>If Senior needs magical treasures, techniques, or precious items, we can find them all for Senior."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's gaze was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit, he was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>Because he did indeed need techniques.</p><p></p><p>And having these Purple Mansion old men help him find techniques would be much more convenient than looking for them himself.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if he became the righteous leader of Cuiyun Continent, wouldn't all the techniques in Cuiyun Continent be his?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Cloud Palace Leader stepped forward: "Senior, please look, who is this?"</p><p></p><p>With the Cloud Palace Leader's words, an old man with a weak aura was brought onto the scene.</p><p></p><p>There was fear in the old man's eyes, along with a hint of resentment.</p><p></p><p>This old man's aura was actually that of a Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "I don't know him."</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace Leader continued, "Some time ago, Senior was entrusted by an elder to take the Purple Gold Gourd.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Gold Gourd came from Hong Lian's clan.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years ago, the old scoundrel Hong Lian took a liking to the Holy Empress of the Wood Clan and wanted to take her as a concubine.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Empress of the Wood Clan would rather die than submit and hanged herself.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the old scoundrel Hong Lian was furious and embarrassed, and slaughtered the entire Wood Clan, with only one or two people escaping!</p><p></p><p>The Purple Gold Gourd was obtained by Hong Lian from the Wood Clan.</p><p></p><p>Senior's elder should be a member of the Wood Clan.</p><p></p><p>We have captured the old scoundrel Hong Lian, and he is at Senior's disposal!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Lian looked at the Cloud Palace Leader, his eyes full of anger: "I have already sought refuge with the Water Immortal Continent. By capturing me, do you want to go to war with the Water Immortal Continent?"</p><p></p><p>The Water Immortal Continent, adjacent to Cuiyun Continent, was slightly stronger than Cuiyun Continent with its Light Palace, but not by much.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Hong Lian.</p><p></p><p>He understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This should be the clan-destroying enemy of the Sect Master and Elder Xuan Chong, right? Back then, the ill-tempered Elder Xuan Chong had shown him quite some care.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Hong Lian with a smile on his face: "If all the Purple Mansion cultivators in the Water Immortal Continent are like you, what's wrong with going to war?"</p><p></p><p>He would love to have more moonlights.</p><p></p><p>That late-stage Purple Mansion powerhouse laughed awkwardly, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan spoke: "Since that's the case, I'll be the leader of Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>As for you, you need to collect techniques for me, the more the better."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, these Purple Mansion cultivators all smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God had agreed, and the stone in their hearts fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't be alone and helpless in the face of the great calamity hundreds of years later.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan spoke again: "Xu Yeli, and you, I have a task for you."</p><p></p><p>That Purple Mansion powerhouse's face tightened: "At your command, Senior can call me Meishan."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you two, take Hong Lian to..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over the Purple Mansion cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>They all tactfully left.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Qi Yuan continue: "The Great Shang and Divine Light Sect, hand them over to the Withered Wood True Lord."</p><p></p><p>Meishan and Xu Yeli's faces tightened: "As you command."</p><p></p><p>Knowing such a secret matter, they knew that their ties with the Blood-Robed Sword God could no longer be severed.</p><p></p><p>"This Purple Gold Gourd, give it to him as well," Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Purple Gold Gourd, he had left a trace of his origin divine ability, along with a wisp of the Sun's True Fire.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of these two having any ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only Meishan, Xu Yeli, and Hong Lian were left.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli looked at Meishan, his eyes showing a puzzled expression: "Senior, I'm actually very curious, why did you choose the Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli had only recently learned about the approaching great calamity.</p><p></p><p>He only then realized how close they, this group of Purple Mansion cultivators, were to death.</p><p></p><p>"You mean to say, the Blood-Robed Sword God has offended Venerable Ye Qiong and won't live long?" Meishan spoke, his voice desolate.</p><p></p><p>"No... that's not what this junior meant."</p><p></p><p>"Other than the Blood-Robed Sword God, do we have any other options?</p><p></p><p>We can only hope that Venerable Ye Qiong, considering the great calamity, won't make a move against our alliance leader in these few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way, under the protection of our alliance leader, when the great calamity descends in a few hundred years, will we have a chance to survive."</p><p></p><p>PS: I'm not in good condition, so I'm taking a day off. There won't be an update at 6 AM tomorrow, I sincerely apologize.</p><p></p><p>How about starting from tomorrow, I'll post two chapters around 6 AM every day (the time might change, I'll gradually adjust to a normal schedule), and not post at midnight? This way everyone can read together when they wake up.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the palace.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun sat in the main seat, and the fragrant smoke from the red dust drifted past his face, making his expression indistinct.</p><p></p><p>The sect master of Xuanfeng Mountain, Kuangjian Zhenjun, squinted his eyes: "Dead, the soul-nurturing flower has been taken by Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Below, Elder Li Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fuluo also did the same, and he added: "It seems that Qi Yuan's disciple has slain them and taken the soul-nurturing flowers, around three hundred of them."</p><p></p><p>After returning from the Tianlong Immortal Realm, Li Xiao and Kang Fuluo had come to see the sect master without delay, informing him of the events that had occurred in the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred red demon soldiers, there must be at least a hundred Foundation Establishment elixirs..." Kuangjian Zhenjun's words were not finished.</p><p></p><p>This news was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>Even if they placed a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, they would not be able to accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan, he was just at the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Red Sword Gate did not plant the red demon seeds in these soldiers?" The Empress of the Great Luo Empire, in a light purple phoenix robe, had a hint of suspicion on her fair jade-like face.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, it can be explained... but without the red demon seeds, how will the old emperor's grand plan succeed?" Kuangjian Zhenjun spoke, voicing his own doubts.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun sat upright on the main seat, silent all along, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally sighed: "Has the method to enter the Sunken Coffin Realm not been found yet?</p><p></p><p>If it is found, everything will be known."</p><p></p><p>Elder Li Xiao shook his head: "This matter is likely only known to the Red Sword Gate and the deceased old emperor."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Red Sword Gate, the hearts of those present grew heavy.</p><p></p><p>That was a formidable existence, with a terrifying Violet Palace Grandmaster stationed within.</p><p></p><p>The Violet Palace and the Divine Infant were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>The Violet Palace could already begin to analyze the essence of spiritual energy and unleash primal power.</p><p></p><p>The primal power was terrifyingly powerful, and Nascent Soul cultivators could not evade it, only endure it.</p><p></p><p>If a Violet Palace Grandmaster were to come to the Shenguang Sect, all the Nascent Soul cultivators of the sect, even if they joined forces, would likely be defeated by the Violet Palace Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>If five or six late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators could still contend with an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But five or six Nascent Soul cultivators who had not yet touched the primal source, when faced with a Violet Palace Grandmaster, could only admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Sword Gate is a bit distant from the Great Luo Cultivation World, and they also have enemies, the Violet Palace Grandmaster may not dare to leave the sect, so there is no need to worry," Kumuzhenjun's words dispelled the worries in the hearts of the others.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kang Fuluo said, "The Bright Palace's Baolong should also have perished in the Tianlong Immortal Realm, I don't know if he was... killed by someone."</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun looked at his son-in-law and said, "If you have any thoughts, feel free to share them."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fuluo continued, "Moyu Gate's Lu Fei and Liu Xing were both killed by Baolong. The old emperor and his soldiers were slain by Qi Yuan's disciple.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, the Bright Palace's Zhu Lianhua had sent a invitation to the Seven-Colored Peak, but was rejected.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Zhu Lianhua's corpse was found near the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, Baolong has perished in the Tianlong Immortal Realm, and it is likely also related to Qi Yuan's disciple."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fuluo spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his heart was not calm at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had witnessed Baolong's formidable strength, which was comparable to an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Condensation stage, how interesting." A flash of sharpness appeared in Kuangjian Zhenjun's eyes, "Could it be that the one from the Seven-Colored Peak, as the rumors say, is truly a hidden Violet Palace cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Although the common cultivators of the Great Luo Empire all believed that Ren Yixi was a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of Kuangjian Zhenjun and Kumuzhenjun, Ren Yixi was even more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was an injured Violet Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If he was a Violet Palace cultivator, he could have bestowed some primal power to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Everything would make sense then.</p><p></p><p>"This matter need not be mentioned further," Kumuzhenjun concluded the discussion.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Kumuzhenjun's words, the others present also acquiesced.</p><p></p><p>Since the matter had ended, the crowd took their leave one by one.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, only Kumuzhenjun and the dignified and beautiful Empress of the Great Luo remained.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun stood up, walking to the Empress's back, his hand embracing her waist, feeling the warm and plump body of the mature woman, and he said, "Muyou, you've worked hard."</p><p></p><p>The Empress of the Great Luo, with her phoenix-like eyes and charming appearance, replied, "If it weren't for you back then, I would have already perished, what hardship is there?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kumuzhenjun thought of something, and he whispered, "You say Qi Yuan slew Baolong and those soldiers, was it with the treasures bestowed by Ren Yixi, or by his own strength?"</p><p></p><p>The Empress, upon hearing this, had a pained expression in her elegant and dignified eyes, as if she was lost in memories. "Have you not given up?"</p><p></p><p>A fierce aura emanated from Kumuzhenjun's eyes: "How can I forget, my clansmen, all died at their hands.</p><p></p><p>I must cultivate an unparalleled genius, at least among the top hundred of the Eastern Land Genius Ranking, only then do I have a chance to reclaim the things left behind by my clansmen! Fuluo has worked hard, but his talent... is limited, barely able to touch the Minor Genius Ranking, let alone the top hundred of the Genius Ranking."</p><p></p><p>The Empress, upon hearing this, did not try to dissuade him further: "This matter requires caution, we cannot decide hastily."</p><p></p><p>"So, I will send people to enter the Tianlong Immortal Realm, to see what exactly happened in the Sunken Coffin Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it was indeed Qi Yuan's doing, he is worthy of my investment!" Kumuzhenjun had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>In a small place like the Great Luo Empire, the chance of encountering an unparalleled genius was truly too low.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The wooden token fell with a crisp sound, like mountain spring water hitting the rocks.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly awoke: "Xiaojia?"</p><p></p><p>He looked around, and saw that the originally deeply sleeping Xiaojia seemed to have regained some consciousness.</p><p></p><p>She did not make any significant movements, only tightly clutching Qi Yuan's sleeve, timidly.</p><p></p><p>A touch of tenderness flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p></p><p>What he saw was Xiaojia, who seemed ready to awaken at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect her to wake up so soon.</p><p></p><p>Was there some change in the situation? </p><p></p><p>Or was it that being with him, Xiaojia would gradually recover? Or were there other unknown reasons?</p><p></p><p>[Xiaojia, the Empress of the Bridal Robe, is also your wife. Now, she is in a semi-awakened state, and may fully awaken in about six days.]</p><p></p><p>Knowing this news, Qi Yuan felt somewhat excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Xiaojia was going to wake up, and this was a good thing, right?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tightly embraced Xiaojia.</p><p></p><p>However, the Xiaojia who had just cuddled up to him seemed to have exhausted all her strength, and had fallen back into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes to burn an incense stick passed.</p><p></p><p>Xiaojia disappeared from Qi Yuan's embrace, and a trace of the bridal robe appeared on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked out of his room.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The door. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> Now, the formula for the Divided Soul Pill has been obtained, the main material, the Soul Remembrance Flower, has been obtained, and the other spiritual medicines are not rare.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to go to the Divine Medicine Peak and seek the help of a physician to refine the pill.</p><p></p><p>In the immortal cultivation world of the Great Merchant Kingdom, physicians are a combination of pharmacists and alchemists.</p><p></p><p>They not only know how to treat people, but also how to refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that the Divine Medicine Peak is the wealthiest among the peaks of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>This peak also has the most junior disciples.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan stepped into the Divine Medicine Peak, a beautiful female disciple cultivating qi came up to him: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, why have you come to our Divine Medicine Peak? Have you suffered some injuries? This junior sister is proficient in various medical arts and can treat you for free."</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Medicine Peak, the junior disciples are also divided into different levels. A beautiful woman like this would be assigned light tasks, such as reception, and could occasionally earn some extra income.</p><p></p><p>For these junior disciples, the most important thing is to have keen eyesight and to be familiar with the important figures of the sect. Otherwise, it would be embarrassing to turn away a major figure.</p><p></p><p>Facing the implicit suggestion in the beautiful woman's words, Qi Yuan said, "Thank you, junior sister, for your kindness. I need to find an elder to refine an elixir. Do you know which elder is currently free?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a trace of disappointment flashed in the beautiful woman's eyes. The opportunities in the immortal cultivation world are limited, and one must seize them when they arise.</p><p></p><p>However, she quickly said, "There are four elders currently free, namely Elder White Crane, Elder Xuan Chong..."</p><p></p><p>She told Qi Yuan the details about the four elders.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xuan Chong," Qi Yuan made a judgment, "Please lead the way, junior sister."</p><p></p><p>Towards his fellow disciples, Qi Yuan was still polite and gentlemanly.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman then led Qi Yuan towards the Divine Medicine Peak, while explaining some information about Elder Xuan Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xuan Chong is not originally from the Great Merchant Kingdom, but is an outsider cultivator who was brought back by the sect master. He is the second-best physician on the Divine Medicine Peak, after the peak master."</p><p></p><p>After looking around to ensure no one was listening, she leaned in and whispered to Qi Yuan, "But this elder... has a bit of a temper. I heard that once, a direct disciple went to him to refine a medicinal liquid, but accidentally said the liquid smelled a bit foul, and was immediately beaten and had his leg broken by the elder."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm," Qi Yuan felt it was nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>Powerful people often have some quirks. Which of the Four Divine Flower Emperors, except for him, didn't have a problem with their head? Yet they were still top-tier geniuses. Where was he in comparison, still wandering at the village level after so long.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the beautiful woman's lead, Qi Yuan arrived outside Elder Xuan Chong's cave dwelling, and the two waited quietly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the woman and softly said, "You should have a water-attributed spiritual root. Recently, too much contact with fire crystals has caused your spiritual energy to become chaotic. Eating some cool-natured foods can help resolve this."</p><p></p><p>Towards his fellow disciples, Qi Yuan was truly gentle. After all, she had been his free tour guide, so occasionally offering a bit of advice was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>The woman was initially stunned, then a look of delight appeared on her face: "Thank you, Senior Brother Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>She had indeed been feeling issues with her cultivation recently, but didn't know the reason.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a shrill voice came from within the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"How did you discern that?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Elder Xuan Chong, who had emerged from the cave.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman tactfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the cave and immediately sensed a dense wood-attributed spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong's face was covered in soot, and there was a broken alchemy furnace in front of him, indicating that the pill refining had failed and the furnace had exploded.</p><p></p><p>"I saw it with my eyes," Qi Yuan, who cultivated the five elements, was especially sensitive to the five elements.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Chong looked at Qi Yuan, a flash of brilliance in his eyes. He casually asked, "I heard you killed the Broken Wolf in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it wasn't me. How could I dare offend someone from the Radiant Palace?" Qi Yuan quickly denied it.</p><p></p><p>A disappointed look flashed across Xuan Chong's eyes, and he then asked, "Was it you who killed the old emperor and his death squad?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Qi Yuan did not hide this, as the old emperor was already dead, and there was probably no one behind him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had obtained the Soul Remembrance Flower, which was no secret. If someone investigated, they would know about it.</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell this old man how you killed them?" Xuan Chong looked at Qi Yuan with amazement.</p><p></p><p>"I just hacked them to death one by one."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Chong stared at Qi Yuan, then suddenly burst out laughing: "This old man believes you."</p><p></p><p>"What do you need to refine?"</p><p></p><p>"The Divided Soul Pill," Qi Yuan said, taking out the formula and the Soul Remembrance Flower.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Chong took the formula, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes: "This is slightly different from the formula I've seen before."</p><p></p><p>"I've improved it. Elder, please refine it with this," Qi Yuan was a bit surprised that Xuan Chong had seen the original formula.</p><p></p><p>It seems this old man's background and origins were not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But so what? The Divine Light Sect was full of loopholes anyway.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Chong looked at the formula, took the Soul Remembrance Flower, and said, "The other materials can all be found on the Divine Medicine Peak, except for the Mysterious Chicken Feather, which you'll need to go to the market and buy."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "I wonder how much the materials and labor for refining this elixir will cost in spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Free, no spirit stones needed," Xuan Chong's voice became shrill, and he forced a benevolent smile, though it looked a bit creepy.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Qi Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Because you are a disciple the sect master is focusing on cultivating," Xuan Chong chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt utterly bewildered.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xuan Chong took out a gourd from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"I have a few Divided Soul Pills here. Take what you need."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the gourd and saw that it did indeed contain Divided Soul Pills.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the beautiful woman's words. Who said Elder Xuan Chong had a bad temper?</p><p></p><p>He's practically a great benefactor! "Elder Xuan Chong, I'll take the elixir, and in the future, I'll hold your funeral!" Qi Yuan was in dire need of Divided Soul Pills.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was some scheme behind it from Xuan Chong, so what? He's not going to miss out on a good deal.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite an interesting fellow," Xuan Chong, hearing the mention of the funeral, did not get angry. "Go buy the Mysterious Chicken Feather, and I'll refine the pill for you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Qi Yuan left the cave dwelling, disappearing in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>In the cave, Xuan Chong looked at the Soul Remembrance Flower, his expression shifting between light and dark. At this moment, a spatial disturbance occurred, and the Withered Wood True Lord appeared in the cave.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

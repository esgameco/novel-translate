        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately at this moment, the demon had already entered his heart.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had recovered to the level of a Great Supreme, and his fundamental divine abilities were once again flawless and complete.</p><p></p><p>However, the heart demon had already appeared, like a wildfire that was impossible to extinguish.</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist's face was contorted in fear as he looked at Qi Yuan: "What did you do?!"</p><p></p><p>He simply couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The heart demon was devouring his body. At this moment, all of his fundamental divine abilities were being used for defense, and it still wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>"What did I do? I don't remember," Qi Yuan glanced at Purple Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan, who was watching this scene from not far away, found Qi Yuan even more bewildering and confusing when facing him.</p><p></p><p>He had just seen Qi Yuan use some words to fool Purple Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Then Purple Supreme inexplicably had his heart demon break out.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know the reason, but found it extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan wondered if he should pierce his own ears.</p><p></p><p>In case one day he heard Qi Yuan's words and also had his heart demon break out, that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the originally extremely powerful Purple Daoist roared in agony for a long time, but was ultimately unable to suppress the demon in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he died with hatred.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh: "As expected of a Great Supreme, it took so much of my mental effort to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Qi Yuan didn't like killing people with words.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't good with words to begin with, how could he compare to Zhuge Liang cursing Wang Lang to death before the army.</p><p></p><p>He preferred to kill enemies with one sword strike, or chop off their heads with a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>But the enemy was too powerful, and he had only mastered the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra to the level of exhaustion, barely scratching the surface.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, at least when it reached the level of inscription, as soon as he appeared, others would forget upon seeing him.</p><p></p><p>He could also forget everything at any time.</p><p></p><p>Including himself.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan, who was beside him, heard Qi Yuan's words and wanted to splash tea on his face: "Brother, you killed a Great Supreme with just a few words, you're even stronger than... my master!"</p><p></p><p>"A few simple words, yet it exhausted all my wisdom! You know, mental labor is sometimes more painful than physical labor."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only sometimes.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan felt that Qi Yuan was talking nonsense again, saying things he couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>But he could only say from the side...</p><p></p><p>"Big brother is mighty! Killing a Great Supreme just like that!</p><p></p><p>I never thought that I, Chen Huan, would have such a day, to fight alongside big brother and kill a Great Supreme, plus... six Supreme small fries." Chen Huan added in the remaining White Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>Killing a Great Supreme gave a lot of experience.</p><p></p><p>He directly rose to level 132.</p><p></p><p>If he could kill more Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even felt that he could quickly level up to 200.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Supremes weren't so easy to kill, especially Great Supremes.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Purple Daoist's corpse: "If you didn't want to be my wife, you could barely qualify as a decent first love."</p><p></p><p>With these words, Qi Yuan felt more and more like a scumbag.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't care, his eyes fell on the ancient stone tablet beside Purple Daoist's corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Destiny Tablet... we meet again at last."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan revealed a bright smile, grabbing the Destiny Tablet that wanted to escape with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder this Purple Daoist looked so much like Purple Heavenly Fairy, it turns out, they both obtained the so-called supreme treasure of this world, the Destiny Tablet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Destiny Tablet, his gaze looking over.</p><p></p><p>[Destiny Tablet fragment, once named Deception Tablet, contains inauspiciousness, purified by Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Everyone can get the answer they want to get on the Destiny Tablet.]</p><p></p><p>The information obtained was little, but very useful.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Destiny Tablet fragment meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the mummy he encountered in the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The mummy had said he came from the Buddhist land to purify inauspiciousness.</p><p></p><p>This Destiny Tablet...</p><p></p><p>"Since people can get the answers they want from you, can you let me become a Golden Immortal of the Daluo Heaven, a混元 Saint?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>He pinched the Destiny Tablet.</p><p></p><p>At this time, special images appeared in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to traverse time and space, seeing his future self.</p><p></p><p>His future self, relying on the Destiny Tablet, was invincible, defeating the White Emperor and the Lord, escaping this realm, and finally ascending to the legendary Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Destiny Tablet, he solved crises step by step, attaining the highest dao.</p><p></p><p>His future self became a 混元 Saint, able to cross the river of time at will.</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth to exhale, and all the stars were destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes looked over.</p><p></p><p>[Deceptive future scene, those who possess the Destiny Tablet are more likely to believe this is real.]</p><p></p><p>Everything was illusory.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't traversed the future, nor had he attained 混元.</p><p></p><p>Everything was illusory.</p><p></p><p>He held the Destiny Tablet, his expression calm: "No wonder NPCs who obtain you all think they're invincible, so it turns out..."</p><p></p><p>He then laughed: "Can you help me find the person I'm looking for?"</p><p></p><p>He thought of Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the Destiny Tablet had no answer.</p><p></p><p>Some strange text appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>The general meaning was that activating the Destiny Tablet also required energy, preferably the host's blood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "I'm afraid you don't even know who I'm looking for."</p><p></p><p>He took the Destiny Tablet fragment, placed a few restrictions on it, and put it away.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Chen Huan beside him and slowly said: "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day later, in No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan looked surprised: "You want to form an organization called Blood Palace? That name doesn't sound auspicious."</p><p></p><p>Among today's powerful figures, who doesn't know of the Blood Demon? The Blood Demon is an even more terrifying fiend than demons.</p><p></p><p>The Lord once said that the Blood Demon would bring destruction to the world.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Huan was at odds with the Lord, he still believed some of what the Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"It will be called Blood Palace." Qi Yuan said firmly.</p><p></p><p>His main purpose in creating Blood Palace was to see the Golden Canary.</p><p></p><p>When the Golden Canary awakened him back then, he didn't know what price it paid, but it must have been very heavy.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he gave the power of reincarnation to the thirteen people of Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now, perhaps tens of thousands of years have passed, those thirteen people may have fallen into reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>He established Blood Palace in order to awaken the memories of those thirteen people.</p><p></p><p>Or, if they still remembered Blood Palace, they would come to No Return City to see him.</p><p></p><p>It was useless for one person to guard No Return City alone.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, establishing an organization is very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>We're in the Eighty Thousand Cities, who would come from thousands of miles away to die here?" Chen Huan's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>For a powerful organization to attract people to join, it means this organization must bring benefits to those who want to join.</p><p></p><p>Big brother says establish an organization and just establishes one.</p><p></p><p>Who would come? And to a place like the Eighty Thousand Cities.</p><p></p><p>Coming would be suicide.</p><p></p><p>Even if people came, those who came would probably be weaklings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was deep: "Who says our Blood Palace doesn't have good things, aren't I one?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Chen Huan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Qi Yuan say: "I have a supreme method that can help Earthly Legends enter the Supreme realm, is this... enough?"</p><p></p><p>The path of human demons, Qi Yuan was most familiar with.</p><p></p><p>He could teach and help the NPCs of this world break through realms.</p><p></p><p>Especially from Earthly Legend to Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>The number of Supremes in this world was only about a thousand.</p><p></p><p>But what about Earthly Legends? Just in the Eighty Thousand Cities, there were over a hundred thousand Earthly Legends.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the entire Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>No Return City was too small, too small.</p><p></p><p>Insignificant among the Eighty Thousand Cities.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Thousand City region, the number of Earthly Legends was nearly a thousand.</p><p></p><p>This Thousand City region was part of the Eighty Thousand Cities without a Great Supreme presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, in the Eighty Thousand Cities with Great Supremes presiding, how many Earthly Legends were there?</p><p></p><p>How many people were stuck at Earthly Legend, unable to break through to Supreme? Even Chen Huan, a disciple of the White Emperor, had difficulty breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other Earthly Legends.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan's eyes revealed a shocked expression: "Big brother... if you do this... you'll offend the White Emperor Palace and the Lord of the Endless Blood Sea."</p><p></p><p>He could imagine, once Qi Yuan lectured and helped Earthly Legends across the world enter the Supreme realm, what changes would occur in the world's structure.</p><p></p><p>Although the White Emperor wouldn't care about Blood Palace's appearance, would the high-level officials of White Emperor Palace ignore it?</p><p></p><p>Would the Lord allow Blood Palace to exist?</p><p></p><p>At that time, Blood Palace would definitely face enormous pressure.</p><p></p><p>"If anyone objects, they can come find me in No Return City, I'll make them submit." Qi Yuan simply didn't care about those trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>His main purpose was to find the Golden Canary.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps before Blood Palace became powerful, the Golden Canary would already be found.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But brother... doing this will definitely attract a lot of attention," Chen Huan knew that if Qi Yuan could help Terrestrial Myths enter the Supreme realm, it would be an incredibly shocking event. "Moreover, what if those who join the Blood Palace and receive your favor to enter the Supreme realm... betray you? The loyalty of others cannot be guaranteed either."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "Why do I need others' loyalty? I just need them to work for me. If they're unwilling... well then, they can become my experience points."</p><p></p><p>There were too few Supreme beings in this world. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan estimated that killing all the Supreme beings in this world wouldn't even get him to level 200.</p><p></p><p>So why not mass produce some Supreme beings himself?</p><p></p><p>If they opposed Qi Yuan, he could simply kill them and turn them into experience points for himself. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they behaved and didn't oppose him, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Helping them reach the Supreme realm would be considered a good deed.</p><p></p><p>Whether in life or in games, apart from the people he cared about, Qi Yuan really couldn't be bothered to pay attention to others.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to achieve his own goals.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, once this starts, there's no turning back. Are you sure?" </p><p></p><p>"I'm sure," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Thousand Cities Territory.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling smiled in surprise. She looked at Chen Huan and said lightly: "Junior brother, although you've become a Supreme being, it's best not to make such jokes."</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Chen Huan had come to the Great Sorrow City in the Thousand Cities Territory. Following Qi Yuan's instructions, he was looking for Terrestrial Myths to join the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, progress was very slow.</p><p></p><p>Several days had passed, and only two Terrestrial Myths nearing the end of their lifespans were willing to follow him to No Return City to join the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>After all, their lifespans were almost exhausted. If they didn't break through soon, they would die of old age.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, I haven't hidden anything in my words," Chen Huan said seriously. "The Guardian of No Return City is a born divine saint who can help people break through to the Supreme realm! Junior brother also broke through to Supreme after listening to the Guardian's teachings."</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense. Even our master cannot help people break through to Supreme. Do you think that Guardian of No Return City can?" Huang Mengling sneered.</p><p></p><p>She had met the Guardian of No Return City before. He had some talent, but that was all.</p><p></p><p>Help people break through to Supreme?</p><p></p><p>Was that even possible? </p><p></p><p>It was like someone scrolling through short videos nowadays, and a video blogger saying, "Become my disciple and I'll help you earn 10 billion in a year."</p><p></p><p>Would anyone believe that?</p><p></p><p>You might as well believe in the First Emperor of Qin.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such an outrageous claim, Huang Mengling naturally didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, the Guardian's terrifying power is far beyond your imagination," Chen Huan recalled being surrounded and attacked by the Great Supreme and other Supreme beings at that time. He said, "The Purple Daoist of Thousand Cities Territory led Supreme beings to attack me and my brother, but was... easily killed by my brother!"</p><p></p><p>When ordinary Supreme beings perished, which one didn't cause mountains to collapse and the earth to split, destroying cities and killing people?</p><p></p><p>Especially for a Great Supreme, it was extremely difficult to kill one.</p><p></p><p>It might take hundreds or thousands of days of battle for one to die.</p><p></p><p>How long did it take for Purple Daoist to perish? Probably not even the time it takes to burn a stick of incense!</p><p></p><p>The mocking expression on Huang Mengling's face grew even stronger: "Purple Daoist was a Great Supreme. Who in the Thousand Cities Territory could match him? And who could kill him? To capture him would require at least three Great Supremes of the same level working together, along with over ten ordinary Supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>How could the Guardian of No Return City, a mere Terrestrial Myth who barely broke through to Supreme, kill Purple Daoist? Junior brother, I don't know what you're trying to do, but I still advise you to turn back from this misguided path."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Huang Mengling blocked Chen Huan's path.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was the senior sister, and Chen Huan had always been afraid of her.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a terrifying aura spread out. Huang Mengling's face instantly turned pale, and she heard Chen Huan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, I am now... a Supreme being!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to call you senior sister out of respect for our master!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's face was very cold.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling felt a bone-chilling killing intent and coldness.</p><p></p><p>Her gums trembled, and she didn't dare to look directly at Chen Huan's face as she silently stepped aside.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan didn't look at this senior sister again and left the place.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, it took a long time for the fear on Huang Mengling's face to dissipate: "A Supreme being who luckily broke through without comprehending powerful innate divine abilities - give me a hundred years and I could easily defeat him!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling felt somewhat unconvinced.</p><p></p><p>After some time, an elegantly dressed old man came out of the palace, looking hurried.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling was stunned: "Wang Gai, why aren't you in closed-door cultivation trying to break through to Supreme? Why are you going out?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Huang Mengling, Wang Gai lowered his head: "Fairy Huang, I... I want to go to No Return City to try my luck."</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai didn't dare to look at Huang Mengling.</p><p></p><p>What Chen Huan said was exaggerated, even ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>There was no credibility at all.</p><p></p><p>It might even be a trap.</p><p></p><p>But Wang Gai's lifespan was coming to an end.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of dying.</p><p></p><p>What he feared was that after his death, his large family would lose his protection. In a place like the Thousand Cities Territory, their fate could be very miserable.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian of Great Sorrow City, that Supreme being, had always been iron-blooded and valued people based on their usefulness.</p><p></p><p>While he could fight, his clan members could still live in luxury and wealth.</p><p></p><p>If he died, the fate of his clan members could be very tragic.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme being's actions had caused some criticism, with people pointing out various problems, but it was useless. Who could oppose when this Supreme being's father was a Great Supreme?</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Huang Mengling's face looked extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Gai quickly ran out.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly: "It's truly difficult for a Terrestrial Myth to reach Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Even the White Emperor's disciple, Fairy Huang, is affected by the comprehension of origin, unknowingly giving rise to heart demons and emotional fluctuations."</p><p></p><p>He remembered that when he first met Fairy Huang, this fairy was courteous and polite.</p><p></p><p>How unlike now, with heart demons running wild.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wang Gai felt more worried.</p><p></p><p>If even the White Emperor's disciple found it so difficult to break through to Supreme...</p><p></p><p>Could they really break through to Supreme by going to that No Return City and joining that so-called Blood Palace? But then he thought, he was going to die anyway.</p><p></p><p>So he might as well make one last desperate attempt before death.</p><p></p><p>If it failed, at least he would have tried his best.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the icy snow-covered land, a black graceful figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's small face was extremely pale, like a pear blossom. Half of her face was tightly covered by a black veil, but the remaining half that was exposed was enough to captivate a nation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the law of the word "demon" would not allow people to appreciate this beautiful face, only causing disgust.</p><p></p><p>She walked in the icy snow-covered land, tightly gripping chains in her hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she stopped and spoke in a voice that was both alluring and ethereal: "Husband, when will you come to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was no response at all.</p><p></p><p>In the icy snow-covered land, there was only the howling sound of the great snow.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao wasn't disappointed, but smiled coquettishly: "Husband, you better hide well. If your slave finds where your true body is, I will surely lock you tightly by my side as well.</p><p></p><p>Who told you... to never come see your slave."</p><p></p><p>She walked alone in the icy snow-covered land.</p><p></p><p>After some unknown time, the wind and snow ahead stopped.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored figure appeared in front, it was He Wu of the Northern Demon Thirteen Fiends.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's eyes showed a wary look: "Why have you come again?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Wu's eyes held a trace of joy: "Aren't you also curious about why we've become like this, detested by heaven and annoying to people?"</p><p></p><p>"What if I'm curious, and what if I'm not?" Ning Tao smiled sadly.</p><p></p><p>At least, she hadn't seen disgust in her husband's eyes.</p><p></p><p>What she saw seemed to be an unintentional familiar doting.</p><p></p><p>"At the southernmost point of the Flowing Wind Realm is the End of the World. Perhaps we can find our answers there," He Wu said. "I've gradually notified the Northern Demon Thirteen Fiends, and they're all willing to go with me to the End of the World. Are you willing to go?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's eyes showed curiosity: "Who told you this information?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Wu's eyes showed a reminiscent look, then he said: "I cannot say, cannot say."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid it might be a trap?" Ning Tao asked.</p><p></p><p>"If this is also a lie, then this world is truly too ridiculous," He Wu said.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was silent for a while, and finally said slowly: "I will go to the End of the World, but... I'm afraid I won't be able to get there anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>She was still with the Blood Demon now, suffering endless pursuit.</p><p></p><p>He Wu glanced at the blood-colored flesh ball behind Ning Tao and said helplessly: "If you abandon him, perhaps all threats will disappear."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled sweetly: "If I abandon him, what if my husband can't find me?"</p><p></p><p>He Wu looked at Ning Tao for a long time before saying: "Even the Blood Demon, upon seeing your face, would detest you. Otherwise, why wouldn't he show himself?"</p><p></p><p>Even they themselves detested themselves, let alone others.</p><p></p><p>"No, my husband won't," Ning Tao stubbornly raised her head. She glanced behind her, her gaze determined, "He's just lost his way for a while, he hasn't..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

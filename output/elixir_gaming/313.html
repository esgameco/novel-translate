        <h1>Chapter 313</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He touched his forehead, and there was another large pool of blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally looked seriously at Qi Yuan, with a somewhat dazed expression: "My wife?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your wife. Sigh, I hit too hard, your wife couldn't withstand it. What a pity. You should quickly collect some, keep it as a memento," Qi Yuan said casually. </p><p></p><p>Blood and foam flew everywhere, but not a single drop fell on Qi Yuan. The blood-colored long sword disappeared. He stood in this space like an otherworldly immortal.</p><p></p><p>However, the words spoken by this immortal were somewhat crazy and difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the injured Yu Xiu struggled to stand up. He looked at Qi Yuan with awe in his eyes: "Thank you, sir, for saving my life!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Xiu's head was still buzzing, somewhat concussed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Yu Xiu: "Can you tell me... about the hidden map?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Yu Xiu looked confused.</p><p></p><p>This person, who was almost comparable to a deity, actually didn't know...</p><p></p><p>"Sir, my name is Yu Xiu. This matter cannot be explained quickly. When the curse ends, this place will also shatter.</p><p></p><p>Next time I come out, I will definitely find you, sir, and inform you of the details."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu spoke faster, because he felt he was about to go back.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his body became transparent, and then... disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The entire space also collapsed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The environment around Qi Yuan and Han Xianyun changed back to the previous small alley.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun held his head. He still hadn't woken up from the shock.</p><p></p><p>Especially after waking up, he felt dizzy, as if he had suffered a huge attack.</p><p></p><p>He felt that everything seemed like a dream.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his mind in chaos: "Just now... did we enter a special space, or was it my imagination?"</p><p></p><p>He suspected that he might be mentally disturbed and having delusions.</p><p></p><p>After all, his current state was not good, feeling top-heavy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this state was actually because he had been awakened by Qi Yuan's shout.</p><p></p><p>"Your wife's remains are still on your head, how could it be imagination? Don't tell me you want to be a scumbag and not take responsibility?" Qi Yuan said with a light smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The weather was gloomy, with howling winds.</p><p></p><p>Inside the ancient fortress, there were clusters of cramped buildings.</p><p></p><p>On the walls of the fortress were carved various strange creatures.</p><p></p><p>There were terrifying big fish with six pairs of wings, and majestic creatures with lion faces and human bodies.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the open space in the middle of the fortress, a spatial fluctuation occurred, and a figure fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time, four people gathered in this open space.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xiu? Weren't you on vacation in reality, trying to break the curse? Why are you back so soon?"</p><p></p><p>"And what's with the injuries on your body, are these... wounds left by the Executioner Axe Moss?"</p><p></p><p>The two men and two women present all looked at Yu Xiu with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Among them, only a tall woman with braided hair looked worried.</p><p></p><p>"There were some unexpected events when breaking the curse." Obviously, Yu Xiu didn't want to tell these people everything.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we're about to be sent out on a mission, and at this time... you're injured again. What about the next mission... what are we going to do?" A burly man revealed a complex expression in his eyes, looking worried.</p><p></p><p>The others felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>The five of them currently belonged to a small team, and having a main combat force injured greatly affected their mission.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a thin man spoke up: "Don't mention the mission. I estimate that before the mission even starts, our... fortress will be broken."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this, the faces of those present changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The fortress was their dwelling place and also protected them from outside erosion.</p><p></p><p>However, recently, the number of missions completed by people in the fortress had been decreasing.</p><p></p><p>The blood array energy source of the fortress was insufficient and growing weaker.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying monsters in the night would probably break through the blood array of the fortress before long.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the residents of the fortress would likely suffer heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>And they would only be able to become wanderers, not knowing where their next meal would come from.</p><p></p><p>"That's a Wu Ying level monster, even stronger than the Executioner Axe Moss. Our small fortress simply can't resist!" The braided woman also looked worried.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what those people up there are planning," someone sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yu Xiu covered his wound: "Sister Nana and I will go back to treat the injury. We're done talking."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the braided woman didn't hesitate at all and directly carried Yu Xiu on her shoulder. The two of them headed towards the cramped rooms inside the fortress.</p><p></p><p>Back in the room, after confirming that no one was around, Yu Xiu let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>An Liangna's face showed an anxious expression: "Yu Xiu, what's really going on?</p><p></p><p>Are these wounds really left by the Executioner Axe Moss?"</p><p></p><p>An Liangna's face seemed to have ten thousand questions.</p><p></p><p>She and Yu Xiu were intimately close, and she was most familiar with Yu Xiu's strength, knowing some of his trump cards.</p><p></p><p>She knew that if Yu Xiu had been tortured, he definitely wouldn't have escaped so easily.</p><p></p><p>"Nana, do you think there's someone in reality who could kill Axe Moss?" Yu Xiu asked, recalling the scene he witnessed in the torture space.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Axe Moss is at least at the Wu Ying level. Even in major missions, he would be considered a big boss. In the real world, they're all just ordinary people." An Liangna clearly didn't believe anyone in reality could kill Axe Moss.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yu Xiu was silent for a moment before saying, "Axe Moss was killed with one sword by someone from reality..."</p><p></p><p>He told An Liangna everything about fortune-telling for Qi Yuan and what happened afterwards.</p><p></p><p>After listening, An Liangna's eyes showed shock: "How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>In the real world, bloodlines have limits, and blood warriors simply don't exist.</p><p></p><p>Without blood warriors, how could anyone contend with Axe Moss?</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, according to what you said, he had no death aura on him, so he's clearly not one of us," An Liangna said, utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that reality seems to have undergone some major changes, which might be related to this," Yu Xiu said slowly, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>"Major changes?" An Liangna was silent for a moment before continuing, "No matter how powerful reality becomes, what does it matter? This is..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yu Xiu also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Yes, An Liangna was right.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful reality became, it couldn't affect them.</p><p></p><p>Here, they could only rely on each other, on their companions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dragon Terrace City, in a hotel.</p><p></p><p>In front of Qi Yuan was a huge screen.</p><p></p><p>On the screen, the robot Zero One had a smile on its face.</p><p></p><p>"Today we shot three videos... yesterday's earnings... bought wedding candy... the cat lost five hundred and seventy-two cat hairs..."</p><p></p><p>It continued to report its work to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded, indicating approval.</p><p></p><p>"How's the search going for the Raging Dragon Martial Lord and the Blood Compass that I asked you to look into?" Qi Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>This was what he cared about most now.</p><p></p><p>It was related to the path of advancement for the Spirit Path Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>It was also related to breaking through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"No information was found on the Raging Dragon Martial Lord or the Blood Compass.</p><p></p><p>However, through searching, information about Blood Luo Island was found.</p><p></p><p>Blood Luo Island is located in the depths of the Central Asian Ocean. One thousand seven hundred years ago, an earthquake occurred in the Central Asian Ocean, and Blood Luo Island sank into the vast ocean, never to be heard from again."</p><p></p><p>"An island from one thousand seven hundred years ago? Can its exact location still be found now?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>If it could be found, he would go be a diver and take a casual look.</p><p></p><p>"Too little information, unable to locate," Zero One showed a troubled expression, as if being unable to help Qi Yuan solve his problems was a painful thing.</p><p></p><p>However, Zero One continued: "Regarding the Yu Xiu you mentioned and the portrait you provided, I have searched through many materials and also mobilized backup surveillance footage from around the world. In the end, I found some information.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu, from An County, Qin Yuan Country, died in a car accident... thirty-four years ago.</p><p></p><p>Based on his age, he should be fifty years old now."</p><p></p><p>"Dead—"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he remembered the term "death energy" that Yu Xiu had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the place where Yu Xiu is requires death... to enter?" Qi Yuan speculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean I have to commit suicide to complete this task of becoming the Spiritual Martial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qi Yuan quickly shook his head. </p><p></p><p>He had a mental illness certificate, but he wasn't mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>Suicide, he couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking back to yesterday, he had only been able to enter that secret space with the help of Han Xianyun's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean if his own bloodline concentration reached the standard, he could also enter similar secret spaces?</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to be a diver and catch mutant sea monsters in the ocean," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>The blood essence from the witchcraft religion was a mishmash. After consuming it, it could indeed enhance Qi Yuan's martial arts cultivation and talent.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, too much of it would overshadow everything else.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to change clothes and go on a trip."</p><p></p><p>This time, he would stay in Tianyue City for about a week, and then start the martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>During this week, he would visit some martial arts attractions.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Wuyun Pavilion, which was engraved with various martial arts traces.</p><p></p><p>When they left yesterday, Han Xianyun had promised to accompany him to Wuyun Pavilion as his tour guide.</p><p></p><p>A free tour guide, might as well use it.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared outside Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After three months of growth, his hair was quite long, giving him the look of a handsome man in ancient costume.</p><p></p><p>When Han Xianyun saw Qi Yuan, his face lit up with excitement. He waved continuously and jogged over: "Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun, who had gone home last night, had felt dizzy and slept for a while.</p><p></p><p>After waking up, he became clear-headed and particularly excited.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Qi Yuan was... the fierce person who had destroyed the Wugui military camp with one sword back then.</p><p></p><p>The legendary... omnipotent immortal cultivator.</p><p></p><p>No wonder yesterday, when he worriedly said that with the revival of immortal cultivation, martial arts would no longer exist, Qi Yuan wasn't anxious at all.</p><p></p><p>As an immortal cultivator, why would he be anxious? Martial arts was probably just a toy, a way to experience life.</p><p></p><p>How should one deal with an immortal cultivator? This morning, Han Xianyun asked himself this question.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he knew the answer.</p><p></p><p>Flatter him! Maybe if he flattered him happily, Mr. Qi would wave his hand and gift him an awesome wife.</p><p></p><p>That would be a huge win.</p><p></p><p>"You've brought big and small bags, very well prepared," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"To be Mr. Qi's tour guide, I must be fully prepared!" Han Xianyun said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Wuyun Pavilion not open? I see people guarding outside," Qi Yuan scanned the area and saw police tape around Wuyun Pavilion, with several black-suited bodyguards standing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Wuyun Pavilion is free, anyone can enter. I guess some rich second generation reserved it. No worries, I'm also a rich second generation, small problem," Han Xianyun replied casually.</p><p></p><p>Such scenes were very common in Qinyuan Country.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people were used to this and had no objections.</p><p></p><p>After all, jokingly speaking, the nobility's favor could not be repaid in generations.</p><p></p><p>More realistically, would objections be useful?</p><p></p><p>On TV, in textbooks, even in the constitution, they didn't even bother to pretend.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Star families even had immunity from the death penalty.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it somewhat inappropriate to use special privileges like this?" Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>He never used special privileges.</p><p></p><p>For example, when he was in the Canglang Realm and wanted to go to a sect's library.</p><p></p><p>He could have used his privileges to force those people to open the library.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't use privileges, instead relying on his strong personal charm, plus the partial hospitality of those sects.</p><p></p><p>When he went, those people would open the library.</p><p></p><p>"How about I use my personal charm to move them?" Qi Yuan wanted to act as he did in the Canglang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Leave such small matters to me!" Han Xianyun patted his chest and guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>He was about to go find the person in charge of this when suddenly a voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you're here?" An elderly man who looked like a butler walked over with a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Wang, why are you here?" Han Xianyun looked puzzled, "The one who reserved Wuyun Pavilion, it can't be my big brother, right? Perfect, open the back door for me, I have a friend who wants to go in too!"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly it was his own family, Han Xianyun felt this would be even easier to handle.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a group of people came walking over in droves.</p><p></p><p>At the front was a middle-aged man and a beautiful woman with exotic features.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man saw Han Xianyun and showed a surprised look in his eyes. He then said to the woman beside him: "Princess Huansha, this is my younger brother Han Xianyun, he is a martial artist at the peak of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Weren't you interested in martial arts? My brother can be your tour guide and explain Wuyun Pavilion to you."</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha was a princess from the country of Liulisi, who had come to Longtan City in Qinyuan Country for a visit.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun's older brother, Han Kang, was responsible for accompanying and ensuring Princess Huansha's safety.</p><p></p><p>Now that Han Kang saw his brother here, he decided to let his brother accompany her.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun heard this and was speechless: "Big brother, I'm accompanying a friend."</p><p></p><p>He finished speaking and looked at Princess Huansha: "Princess, I apologize, but I don't have time today."</p><p></p><p>Accompany a princess from a small country, or an immortal cultivator? Was there even a need to choose?</p><p></p><p>Definitely the immortal cultivator! Could the princess give him an awesome wife? Obviously not.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his brother's words, Han Kang's expression froze slightly.</p><p></p><p>This brother of his, although usually carefree, wouldn't cause problems with important matters.</p><p></p><p>Faced with his orders, his brother had never refused before.</p><p></p><p>Today, he refused him to his face.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang was already displeased in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This friend is... from martial arts circles?" Han Kang looked at Qi Yuan, "How about this friend comes to Wuyun Pavilion again tomorrow, and I'll have my brother accompany you then."</p><p></p><p>Han Kang's words carried an indisputable tone, with the overbearing attitude of someone in a superior position.</p><p></p><p>"I came today, why should I come tomorrow? Is Wuyun Pavilion your family's property? Why don't you come tomorrow instead?" Qi Yuan was unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Before Han Kang could speak, a secretary-like man with gold-rimmed glasses beside him said,</p><p></p><p>"Wuyun Pavilion... can indeed be considered our property."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had been put in his place.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat unhappy.</p><p></p><p>In this game, he was restricted everywhere.</p><p></p><p>He had already decided that when he had money, he would directly buy Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Encountering today's situation, he could then arrogantly retort:</p><p></p><p>"What, Wuyun Pavilion is your family's property? Sorry, but all of Gongxing is mine."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Gongxing wasn't his at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He was just a weak, helpless commoner being bullied, severely mocked, but not daring to fight back, standing there like a nobody.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Princess Huansha's eyes showed an interested look: "Are both of these gentlemen martial artists? I've always admired your country's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>How about this, this little girl will tour Wuyun Pavilion together with these two gentlemen, what do you all think? Besides, we're all young people, so we can have a more relaxed time."</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha's suggestion immediately stirred up waves.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang was stunned for a moment, then thought for a bit before saying: "That's fine."</p><p></p><p>The others had no objections either.</p><p></p><p>After all, Wuyun Pavilion was full of their own people.</p><p></p><p>With good security measures outside, there wouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang looked at Han Xianyun and Qi Yuan, his tone serious with a hint of pressure: "After entering Wuyun Pavilion, remember to protect Princess Huansha, don't let anything happen to her."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun then looked at Qi Yuan with a troubled expression: "Mr. Qi, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Whatever, after all this is someone else's property," Qi Yuan was also helpless, feeling his own weakness and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 575</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old man wanted to speak, wanted to transmit his voice, but could not say anything.</p><p></p><p>"What, you don't agree?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face showed even more terror.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot, you're still silenced." Qi Yuan had a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He lightly tapped his hand, and the restraints on the Celestial Elder instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Elder hurriedly said, "I agree, I agree, Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days! Qi Tan has offended you, he deserves to die, he deserves to die!"</p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial Elder of the Qi family had never seen Qi Yuan before, from the newly changed form of address and Qi Yuan's extraordinary abilities, aside from the Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days, who else could it be? Next to him, Lian Mei's pupils dilated.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days! </p><p></p><p>This good friend of hers, who seemed to have no divine powers, was actually the legendary Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days who had destroyed the Taixuan Palace! That Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days was the most miraculous and legendary figure from a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>One person overthrew the Ghost-Controlling Heaven, fought alone against the Taixuan Palace, the Ten Thousand Days descended... causing the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Who does not know, who does not understand.</p><p></p><p>Such a majestic existence, Lian Mei had never imagined she would have the chance to see.</p><p></p><p>As a result, not only did she see him, but she also spoke with him, and even... argued with him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the fact that the one she argued with was such a majestic existence, her heart was in a panic, felt blocked, and she even felt that her dress might not be dignified enough.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators around, upon hearing this, were first confused, then realized something, and one by one bowed their heads, with some even kneeling on the ground, their expressions excited.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the dead Qi Tan who could not die again, and suddenly waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>A special aura permeated, and the originally dead Qi Tan was revived.</p><p></p><p>The revived Qi Tan still had a somewhat confused expression.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he killed by that terrifying existence? </p><p></p><p>Could it have been an illusion? But when he looked up and saw that familiar figure and the humble posture of the ancestor, his expression stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Not an illusion?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a calm voice entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Now you know... how to show off, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I specially revived you, just to kill you again."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Qi Tan's body shattered again, dead beyond death.</p><p></p><p>He was bewildered by his revival, and then bewildered by his death.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present all felt that the Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days was somewhat terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Killing someone, reviving them, and then killing them again.</p><p></p><p>This was too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Only the Celestial Elder had a tumultuous heart.</p><p></p><p>Because he had clearly seen that Qi Tan truly died, and even his true spirit was shattered.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Supreme Sovereign intervened, he could not be revived.</p><p></p><p>Then how did his descendant... no, his evil offspring, be revived? Could it be an illusion?</p><p></p><p>This was the only explanation he could understand.</p><p></p><p>However, for the Supreme Sovereign to display such an illusion technique in front of him, this kind of skill was also enough to make one marvel.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, killing people and showing off are the great joys of life."</p><p></p><p>After killing Qi Tan twice, Qi Yuan felt refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>As for why Qi Tan could be revived, naturally it was because Qi Yuan had marked him, consumed resources, and revived Qi Tan.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Elder of the Qi family kept his head down, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Qi Yuan say, "The atmosphere in the cultivation world is too bad, you must manage your Qi family disciples well. In the future... if such an incident happens again, it won't be as simple as just one Qi Tan dying."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pushed his hand, and the figure of the Celestial Elder quickly disappeared, returning to its original position.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the nearby Shen Wushen: "Didn't I promise you that I would help you enter the Immortal Realm to find the Flowing Light? Look, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, and a rhombic crystal immediately appeared in the sight of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Those Violet Palace cultivators who saw this rhombic crystal all had expressions of envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Even a strand of Flowing Light was worth them fighting fiercely.</p><p></p><p>This was the source of the Flowing Light.</p><p></p><p>If they obtained it, they might be able to instantly surpass the Violet Palace and step into the Yin Shen Realm.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lian Mei, upon hearing this, associated it with what Qi Yuan had said before, about helping Shen Wushen enter the Immortal Realm to seek the Flowing Light. At that time, she still felt that Qi Yuan was boasting, but now she realized that she was the real fool.</p><p></p><p>"You take it, don't worry, no one dares to snatch it from you.</p><p></p><p>If anyone dares to snatch it, that's disrespecting me." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Violet Palace cultivators had no thoughts of robbery.</p><p></p><p>This was a gift from the Supreme Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The symbolic meaning of this item was much higher than its actual value.</p><p></p><p>"Right, who dares to snatch it?" Qi Yuan said, sweeping his gaze over these Violet Palace cultivators. His gaze fell on a bald burly man, "Oh, you seem to be the most diligent and boldest robber cultivator here, dare you snatch it?"</p><p></p><p>The bald man, being noticed and questioned by the Supreme Sovereign, felt like crying without tears.</p><p></p><p>He felt like his ancestral graves were emitting green smoke, actually talking to the Supreme Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"This one... this one dares not." The bald man was terrified.</p><p></p><p>He dared not! </p><p></p><p>The gap between the Violet Palace and the Supreme Sovereign was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, whether he lived or died, from now on, he would definitely be the most successful and famous one in this lineage.</p><p></p><p>"You see, even the boldest robber cultivator here doesn't dare to rob you, Shen Wushen, you can rest assured and keep it." </p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen took a deep breath, "Thank you, Brother Qi."</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Lian Mei's head was in a daze.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days seemed a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Using a disrespectful way of saying it, he seemed a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, the friendship between us doesn't need these." Qi Yuan waved his hand, feeling a bit bored.</p><p></p><p>After playing with these people for so long, it had become boring as well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a crisp voice came.</p><p></p><p>"On the command of the Grand Master of the Hall of Principles, I specially invite the Supreme Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days to gather at the Hall of Principles."</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun walked out, his face full of reverence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Hong Yun, his gaze calm: "Since the Hall of Principles has invited me, there is no reason for me not to go."</p><p></p><p>This Hong Yun was somewhat interesting.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of Principles inviting him, with the strength of their Grand Master, could summon a projection at any time, so why did Hong Yun come in person?</p><p></p><p>It was clear that he wanted to convey something to him through Hong Yun.</p><p></p><p>Their figures flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan went straight to the point: "You're quite interesting, are you from outside the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see many hidden information.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun was a little surprised: "I come from the South Pavilion Universe."</p><p></p><p>"This name... is quite special." Qi Yuan said casually, "Does the South Pavilion Universe have a Dao Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Hong Yun nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Master..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Master realm could be considered a unique kind of omniscience and omnipotence.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this South Pavilion Universe has already embarked on a cycle.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Dao Masters, Qi Yuan was extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>At the Celestial Elder's Fourth Layer, if he encountered one, he still had a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>But at the Celestial Elder's Fifth Layer, if they were hostile, escaping... would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Dao Masters of the Immortal Realm have already perished.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the opponent was a big villain full of profanity and obscenity, how would Qi Yuan deal with him when trying to rectify the cultivation world? Hong Yun seemed to have thought of something, and then said, "The South Pavilion Universe... also has no future."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes, revealing a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"The South Pavilion Universe... also has no future?" He was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He could still understand that the Immortal Realm had no future.</p><p></p><p>It was because the Dao Master of the Immortal Realm had perished, and the Supreme Sovereign had broken through to the Celestial Elder's Fourth Layer at the moment of ultimate sublimation, severing the future.</p><p></p><p>But the South Pavilion Universe also has no future? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that some strange events have also occurred there.</p><p></p><p>"The specific reasons are not something I can know." Hong Yun said.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The South Kalpa Universe... has no future." Qi Yuan's gaze was calm, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt very tired.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, just thinking about these grandiose and empty things is utterly exhausting.</p><p></p><p>It's better to bully someone like Qi Tan, a small fry, to soothe and relax his mood.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, life is really too difficult." Qi Yuan sighed again, taking out a juice box and chugging it down.</p><p></p><p>Red Yun was speechless, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>This Wanri Overlord is indeed... strange and peculiar.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two figures appeared in the Hall of Highest Principles.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Hall's Grand Presider appeared, revealing its true form - that of a dragon-turtle.</p><p></p><p>With a turtle head and shell, a dragon's body coiled around it, with a faint divine glow.</p><p></p><p>On the turtle shell, there seemed to be the inscriptions of the Highest Principles, their aura mysterious and vast.</p><p></p><p>"Wanri Overlord, it has been centuries since we last met. Your cultivation has deepened further." </p><p></p><p>The Grand Presider spoke, gazing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With His eyes, He could see through all things in the world, but on Qi Yuan, He did not find any information leaking out.</p><p></p><p>This Wanri Overlord is truly mysterious and powerful.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite strong as well." Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>Although this Grand Presider was only at the second layer of the Yang Divines, Qi Yuan could tell that if the Flame Realm Lord of the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth were to clash with the Hall's Grand Presider, the outcome would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm's six heavens could not enter the third layer of the Yang Divines, so the Hall forged an alternative path - the Supreme Principles Dao, to enhance the Yang Divine cultivation, walking a unique path.</p><p></p><p>"Wanri Overlord, in opening the Immortal Palace this time, have you made contact with the existence of the Sole Palace?" the Grand Presider asked.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that." Qi Yuan replied lazily, conserving his words.</p><p></p><p>"I see." The Grand Presider had a knowing look, "If that is the case, the Wanri Overlord should know that... our Immortal Dao's Patriarch has perished."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the Grand Presider's expression became complex.</p><p></p><p>"With the Patriarch's demise, the future of the Immortal Dao is bleak... I wonder who can take the reins of the Immortal Dao now." The Grand Presider sighed with an indescribable emotion.</p><p></p><p>The death of the Patriarch is a devastating blow to a Dao. </p><p></p><p>It could even lead to its destruction.</p><p></p><p>"What did you come to see me for?" Qi Yuan was not interested in listening to the Grand Presider's lamentations, and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Patriarch's demise, the Hall of Highest Principles has been wanting to rebuild the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the Supreme Principles Dao was born.</p><p></p><p>The Sole Palace has opened the Linyu Shedding, constructing the seven heavens of the Immortal Realm, and while their path differs from the Hall's, their goal is the same.</p><p></p><p>The Sole Palace has the Sole Palace, and the Hall... has the Yiyuan Assembly."</p><p>As he said this, the Grand Presider's eyes shone with confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The Yiyuan Assembly, is it on par with the fourth layer of the Yang Divines like the Sole Palace?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had grown stronger, he was seeing more things.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Presider's face showed an embarrassed expression: "The Yiyuan Assembly is naturally far from the level of the fourth layer of the Yang Divines, but it is a rare treasure of a Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan's response was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>At his level, ordinary Realm Lord treasures no longer attracted his attention.</p><p>In the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth, the number of Realm Lord treasures he had shattered exceeded tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>A mere Realm Lord treasure, he truly did not care about.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanri Overlord must not underestimate the Yiyuan Assembly. It was personally crafted by the disciples of the Immortal Dao Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>This Yiyuan Assembly... can connect to other universes, and within it, one can communicate with the powerful beings of other universes!" The Hall's Grand Presider said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Principles Dao is the path that the Hall has created through the Yiyuan Assembly, by communicating with the strong ones of countless universes, pooling their wisdom, to ultimately create this path.</p><p></p><p>"Can one leave the Immortal Realm?" Qi Yuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"No, only the true spirits can communicate within the Yiyuan Assembly." The Hall's Grand Presider said, "Entering the Yiyuan Assembly has countless benefits. Not only can one experience the rules and Dao of different universes, one can also rapidly improve one's cultivation and refine one's true spirit.</p><p></p><p>A Yang Divine of the second layer, if they were to stay in the Yiyuan Assembly for tens of thousands of years, their true spirit would solidify to the point that even if they were to encounter the end of the universe, they might still be able to survive and revive when the universe is reborn."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the Grand Presider had an awe-filled expression.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that at the end of a universe cycle, all beings would perish.</p><p></p><p>Only those at the third layer of the Yang Divines or above would not be affected by the end of the universe and die.</p><p></p><p>The mere act of refining one's true spirit is enough to make all the Yang Divines in the Immortal Realm yearn for it.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Divines have infinite lifespans, but if they do not reach the third layer, they will still perish when the universe ends.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I were to preside over the Yiyuan Assembly for 300 billion years, I would have only entered it once." The dragon-turtle Grand Presider said.</p><p></p><p>A cycle is approximately 490 billion years.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Presider's lifespan exceeds 300 billion years.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that in this cycle, the Immortal Realm has already reached the late period.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is very high, in this cycle, I have not seen anyone with talent surpassing yours.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I intend to give you the opportunity to enter the Yiyuan Assembly, to enhance your strength.</p><p></p><p>But this gift is not without a price, in the not-too-distant future, you will need to represent the Immortal Realm and participate in the Grand Myriad Assembly in the Yiyuan Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan did not speak, the dragon-turtle Grand Presider continued: "In addition to the Immortal Realm, there are many other universes in the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>When the Immortal Dao Patriarch was still alive, every so often, the young talents of the Immortal Realm would enter the Yiyuan Assembly to participate in the Grand Myriad Assembly, debating the Dao with the powerful beings of the various worlds and universes.</p><p></p><p>The rewards for the debates are plentiful, but with the Patriarch's demise, according to the Hall's records, the Immortal Realm has not had such rich rewards for many cycles.</p><p></p><p>I only hope that in the Grand Myriad Assembly, the Wanri Overlord can bring back some opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, by the end of this cycle, I fear... there will be few in the Immortal Realm who can withstand the calamity of the universe."</p><p></p><p>This is the purpose of the Hall's Grand Presider.</p><p></p><p>Although he has lived for an extremely long time, his understanding of the Supreme Principles is only at the initial stage, and after being tempered by the Yiyuan Assembly, his strength has reached its limit, naturally not as much potential as the young Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Qi Yuan pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he was quite interested in this Yiyuan Assembly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he could see aliens.</p><p></p><p>But... listening to the Grand Presider's words, it seems that he would have to wait a very, very long time for this Grand Myriad Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was contemplating, suddenly, a mysterious aura descended.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, I have something to discuss with you." </p><p></p><p>The dragon-turtle Grand Presider was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the Hall's Second Presider to come find him at this time.</p><p></p><p>He apologized to Qi Yuan with a gesture, and his true spirit disappeared at that moment, entering the lower levels of the Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, what is the matter?" the Grand Presider asked.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Second Presider would not disturb him without reason.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, could it be that you intend to bestow the Yiyuan Assembly's gift upon the Wanri Overlord?" the Second Presider asked.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Presider pondered and said, "Junior Brother, I know you have always wanted to enter the Yiyuan Assembly, but your talent is not enough to support you going in.</p><p></p><p>Among the current six heavens of the Immortal Realm, aside from the former Great Day, no one has the qualifications to enter the Yiyuan Assembly, except for the Wanri Overlord.</p><p></p><p>In this cycle, there are less than 30 billion years left, if we do not strive harder, I fear we may not be able to survive this cycle."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Presider persuaded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, it is not that I am greedy, but I have a better candidate." the Second Presider said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Could it be the Black Sword of the Black Abyss?" the Grand Presider casually mentioned.</p><p></p><p>"No, it is the Bilu Overlord!" the Second Presider said.</p><p></p><p>"The Bilu Overlord's talent is only slightly better than yours, not even as good as the Great Day, how can they enter the Yiyuan Assembly?" the Grand Presider said, his face filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The Second Presider must have a reason for coming to him, it was not a futile attempt.</p><p></p><p>"The Bilu Overlord has obtained a rare Dao fruit in the Immortal Palace, and they are in perfect harmony with that Dao fruit. Once they fully refine it, they may be able to break through the Immortal Realm's restrictions and enter the third layer of the Yang Divines! A Yang Divine of the third layer who has comprehended the Supreme Principles, would they not be more qualified than the Wanri Overlord to enter?" the Second Presider said with a self-satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

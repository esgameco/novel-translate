        <h1>Chapter 428</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As in the past, Qi Yuan chatted idly with Jin Li for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Did they borrow the celestial jade?" Qi Yuan asked at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they did," Jin Li replied.</p><p></p><p>The current conversation made her feel as if she had returned to the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan was in danger among the Four Forbidden Lands.</p><p></p><p>Yet she was constantly enjoying his grace.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," Qi Yuan continued, "When the time is right, you can order your clan to... ambush the celestial jade mines of the Moluo clan in the Sixth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>The sacred lands of the Sixth Heaven had enterprises in the Fifth Heaven, and the Moluo clan also had many celestial jade mines in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"You... be careful. If it's not feasible, come to the Moon God Palace anytime. With Youhuang Canyue here, even if the Moluo Heavenly Lord brings the Moluo Well to the upper realm, he won't be able to harm you at all!" Jin Li was most concerned about Qi Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, a bunch of old men and women who don't like to bathe can't hurt me."</p><p></p><p>After the communication ended, Qi Yuan transformed into the appearance of the Demon Eye and sat in his cave dwelling, continuing to expand the Golden Core chapter of the "Qi Yuan Sutra".</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this will keep my wife Ning Tao busy for quite some time."</p><p></p><p>A divine method could almost condense a stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>In the stellar golden core, that barren universe, Ning Tao had hardly any rest.</p><p></p><p>Because there were really too many divine methods.</p><p></p><p>But this was also normal.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, the lifespan of a Yang Spirit was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>Unless they perished in the Root Demon Tribulation or died at the hands of an enemy, they were almost immortal.</p><p></p><p>In endless time, the divine methods created by Yang Spirits were naturally numerous.</p><p></p><p>"So, before the game starts, there are three ways to increase strength.</p><p></p><p>One is to condense golden cores, to win by quantity.</p><p></p><p>The second is to participate in the Supreme Principle Debate Conference and comprehend the supreme principles.</p><p></p><p>The third is to find my well and return it, as a magical treasure is also a great enhancement."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was very organized in doing things.</p><p></p><p>Those who love to make plans will have good luck.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed, Qi Yuan opened his eyes, revealing a smile, which then turned into a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Even after entering the realm of Yang Spirit, it's still difficult to resist inner temptation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone who sees the gate of supreme principles is like seeing a naked peerless beauty - all rationality disappears and they rush in recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most importantly, my acting skills are high."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Then he felt that this analogy was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Using a naked peerless beauty to compare to the gate of supreme principles was too insulting to the gate, and also insulting to those Yang Spirit Heavenly Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Another one has fallen for the trap, I should go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form disappeared, turning into a stream of light.</p><p></p><p>About five hundred breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found himself in the underworld, with traces of a great battle everywhere on the ground, broken walls and ruins.</p><p></p><p>The previous strike, with the sneak attack and the help of the divine infant, could be said to have been easily handled.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the remnant soul on the ground and said boredly:</p><p></p><p>"I am your ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>This time, he had once again methodically lured an unfortunate soul in, and then beat them to a pulp.</p><p></p><p>"The underworld has another triple-disabled person!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I'm really too kind-hearted. My pure love has become triple-disabled, yet I still take care of her without leaving."</p><p></p><p>Hmm... physically disabled, soul disabled, brain disabled.</p><p></p><p>Commonly known as triple-disabled.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, with this one taken down, that fellow Wutian can secretly sneak over."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in quite a good mood.</p><p></p><p>The area guarded by this triple-disabled person was located at the border of the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>With his control of authority, he could let Buddha Wutian secretly sneak in, bringing the Buddhist kingdom into the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Then, when encountering Yang Spirits at the level of supreme principles, Qi Yuan wouldn't have to work so hard to fight them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and two months passed.</p><p></p><p>During the days when Qi Yuan was away, Jin Li went to the Absolute Moon Abyss to kill members of the Moluo clan as usual.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's help, it could be said that Jin Li's killings were very successful.</p><p></p><p>She was able to return fully loaded each time.</p><p></p><p>Yu Tiao looked at Jin Li, her eyes filled with envy: "The Moon Lady's achievements are probably enough to make a request to the Moon God Sovereign soon."</p><p></p><p>Yu Tiao regretted it as soon as she finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's petition was to leave her position as the Moon Lady.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li responded with an "Mm", which counted as a reply.</p><p></p><p>In the Moon God Palace, her personality had always been cold and aloof.</p><p></p><p>"The Lady has been overly successful lately. Could it be that there are undercover agents planted in the Moluo clan?" Yu Tiao changed the subject and asked, her eyes filled with expectation.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Jin Li's eyes: "That cannot be disclosed."</p><p></p><p>Of course she wouldn't reveal any information about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yu Tiao didn't pursue the matter further, but casually asked: "I wonder which family that genius the Moon Lady is fond of comes from?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Tiao's eyes were filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The people around also looked towards Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>They were all very curious about which sacred land Qi Yuan came from, since he was able to win the beauty and even make Jin Li give up her position as the Moon Lady.</p><p></p><p>Who was his master, or ancestor? It should be... a Yang Spirit of supreme principles?</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't come from any family," Jin Li shook her head.</p><p></p><p>She understood what these people meant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the cultivators present were all surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, Jin Li's next words shocked them even more.</p><p></p><p>"I met him when I was in the lower realm," Jin Li's eyes held memories of the past.</p><p></p><p>The people present were completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator from the lower realm?"</p><p></p><p>"He's actually a cultivator from the lower realm!"</p><p></p><p>It was extremely difficult for cultivators from the lower realm to ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>But in the Moon God Palace, cultivators from the lower realm were rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>After all, even in the upper realm, the Moon God Palace belonged to the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The lower realm was very distant to them.</p><p></p><p>Since he had ascended from the lower realm, this also meant that he had no background at all.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Jin Li was still willing to give up her qualification as the Moon Lady for him. How could they not be shocked and surprised?</p><p></p><p>If it was said that he was a descendant of some supreme principle or great supreme principle cultivator, it would be understandable.</p><p></p><p>But he turned out to be a poor fellow from the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Jin Li, they admired her even more, but also had strange looks in their eyes, as if they felt she was wasting herself.</p><p></p><p>"He's different," Jin Li's eyes sparkled with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>He had always been different.</p><p></p><p>The charm of the Faceless Sword God from the past was still firmly etched in her memory.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice transmission fell into her ear.</p><p></p><p>"Jin Li, come to the Moon God Hall."</p><p></p><p>The one transmitting was none other than the Longyue Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li hurriedly quickened her pace towards the Moon God Hall.</p><p></p><p>The moon hung in the clear sky, its pure moonlight falling on the Moon God Hall, as if coating the great hall with a layer of white jade glaze.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li wore a black battle robe from top to bottom, with a light gold belt tied at her waist, clearly a dividing line, showing an exceptionally graceful figure. The gold wide collar embroidery at the neckline added a touch of charm.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Longyue Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the Longyue Heavenly Lord, Jin Li bowed from afar.</p><p></p><p>Yang Spirits could not be looked at directly, so she couldn't see the Longyue Heavenly Lord's face or true form.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Longyue Heavenly Lord nodded, her voice resounding, and went straight to the point, "How is Qi Yuan doing in the Moluo clan now?"</p><p></p><p>The Longyue Heavenly Lord's eyes held curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Two months had passed, and she didn't know if Qi Yuan had managed to deceive the other Heavenly Lords of the Moluo clan and establish a firm footing.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's mind tensed.</p><p></p><p>She recalled her conversation with Qi Yuan yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Buddha from the Buddhist realm descended, and together with him they ambushed and killed a Yang Spirit at the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>When she heard this yesterday, she was extremely shocked, just as unbelievable as when she heard Qi Yuan's statements in the lower realm. </p><p></p><p>Isn't the Buddha of the Buddhist realm the current Buddha? How did another Wutian Buddha appear? And to dare call oneself Buddha, one must definitely have the chance to break through to the Great Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he also obeyed Qi Yuan's orders.</p><p></p><p>How could Jin Li not be surprised?</p><p></p><p>More importantly, they took down an Ultimate Principle expert.</p><p></p><p>In this demon abyss, almost everything was under Qi Yuan's control.</p><p></p><p>But if this matter was revealed, it would be too sensational.</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan had full control and ensured safety, she would not disclose this information, to avoid any changes in the situation.</p><p></p><p>"The situation has been temporarily stabilized," Jin Li calmly replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lunar Embrace Celestial Venerable breathed a sigh of relief: "It's good if he can lie low for now."</p><p></p><p>Then, she changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if he can pull off something big?" A glint flashed in Lunar Embrace Celestial Venerable's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li lowered her head and gracefully bowed: "I'd like to hear the details."</p><p></p><p>"Thirty years from now will be the spiritual energy tide of Crescent Moon Abyss. I know some secrets about that Demon Abandonment Celestial Venerable of Crescent Moon Abyss. During the spiritual energy tide, Demon Abandonment Celestial Venerable will need to go into seclusion and cannot be disturbed.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he can secretly open the authority of the creation treasure, let Colorful Moon Celestial Venerable sneak in, severely injure Demon Abandonment Celestial Venerable, or even... kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Lunar Embrace Celestial Venerable explained her plan methodically.</p><p></p><p>The plan sounded ordinary, but each step would be very difficult to implement, and the collection of this information had not come easily.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li listened calmly and said: "I will pass this information on to him."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, if Demon Abandonment Celestial Venerable is severely injured or even killed, he can escape to my Moon Palace area.</p><p></p><p>I still think you should persuade him to join my Moon Palace. Otherwise, he will be alone with no foothold, and unable to hide when faced with the siege of the Demon Luo clan," Lunar Embrace Celestial Venerable continued.</p><p></p><p>There was expectation in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the plan was successfully implemented, she would have accomplished a great feat thirty years later.</p><p></p><p>For so many years, both sides had been scheming against each other, wanting to severely injure or even kill the other's Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables, but unfortunately there had been no opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Now, finally seeing such an opportunity, how could she not be pleased.</p><p></p><p>"If Demon Abandonment Celestial Venerable is killed, even if you leave your Moon Maiden status, I will apply for a Yang Spirit opportunity for you!" Lunar Embrace Celestial Venerable said imposingly.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Palace was clearly in decline now, she had to do something.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Celestial Venerable!" Jin Li bowed, unconsciously straightening her chest, as if proud for Qi Yuan, but also with a hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Absolute Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>A mythical cultivator of the Demon Luo clan was hiding tightly in the shadows, his eyes filled with fear and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the center of Absolute Moon Abyss from afar.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty... has betrayed us!"</p><p></p><p>As one of the top ten mythical experts in Absolute Moon Abyss, Mu Lan had always been responsible for the logistics of Absolute Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>During this period, in the battles between Absolute Moon Abyss and Moon Palace, they had been completely wiped out every time.</p><p></p><p>Their information seemed to be obtained by Moon Palace without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Mu Lan was cautious and pretended not to know, investigating secretly.</p><p></p><p>The investigation revealed shocking results.</p><p></p><p>All clues pointed to Eye of Demon Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Each military deployment was confidential, known only to the leading mythical expert and Eye of Demon Celestial Venerable, no one else.</p><p></p><p>But recently, deployments had been too frequent, as if they were just sending people to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>Those who knew the deployment plans had all died.</p><p></p><p>So obviously, whoever was still alive was the mole.</p><p></p><p>Their leader, the number one in Absolute Moon Abyss, Eye of Demon Celestial Venerable, was extremely suspicious.</p><p></p><p>How could Mu Lan not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This matter must be reported to the other Celestial Venerables." Mu Lan concealed his form.</p><p></p><p>He felt this couldn't go on.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would soon be sent to deal with Moon Palace, and he would be the next to die.</p><p></p><p>Waiting passively for death was not his style.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Blaze Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"No, Demon Blaze Celestial Venerable is too weak."</p><p></p><p>"If we're going to find someone, it should be someone powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"How about... Demon Hall Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Demon Hall Celestial Venerable was an Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit, second only to Demon Prosperity in power within the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Mu Lan entered the teleportation array, heading towards the area guarded by Demon Hall Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>As his figure disappeared, a pair of golden eyes appeared in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"Life is full of surprises, should I give him a scare later?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan hardly pretended anymore.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, he would still act as a big eyeball.</p><p></p><p>Now... why bother acting anymore.</p><p></p><p>The nearby Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables had all been taken care of by him.</p><p></p><p>The remaining few were also in his sights.</p><p></p><p>As for Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable, he needed to be dealt with last.</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, it will be another day of acting skills explosion!"</p><p></p><p>He already had a complete plan to deal with Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>As an Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit, Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable was good at rallying other Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>He had created a small group chat with five other Celestial Throne Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>In this small group, they often chatted and even gossiped about other Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, they actually had a good relationship.</p><p></p><p>But on the surface, even Eye of Demon Celestial Venerable didn't know these people were secretly in contact.</p><p></p><p>Now, of the people in this small group, only Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable remained to be dealt with.</p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Venerables had all been taken down.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Qi Yuan felt he could start setting things up.</p><p></p><p>Five communication devices appeared.</p><p></p><p>A pig-butchering scam? Everyone in the group is my alt account, you're the only pig!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan started typing.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I see purple light in the south, faintly like purple qi.</p><p></p><p>I fear it's a scheme by Moon Palace, is anyone willing to explore it with me?"</p><p></p><p>After a while, Qi Yuan replied with another account.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually purple qi, I'm coming!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll come too!"</p><p></p><p>"Since we've seen it, let's go together!"</p><p></p><p>The other accounts also logged in and replied.</p><p></p><p>"What about Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable, does he want to go?" someone asked.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Prosperity is at the Ultimate Principle realm, he surely won't be interested in that wisp of purple qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, if it were a complete strand of purple qi, Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable might be interested, but one strand divided among five people probably won't do."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used five accounts to chat with himself in the group.</p><p></p><p>First, create a "truth" for Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>We saw purple qi and are preparing to go capture it!</p><p></p><p>After laying the groundwork, once the other Celestial Venerables were captured, he would target Demon Prosperity Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I laugh at the Demon Luo's lack of strategy, and Demon Prosperity's lack of wisdom!"</p><p></p><p>"The mere Demon Luo clan is not worth mentioning, they've all become triple amputees!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the successful implementation of these plans was all related to the great attraction of the Ultimate Principle Gate for Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables, and also to the Netherworld... similar to a strange land, isolating the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables within.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also related to Qi Yuan's powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>If any of these three points were not met, it would be impossible to silently take down a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"After taking over the Demon Abyss, I can return to the Fifth Heaven to fish and bring my Jing back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very planned and orderly in his actions.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

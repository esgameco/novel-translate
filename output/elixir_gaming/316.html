        <h1>Chapter 316</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Liu Yu siblings looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha had a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's words confused them.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's world, only accessible after death? What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>The underworld? Qi Yuan pondered thoughtfully: "Only accessible after death, are there other methods?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to die before finishing the game.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's my turn to ask... Was the strange crystal used to fish for sea monsters in the water, with a sea monster inside?" Chen Fan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded, "Now it's your turn to answer about other methods."</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan continued: "Let me take a look at it first, then I'll answer your other questions together."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan didn't dither any further. </p><p></p><p>Scheming and calculating who gains an advantage? </p><p></p><p>That wasn't his style.</p><p></p><p>If the other party deceived him, he could simply kill them with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>His hand trembled, and suddenly there was a splashing sound from the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>A cubic meter of transparent crystal flew out of the water.</p><p></p><p>Inside the transparent crystal was a mutated sea monster.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Liu Yu siblings widened their eyes: "Such great strength, this must weigh over a hundred jin!"</p><p></p><p>Tossing up something weighing over a hundred jin so easily, he must have taken high-grade gene enhancement drugs.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan watched this scene with surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He never expected to find such a rare creature in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The transparent crystal plus the mutated sea monster weighed far more than a hundred jin - at least a thousand jin, nearly ten thousand jin.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary blood warriors simply didn't possess such immense strength.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the mutated sea monster, becoming complex. After a few breaths, he sighed in relief: "Its aura has been extinguished..."</p><p></p><p>He appeared here because he sensed the aura of the Ink Shark King.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the sea monster swim away, he feared the Ink Shark King had broken free from its seal.</p><p></p><p>Although there were now powerful weapons like the Eye of the Sky, if the Ink Shark King went on a rampage, it would still cause significant casualties.</p><p></p><p>So if he discovered the Ink Shark King was still alive, he would dissuade the man before him and then seal it again.</p><p></p><p>Now that the sea monster's aura was extinguished, there was no need to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, now it's your turn to answer me - besides death, what other methods are there to enter the world you mentioned?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>This matter was of utmost importance to him.</p><p></p><p>He even suspected the path of the Spirit Dao Martial Lord might be in the place the man before him said could only be reached after death.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "Given your strength, you should have... been there before.</p><p></p><p>Once you break through the martial arts limit and become a blood warrior, you can... sense the Blood Realm and wander the Yellow Springs in a mysterious state."</p><p></p><p>Back when he broke through the martial arts limit, he glimpsed a corner of the Yellow Springs.</p><p></p><p>Any martial artist who breaks through the martial arts limit can sense the Blood Realm and enter the Yellow Springs in a special form to wander for a while.</p><p></p><p>"However, there's only that one chance." Chen Fan's eyes showed a reminiscent look, "The longer you stay there, the more benefits you gain, but... the greater the drawbacks too. It will contaminate your bloodline and shorten your lifespan."</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan revealed a lot of useful information.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened attentively, his eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan hesitated for a moment, but ultimately chose to explain: "The path of martial arts lies in the bloodline. The stronger the bloodline, the stronger the power.</p><p></p><p>And in... that place, there are many bloodlines that meet the conditions, allowing rapid improvement in martial arts cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"But... because the bloodlines are all different, absorbing too many... can easily lead to conflicts and madness?" Qi Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>"Correct." Chen Fan nodded, looking at Qi Yuan with an appreciative gaze.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Qi Yuan had never been to that place, yet he could guess these things.</p><p></p><p>This showed his profound understanding of the martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>"So, if you want to go further on the martial arts path, you must enter that place.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately... that place is just a cage.</p><p></p><p>You haven't been there before, I advise you not to go."</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan finished speaking and said no more.</p><p></p><p>He left with the Liu Yu siblings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched Chen Fan's retreating figure and waved his hand: "Thank you, random NPC narrator, for telling me so much.</p><p></p><p>Although you don't have a name, if I ever become a film director, I'll definitely make you the lead actor."</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan ignored Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, only Qi Yuan and Princess Huansha remained on the huge yacht, along with a pile of mutated sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these sea monsters and muttered: "If you just lay flat and don't seek progress, honestly it would take some effort for me to find you."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he mercilessly waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, over a hundred sea monsters were all reduced to pulp.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan made no promise to return them to the sea.</p><p></p><p>A drop of blood oozed from each sea monster.</p><p></p><p>The Ink Shark King produced three soybean-sized drops of blood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan collected all these blood drops one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Amoeba Princess, let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Having collected the blood, Qi Yuan didn't want to break through the martial arts limit on the sea.</p><p></p><p>According to Chen Fan, when breaking through the martial arts limit, every martial artist has a chance to sense the Blood Realm and then wander to that realm in a special state.</p><p></p><p>If he broke through now and his soul ran off there while the yacht capsized, what would he do?</p><p></p><p>He had to return to the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Then, he would set up a formation before breaking through - that would be the simplest way.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>In the hotel room.</p><p></p><p>Formations surrounded Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>These formations were enough to ensure his safety.</p><p></p><p>Even if a major earthquake or flood occurred, they couldn't take him away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, over a hundred drops of blood floated around Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His eyes burst with intense light.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, and in an instant, all these crystalline blood drops entered his lower abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes turned blood-red at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His forehead seemed to become oily and shiny.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes. He seemed to hear the rolling of ocean waves, and also the sound of flying yellow sand.</p><p></p><p>The blood in his body kept churning and boiling, finally condensing into an extremely blood-red and demonic drop.</p><p></p><p>"Disperse."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's soft command, this drop of blood suddenly dispersed, spreading into his five viscera and six bowels, extraordinary meridians, and four limbs.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body suddenly became stronger at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the feeling of breaking through the martial arts limit?</p><p></p><p>It's completely different from... the martial arts limit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stated the obvious.</p><p></p><p>Now, without using Dao techniques, relying solely on martial arts strength, he could contend with those at the fourth level of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>"So, breaking through the martial arts limit and becoming a blood warrior is the beginning of the superhuman path of martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before him was a sea of blood, very quiet, without any sound, or perhaps the sound had not yet arrived.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was sensing the Blood Realm as Chen Fan had described.</p><p></p><p>"A place condensed from blood?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Blood Realm ahead, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary martial artist saw this Blood Realm, even if they wanted to enter, they would be helpless, not knowing how.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's own strength was extremely powerful, and his control over his soul and divine sense had reached the limit.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Blood Realm, he only needed to probe his soul into it.</p><p></p><p>His soul, like a fish, suddenly plunged into the Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an ethereal voice entered Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>[In the 13th year of Tianqi, war and chaos raged, disasters struck everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In Yunyan County, the genius martial artist Luo Bufan broke through the martial arts limit, seemingly shattering space and ascending.</p><p></p><p>The Chen clan and Luo clan were completely slaughtered by monsters.</p><p></p><p>Mission: Uncover the truth.</p><p></p><p>Reward: Blood Pill for Tempering the Body.]</p><p></p><p>"?? Am I playing a game within the game?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had originally come here to play a game. </p><p></p><p>But the game content was to continue playing games.</p><p></p><p>Was this some kind of nesting doll situation?</p><p></p><p>"So, this hidden map is like a copy of the main god space?" Qi Yuan guessed.</p><p></p><p>He had seen many comics and animations with this kind of setup.</p><p></p><p>This kind of setting was easy for him to accept.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a flood of information poured into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Just like the innate seed, his head now contained the memories of a game character, as well as the character's understanding of the world's background.</p><p></p><p>After receiving this information, Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This game is a mythical version of... Tianxi?"</p><p></p><p>The previous dynasty of the Qin Yuan Kingdom was called the Tianxi Dynasty, which was also the era of Luo Bufan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had received compulsory education and had some understanding of ancient history.</p><p></p><p>Historically, the Tianxi Dynasty was just an ordinary feudal dynasty, without even many cannons.</p><p></p><p>A very ordinary feudal dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything unusual, it was that there were many legends about martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the martial artists recorded in history books were somewhat mythologized.</p><p></p><p>But... in this game, the Tianxi Dynasty was a mythical version.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists could overturn rivers and seas.</p><p></p><p>And... in the Tianxi Dynasty, various monsters also lived.</p><p></p><p>These monsters fed on humans.</p><p></p><p>These things were not in the history textbooks.</p><p></p><p>Either the historians were all gone and the history Qi Yuan wrote was all unofficial, or this was a mythical game version of Tianxi.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this game... he might as well play it first.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was used to being leisurely in urban games.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked up and saw somewhat damp earthen walls with red curtains hanging on them, looking quite festive.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi... I don't want to, I'm not willing, please don't..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a tearful voice came.</p><p></p><p>A dark-skinned, rather ordinary-looking girl held a kitchen knife in her hand, with tears still in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She was wearing a wedding dress, which made her look even darker in the dim light.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the girl's words, more memories flooded in, and Qi Yuan felt quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>The girl before him had a very casual name, called Xiao Mei.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the game's planners had given up and couldn't be bothered to come up with good names.</p><p></p><p>Calling her Xiao Mei (Little Beauty) was one thing, but Xiao Mei wasn't beautiful at all - she was dark-skinned and very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>This Xiao Mei was a child bride that Qi Yuan's game character had picked up.</p><p></p><p>The setting for Qi Yuan's character was that he was a butcher, with some spare money at home, and especially fond of gambling.</p><p></p><p>He had always wanted to marry a beautiful wife, but since the child bride was ordinary-looking, he named her Xiao Mei.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, nine out of ten gamblers lose, and this character owed a large sum of money to the gambling house.</p><p></p><p>Who would have known that the boss behind the gambling house in Yunyan County was a nest of weasels.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Fourth Master Huang came to Qi Yuan to collect the debt. When Qi Yuan couldn't pay, he offered his child bride as collateral.</p><p></p><p>As it happened, Fourth Master Huang liked Xiao Mei's type.</p><p></p><p>Now, Fourth Master Huang had come to receive the bride, preparing to marry Xiao Mei.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Mei held the kitchen knife, tears falling from her eyes like rain: "You saved my life, I'm giving this life back to you. After I marry Fourth Master Huang, we'll be even!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Mei's gaze towards Qi Yuan contained anger, fear, and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "We're even now."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was just a game setting.</p><p></p><p>Was he supposed to call someone "Dad" if the game gave him a father character? Besides, right now, he was here in his true form.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't even using the game character's body, only adjusting his appearance and attire.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's cold and heartless words made Xiao Mei completely despair.</p><p></p><p>She had originally fantasized that Brother Qi would have a change of heart and take her away from Yunyan County.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Just then, a knock on the door broke the silence of the night.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Er, open the door quickly. Is the wedding dress ready? You coward, hurry up and send the young lady out. Don't keep Fourth Master Huang waiting!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Mei held the kitchen knife in her hand, her face covered in tears, but without any sense of beauty in sorrow. Instead, her face was covered in snot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes showed an interested look.</p><p></p><p>"A monster?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he found the monsters of this world quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline martial arts of this world were quite intriguing.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qi Yuan took a step, he was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because... his cultivation level... had decreased.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, he was almost at the peak of Foundation Building, just a bit away from Elemental Core.</p><p></p><p>But now, his cultivation level was only at the peak of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>It was different from his previous gaming experiences.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level had been forcibly reduced by one level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan recalled Great Wisdom True Lord's explanation.</p><p></p><p>In the realm of Nascent Soul, there was a stage called the Realm of Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>For those who had not reached the Realm of Ultimate Principle, rashly entering a world with completely different rules would cause their cultivation level to suddenly drop by a major realm.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Minor Realm of Ultimate Principle would result in dropping by a minor realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was facing this situation.</p><p></p><p>His magical cultivation had dropped by a major realm, but his martial arts cultivation still remained.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan secretly vigilant.</p><p></p><p>But not too much.</p><p></p><p>It was just a game, after all. The important thing was to have fun.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the room door, walked into the courtyard, and threw open the main gate.</p><p></p><p>Outside the gate stood several burly men, thick-waisted and broad-shouldered, looking fierce and menacing.</p><p></p><p>Beside the men was a sedan chair, next to which stood an old man wearing a silk robe. The old man had a kind and benevolent face, with gentle eyes and eyebrows. If seen on TV, he would immediately be recognized as a good person.</p><p></p><p>The old man's body seemed to be covered in thick perfume. From far away, Qi Yuan could smell a strange odor.</p><p></p><p>It was like a smelly person wearing strong, cheap perfume, standing next to you in a closed, dirty elevator that hadn't been cleaned for years - that kind of pungent smell.</p><p></p><p>This old man was Fourth Master Huang. At first glance, he looked human, but upon closer inspection, he had a pair of mouse ears.</p><p></p><p>Before the distinguished guests outside could speak, Qi Yuan spoke first: "Are you a mouse-eared guy?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen cat-eared girls before, and now he was seeing a mouse-eared man.</p><p></p><p>This completely shattered his fantasies about these... creatures.</p><p></p><p>However, in this vast world, nothing is impossible. Perhaps some men don't like young boys but prefer mouse-eared men instead.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you speak to Fourth Master Huang like that? Where's the young lady? Bring her out quickly!" The burly man wore a short, open-chested hemp shirt, revealing yellow chest hair underneath.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yellow Hair, you're just an NPC. How dare you speak to me like that? Don't you know that according to Tianxi law, trespassing into someone's home is illegal!" Qi Yuan was skilled at wielding legal weapons.</p><p></p><p>Although the law is a tool of the ruling class, Qi Yuan, as a successor, saw no harm in using it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a father of two daughters, he despised yellow-haired men.</p><p></p><p>Even though this yellow hair wasn't on his head, who says yellow chest hair isn't yellow hair?</p><p></p><p>The yellow-haired man was furious and embarrassed, ready to give Qi Yuan a beating.</p><p></p><p>He had done this kind of thing many times before.</p><p></p><p>But then Fourth Master Huang spoke elegantly: "Today is a joyous occasion, let's not see blood.</p><p></p><p>I know you're unhappy about me marrying your child bride, Qi Er.</p><p></p><p>But you signed the contract of sale back then."</p><p></p><p>Fourth Master Huang wasn't human, but he loved to pretend to be human and act according to human nature.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Er signed it, what does that have to do with me, Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan cursed loudly and threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't use his magical skills, but his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Having just broken through in martial arts, he needed to practice.</p><p></p><p>Facing these small boss monsters, Qi Yuan once again found the thrill of playing a game.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you've gotten bold? Learning some fake moves and daring to attack Fourth Master Huang? You're asking for death!"</p><p></p><p>Yellow Hair was furious and immediately attacked Qi Yuan. Clearly, he was also a trained fighter. Yesterday, he had easily beaten Qi Er, so he didn't take Qi Yuan seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

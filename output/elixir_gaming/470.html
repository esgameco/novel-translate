        <h1>Chapter 470</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Dao partner?"</p><p></p><p>Being stared at by this black-robed woman, for some reason, Qi Yuan felt goosebumps rising inexplicably in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I have a dao partner, we even got our marriage certificate!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hurriedly replied.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu, who was standing to the side, saw this and said softly: "This is the White Dragon Abyss Master. I invited her here this time because I want her to become your guardian!"</p><p></p><p>A guardian was different from a master, more like an investor. </p><p></p><p>If the White Dragon Abyss Master became Blood Robe's guardian, she would need to protect Blood Robe's safety before he grew up.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, after Blood Robe grew up, he would also need to repay the White Dragon Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this damned Lin Ya Tui, I would naturally be able to protect you completely. Now, with undercurrents surging, I'm finding you a guardian." This sentence was transmitted mentally by Zi Yuan Zu to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss was becoming increasingly complex, even Black Sword had encountered a crisis.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu sensed a strong threat, and he didn't feel he had the confidence to fully protect Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>It was better to send him to the White Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan widened his eyes and looked at the White Dragon Abyss Master: "Are you that White Dragon Abyss Master who can make anyone pregnant just by staring at them?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan very much wanted to run away.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to get pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu's expression changed slightly: "Please forgive Blood Robe, Abyss Master. His personality has always been lively!"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Blood Robe's words would anger the White Dragon Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the White Dragon Abyss Master smiled: "Geniuses are more interesting with some personality."</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, smiling faintly, seeming to particularly appreciate him.</p><p></p><p>However, her next words made Qi Yuan lose his composure.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't mind bearing a child for me, I... will be your guardian and protect you completely. Even if a Supreme wants to kill you, I will ensure the safety of you and our child." The White Dragon Abyss Master's words were shocking.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although he had asked the White Dragon Abyss Master to be Blood Robe's guardian, complete protection was actually limited.</p><p></p><p>If it involved a Supreme, the White Dragon Abyss Master might also back down.</p><p></p><p>But from the White Dragon Abyss Master's meaning, if Blood Robe was willing to bear a child for her, she would even be willing to resist a Supreme for Blood Robe's sake.</p><p></p><p>This was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>As for Blood Robe bearing a child, Zi Yuan Zu actually didn't have any thoughts about it.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was different. He widened his eyes: "Let me bear a child? No way! I'm a man, how can I bear a child!"</p><p></p><p>"Why can't a man bear a child? At our level, who gives birth doesn't matter," the White Dragon Abyss Master said seriously, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu actually didn't have much reaction.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the immortal path, compared to one's own safety, bearing a child was indeed trivial.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master's words just now, if spoken in the Sixth Heaven, who knows how many Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables would be scrambling to bear a child for her.</p><p></p><p>If it were Zi Yuan Zu himself, he would even be somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>After all, the mother gains status through her child.</p><p></p><p>Attaching oneself to the White Dragon Abyss Master, how many years of struggle in life could be saved? Unfortunately, the White Dragon Abyss Master wouldn't be interested in an old man like him.</p><p></p><p>"No, I refuse. My sex is male, and my gender identity is also male!" Qi Yuan said seriously, "We need to recognize the differences and diversity of human bodies."</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master narrowed her eyes and said softly: "Zi Yuan Zu probably hasn't told you that some time ago, there was a great battle in the Outer Heavens, a traitor appeared in the Black Magic Abyss, and Black Sword nearly perished.</p><p></p><p>Even a genius like Black Sword with self-protection abilities nearly died prematurely, not to mention you.</p><p></p><p>If a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable of my level, or even one of Zi Yuan Zu's level, were to use their knowledge against your ignorance, do you think... you could still survive?"</p><p></p><p>What the White Dragon Abyss Master said was the truth, and this was also Zi Yuan Zu's concern.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday someone could secretly plot against Black Sword, today couldn't they plot against Blood Robe? Hearing this, Qi Yuan shook his head: "Since entering the cultivation world, all I have sought is to follow my heart's desires and do as I please.</p><p></p><p>If I go against my true nature, what's the point of cultivating immortality?"</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had only comprehended Absolute Adaptation, perhaps hearing the White Dragon Abyss Master's words, under the influence of the supreme principle he would have agreed.</p><p></p><p>Everything would be for survival.</p><p></p><p>But he had also comprehended Doing As One Pleases.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu sighed softly, then bowed to the White Dragon Abyss Master and said: "I have troubled the Abyss Master."</p><p></p><p>He would respect Blood Robe's choice.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that he might not have the true ability to protect Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master narrowed her eyes. She stared at Qi Yuan, pondering many things, and finally said slowly: "What if I bear a child for you?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu widened his eyes, his beard trembling, clearly shocked by these words.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the White Dragon Abyss Master's true form was of the dragon race, specifically a Dark Abyss White Dragon.</p><p></p><p>This clan was particularly special.</p><p></p><p>Generally, they did not give birth to offspring themselves, but sought dao partners to bear children for them, ensuring the continuation of their clan.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, they often intermarried or formed alliances with other races.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also cases of same-clan dao partners, but these were rare.</p><p></p><p>What the White Dragon Abyss Master said about personally bearing a child for Blood Robe was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Because if a Dark Abyss White Dragon personally gave birth to offspring, it would greatly drain their vitality and endanger their life.</p><p></p><p>No dragon of the Dark Abyss White Dragon clan would choose to personally bear offspring, unless they were already gravely injured and near death.</p><p></p><p>Now, for the White Dragon Abyss Master to compromise so much, how could Zi Yuan Zu not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>If it were a "shrimp-headed man" from the Blue Star, he would probably be overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master also looked at Qi Yuan, very confident.</p><p></p><p>Such conditions were practically a golden opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But she never expected that the response she got was...</p><p></p><p>"I refuse." Qi Yuan flatly rejected, "It's not good to marry and have children without feelings."</p><p></p><p>Although from an outsider's perspective, Qi Yuan would be gaining a huge advantage.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan always felt that men and women were equal, all people were equal.</p><p></p><p>Some people always think that when a man and woman have relations, the man comes out ahead.</p><p></p><p>Is it possible... that he would be losing out?</p><p></p><p>Did he really need the White Dragon Abyss Master as a guardian so badly right now?</p><p></p><p>Actually, he didn't.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, his enemy was that person from the Tai Huang Palace, an irreconcilable foe.</p><p></p><p>If he said this, would the White Dragon Abyss Master really stand firm against that person from the Tai Huang Palace for his sake? Most likely not.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master looked at Qi Yuan, a complex expression in her eyes: "This... you won't agree to this either?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, she was truly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, White Dragon Abyss Master, but I don't need a guardian for now." Qi Yuan's attitude was very firm.</p><p></p><p>Although Zi Yuan Zu was shocked, he finally sighed and said: "It seems Blood Robe and the Abyss Master are not fated to be together."</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze profound, and finally said with disappointment: "If you change your mind, you'll always have the chance to find me."</p><p></p><p>After the White Dragon Abyss Master finished speaking, her form disappeared in that moment.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths later, outside the Black Magic Abyss, a female Great Principle showed shock in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Abyss Master, how could you suddenly want to... bear a child for a junior? Hmph, this person really doesn't know his place, actually refusing the Abyss Master!"</p><p></p><p>This Great Principle was from the White Dragon Abyss. The conversation between Blood Robe and the Abyss Master just now had not been deliberately concealed, and she was not far away, so she naturally heard it.</p><p></p><p>In her heart she was both shocked and very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>She was shocked that the Abyss Master wanted to bear a child for Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't accept it! What qualifications did Blood Robe have! Even if Blood Robe didn't agree, she would still persuade the Abyss Master to give up the idea.</p><p></p><p>A profound look flashed through the White Dragon Abyss Master's eyes, and she asked strangely: "Are there any other dragon clans in the Sixth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Principle woman's expression froze slightly: "No, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Then, her eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Of course there were other dragon clans in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, the Dark Abyss White Dragons considered themselves the orthodox dragon clan, the origin of dragons.</p><p></p><p>The other dragon clans had all been expelled from dragon status by them.</p><p></p><p>They could only be considered mixed-blood dragons, hybrid dragons.</p><p></p><p>Now, for the White Dragon Abyss Master to ask like this?</p><p></p><p>She definitely wasn't referring to those dragons expelled from dragon status.</p><p></p><p>"I smelled the scent of other dragon clans on him, very pure, very... ancient," the White Dragon Abyss Master said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"He actually has dragon clan bloodline?" The Great Principle woman now understood why the Abyss Master would be willing to bear a child for Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>If it were her, she would probably also be unable to resist bearing a child for Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>After all, a child born of two pure dragon clans would be exceptionally formidable! According to the ancient prophecies of the Dark Abyss White Dragon clan, such a child born would definitely achieve the level of Supreme, or even higher.</p><p></p><p>How could the White Dragon Abyss, which had long been in decline and surviving in the cracks, give up such an opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"What level is it, on par with our Dark Abyss White Dragons, or a level higher?" asked the Great Principle woman.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Abyss White Dragon clan had a kind of attitude that below themselves, all were mixed-blood dragons, while above themselves, all dragons were equal.</p><p></p><p>"Unknown," the White Dragon Abyss Master shook her head, "I'd have to take a good look at him... to know."</p><p></p><p>The Great Principle realm woman hesitated, then her gaze became determined: "Abyss Master, since he's unwilling to bear a child for you, should we... kidnap him?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master shook her head, her gaze meaningful: "The current Black Magic Abyss... is full of loopholes. Don't worry, he will beg me to be his guardian. After all... he won't bear to see Zi Yuan Heaven... gone."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Principle woman's gaze sharpened: "Zi Yuan Heaven will...?"</p><p></p><p>"This Lin Ya Tui is presided over by the Tai Huang Palace. The Tai Huang Palace must establish some authority.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, the Moon God Palace has the Moon God Sovereign presiding, so nothing major will happen before the Lin Ya Tui begins.</p><p></p><p>As for that Abyss Master of the Black Magic Abyss... hehe, given the current situation... it's hard to say.</p><p></p><p>He has always been selfish and self-serving, otherwise he wouldn't have snatched his disciple's opportunity back then.</p><p></p><p>Now, for his own sake he will certainly abandon... a few parts, to exchange goodwill for the Tai Huang Palace to stop.</p><p></p><p>The matter from back then has always been a thorn in the heart of the Black Magic Abyss Master. He can't wait to abandon Zi Yuan Heaven... At that time..."</p><p></p><p>"But wouldn't this make us enemies with the Tai Huang Palace?" the Great Principle realm woman said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I may not be able to protect Zi Yuan Zu, but I should be able to protect my husband, right?" A terrifying light flashed in the White Dragon Abyss Master's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the White Dragon Abyss Master, the ruler of a holy land, she naturally had her own confidence.</p><p></p><p>All were thousand-year-old foxes, how could they be so easily killed?</p><p></p><p>Who didn't have some trump cards?</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Qi Yuan heard the White Dragon Abyss Master's words, he would definitely say: "Pah, shrimp-headed woman, I haven't agreed to be your husband yet!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at that moment, Purple Origin Ancestor sighed with regret: "Such a good opportunity, and you didn't seize it. The White Dragon Abyss Master is a famous wealthy woman in the Sixth Heaven. If you could get her pregnant, you could save thousands of years of detours! If you don't want to have children, there are plenty of others who do!"</p><p></p><p>He was truly heartbroken that Blood Robe had missed such a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need," Qi Yuan shook his head. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to rely on his own efforts!</p><p></p><p>As a person from the Blue Star, he had to work hard to get rich, had to struggle, couldn't just lie flat!</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, since the Linya Molt began, danger could strike at any moment. Even Black Sword may not be able to protect himself. With my old bones, I'm afraid I can hardly keep you safe. Why don't you... go to the Moon God Palace instead?" Purple Origin Ancestor said casually as he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was truly worried. </p><p></p><p>Black Sword's injury had sounded the alarm for him.</p><p></p><p>In the Black Magic Abyss, undercurrents were surging, hiding huge crises.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you underestimate me too much. I still have some ability to protect myself!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>He was improving his cultivation every moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you?" Purple Origin Ancestor said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, if we were to really fight, to say something disrespectful, with your old arms and legs, you may not be a match for me."</p><p></p><p>"You're getting cocky!"</p><p></p><p>"Old man, I'm improving myself in every way every moment. What about you?" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed improving himself in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the "Ancestral Blood Scripture" to enhance his Myriad Path Martial God cultivation and strength; refining the Human Emperor Banner; stabilizing his Supreme Principles; and last but most importantly, the number of his Solar Golden Core was constantly increasing, reaching an exaggerated amount.</p><p></p><p>How strong he was now, he actually didn't know.</p><p></p><p>But... pinning down Purple Origin Ancestor shouldn't be much of a problem.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's enemy, that Supreme Lord from the Too Brilliant Palace, was still very powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, you brat!" Purple Origin Ancestor cursed angrily and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, if you encounter any trouble you can't handle, come find me. </p><p></p><p>Considering how filial you are, treating me like your grandfather, I'll reluctantly help you solve it!"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Only an angry curse came from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan shrugged indifferently and returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Just as he reached the entrance of his dwelling, Qi Yuan saw Purple Origin Xiaolu waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe, you went out?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving, Purple Origin Xiaolu had gone to find information about strange lands for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I went to see a shrimp-headed woman. Sigh... the atmosphere in this immortal realm is too bad and needs to be rectified. Running into any random woman turns out to be a shrimp-headed woman!" Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Waves Realm was better.</p><p></p><p>At first, the atmosphere there wasn't good either, with many shrimp-headed men and women.</p><p></p><p>Many people had nothing to do and cursed each other online all day.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was there to beat people up through the internet, establish the Blood Palace, and correct the atmosphere of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Now the Azure Waves Realm could be considered one big loving family, harmonious and friendly.</p><p></p><p>The current Sixth Heaven had too many problems.</p><p></p><p>Those with corrupt morals, those who inhaled sharply causing global warming, those who could make others pregnant with a glare - all kinds of weirdos abounded.</p><p></p><p>This also caused Qi Yuan to be afraid to go out casually. What if someone saw him and suddenly got pregnant?</p><p></p><p>What about his innocence?</p><p></p><p>"Ah? What shrimp-headed woman?" Purple Origin Xiaolu clenched her fists, somewhat indignantly. "What did she do to you, Senior Brother Blood Robe?"</p><p></p><p>"She wanted me to have her child!"</p><p></p><p>"That's so shrimp-headed!" Purple Origin Xiaolu nodded. To actually ask Senior Brother Blood Robe to have a child.</p><p></p><p>She wouldn't even bear to let Senior Brother Blood Robe have a child.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't a beautiful man be cherished?</p><p></p><p>If anyone was to give birth, it should be her giving birth for Senior Brother Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>"Later, seeing I wasn't easy to persuade, she said she wanted to keep me and she would give birth instead," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu was angry, her cheeks puffed up: "She's really thinking too beautifully. How could there be such a good thing in this world? Senior Brother Blood Robe, who is she? I'll go educate her personally. She's too shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"You want to go argue with her and take her down?" Qi Yuan blinked. "But she's quite powerful. I'm afraid you're no match for her."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Purple Origin Xiaolu felt warmth in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Blood Robe was concerned about her.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong she is, Xiaolu isn't afraid. Xiaolu will condemn her, and Xiaolu will work hard to become stronger!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, she's the master of the White Dragon Abyss. She probably hasn't gone far yet. You can still catch her to scold her a few times."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Ah? Ah?" Purple Origin Xiaolu's eyes widened, her face showing an expression of disbelief. "The master of... White Dragon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the old man wanted her to be my guardian, but she would only agree if I gave her a child. Sigh, being too handsome when going out is really too dangerous. You get harassed at every turn." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Purple Origin Xiaolu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This news was like a bolt from the blue.</p><p></p><p>But then she said pitifully: "Senior Brother Blood Robe, I don't dare scold this White Dragon Abyss Master. Xiaolu doesn't want to... carry her child!"</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master was known to make anyone pregnant with just a glare.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu didn't want to get pregnant before marriage.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's fine. These are all small problems." Qi Yuan said nonchalantly. He slowly asked, "Did you sort out the matter of the strange lands?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Purple Origin Xiaolu immediately entered work mode.</p><p></p><p>"I've found them. There are three strange lands that meet the conditions!" Purple Origin Xiaolu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, which three?"</p><p></p><p>"The first strange land is the Star Drunk Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>From this strange land, one can see the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts of Ghost Pass from afar. Also, one day in the Sixth Heaven is about twelve days in the Star Drunk Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>This strange land is the safest among the three. Senior Brother Blood Robe would be very safe if you sneak in secretly."</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"The time flow is a bit slow. What about the other two?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>It would probably take quite a long time to see the flaws in the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"The second strange land is called the Lotus Strange Land. One day in the Sixth Heaven is thirty days in the Lotus Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>But this strange land produces a kind of lotus wine. Even if a Yang Spirit enters, they might become lost in drunken dreams. It's very dangerous." Purple Origin Xiaolu said nervously.</p><p></p><p>This strange land was very dangerous. She didn't recommend Senior Brother Blood Robe to go there.</p><p></p><p>"What about the last one?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu hesitated a bit, but still said: "For the last strange land, one day in the Sixth Heaven is about a year and a half in the strange land."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This one is not bad!" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>This way, wouldn't it take very little time for him to find the flaws in the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts?</p><p></p><p>Not only could he openly sneak into Ghost Pass, he might even be able to claim this phantom for himself.</p><p></p><p>"But in this strange land... there seems to be a Yang Spirit of the Holy Light Clan!" Mentioning this, Purple Origin Xiaolu seemed a bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying nature of the Holy Light Clan was almost common knowledge among the major holy lands of the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This race came from outside the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators would believe whatever they said.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Spirits at the Great Supreme Principle realm would stay as far away as possible from the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Light Clan?" Qi Yuan showed a curious expression. "How interesting. I'm very curious about this clan."</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, Qi Yuan himself would also believe what the Holy Light Clan said, but his nose would grow longer.</p><p></p><p>This contrast was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not afraid of the Holy Light Clan." Qi Yuan asked seriously, "Where is this strange land located?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Purple Origin Xiaolu hesitated: "Senior Brother Blood Robe, the Holy Light Clan is very terrifying. I don't dare tell you, I'm afraid you..."</p><p></p><p>"Relax, I've seen the Holy Light Clan before. I even killed one of them once." Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Back then, it took him a huge effort to kill East Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Purple Origin Xiaolu was a bit skeptical.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, don't you trust me? I always act with confidence. I don't do things I'm not sure about.</p><p></p><p>I'm also very planned. Remember my great plan? Didn't that Hui Zeng die... just as planned?"</p><p></p><p>It would have been better not to mention the plan. Mentioning the plan made Purple Origin Xiaolu even more speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe, Celestial Venerable Hui Zeng died at the hands of the Human Emperor Hall Envoy!" Purple Origin Xiaolu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if not for my great plan, how would he have died? All of this was within my plan and arrangements!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"..." At this moment, Purple Origin Xiaolu suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Blood Robe had asked her to find strange lands, and ones that could see the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts!</p><p></p><p>Now, the one most interested in the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts was that Human Emperor Hall Envoy! A crazy guess arose in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe, do you know the Human Emperor Hall Envoy?" She lowered her voice and asked secretly, with a very sneaky look.</p><p></p><p>"Know him? I suppose so, but also not really." Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>Does one know oneself?</p><p></p><p>What does that mean? Hearing this, huge waves surged in Purple Origin Xiaolu's heart.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious and powerful Human Emperor Hall Envoy, Senior Brother Blood Robe actually knew him! Thinking of this, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Senior Brother Blood Robe wouldn't go to that strange land. If anyone went, it would be that Human Emperor Hall Envoy.</p><p></p><p>"That strange land is called the Tianken Strange Land. Its specific location is..." Purple Origin Xiaolu didn't conceal anything. She continued, "Senior Brother Blood Robe must tell the Human Emperor Hall Envoy that there may be Holy Light Clan members in the strange land!"</p><p></p><p>"The name of this strange land... is interesting. A coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Mm, don't worry. By the way, don't tell anyone about this matter today!" Qi Yuan thought for a moment and instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Purple Origin Xiaolu nodded vigorously. "Senior Brother Blood Robe, you know, Xiaolu's mouth is very tight. I absolutely won't leak anything!"</p><p></p><p>She was a bit excited now, after all, she was doing big things for Senior Brother Blood Robe and the Human Emperor Hall Envoy.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had participated in formulating the great plan, and even offered suggestions to make the plan more detailed.</p><p></p><p>So, when the Human Emperor Hall Envoy executed the great plan and killed the Yang Spirit, Purple Origin Xiaolu also had a share of the credit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Purple Origin Xiaolu's little mouth and nodded in approval: "I trust your mouth!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu left the cave dwelling with an elated heart.</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, Qi Yuan looked in the direction of the Tianken Strange Land's location, his gaze surging: "One day equals a year and a half. Strive to... turn Ghost Ruling Heaven upside down in half a month!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

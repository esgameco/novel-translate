        <h1>Chapter 155</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord looked at Qi Yuan and said, "Since you don't want to shatter your own golden core, why not shatter someone else's golden core to form your own divine infant?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at everyone present, and finally said bitterly, "Their golden cores are too weak, I'm not interested."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the several prodigies present changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>"I, Lu, am untalented, but I have condensed an earth-grade golden core using ten thousand years of Profound Yin Qi. When this golden core emerges, it turns three miles of land into Profound Yin. May I ask, friend, is this golden core weak?" One of the prodigies couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The singing girls on the flower boat heard this and all showed envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, being able to form a golden core is already a joyous occasion.</p><p></p><p>The golden cores usually formed are from ninth grade to first grade. </p><p></p><p>Those who can form profound-grade, earth-grade or heaven-grade cores are one in a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>There are over a billion living beings in the hundred countries. As a result, apart from Qi Yuan, the highest was Kang Fulu's first-grade golden core.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at that prodigy and said regretfully, "Weak."</p><p></p><p>Turning three miles of land into Profound Yin? That's nothing!</p><p></p><p>He could kill that with a kitchen knife when he was at the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of golden core did you form then? Take it out and let us see?" That prodigy sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head, "I'm afraid if I take it out, you'll all die."</p><p></p><p>A stellar golden core can't just be summoned at will.</p><p></p><p>"You just don't dare to take it out." That prodigy mocked coldly.</p><p></p><p>They naturally thought Qi Yuan was boasting.</p><p></p><p>The other prodigies laughed and said, "Lu Yi, perhaps his is a celestial-grade golden core, so of course he looks down on your earth-grade golden core."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored them. These people were too young, it would take thousands of years for them to grow into his ideal. He couldn't be bothered to pay them any attention.</p><p></p><p>He continued to ask the Great Wisdom True Lord for help: "Their golden cores are too weak, I really can't be interested. Are there any other methods?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord said, "Do you know why the divine infant is called a divine infant?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he really didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, isn't it just shattering the core to form the infant, and having the divine soul take control?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I don't know either," the Great Wisdom True Lord spoke, "But based on my many years of reading ancient texts,</p><p></p><p>I speculate that the divine infant is the foundation of the Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, once one enters the realm of the Yin Spirit, one can give birth to a Primordial Spirit that can roam the Great Void.</p><p></p><p>How do you think this Primordial Spirit is born?"</p><p></p><p>The divine soul is a cultivator's spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Spirit is an even more mysterious thing.</p><p></p><p>At the Primordial Core realm, one's divine soul can leave the body.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Spirit is an existence of an even higher level than the divine soul, and can enter the legendary Great Void.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Primordial Spirit evolves from the divine infant?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's my guess too. They both have the word 'divine' in them, so there must be some connection.</p><p></p><p>So... all Yin Spirits, and even Yang Spirits, their Primordial Spirits are divine infants." The Great Wisdom True Lord told Qi Yuan his discovery.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at the star projections in the sky and widened his eyes: "Are immortals and gods all divine infants?"</p><p></p><p>"I've told you this, but don't tell anyone else. There's great karma involved in this." The Great Wisdom True Lord said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The singing girls on the flower boat and those prodigies were speechless when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Saying immortals and gods are divine infants, how daring.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone else about this." Qi Yuan glanced at everyone on the flower boat.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, everyone present couldn't help but feel a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord nodded: "Do you know what my divine infant is?"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord's expression became sorrowful: "My dao companion went mad and perished. I took her hair and made it into an external pill, and her body formed the golden core.</p><p></p><p>My divine infant is her hair.</p><p></p><p>I hope that one day, when I advance to the Yin Spirit realm,</p><p></p><p>The divine infant will transform and be able to nurture... her Primordial Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't good at comforting people, so he said, "I wish you success."</p><p></p><p>"I'll take your kind words." A sharp light flashed in the Great Wisdom True Lord's eyes, "One day, she will be reborn from the ashes in my divine infant!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts drifted far away.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Five Ancestors - Metal Ancestor, Water Ancestor, Earth Ancestor and others in the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the five of them sacrificed themselves to achieve Qi Yuan's Five Elements Qi, and also allowed Qi Yuan to successfully control the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>If he were to condense a divine infant according to his wishes,</p><p></p><p>In the future, when he enters the Yin Spirit realm, could those old acquaintances walk out of his divine infant? Of course, Qi Yuan was just thinking.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord said at this time: "The coexistence of golden core and divine infant is already going against heaven, and may incur heavenly punishment. Friend, take care of yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Solar True Fire had already been ignited on the stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>The potential of this golden core would also become infinite.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's view, given enough time, he could even devour all the stars in a universe.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan didn't enter the divine infant realm, he could still become stronger by strengthening his stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>So, even if he didn't perfect the "Qi Yuan Scripture", he could still slowly grow into a top expert in the myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>The golden core was originally an invincible path, why need to condense another divine infant?</p><p></p><p>But obviously, Qi Yuan had ambitions.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to improve himself in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>The "Qi Yuan Scripture" naturally needed to be perfected.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant also needed to be formed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for telling me this, friend. I've benefited greatly." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The path of the divine infant was not yet fully determined, but Qi Yuan already had quite a few ideas.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and Qi Yuan returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The ice queen of the Divine Flower Society had passed on hundreds of techniques to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These techniques were all from her sisters for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were four heaven-grade techniques, dozens of profound-grade techniques, and countless jade-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly went from a pauper to a temporary rich man.</p><p></p><p>"With so many techniques, it should be enough for me to advance the 'Qi Yuan Scripture', right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately devoted himself wholeheartedly to the great cause of adapting techniques.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>The day of the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle was getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>There were more and more prodigies in Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Every day, one could see the figures of some prodigies flying in the sky of Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned a deaf ear to everything outside and focused only on perfecting the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>One day, Qi Yuan suddenly woke up.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Land Prodigy Battle is in two days..." Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Qi Yuan's "Qi Yuan Scripture" had progressed to a critical point.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle.</p><p></p><p>But remembering that the top twenty in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle could obtain the qualification to enter the Wangyue Continent, as well as the Sect Master's entrustment, Qi Yuan's gaze became determined.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still have to participate in this Eastern Land Prodigy Battle."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan walked out of his cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kang Fulu was talking with a cat girl outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was on a nearby bodhi tree, seemingly pondering some difficult problem.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu saw Qi Yuan and was somewhat surprised: "Junior brother, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>"To participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle." Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu looked horrified: "Today?"</p><p></p><p>He slapped his thigh, thinking he had forgotten the date.</p><p></p><p>But when he checked the date, he looked at Qi Yuan strangely again: "Isn't it in two days? Why are you going now?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to see if there's any back door I can use." Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Back door?" Kang Fulu's expression became even stranger, he asked Jiang Ya in the distance, "Is there a back door for the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya woke from her contemplation and glanced at Qi Yuan: "The Eastern Land Prodigy Battle is jointly decided by three Yin Spirits, there is no back door at all."</p><p></p><p>"There were originally no back doors in the world, but when many people walk them, they appear." Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, after he said this, he felt that this sentence was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu looked at Qi Yuan and didn't say anything more: "Junior brother... I wish you success in finding a back door."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left this inn.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's appearance had changed greatly, and he had changed into a blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>He stopped in front of a palace, his eyes showing a hint of joy: "Finally found it."</p><p></p><p>The palace ahead was quiet and deserted.</p><p></p><p>The boy at the front gate was dozing off, seemingly falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the boy.</p><p></p><p>The boy in his dream seemed to sense something and suddenly woke up: "Who... who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, inexplicably frightened.</p><p></p><p>"I... a Golden Core cultivator participating in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking." Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>The fear in the boy's heart dissipated somewhat, and he slowly asked, "What are you doing here to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the person in charge of this Eastern Land Prodigy Battle, the great cultivator Feng Lan, resides here."</p><p></p><p>"No visitors</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young servant heard this and his face filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were two Purple Mansion cultivators in Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>One was the master of the Cloud Palace, and the other was the powerful Wind Orchid.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, some ignorant cultivators would come to visit the powerful Wind Orchid.</p><p></p><p>The man before him was probably one of them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the door opened and a tall woman walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Ming Ri, what's going on?" asked the tall woman.</p><p></p><p>"This person has come to seek an audience with the master," the young servant quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuanze looked at the tall woman, his eyes showing surprise: "Nose Booger Immortal, I didn't expect to see you here. What a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the tall woman's hands.</p><p></p><p>The nails on her fingers were now trimmed short, the long nails likely cut recently.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh, these geniuses really do listen to advice. After he said long nails with nail polish were not good for picking nose boogers, she immediately cut her nails and switched to using magical techniques instead.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wind Moon Immortal's expression changed drastically, her anger rising rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the most famous person in Cloud City, besides the top three on the Genius Rankings, was her, with her new nickname of Nose Booger Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Even her sisters used this to mock her.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, one of her suitors secretly sent her a magical technique. When she opened it, it was a nose-picking spell!</p><p></p><p>She was so angry! She wanted nothing more than to beat up Great Wisdom True Lord and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, she ultimately didn't bully the weak. She thought that after the Eastern Land Genius Battle began, she would definitely challenge that Qi Yuan and teach him a lesson.</p><p></p><p>Now, a stranger directly called her Nose Booger Immortal. How could she not be angry?</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" she looked at Qi Yuan, fuming.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't give an explanation, she would definitely beat him up.</p><p></p><p>"I am... the Blood Robe Sword God," Qi Yuan calmly stated his name.</p><p></p><p>"What? Blood Robe Sword God?" Wind Moon Immortal was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Fear and awe welled up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't attended the Fish Dragon Banquet and hadn't seen the Blood Robe Sword God in person.</p><p></p><p>But she naturally knew of the Blood Robe Sword God's strength and terrifying reputation.</p><p></p><p>He was a fierce character, single-handedly destroying the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Why did he come here? Wind Moon Immortal didn't even consider that the blood-robed man before her might be an imposter.</p><p></p><p>Because the Blood Robe Sword God's infamous reputation preceded him.</p><p></p><p>No one would dare to impersonate him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, many people knew that the Blood Robe Sword God had provoked the Ye Qiong Venerable, almost offending him.</p><p></p><p>Impersonating the Blood Robe Sword God would be asking for death.</p><p></p><p>And looking carefully at the Blood Robe Sword God before her, she couldn't discern his strength at all.</p><p></p><p>It must be the real Blood Robe Sword God without a doubt!</p><p></p><p>Her heart was filled with both fear and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Even a big shot like the Blood Robe Sword God knew of her... Nose Booger Immortal nickname?</p><p></p><p>For someone of the Blood Robe Sword God's caliber, living for ten thousand years was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Which meant that for at least ten thousand years, she wouldn't be able to shake off this Nose Booger Immortal nickname.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please wait a moment. I'll go notify the Ancestor right away!"</p><p></p><p>"Just take me in directly, it'll save time," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Wind Moon Immortal's expression changed, but she eventually nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this time, deep in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid was playing chess with the master of Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect such a major event to occur after just one month in Emerald Cloud Continent," Wind Orchid sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace master also revealed a melancholy expression: "Who could have imagined that the mighty Palace of Light would be destroyed overnight.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe Sword God is truly a god of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>I really don't know how he managed to destroy the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that, as he claimed, the falling of the great sun that day was really related to him?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible," Wind Orchid shook his head, "In this world... there can only be one, you know what I mean."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Cloud Palace master also fell silent, not daring to say more.</p><p></p><p>One must be cautious when speaking of Venerables, especially that particular Venerable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wind Orchid said with a worried expression: "Once the Eastern Land Genius Battle is over, I need to hurry back. Staying in Emerald Cloud Continent is too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>If I don't die from the great calamity but end up dying here, that would be too unlucky."</p><p></p><p>He was very afraid of the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Because he was currently in charge of the Eastern Land Genius Battle, serving the three Yin God Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Nominally, he could be considered a temporary subordinate of Ye Qiong Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Robe Sword God found out about this.</p><p></p><p>Based on their understanding of the Blood Robe Sword God, that madman would definitely kill him.</p><p></p><p>Who in Emerald Cloud Continent wasn't afraid of the Blood Robe Sword God now? Justice destroying evil?</p><p></p><p>It was more like a giant demon destroying evil!</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, the Blood Robe Sword God has arrived." Just then, an urgent mental message came through.</p><p></p><p>The chess piece in Wind Orchid's hand suddenly fell to the ground, and his face revealed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace master looked surprised: "What's wrong, friend?"</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to run quickly. The Blood Robe Sword God has come to kill me!" Wind Orchid was terrified, his face full of grief.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, he ultimately didn't manage to escape.</p><p></p><p>Because before he could leave, he felt a pair of terrifying eyes lock onto him.</p><p></p><p>"Preparing to run as soon as you see me, are you a bad person? If you're a bad person, I, the Blood Robe Sword God, must carry out heaven's will!" Qi Yuan's lazy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Even though Wind Orchid was a Purple Mansion cultivator, his soul couldn't help but tremble. His face twisted as he said: "Not running... need to pee... urgent need to pee."</p><p></p><p>"Your Wind family is really strange. One picks nose boogers, another needs to pee urgently," Qi Yuan glanced at Wind Moon, then at Wind Orchid.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wind Orchid felt somewhat embarrassed, a hint of confusion flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Because from the Blood Robe Sword God's tone, it seemed he hadn't come to kill him?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with utmost respect: "To what do we owe the honor of the Blood Robe Sword God's visit? What business do you have with this humble one?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, where was his demeanor as a Purple Mansion powerhouse? He looked just like a small fry.</p><p></p><p>After all, facing a Yin God, he would only feel reverence.</p><p></p><p>But facing the Blood Robe Sword God, it was pure terror.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a great demon.</p><p></p><p>"I signed up for the Eastern Land Genius Battle a while ago," Qi Yuan spoke, casually finding a chair to sit down.</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God signed up for the Eastern Land Genius Battle?</p><p></p><p>Why would a Purple Mansion powerhouse sign up for the Eastern Land Genius Battle?</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I've been delving into cultivation techniques recently and have reached a crucial stage. I can't attend the Eastern Land Genius Battle.</p><p></p><p>Is it possible to postpone the date of the Eastern Land Genius Battle?" Qi Yuan asked mildly.</p><p></p><p>Since he was asking for a favor, his tone was very amiable.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... the Eastern Land Genius Battle cannot be delayed," Wind Orchid said with a troubled expression, utterly confused inside.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God must be at least ten thousand years old, right? At such an advanced age, he couldn't possibly enter the battlefield of the Eastern Land Genius Battle.</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid explained to Qi Yuan why it couldn't be delayed, mainly because the opening time of the secret realm was fixed and couldn't be artificially changed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan looked at Wind Orchid: "In your opinion, how do I compare to the top ten geniuses on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings? Who's stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid was completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>Was this big shot just messing with him?</p><p></p><p>"Of course Senior is stronger!" he carefully answered.</p><p></p><p>"You see, you've admitted I'm stronger. Doesn't that mean if I participate in the Eastern Land Genius Battle, I would definitely make it into the top twenty?" </p><p></p><p>"You could," Wind Orchid could only nod. He glanced at Qi Yuan and weakly said, "It's just that Senior's age is a bit high. The Eastern Land Genius Battle is only for young people under 200 years old."</p><p></p><p>"I'm very young. I'm only twenty... not even thirty years old this year," Qi Yuan stated firmly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had originally intended to tell the truth.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, he was already married to Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>Getting married before twenty would violate marriage laws, so he inflated his age a bit.</p><p></p><p>In the room, the Cloud Palace master watched this scene, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Wind Moon Immortal stood to the side, wanting to laugh but not daring to.</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid's expression was strained: "Senior... indeed looks very young."</p><p></p><p>"Not just looks, I am young!" Qi Yuan corrected Wind Orchid's mistake.</p><p></p><p>"So, my strength qualifies, my age is suitable, for participating in the Eastern Land Genius Battle. If not top three, I should at least make top ten, right? Since the result would be the same, let's not bother with the process and just directly place me in the top ten," Qi Yuan said imperiously.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, this feeling of using connections felt really good.</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Was the Blood Robe Sword God even speaking human language? If it were anyone else, even a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, he would dare to curse them for being shameless.</p><p></p><p>But facing the Blood Robe Sword God, he truly didn't dare to refute.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... still needs to be reported to the three Yin God Venerables. I... don't have the authority to decide," Wind Orchid said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Then hurry up and report it. I want the result quickly," Qi Yuan urged, his voice turning cold, "If you maliciously obstruct me from getting into the top twenty of the Eastern Land Genius Battle, that would be making an enemy of me!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, cold sweat broke out on Wind Orchid's forehead: "I'll report it right away!"</p><p></p><p>Even with ten lives, he wouldn't dare to be enemies with the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The fate of the Palace of Light was still fresh in memory.</p><p></p><p>A top power in Emerald Cloud Continent with a legacy of ten thousand years, destroyed just like that!

        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand the scene in the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>Even now, she still didn't understand how the Blood Lord had managed to walk out of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons. </p><p></p><p>Even she would become a great demon if she entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>How was the Blood Lord able to walk out?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Tao felt an inexplicable pain in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but recall the blood-colored robe she had seen that day outside the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>Was it a coincidence? The scene shifted again.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Jiupan, a colorful little bird flapped its wings and landed next to a drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>There was a curious look in the bird's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The story continued.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a canary, aren't I pretty? I'm the most beautiful in all of Mount Jiupan!"</p><p></p><p>"You round little thing, I'll call you... Blood Bead."</p><p></p><p>"You left without saying goodbye, I won't go looking for you, I won't miss you!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead, it's raining..."</p><p></p><p>If the previous scenes were like a sad song in a winter snowscape,</p><p></p><p>The current scenes were like a gentle spring rain, fresh with a hint of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead, you're amazing, quickly tell everyone that the canary is the most beautiful in all eighteen mountains!"</p><p></p><p>"He's not a great demon, he won't die!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll reluctantly believe you this once!"</p><p></p><p>"How to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons..."</p><p></p><p>The girl left the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons. On her face that she was so proud of and often showed off, a character for "demon" was now engraved.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so stupid, I can't even put on makeup properly, I look so ugly..."</p><p></p><p>"Am I very ugly? Why don't you come see me?"</p><p></p><p>The scene ended abruptly here.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao covered her left cheek with her hand. It hurt.</p><p></p><p>Countless memories flooded into her mind like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>Thousands, tens of thousands of years of endless memories.</p><p></p><p>There were Blood Bead's whispers in her ear, and also the cold sword of that blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>She remembered.</p><p></p><p>She... was the most beautiful in Mount Jiupan, the canary.</p><p></p><p>Blood Bead, her most admired childhood sweetheart.</p><p></p><p>Life after life, reincarnation in the illusory realm.</p><p></p><p>She entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, watching Blood Bead sink into the illusion, constantly trying to awaken him.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead..." Ning Tao covered her face, feeling inexplicably hesitant.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the gentleness in the eyes of that blood-colored figure she saw outside the City of No Return that day.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the canary? She's a very tsundere, very vain girl. I've been looking for her all this time."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Venerable One's lips curled into a smile as she looked at Ning Tao and asked: "Demon girl, have you remembered all your memories now? Do you hate the great demon now?"</p><p></p><p>She seemed to care very much about this.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked up coldly at her: "He is not a great demon!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Bead had said she wasn't a great demon!</p><p></p><p>She believed it!</p><p></p><p>Even in the illusion, when she saw him slaughter countless lives, when she saw him stab her again and again with his sword.</p><p></p><p>She still believed he wasn't a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Everyone said he was a great demon, but the canary knew he was just her childhood sweetheart, he wasn't anyone else.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, another self-deceiver." Shang Yanran laughed, then looked at Baize, "We were husband and wife once, and they are my junior brother and sister. I'm willing to let them off, but... the demon girl, I have to kill her, or... take her away."</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura emanated from Shang Yanran's body, enough to move a great sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The seven powerful figures behind her also took a step forward, pressing towards Baize.</p><p></p><p>"This time... no one can save you, demon girl." A cold light flashed in Shang Yanran's eyes. "Only by dealing with the demon girl and the great demon can this world truly find peace.</p><p></p><p>Baize... do you really want to stop me?</p><p></p><p>Can you stop me?</p><p></p><p>Or are you disregarding the lives of all under heaven for your own selfish desires?"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura emanated from Shang Yanran's body.</p><p></p><p>The demon girl, she must take away.</p><p></p><p>In the past, she thought the Blood Lord was dead, and simply let the Thirteen Demons of the North roam free, using them as pawns.</p><p></p><p>But recently, her avatar in the mortal realm sensed a trace of the Blood Lord's aura.</p><p></p><p>So, the canary must be in her grasp.</p><p></p><p>In this life, what she coveted most was Baize, and now, there was also the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Baize looked at Shang Yanran, hesitation flashing in his eyes before he said: "She is not a demon girl, even if she was... that was two reincarnations ago.</p><p></p><p>If you want to take her away, you'll have to go through me!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, no one... can stop me!" Shang Yanran's face twisted into a grimace.</p><p></p><p>Today, no matter who comes, she will take the canary away!</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor was desolate.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was right.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't stop her at all.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's avatar, plus those seven powerful figures, could easily take Ning Tao away.</p><p></p><p>Even if his master came, he probably couldn't stop Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>This matter... had become an unsolvable situation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, comprehending the origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Ten years had passed.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension had deepened, but he still couldn't truly engrave it, and the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra couldn't reach the subtle level.</p><p></p><p>"Forget... what exactly have I forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered hard but gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, intermittent voices sounded in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead..."</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead..."</p><p></p><p>The voice was miserable, with a hint of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart suddenly skipped a beat, as if he saw the canary with tears streaming down her face, eyes red, stubbornly looking up at him helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes poured into his mind like an avalanche.</p><p></p><p>He saw himself trapped in the reincarnation of the great demon, slaughtering the living according to the great demon's path.</p><p></p><p>He saw himself walking in the desert wearing a blood-colored robe, with a figure whose face he couldn't see chasing behind, pierced by his sword.</p><p></p><p>He saw himself tied to a stone pillar, suffering the burning of ten thousand fires, with that figure unhesitatingly throwing herself on him, enduring endless pain together.</p><p></p><p>He saw that figure holding him, jumping into the rolling lava without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>He saw himself wounding that figure with his sword again and again, but that figure still came to find him without hesitation in every life, accompanying him, facing the hostility of the world together.</p><p></p><p>In the illusion, that figure truly existed, not his delusion.</p><p></p><p>He understood that figure was the canary.</p><p></p><p>"Canary..."</p><p></p><p>The endless illusions were like reincarnation after reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Those... were illusions, the life of the great demon.</p><p></p><p>Originally, entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, he experienced the life of the great demon.</p><p></p><p>The canary broke in, trying to awaken him.</p><p></p><p>"I remember now."</p><p></p><p>All the scenes turned into endless emotions.</p><p></p><p>A hint of pity appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>And a hint of irritation.</p><p></p><p>The desire to see the canary became more urgent.</p><p></p><p>"After she sank into the illusion with me... where exactly is she?"</p><p></p><p>Countless emotions erupted from Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Demon Attraction of the Void Realm Ruler seemed about to gush out, uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan recalled everything that happened in the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra also thoroughly entered the subtle level at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart was filled with mixed emotions, along with intense self-blame and pity.</p><p></p><p>He calmed himself down.</p><p></p><p>"Why can I hear the canary's voice..."</p><p></p><p>He heard the canary's voice, then recalled all the memories.</p><p></p><p>Why did he hear it? This was important.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Foundation Establishment stage, Qi Yuan's ears could hear some strange sounds.</p><p></p><p>Before entering this game, he had heard Ning Tao's voice.</p><p></p><p>Where was the source of the voice? Where was the canary? Who... was she now?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an aggrieved voice with a crying tone fell into his ears again.</p><p></p><p>"Am I very ugly? Why don't you come see me?"</p><p></p><p>The canary's voice fell into his ears like a bolt from the blue.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly remembered.</p><p></p><p>At Seven-Colored Peak, he had heard Ning Tao murmuring in her dream: "Am I very ugly? Why don't you come see me?"</p><p></p><p>He had heard such sleep talk more than once.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he always treated these as jokes, even mocking Ning Tao for sleep talking despite being a sovereign.</p><p></p><p>During the Ten Thousand Mile Great Escape, Ning Tao carried the blood ball and fought with the great sovereign.</p><p></p><p>When night fell, she curled up like a kitten, with Qi Yuan guarding by her side.</p><p></p><p>He had also heard Ning Tao's tearful sleep talk.</p><p></p><p>He understood! Completely understood! Ning Tao was the canary.</p><p></p><p>On Ning Tao's face, the character for "demon" was engraved.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Demons of the North, hated by heaven and annoying to people. In the eyes of the world, she was like an ugly monster.</p><p></p><p>The canary who loved beauty so much had become a "demon" despised by the world, hated by everyone, seen as the ugliest monster.</p><p></p><p>How could she bear such pain?</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How could she bear his sword strikes, one after another, in the illusory realm?</p><p></p><p>At that time, under the influence of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, he had fallen into the trajectory of a great demon's life, slaughtering the masses like a great demon would.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the great demon, there was always someone waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"Canary... Ning Tao..."</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming aura swept over his body, and at this moment, the sky of the entire No Return City turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already found the path of inscription for the Heart Demon Summoning of the Void Realm Ruler.</p><p></p><p>Within the barrier, the White Emperor's avatar was imprisoned by Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>The seven supreme beings also approached the Thirteen Demons of the Northern Demons, all the way to Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>A smile curved Shang Yanran's lips: "In the past, you had the Blood Lord to protect you. Today... who can protect you?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at Shang Yanran, her eyes filled with intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hoarse voice filled with endless self-blame rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Canary, I'm late."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you."</p><p></p><p>The chains tightly gripped in Canary's hands trembled at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Various terrifying auras emanated from that blood-colored flesh ball.</p><p></p><p>When Shang Yanran saw that blood ball, a hint of surprise flashed in her eyes: "Blood Lord? No, you are a drop of the Blood Lord's blood!"</p><p></p><p>In the past, when the Blood Lord entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, he had cut off his own arm and left it by Canary's side.</p><p></p><p>Later, when the Blood Lord perished in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, only a single drop of blood flew out.</p><p></p><p>The blood ball before them was that very drop of the Blood Lord's blood!</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's thin figure trembled at this moment. She tightly gripped the chains, glancing at that blood-colored flesh ball. That glance seemed to span oceans and mulberry fields, as if a single glance crossed ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>She finally saw again the person she had been thinking of and dreaming about throughout endless ages.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood-colored flesh ball also condensed into a figure in a blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl!" She tightly embraced the blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>Just like when the great fire spread before, she had unhesitatingly embraced him, perishing together in the sea of flames.</p><p></p><p>A smile played on Shang Yanran's lips: "How touching. Great Demon... you've finally deigned to show yourself."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan in the blood-colored robe looked at Shang Yanran, a cold smile also appearing on his lips: "Today, you must die!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shang Yanran's smile grew wider: "Never mind just a drop of your blood, even if you, the Blood Lord himself were here in person, you might not be a match for this avatar of mine.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, can your true self even come here now?"</p><p></p><p>Canary tightly gripped Qi Yuan's arm.</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with excitement. He had never expected to see his mentor at this time: "Master, do not come here unless you've reached the sixth realm! Shang Yanran has obtained the Fate Tablet, she is no longer herself!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran smiled brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>It was just a drop of blood after all, not even capable of harming a Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>How could it possibly take Ning Tao away from her hands?</p><p></p><p>"Great Demon, I'm taking Canary away today. If you want to see her, come find me at the Palace of Ten Thousand Demons with your true body!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was extremely calm, his previous endless self-blame and guilt transformed into surging killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Even a drop of blood can kill you!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, terrifying changes occurred on the figure condensed from his drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Soul Blood!</p><p></p><p>The Soul Blood that fell from the Great Void was used by Qi Yuan at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Blood obtained from Old Demon Black Chicken could be parasitic on treasures.</p><p></p><p>Condensing that treasure into a soul weapon.</p><p></p><p>What kind of treasure could be more precious than a drop of his blood?</p><p></p><p>This was a drop of blood from the foundation of the Heavenly Way!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan condensed himself into a soul weapon.</p><p></p><p>As the Soul Blood fell, Qi Yuan's blood underwent a huge transformation.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Canary: "Wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>After becoming a soul weapon, he would no longer be able to descend his consciousness here.</p><p></p><p>The blood-robed figure kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Inscription!</p><p></p><p>In No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a great shout.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why he had been unable to inscribe his origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>In the illusory realm, he had cut off an arm, forgetting the consciousness forced upon him by the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, that consciousness being that he was the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>That arm turned into a drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>That drop of blood was endless demonic karma, it was the Great Demon, it was the root of all demonic karma.</p><p></p><p>That drop of blood truly matched the origin divine ability of Heart Demon Summoning of the Void Realm Ruler.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to inscribe this divine ability onto that soul weapon!</p><p></p><p>Within the barrier, the blood-colored robe had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's eyes were filled with deep reluctance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood-robed figure transformed into a blood-colored, bewitching long sword.</p><p></p><p>A greedy look appeared in Shang Yanran's eyes: "Turning oneself into a soul weapon, what an exquisite technique.</p><p></p><p>This sword, if wielded by an ordinary Supreme Being, could even harm a Great Supreme Being! Unfortunately, such a sword can only be considered exquisite. Never mind killing me, it can't even wound me!"</p><p></p><p>With Shang Yanran's words, another strange change occurred on the blood-colored long sword.</p><p></p><p>Greed, lust, pride...</p><p></p><p>Various auras emanated from this sword.</p><p></p><p>Within the entire barrier, including the White Emperor, everyone felt somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Looking at that blood-colored long sword, their eyes showed surprise for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Origin divine ability!" Shang Yanran's eyes widened, "You actually inscribed an origin divine ability onto a sword, you... you really are... willing to sacrifice!"</p><p></p><p>Inscribing an origin divine ability onto a soul weapon was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>But Shang Yanran knew it could be done.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord, haha... this move of yours is indeed beyond my expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, inscribing an origin divine ability onto a soul weapon.</p><p></p><p>Your true body... is essentially ruined! Without an origin divine ability, your true body could be killed by even an ordinary Supreme Being!" Shang Yanran laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Her evaluation of the Blood Lord in her heart became even lower.</p><p></p><p>For any cultivator, being easily blinded by emotion, how could they achieve anything great.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see just how strong your origin divine ability is!"</p><p></p><p>Even facing the Blood Lord's origin divine ability, Shang Yanran was not afraid at all!</p><p></p><p>After all, her realm had already reached the limit of this world.</p><p></p><p>If she were to break through one more step... something bad would happen.</p><p></p><p>All her plans would come to nothing.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao held the blood-colored long sword, her figure growing taller at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Holding the sword, she felt a kind of blood connection.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is named Heart Demon Summoning of the Void Realm Ruler!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stepped forward, like a peerless swordswoman.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, she could finally... fight side by side with Blood Pearl.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, endless blood qi spread, filling the entire barrier.</p><p></p><p>Greed, pride, gluttony... all kinds of emotions arose.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the seven powerful beings finally showed moved expressions.</p><p></p><p>A look of disbelief appeared in Shang Yanran's eyes: "Heart demon? Great Demon? How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly be the real Great Demon! Such an origin divine ability simply could not be condensed.</p><p></p><p>Only the Great Demon, who was once Buddha, could condense it.</p><p></p><p>Because all worldly demonic karma was the origin of the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>A look of bewilderment appeared in Shang Yanran's eyes, followed by a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>The real Great Demon? ... That would be even more interesting!</p><p></p><p>As the sword struck, the seven powerful beings behind Shang Yanran, like fragile porcelain dolls, developed cracks on their bodies just from looking at the sword once.</p><p></p><p>They kept howling and crying, as if they had fallen into an endless demonic realm.</p><p></p><p>The seven supreme beings couldn't even withstand a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>A snow-white demon crawled out of Shang Yanran's back.</p><p></p><p>That demon was different from everyone else's.</p><p></p><p>There was no fear in her eyes, only a smile: "Blood Lord, I'll concede you've won this round. I'll give you this avatar.</p><p></p><p>However, having lost your origin divine ability, what is there to fear? I'll be waiting for you in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons!</p><p></p><p>If you don't come in quickly, Canary... will fall into my hands."</p><p></p><p>With her words, Shang Yanran struck and killed this body of hers with one palm.</p><p></p><p>After all, if that sword strike had continued, it would have been enough to harm her true body through the avatar.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's avatar dissipated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Those seven powerful beings, struck by this sword, had their heart demons break through their bodies and perished.</p><p></p><p>With a simple sword strike, eight powerful beings were killed.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Thirteen Demons of the Northern Demons looked at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>What happened today was truly beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the White Emperor looked towards that blood-colored long sword, his eyes filled with shock and a hint of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Such a sword strike, stirring up endless heart demons.</p><p></p><p>Was Master... really the Great Demon? If it was true...</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how to face it.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's small hand tightly gripped that long sword, a smile squeezing onto her pale little face: "Blood Pearl... everything in the illusory realm was fake."</p><p></p><p>All the suffering was caused by the curse of ten thousand demons after entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Blood Pearl drawing his sword and killing was nothing but an illusion.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

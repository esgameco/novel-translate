        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Fengui Kingdom was weak, with only three cities to its name.</p><p></p><p>These three cities were guarded by ten generals of Fengui who had shed blood to defend them.</p><p></p><p>Now, seven of the ten great generals were gone, with only three remaining.</p><p></p><p>The burly general, his hair completely white, gazed into the distance with a weathered look.</p><p></p><p>"General Qi, how is it?" A somewhat childish voice rang out as the young queen, in her simple attire and in the prime of her youth at 29, walked over gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"The Moluo army outnumbers us several times over. It will be difficult!" General Qi said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Having fewer defenders than attackers wasn't a big problem when defending a city.</p><p></p><p>But the enemy was the Moluo race.</p><p></p><p>Every member of the Moluo race was a powerful warrior, comparable to a first-realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After the great changes in heaven and earth, and the rise of martial arts, the Wangyue Continent produced many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Moluo race, the gap was still too large.</p><p></p><p>The entire Fengui Kingdom had only a few third-realm cultivators, as well as the fourth-realm Luo Xi who had returned from the Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>According to the classification of the Canglanjie, the third realm was equivalent to the Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>Among the soldiers, only one in ten was likely to be a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Luo Xi has managed to bring reinforcements," the young queen said with a desolate expression.</p><p></p><p>General Qi fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The conditions Luo Xi offered were unlikely to persuade people from other worlds.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, people from other worlds were no pushovers either.</p><p></p><p>They were just weaker versions of the Moluo race.</p><p></p><p>The young queen's face turned resolute: "Even without reinforcements, I will defend the kingdom to the death!"</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to die for Fengui, willing to die for Wangyue!" General Qi said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The war before them was not just a war of national annihilation, but a war to destroy their world.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Wangyue Continent had become delicacies in the mouths of foreign races.</p><p></p><p>Only by fighting with all their might did they have a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an ethereal voice drifted over.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need you to die for me."</p><p></p><p>A group of five people appeared out of thin air on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>General Qi tensed up, his hand moving to the hilt of his sword.</p><p></p><p>However, upon seeing Luo Xi, his vigilance lessened somewhat, though his hand remained on his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, these are our allies from Canglanjie," Luo Xi hurriedly introduced.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young queen's childlike face broke into her signature smile: "Greetings to you all."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the queen.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, she reminded him of Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li must have been about this age back then.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, is this all the Moluo race has?" Qi Yuan looked towards the area outside the city. As far as the eye could see, there were endless military camps, an impressive sight.</p><p></p><p>General Qi was puzzled. What did he mean by "is this all"?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know when the sect forces behind Your Excellency will arrive. We are willing to serve as the vanguard and slay these fiends!" General Qi responded.</p><p></p><p>The young queen also looked at the excessively young Qi Yuan with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a hurry. After killing the Moluo here, I still need to go to the other six kingdoms."</p><p></p><p>A look of confusion flashed in General Qi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The young queen also looked at Luo Xi, wanting to understand exactly what was happening.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze penetrated dozens of miles. He saw the grotesque, monster-like members of the Moluo race.</p><p></p><p>They were three meters tall, their skin a mix of dark and blue, with their backs covered in dense scales.</p><p></p><p>Their open mouths revealed teeth stained with green liquid.</p><p></p><p>Most eye-catching was the crimson bloodmark on their foreheads, like burning flames.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red sword appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes seemed to pierce through the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Amidst heavy snow, he led Moon Woman to slaughter the Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious Black Robe Guards were like dead dogs under his sword.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Moluo race had invaded his Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Dao of this world, Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't be polite.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand brushed along the sword's body, as if wiping away bloody dust.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present looked at the sword in Qi Yuan's hand, involuntarily showing fear and shock in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they saw a god of slaughter who had massacred thousands!</p><p></p><p>The killing intent emanating from this person from another realm made heaven and earth tremble.</p><p></p><p>Could such a god of killing really be Fengui's savior?</p><p></p><p>However, when his hand wiped the blood color from the sword's body, suddenly ten thousand rays of light rose up.</p><p></p><p>All the people of Fengui, seeing that white radiance, inexplicably felt warmth and a sense of closeness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had seen their emperor, their god!</p><p></p><p>A vast voice rang out, like that of a deity.</p><p></p><p>"I have a sword, when dust is gone, light is born.</p><p>Slaying Moluo, ten thousand flowers bloom on green mountains."</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword broke free from Qi Yuan's hand and flew directly towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Endless light emanated from the sword's body, and sharp sword radiance shot directly towards the Moluo race's camp.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack!" Such an urgent voice had just come from within the camp.</p><p></p><p>Endless light and sword radiance then engulfed them.</p><p></p><p>Almost all members of the Moluo race had no time to react before being dissolved by this sword light.</p><p></p><p>A full eight thousand Moluo warriors, including some Shenying realm cultivators, turned to ash under this one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In just three breaths.</p><p></p><p>Endless sword light flashed, and the Moluo position was razed to the ground!</p><p></p><p>Before everyone could be shocked, they saw blood-red flower buds breaking through the scorched earth that had been full of wounds just moments ago.</p><p></p><p>The former battlefield transformed into a sea of flowers in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Flowers in full bloom clustered together, forming a stark contrast with the previous scene.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "Since you dared to come to my home, stay and become fertilizer for the flowers!"</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord gave a thumbs up: "You truly understand the art of waste utilization."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan, speechless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>As for General Qi and the young queen, their eyes were wide, their bodies trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength... what realm was this exactly? The legendary fifth realm?</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi kept staring at the sword Qi Yuan had just used, his mind in turmoil: "Your sword technique... seems familiar!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, in Qi Yuan's sword strike, he saw traces of the High Priest's sword technique.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan glanced at Luo Xi, countless speculations flashing through his mind. "Let's go to the next kingdom."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, Qi Yuan didn't linger. He left with Jiang Ya, Great Wisdom True Lord, Xu Tongchen and the others, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Only the bewildered young queen and General Qi were left behind.</p><p></p><p>"He left just like that?" the young queen asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>This person had come quickly and left suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Everything felt like a dream.</p><p></p><p>Fire in stone, body in dream.</p><p></p><p>If not for the colorful sea of flowers in front of the city, she might have thought it was all an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Minister Luo Xi, what price did you pay to invite this expert?" General Qi asked with concern.</p><p></p><p>The young queen also felt her heart tighten.</p><p></p><p>How could such a powerful expert from another realm cooperate with them?</p><p></p><p>"No... no price," Luo Xi said.</p><p></p><p>His words left everyone present dumbfounded. No price? Who didn't know that those immortal cultivators from Canglanjie put profit above all else?</p><p></p><p>Back then, when a country asked those Shenying realm cultivators for help, they not only ceded several cities, but also sent several princesses and princes to become servants.</p><p></p><p>Was that young man really so... noble?</p><p></p><p>"He said the Wangyue Continent is his home."</p><p></p><p>"When unwelcome guests come to his home, of course he'll personally see them off!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was stunned.</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in the young queen's eyes: "Could it be that this expert is actually from our Wangyue Continent?"</p><p></p><p>General Qi also looked shocked.</p><p></p><p>Could such a thing be possible?</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi's eyes were deep: "His sword just now seemed familiar to me.</p><p>Who... exactly is he?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Streams of light flew across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was very quiet, as if still stunned by Qi Yuan's sword strike earlier.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "Can I make a suggestion?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was startled: "Feel free."</p><p></p><p>This was a rich lady, he had to hold on tight to this thigh.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that before we leave, could we have them offer up their cultivation methods?" Jiang Ya had come along largely to collect this world's techniques.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately felt he had suffered a great loss and deeply regretted it.</p><p></p><p>For every technique Jiang Ya didn't get, he would miss out on five!</p><p></p><p>"You should have reminded me earlier." Qi Yuan looked deeply towards Fengui, but it was already out of sight.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't go back.</p><p></p><p>He needed to continue slaughtering members of the Moluo race.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that killing Moluo race members could also shorten the time needed for him to regain control of this world's Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>So, kill, kill, kill, until blood flows like a river! Strive to regain control of this world's Heavenly Dao before the Yin spirits of the Moluo race discover it.</p><p></p><p>Then, he would have more confidence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days passed in the blink of an eye. Qi Yuan led the group, traveling non-stop and killing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In the seven kingdoms, nearly 100,000 members of the Moluo race were all slaughtered by Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't leave in a hurry. As soon as he arrived, he had them</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ruler began collecting cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>After slaughtering the members of the Moluo clan, he stayed for a few hours, waiting to roughly collect the techniques, then went to other countries to continue exterminating the Moluo.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that slaughtering the Moluo clan made Qi Yuan feel like he was back to grinding in games on the Wangyue Continent. </p><p></p><p>With each Moluo clan member he killed, he felt he was one step closer to becoming the Heavenly Dao of this world again.</p><p></p><p>This sense of progression and advancement made him feel very accomplished.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the palace of the last of the seven countries, Qi Yuan wore a blood-red robe that made him look extraordinarily demonic.</p><p></p><p>Even Jiang Ya's gaze towards Qi Yuan became strange, thinking he was a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord had directly asked on the road: "Senior, your bloodthirst is terrifyingly strong. How many lives have you taken?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan answered at the time: "I've lost count, too many to remember."</p><p></p><p>This made Jiang Ya even more certain that the Blood-Robed Sword God was truly a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Such a great demon, standing in one place, would involuntarily instill fear in cultivators, and mortals would be plagued by nightmares, avoiding him at all costs.</p><p></p><p>However, here, the scene Jiang Ya saw was different from what she imagined.</p><p></p><p>Those mortals, those nobles and aristocrats, looked at Qi Yuan with eyes full of reverence and affection.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blood-Robed Sword God had saved them!</p><p></p><p>But the innate fear and trembling should be impossible to hide.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Jiang Ya didn't detect any trembling from these people at all.</p><p></p><p>These people looked at the blood-soaked Blood-Robed Sword God as if he wasn't a great demon, but a hero.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, these are all the techniques, including our royal family's clan-protecting skills and unshareable secrets!" The King of Wei presented the techniques with a fawning expression.</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, the civil and military officials all looked at Qi Yuan with admiration in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya even noticed some young children secretly peeking through the curtains, looking at the Blood-Robed Sword God with awe in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>She was filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>Was there something wrong with these people, or was it her?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the techniques and handed them to Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya hurriedly put the techniques into her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then took out a map and asked, "Are there many Moluo clan members in the Chuang Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The Chuang Kingdom was nearly a thousand miles from the capital of Wei.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had to pass through the Chuang Kingdom on his way to the Moon Emperor Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Many!" The King of Wei nodded and quietly reminded, "Senior, in the Chuang Kingdom, there are quite a few cultivators from the Cang Lan Realm. Those cultivators are not as selfless as you, Senior. If you go to kill the Moluo clan members in Chuang Kingdom, you might... offend them."</p><p></p><p>The King of Wei's reminder was not without reason.</p><p></p><p>The Chuang Kingdom had spent a great deal to invite a group of Divine Infant cultivators to help deal with the Moluo clan members.</p><p></p><p>As a result, if Qi Yuan went there and cleared out the Moluo clan members without asking for any territory, only for some techniques, it would naturally offend those Divine Infant cultivators who had helped before, and they might even come to hate Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm a reasonable person. I'll definitely use reason to persuade them," Qi Yuan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior's reasoning is the supreme and true reasoning. I very much agree," the Great Wisdom True Lord chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Is this called reasoning? This is clearly called killing, called beheading! She strongly suspected that the Great Wisdom True Lord, after following the Blood-Robed Sword God for this journey, would definitely be influenced. If his master saw him going astray, he would probably be so angry he'd come out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the assembled civil and military officials and casually said, "Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Wei's tiger-like eyes immediately showed reluctance: "Senior... safe journey!"</p><p></p><p>Those nobles and aristocrats, even the imperial guards, all looked at Qi Yuan, some with tears in their eyes, some extremely reluctant to part.</p><p></p><p>It was as if their own father was leaving, no, even closer than a father! The scene suddenly became... bizarre, at least to Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>She felt goosebumps rising on her back.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why it was like this.</p><p></p><p>These people's emotions... were too intense!</p><p></p><p>And... it didn't seem like they were acting. Was it really necessary?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Qi Yuan said without looking at the people below, leaving directly with Jiang Ya and the others.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, there was a chorus of crying, even more spectacular than before.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's heart was full of confusion: "Senior... why are they treating you like this?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>It was too strange.</p><p></p><p>"Because I saved them," Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>If a great demon saved her, she would be grateful, but more than that, she would be afraid.</p><p></p><p>But these people from the Wangyue Continent, their fervent gazes treated the Blood-Robed Sword God, this great demon... like a father.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Jiang Ya didn't believe him, Qi Yuan's expression became desolate: "I didn't expect that at such a young age, not even twenty, I would become a father, and... with a billion children."</p><p></p><p>He was the Heavenly Dao of this world.</p><p></p><p>So, in a sense, the living beings of the Wangyue Continent could indeed be considered his children.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord then said: "Based on my many years of experience, the number of life-transmitting factors is in the billions.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, if the conditions are right for both partners, they can have a billion children at once.</p><p></p><p>I've been researching this too.</p><p></p><p>If my Two Dan Method can't advance in the future, then I'll let thousands and tens of thousands of my descendants go out into the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan admired the Great Wisdom True Lord even more.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't Great Wisdom, this was the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains, great wisdom appears foolish!</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom True Lord knows so much," Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord then said softly: "Reason is hidden in life. As long as you have eyes to discover reason and learn to summarize.</p><p></p><p>For example, I've discovered that if I practice abstinence for half a day every day, I've actually been abstinent for half my life.</p><p></p><p>So those lustful people aren't really that lustful at all, but have actually been abstinent for quite a long time."</p><p></p><p>"The great Dao is simple!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise again.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had also discovered many truths.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the mortal realm, long-lived people are generally old people.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya didn't want to speak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the confusion in her heart still couldn't be resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... is the Wangyue Continent really your home?" she couldn't help but ask, bringing the topic back on track.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the two of them would start discussing grand principles again.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Qi Yuan nodded vigorously, not concealing it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Senior... was born on the Wangyue Continent?" Jiang Ya couldn't help but recall the first time she met the Blood-Robed Sword God, when she sensed that the innate divine abilities of the Blood-Robed Sword God seemed incompatible with the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Half, I guess. Here I... laid the foundation of the Heavenly Dao!" Qi Yuan looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Laid the foundation of the Heavenly Dao?" Jiang Ya was a bit confused when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>She looked carefully at Qi Yuan a few times, wanting to discover something, but unfortunately, she couldn't discover anything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chuang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The young prince was holding a basin of foot-washing water, his expression neither sad nor happy.</p><p></p><p>The girl beside him couldn't help saying: "Royal Brother, why didn't you listen to Senior Zhang Yan's suggestion? Otherwise, you wouldn't have suffered such humiliation."</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, the Chuang Kingdom faced a crisis when the Moluo army attacked.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Chuang personally went to seek help from those Divine Infant cultivators of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they ceded five cities and selected nine princes and princesses to go as servants.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a Divine Infant cultivator named Zhang Yan took a liking to Zhao Ci and wanted to take him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Zhao Ci refused, which also angered Zhang Yan, and he suffered various humiliations.</p><p></p><p>"Royal Sister, you know that I admire the Faceless Sword God the most.</p><p></p><p>I have already joined the Faceless Divine Sect and am a member of the congregation. I cannot switch allegiance to another!"</p><p></p><p>Five thousand years ago, the Faceless Divine Sect began to rise.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Divine Sect worships the Faceless Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that in ancient times, evil demons from beyond invaded the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the people of the Wangyue Continent were suffering.</p><p></p><p>Under the ancient Qi Chun tree, hundreds of thousands of corpses of Wangyue Continent citizens who had resisted the foreign demons were hanging.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sword God, unwilling to see the common people suffer, fought alone with his sword against three thousand foreign demons.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he perished together with the foreign demons.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the girl's eyes became desolate: "There is no second Faceless Sword God on the Wangyue Continent."</p><p></p><p>The legends about the Faceless Sword God were too ancient, and the girl didn't even believe they were true.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, a glimmer of excitement appeared in the girl's eyes: "Royal Brother, do you know about that Blood-Robed Sword God who's been slaughtering the Moluo clan? Do you think... he could help our Chuang Kingdom overcome this crisis?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Ci didn't speak, only let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Through Zhang Yan, he had already indirectly learned about the power distribution in the Eastern Lands of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>The three Venerable Ones were absolutely top-tier powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>They had over a hundred fifth-realm cultivators under them.</p><p></p><p>That Blood-Robed Sword God, according to their description, was merely at the fifth realm.</p><p></p><p>He carried the foot-washing water, knocked on the door, and entered the room.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivator named Zhang Yan glanced at Zhao Ci, his eyes filled with a contemptuous smile: "Do you people of Chuang Kingdom really think that Blood-Robed Sword God can help you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ci's heart sank, and he remained silent.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

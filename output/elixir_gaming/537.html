        <h1>Chapter 537</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If you say that Chen Kang Bao is his servant.</p><p></p><p>What do other people's slaves wear and carry? What about his? People are different, it's enough to drive one crazy.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's a good thing I have my white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the corpse of the Knife Demon in the distance, with a look of pride in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Under the descent of the divine, combined with the comrade-in-arms of his little wife, his combat power has reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>Even to the extent that, in a certain sense, it has surpassed the peak of the Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>The realm of the Divine Descent is higher than Qi Yuan's, but in terms of the use of divine power, it is naturally no match for Qi Yuan, who is capable of slaying the Yang Shen Da Zhili.</p><p></p><p>"Level 150 now."</p><p></p><p>By slaying this Knife Demon, who was a divine-level Armament Master, Qi Yuan's realm has reached level 150.</p><p></p><p>Converted to this world, he is also a divine-level Armament Master.</p><p></p><p>Now, without relying on the power of the Divine Descent, he is a god!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan has made a new discovery about the Knife Demon.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Although it was very far away, Qi Yuan's eyes still detected the abnormality on the Knife Demon's body.</p><p></p><p>[The blood soaked in the dark spiritual light, this blood has been contaminated, the divine artifact is covered in dust, and its power is now less than a thousandth.]</p><p></p><p>This news made Qi Yuan ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Knife Demon's fresh blood been modified by someone?"</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts surged in Qi Yuan's mind, and he looked at the Knife Demon's severed arm, and his conjecture became more certain.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in order to deal with the Divine Descent, someone had soaked the Knife Demon's blood in the dark spiritual light.</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Descent faced the attack of the gods, he had injured the Knife Demon.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the divine artifact has been covered in dust, and the Divine Descent's strength has declined.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, are you there?" Qi Yuan began to consult the staff of the Thorn Blood again.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>"First of all, don't call me 'hey', and secondly, if you have something to say, say it, don't just ask 'are you there?'"</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Dark Spiritual Light?"</p><p></p><p>Since he was playing the role of the Divine Descent, he must find out the cause of the Divine Descent's death.</p><p></p><p>"No, I haven't heard of it." The other party replied.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a little disappointed, it seems he would have to push through the Rakshasa Realm dungeon to find out who else had intervened.</p><p></p><p>"But, if I pay a price, I may be able to find out what this thing is." The Thorn Blood staff member said.</p><p></p><p>"If you help me investigate the information about it, I'll remember this favor, and if I can't make it in the future, come to the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Thorn Blood staff member let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the window and looked at the hazy world outside, as if appreciating the scenery.</p><p></p><p>"Release a task, detailed information about the Dark Spiritual Light, 1 point."</p><p></p><p>As a senior Void Traveler, he also has the authority to release tasks.</p><p></p><p>The Void Paradise has deeply penetrated the embryonic form of this universe.</p><p></p><p>He can even view things like the "Blue Mountain Book".</p><p></p><p>As for other information, as long as he checks, he can easily obtain it.</p><p></p><p>After about a few breaths of time, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"I've found the information about the Dark Spiritual Light."</p><p></p><p>"This thing comes from the Radiant Society, its biggest feature is that it can contaminate divine artifacts, reducing the divine power of the divine artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Qi Yuan expressed his gratitude, and his thoughts were in motion.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Radiant Society again."</p><p></p><p>He had only seen two people from the Radiant Society, one was Fang Shisan, and the other was a dead person.</p><p></p><p>But along the way, the Radiant Society has been deeply entangled with him.</p><p></p><p>At first, when Qi Yuan was the superfluous son-in-law, Fang Shisan of the Radiant Society had tried to ambush him, even to the point of assassination.</p><p></p><p>Later, when Qi Yuan went to the Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss and saw the many corpses in the Anomaly Domain who had forged the fragments of the Bright Spiritual Treasures, he saw people from the Radiant Society again.</p><p></p><p>Among them, those thirty million Armament Masters who had gone to the Anomaly Domain to refine the fragments of the Bright Spiritual Treasures were also under the leadership of the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>Now, the death of the Divine Descent also seems to have the involvement of the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>This Radiant Society is like a wart that won't go away.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Radiant Society?" Qi Yuan asked like a curious child again.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member's gaze sharpened: "The 'Blue Mountain Book' records that the Blue Mountain Realm is about to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This is not only the end of the Blue Mountain Realm, but also the ultimate fate of your universe.</p><p></p><p>Any world, any living being, cannot avoid the fate of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Unless... they can transcend it.</p><p></p><p>I've said too much, let's talk about the Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>The world or universe you are in is about to face destruction.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Radiant Society consider themselves the saviors of this world, and they have been working hard... to save this world."</p><p></p><p>"Righteous?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The righteous ones have been killing him all along, could it be that he is the villain?</p><p></p><p>He is lawful good, he can't even bear to step on an ant, how could he be the villain? But thinking about his self-righteous kindness not being kindness, he also felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"The Radiant Society is not strong, they can only be considered a nuisance, but behind them..." Thinking of this, the Thorn Blood staff member's face showed an expression of awe and fear.</p><p></p><p>That towering existence, even just the thought of it would make one's soul and heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>If he directly invoked its name, with malice, and it was a specific reference, it would be no different.</p><p></p><p>Before he had consolidated his divine domain, that existence could even, with a single thought, erase him from existence across an entire universe.</p><p></p><p>Only by consolidating the divine domain, and deepening the connection with the universe, would that existence not be able to simply kill him with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>But a single thought is not enough, a single finger should work, right? "Who is behind them?" Qi Yuan felt that he lacked understanding of the game's background.</p><p></p><p>"The Radiant Dao Master!" The Thorn Blood staff member trembled as he typed these four words.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Dao Master! The Dao Master of a Dao! "Who is he, what realm is he at, is he very strong?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member, hearing this, was even more certain that Qi Yuan was a native of this world, as he had never even heard of the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that above the divine-level Armament Masters, there are true divine-level beings who have consolidated divine domains?</p><p></p><p>Above the true divine, you call them Ancestor Gods.</p><p></p><p>But in our other universes, they are called Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>There are five layers of Yang Shen, and the gap between each layer is even greater than the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Placed in our Zhou Universe, any one of the Yang Shen could devour an entire realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a towering existence, with a mere yawn, the strongest in your Blue Mountain Realm, the Divine Descent, would die.</p><p></p><p>This is just the first layer of the Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>As for the stronger cultivators at the higher realms, their power is even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>The creator of our Void Paradise is the number one expert in the Zhou Universe, the Void Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>This time, the Thorn Blood staff member did not hide his identity.</p><p></p><p>After so many days of interaction, if the other party was not a fool, he must have known that he was not just a Thorn Blood staff member.</p><p></p><p>"What, you are from another universe?" Qi Yuan, or rather, Shi Wuyun, was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member did not respond, he continued.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Realm Lord is an expert at the perfected third layer of the Yang Shen realm, the number one expert in our Zhou Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord is capable of creating the heavens and the earth, creating a world like the Blue Mountain Realm, and even creating life out of nothing.</p><p></p><p>If he were to act, your embryonic universe would have no one capable of resisting him."</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned the Void Realm Lord, he had an expression of pride and awe.</p><p></p><p>This is the emperor that all the cultivators in the Zhou Universe admire and worship.</p><p></p><p>"A bit strong." Qi Yuan evaluated seriously.</p><p></p><p>At least now, he is unable to create a world or any living beings.</p><p></p><p>Modification, on the other hand, he can do.</p><p></p><p>He had previously obtained the token of the Void Paradise and learned a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The third layer is divided into the realms of rules, all things, and the origin of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The immortal realm's six heavens have comprehended the supreme principles, but in terms of combat power, they are still considered weak rule realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood staff are already familiar with Qi Yuan's reactions.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of the Void Sovereign is something we can only look up to for our entire lives.</p><p></p><p>But the Radiant Dao Master... is actually an existence at the fifth layer of the Yang God, two layers higher than the Void Sovereign, and is known as the Dao Master!</p><p></p><p>The so-called Dao Master is the master of a single Dao, the unique, the eternal, and the fixed! Once one becomes the Dao Master, they have truly transcended, where the destruction of the universe cannot destroy them, and the extinction of the universe cannot extinguish their spirit, freely roaming the river of time, able to traverse the past and future."</p><p></p><p>His ancestral elder was also a Yang God, a Void Traveler, so he knew many hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>And for the Yang Gods, these are not secrets at all.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Master, Dao Master, the master of a single Dao.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the cultivation systems are numerous, such as the Martial Dao, the Witchcraft Dao, the Poison Spirit Dao, the Demonic Cultivation Dao, and so on.</p><p></p><p>When any of these systems reach their true endpoint, with no further progress possible, they can be called the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>The moment one becomes the Dao Master, that cultivation system will be under their control, and the universe they reside in will become their domain.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators who come after will be cultivating for them, and they will never be able to surpass them.</p><p></p><p>On each great Dao, there is only one Dao Master! And in each universe, there can only be the existence of one Dao Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood staff told Qi Yuan what they knew.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with their low realm, their understanding was not entirely accurate, and there were some omissions and errors.</p><p></p><p>But the majority of the content was correct.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed powerful," Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>During his time at the Moon Goddess Palace, he had also learned that the fifth layer of the Yang God could encompass all timelines.</p><p></p><p>Now, he knew even more.</p><p></p><p>Not only could they encompass timelines, but they were also the master of a single Dao.</p><p></p><p>Like the Martial Dao, like the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>This means that if a cultivator in the Immortal Dao were to reach the fifth layer of the Yang God, they would be the sole Yang God fifth layer cultivator in the Immortal Dao, the Dao Master of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Dao cultivation world, there would not be a second Yang God fifth layer cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The life and death of all other Immortal Dao cultivators would be under the control of this Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>They have become the endpoint of the Immortal Dao, the source of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly remembered that the future of the six heavens of the Immortal Realm had been severed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that a cultivator had glimpsed such a future and severed the future of the Immortal Realm with a single sword? The Immortal Realm is vast, perhaps no less than the universe.</p><p></p><p>To be able to sever the future of the Immortal Realm with a single sword, the expert must be at least at the Origin Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"You can offend the Radiant, but don't offend the Dao Master behind him.</p><p></p><p>But of course... you probably won't have the chance to offend the Radiant Dao Master," the Thorny Blood staff member said smugly.</p><p></p><p>He was feeling very proud, as if saying, "You country bumpkins, you well-frogs, now you know how vast the world outside is, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>However, he soon became a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>These people had not yet reached the Yang God realm, so seeing the Radiant Dao Master would be like a well-frog seeing the moon in the sky. But once they reached the Yang God realm and saw the Radiant Dao Master, it would be like a mayfly seeing the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Yang God realm, they couldn't even imagine the true power of the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>"I have a question, the third layer of the Yang God is the Realm Lord, the fifth layer is the Dao Master, so what about the fourth layer?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Dao Master is powerful, far surpassing the one from the Brilliant Palace, but so what? As long as he has a health bar, Qi Yuan could slowly kill him!</p><p></p><p>"This... " the Thorny Blood staff member hesitated, not expecting Qi Yuan to ask about this. "The fourth layer of the Yang God is a taboo, even in our Zhou Universe, there are not many who know what kind of existence the fourth layer is.</p><p></p><p>According to ancient records, even ordinary Yang God third layer cultivators do not know what the fourth layer is like.</p><p></p><p>Likely, only the Void Sovereign at the Origin Realm peak, and the Radiant Dao Master at the Yang God fifth layer, would know about the fourth layer."</p><p></p><p>"The fourth layer of the Yang God is so mysterious?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>They know about the fifth layer, but the fourth layer is unknown, which is really strange.</p><p></p><p>"According to the words of some great existences, the fourth layer of the Yang God cannot be spoken of, cannot be expressed, cannot be perceived, otherwise it would bring great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, lecturer," Qi Yuan sincerely expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he learn more about the game setting, but he also gained a clearer understanding of the cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Dao shouldn't have a Dao Master, otherwise if I just yawn... wouldn't I die?"</p><p></p><p>"No, am I not cultivating the Immortal Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I'm cultivating Schrödinger's Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>With a Dao Master, the Immortal Dao he cultivates is a false one.</p><p>Without a Dao Master, the Immortal Dao he cultivates is real, and he can strive to become the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>"As a Purple Palace disciple and a Divine-level Imperial Guard, why am I pondering these things?"</p><p></p><p>"I should just go and slaughter that little weakling White Moonlight here first!"</p><p></p><p>Yes, after hearing the title of Dao Master, Qi Yuan felt even more that the Divine-level Imperial Guard of this Luosha Kingdom was just a weakling.</p><p></p><p>Probably, in the eyes of a Dao Master existence, his current actions would appear ridiculous and laughable.</p><p></p><p>They are nothing!</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan still upheld his principles.</p><p>As an actor, he must have professional ethics.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The capital city. </p><p>In the main hall, the Prince of Dingyuan stood motionless like a mountain, but his expression was very tense.</p><p></p><p>"The Blade Demon is dead, the Blade Demon has actually been killed with a single sword strike!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, he was both horrified and relieved.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he did not have the curiosity to go to Laihai City to investigate whether the Divine Awakening had truly returned.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have been the one to die.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, there were four people in the main hall, all Divine-level Imperial Guards. Their expressions were not good.</p><p></p><p>"The Blade Demon has been killed with a single sword strike, it seems... He has returned," an old man spoke, his voice hoarse.</p><p>His face was very pale, paler than someone who had been dead for ten days.</p><p></p><p>"He has actually revived, and is almost comparable to his prime!" another Divine-level Imperial Guard said grimly.</p><p>He had the urge to retreat, but he also knew that leaving would only lead to his death faster. It was better to stay with the other Divine-level Imperial Guards and seek safety in numbers.</p><p></p><p>"Even if we unite our forces, we may not be his match," the Prince of Dingyuan said worriedly. "How could He revive when He was already shattered into fragments?"</p><p></p><p>He was truly afraid! After all, if the Divine Awakening had been a little more ruthless back then, he might have been killed along with the Blood Cloud Bandits.</p><p>He also felt that he had been quite bold to stay in Dingbo State for so long.</p><p></p><p>"Now is not the time to discuss how He revived, we should consider... how to eliminate Him!</p><p>If we cannot kill Him, we will all die.</p><p>The immortal achievements we have built will also be buried by His own hands!" the pale-faced old man said bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a majestic voice came from behind the beaded curtain.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years ago, I was unable to fight Him, which has been a great regret in my heart.</p><p>This time, I will personally slay Him!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, the Divine-level Imperial Guards present had mixed expressions.</p><p></p><p>The emperor... is going to act in person?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Where did he get this confidence and courage?</p><p></p><p>These people knew the emperor better than anyone. A hundred years ago, not only did he not dare to fight the Divine Awakening, he didn't even dare to watch the battle, fearing collateral damage.</p><p></p><p>Although he had grown stronger over the years, even to the point of almost reaching the level of the original Divine Awakening, given his timid and suspicious nature, he still would not dare to casually confront the Divine Awakening, right?</p><p></p><p>That is the Divine Awakening we're talking about!

        <h1>Chapter 444</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young geniuses around revealed smiles.</p><p></p><p>A burly man said: "Senior Brother Ice Sword, they're gossiping about you like this. Can you tolerate it? Why don't you use your Eight Layers Ancestral Blood Technique to challenge Blood Robe at the eleventh layer, challenging someone above your level?"</p><p></p><p>This burly man was clearly looking for amusement, with a cheerful tone in his voice.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses looked at Ice Sword expectantly. They also wanted to see how deep Blood Robe's abilities were, as the number one genius of Purple Origin Heaven and someone highly valued by Purple Origin Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I've never liked challenging those above me. I prefer bullying the weak. How about I challenge you at the fifth layer instead?" Ice Sword didn't take the bait. </p><p></p><p>For him, it was better to stay far away from Blood Robe, otherwise misfortune would befall him.</p><p></p><p>Although he was also curious about Blood Robe's true abilities, since Blood Robe was able to kill Mona, his strength was likely a notch above Ice Sword's.</p><p></p><p>As for how much stronger, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>He was also very curious about the gap between Blood Robe and... Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>This was just a small interlude. Everyone harbored their own thoughts as they headed to the Ultimate Principle Dao Discussion with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Principle Dao Discussion was the grandest event in the Six Heavens Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was also their only chance in this lifetime to see so many Yang Spirit experts gathered in one place.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens Realm, Ultimate Principle Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Flowing lights and colors, various terrifying auras leaked out yet remained dormant.</p><p></p><p>A man wore a long black and white robe, his gaze as scorching as the sun.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yang Spirit experts didn't dare to meet his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Still no news of Ten Suns Venerable?" Tai Ci Venerable spoke, his voice giving people a burning sensation.</p><p></p><p>Tai Ci Venerable was an Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirit expert of the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>He was also the Ultimate Principle expert with the highest hopes of stepping into the Great Ultimate Principle realm in Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, Ten Suns had appeared in the sky and declared war on Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>This event shook the Six Heavens Realm, and Tai Huang Palace was furious.</p><p></p><p>Finding Ten Suns Venerable and capturing or killing him became Tai Ci Venerable's mission.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Venerable, Ten Suns Venerable's background is mysterious, there is no news," a Yang Spirit expert replied.</p><p></p><p>"He should be from the lower realms, perhaps lying low in the First Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The First Heaven is too vast and boundless. Even if we spent our entire lives searching, we probably couldn't cover it all," another Yang Spirit expert said with a difficult expression.</p><p></p><p>That fallen Three Thousand Realms expert from Tai Huang Palace had lost contact in the lower realms, so they speculated it was related to Ten Suns Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Especially... the Cang Lan Realm which had produced Yang Spirit experts before.</p><p></p><p>Because the guardian of that realm had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Of course he's from the lower realms. With that kind of imposing manner, he must have taken an alternative path to becoming a Yang Spirit expert, not yet reaching the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>He should attend this Ultimate Principle Dao Discussion.</p><p></p><p>All of you pay close attention. Take note of any Yang Spirit experts with mysterious backgrounds or unfamiliar faces," Tai Ci Venerable said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood. We will also send word to the Moluo clan to help us keep watch," a Yang Spirit expert said.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Tai Ci Venerable nodded.</p><p></p><p>Before that person emerged from seclusion, he wanted to handle this matter well.</p><p></p><p>This way, he might be able to receive rewards and increase his chances of entering the Great Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that Tai Huang Palace only had two Great Ultimate Principle experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Lin Ya Tui approaching, this was his opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"But I've heard that the Moluo clan has been acting strangely lately?" Tai Ci Venerable asked, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>The biggest anomaly was that the Moluo clan had stopped paying tribute to the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the Moluo clan had always wanted to return to the Six Heavens Realm, so currying favor with the Black Magic Abyss was necessary.</p><p></p><p>Now, they suddenly stopped trying to please them, which was very strange.</p><p></p><p>Even their cooperation with Tai Huang Palace had decreased significantly.</p><p></p><p>"That is indeed the case. It's quite odd."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what do you think is the reason? This isn't like the Moluo clan's usual style."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... a genius has appeared within the Moluo clan?" one Yang Spirit expert speculated.</p><p></p><p>Only the emergence of a genius with the potential to reach Great Ultimate Principle could make the Moluo clan's wings grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Because as long as the Moluo clan produced one Great Ultimate Principle expert, they could return to the Six Heavens Realm without having to grovel to the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that's possible," Tai Ci Venerable's gaze was calm, without much fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>It was just a genius with Great Ultimate Principle potential after all.</p><p></p><p>With the Lin Ya Tui approaching, their Tai Huang Palace would be the true rulers. The other Yang Spirit experts were merely pawns.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside a formation, Qi Yuan pursed his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless Tai Huang Palace, actually setting up a dragnet to find me at the Ultimate Principle Dao Discussion."</p><p></p><p>Just now, Qi Yuan had received information from his divine infant.</p><p></p><p>At this Ultimate Principle Dao Discussion, the Yang Spirit experts of Tai Huang Palace would lie in wait, searching for Ten Suns Venerable.</p><p></p><p>They even asked the Moluo clan to help search.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? Asking me to find myself?</p><p></p><p>And the reward was quite shocking. Qi Yuan even wanted to report himself to scam the reward.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, you're daydreaming again!" Purple Origin Daxue looked at Qi Yuan with disdain. "Your love-hate relationship with that Tai Huang Palace expert is so complicated. He's even set up a dragnet to find you. Could it be... you're the runaway little wife of Tai Huang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Qi Yuan glared at Purple Origin Daxue.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait until big sister reaches the Yang Spirit realm. I'll make you roll in front of me!" Purple Origin Daxue said proudly, wearing her bull horns.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't want to bother with Purple Origin Daxue.</p><p></p><p>This guy was really too absurd.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss had been using teleportation formations to travel to Ultimate Principle Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it still took nearly a month of travel before they slowly arrived.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they stepped off the teleportation formation, all the geniuses present instantly felt the extremely dense spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Within the spiritual energy, there seemed to be some mysterious factors that made cultivators feel relaxed and happy.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Withering Glory, long time no see. How have you been lately?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirit expert came over to greet them, wearing a kindly smile.</p><p></p><p>This person was a Yang Spirit expert from the Ultimate Principle Association named Venerable Mysterious Mechanism, specially responsible for welcoming guests.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Withering Glory smiled without it reaching his eyes: "Just barely getting by. Can't compare to you folks at the Ultimate Principle Association, being nurtured by the Ultimate Principle Wall every day, advancing rapidly in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"What use is rapid cultivation progress? I've only comprehended earth-grade Ultimate Principles. My hopes of reaching the Great Ultimate Principle realm in this lifetime are slim," Venerable Mysterious Mechanism sighed, his words tinged with bitterness. His gaze fell on Black Sword, a sharp light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the number one genius of the Black Magic Abyss, Black Sword?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, just as the legends say, he embodies the essence of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The elders once said that Venerable Black Sword would comprehend the supreme Ultimate Principle, truly awe-inspiring."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mysterious Mechanism's face was full of envy.</p><p></p><p>That was the supreme Ultimate Principle! In the entire Six Heavens Realm, there were fewer than ten Yang Spirit experts who had comprehended the supreme Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding gazes also fell on Black Sword, filled with admiration, envy, respect, and more.</p><p></p><p>Although he was only a Heavenly Rank Yang Spirit expert, at this moment he became the focus of everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"I have not yet comprehended any Ultimate Principles, I dare not speak of it," Black Sword said humbly.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mysterious Mechanism smiled: "How could what the elders say be wrong?" In the Ultimate Principle Association, there were elders...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those with such titles must be powerful Zhili realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon Abyss has been on a lucky streak lately. I heard they produced another prodigy who killed Mona of the Ghost Domination Realm. I wonder who it is?" said Xuanji Tianzun, looking over at Ziyuan Daxue and the others.</p><p></p><p>"It's him!" Ziyuan Daxue pointed at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Xuanji Tianzun glanced at him and politely commented, "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>It was just a polite remark with no follow-up.</p><p></p><p>This was normal. </p><p></p><p>After all, only someone like Black Sword, a Yang Spirit Tianzun, was worth recruiting.</p><p></p><p>There was a huge gap between Black Sword and other young prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Xuanji Tianzun stood shoulder to shoulder with Kurong Tianzun, with Black Sword behind them. The other Yang Spirits followed, and behind them were the young prodigies of the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when we'll be able to become the focus of attention like Big Brother Black Sword!" sighed a burly man with an envious look.</p><p></p><p>"Even if we can't be the center of attention, it would be good to just be mentioned by the big shots," said this prodigy, glancing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, that Zhili realm Yang Spirit didn't even mention them.</p><p></p><p>So the contrast and gap was very obvious.</p><p></p><p>It was actually quite normal.</p><p></p><p>It's like if a big shot leader from your province came to your school and singled out your deskmate - you'd probably be envious too.</p><p></p><p>"Being the center of attention isn't good, I have social anxiety," Qi Yuan said at this point. "It's better to keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a low profile is better," Ziyuan Daxue agreed with Qi Yuan for once.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword glanced at the two of them - how can you two say you're keeping a low profile with a straight face?</p><p></p><p>An hour later, in the central city of the Zhili Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Countless figures descended, as if gods were arriving.</p><p></p><p>The Zhili Discourse Conference was about to begin, with a vast number of Yang Spirits and prodigies from various races arriving.</p><p></p><p>The population of the central city reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Zhili Discourse Conference was the number one grand event in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the crowd, a man at the Mythical realm asked, "What's wrong, Meng Xian? You seem lost in thought."</p><p></p><p>This Mythical realm man was from the Second Heaven, and he was from the same faction as Yu Meng Xian beside him.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Tianzun from their sect had been working for free for the Zhili Conference recently, building the Zhili Palace, in order to gain merits.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing... I saw someone familiar, but I might have been mistaken," Yu Meng Xian shook her head, also thinking she must have seen wrong.</p><p></p><p>She also wanted to find that Tianzun. When the Tianzun suddenly disappeared before, someone had entrusted her to deliver something to him.</p><p></p><p>"A familiar person?" The Mythical realm man revealed a thoughtful expression. "Judging by where you were looking just now, it should be the Black Demon Abyss... You must have seen wrong indeed."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Abyss was a power from the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>To them, it was absolutely an overlord-level existence.</p><p></p><p>Just sending out a single Yang Spirit could shatter their sect.</p><p></p><p>Yu Meng Xian had cultivated up from the lower realms, how could she possibly have connections with such big shots from the Sixth Heaven?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, comparing oneself to others is infuriating. They get to participate in the Zhili Conference, while we... can only work here... and be bullied!" the Mythical realm man lamented. "I've been bullied more in this past year here than in my entire life."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, back in the Second Heaven, he was a lofty Mythical expert.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators who saw him would respectfully call him Ancestor or Senior.</p><p></p><p>But after coming to this Sixth Heaven, he was bullied every day.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Yang Spirit Tianzuns, even those young prodigies from big factions who had just entered the Great Venerable realm would look down on them.</p><p></p><p>Yu Meng Xian gave a bitter smile: "Even Tianzuns have to work for free, let alone us? If you want something, you must pay the price."</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Zhili Discourse Conference ends quickly!" the Mythical realm man sighed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to stay in this Zhili Heavenly Realm for even one more day.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Meng Xian's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" asked the Mythical realm man.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yi... is in trouble!" Yu Meng Xian hurried over anxiously.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths later, Yu Meng Xian and the Mythical realm man appeared outside an inn.</p><p></p><p>A young and beautiful woman in tight-fitting clothes, with a good figure, had an angry expression on her face, but didn't dare to act out.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, a burly woman holding a storage bag looked at the Yin Spirit next to the woman in tight clothes: "These few immortal jades should be enough to buy her, right?"</p><p></p><p>This burly woman, named Tuoba Lingyu, was from the Fourth Heaven and belonged to the Mixed Blood Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>This holy land was somewhat similar to the Black Demon Abyss, emphasizing bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the bloodline, the greater the potential.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Black Demon Abyss, where cultivators' bloodlines were mostly innate, they focused on mixed blood, extracting bloodlines, and improving bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>So this sect often captured those with powerful bloodlines to devour and possess for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the Zhili Heavenly Realm, she saw the woman in tight clothes and immediately recognized the extraordinariness of her bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this woman's background was very ordinary, she boldly took out a few immortal jades, wanting to buy this woman.</p><p></p><p>"You're being too forceful, this Qi Yi is my disciple, not some commodity for sale!" Yu Meng Xian hurriedly arrived, her voice filled with refusal.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, which heaven and faction are you from?" Tuoba Lingyu glanced sideways at Yu Meng Xian.</p><p></p><p>"Second Heaven... Wind Spirit Holy Land..." Yu Meng Xian answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so it's old man Feng Ling's sect. I never force people, I'll write him a letter now, telling him to give this woman to me as a gift.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, by the way, I'm Tuoba Lingyu from the Mixed Blood Sect." The burly woman chuckled.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, a letter appeared and was handed to Yu Meng Xian.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the other party was from the Mixed Blood Sect, Yu Meng Xian's face instantly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>The Mixed Blood Sect had a bad reputation.</p><p></p><p>After all, they specialized in capturing those with powerful bloodlines and refining their blood, and could be considered to have committed countless evil deeds.</p><p></p><p>"I will report this matter to the Tianzun," Yu Meng Xian said with a pale face, pulling Qi Yi away.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, give me an answer within ten days, otherwise..." Tuoba Lingyu said, leaving the rest unsaid.</p><p></p><p>The implied threat was very obvious.</p><p></p><p>She was very curious about Qi Yi's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>From afar, she could tell it was an unknown yet powerful bloodline.</p><p></p><p>She was determined to obtain such a bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what she coveted most was naturally the bloodline of the Black Demon Abyss from the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Black Demon Abyss was too powerful, and their Mixed Blood Sect didn't dare to provoke them.</p><p></p><p>She only dared to use her power to bully small factions like the Wind Spirit Holy Land from the Second Heaven.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Yu Meng Xian hurriedly left with Qi Yi, her expression not very good: "This Mixed Blood Sect has always been evil, with a very bad reputation. Qi Yi..."</p><p></p><p>Beside her, the Mythical realm man couldn't help but speak up: "I hope the Tianzun can protect Qi Yi."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yu Meng Xian's gaze became determined.</p><p></p><p>She prepared to offer up the Tianyuan Wondrous Stone to save Qi Yi's life.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yi was her disciple, and she had the responsibility to protect her.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 266</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rusty mechanical bird opened its mouth, its voice extremely annoying, with a sense of a petty person getting his way.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent, not yet speaking, when he heard the mechanical bird continue:</p><p></p><p>"Fifty years ago, there was also a powerful cultivator at the Sixth Step of Heaven who came looking for me. Hehe, at that time I was only at the Purple Palace realm, but I still got a taste of her. Who told her to keep thinking about her family and descendants? Unfortunately, after she died, I accidentally killed her entire family."</p><p></p><p>The mechanical bird was incredibly arrogant. </p><p></p><p>"I know you're very anxious and angry, but don't rush. Because even if you're anxious... you still can't hurt me, hahaha!" The mechanical bird laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of toying with important figures and the strongest cultivators felt great. With the miraculous artifact, even mythical beings couldn't harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Before coming, I already investigated your information. Aren't you... the type who would go offline to kill someone just for cursing you in a jade slip? Now that I've insulted you like this, don't you want to go to the Tai Huang Palace and teach me a lesson?" The mechanical bird Li Qiuchan said irreverently, "Oh sorry, I forgot, you're just a meat pig from the Cang Lan Realm. First, you can't go to the upper realms, and second, you're about to die."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes and shrugged: "Why don't you tell me the address of Dark Sun's headquarters, and I'll let you die... a little less painfully?"</p><p></p><p>The mechanical bird was slightly stunned: "Where does your confidence come from? Or is it that... you still don't know your current situation?"</p><p></p><p>With the Lei Family Four Generals, Li Qiuchan was already in an invincible position. And residing within the miraculous artifact, even the Blood Robed Sword God couldn't do anything to him. His true body was in the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>The miraculous artifact was forged by mythical powerhouses who could reflect all the heavens. The Yang Spirit of Tai Huang Palace had examined it before - even mythical beings from the lower realms couldn't cause any harm to him through the miraculous artifact. </p><p></p><p>After all, the Cang Lan Realm was a closed realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchan was fearless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes glanced at other parts of the mechanical bird's body, more information entering his eyes. He was looking for flaws in the miraculous artifact.</p><p></p><p>"My confidence naturally comes from my strength!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the Lei Family Four Generals, Qi Yuan was exceptionally calm.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical bird Li Qiuchan giggled: "Bring out your trump card, that powerful being who resembles a divine infant!"</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew that Qi Yuan's trump card was a powerful cultivator at the peak of the Sixth Step of Heaven. The appearance resembled a divine infant, but wasn't one. He had already seen through Qi Yuan's trump card.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the unfocused pupils of the Lei Family Four Generals turned towards Qi Yuan. Thunder filled the sky as a powerful divine domain unfolded. Even as puppets, the Lei Family Four Generals could exert strength at the peak of the Sixth Step of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't take the threat of the Lei Family Four Generals seriously. His eyes remained fixed on the mechanical bird.</p><p></p><p>"Who said my trump card is one divine infant? I clearly have... two!"</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, Qi Yuan chanted softly:</p><p></p><p>"Glorious yang, infants emerge from hiding, heed my command, exterminate all inauspiciousness!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, following Qi Yuan's voice, two terrifyingly powerful auras swept out. Two powerful beings exuding the aura of the Sixth Step of Heaven appeared. Their eyes were equally lifeless, but they still showed respect towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"At your command!"</p><p></p><p>Two powerful great venerable ones appeared, their divine domains unfolding at this moment. The battle also erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a look of surprise flashed in the eyes of the mechanical bird Li Qiuchan: "You actually had another trump card, beyond my expectations."</p><p></p><p>However, even so, things were still under his control.</p><p></p><p>At this time, six great venerable ones had already engaged in battle, their divine domains beginning to clash. </p><p></p><p>It was very clear that the divine domains of the two powerful beings on Qi Yuan's side were both stronger than any of the Lei Family Four Generals. However, when the divine domains of the Lei Family Four Generals combined, their power was formidable, enough to gain the upper hand in the clash.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, thunder and lightning intertwined with the essence of metal destruction and myriad woods. The entire void realm was filled with a murderous aura. If an ordinary Yin Spirit entered, they would likely be affected and instantly shredded to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Your trump cards were unexpected, but... at this rate, it won't be long before they all die!" Li Qiuchan was confident of victory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had two trump cards, which was beyond his expectations. But at this rate, he would definitely win.</p><p></p><p>"The battle isn't over yet, anything is possible... Otherwise in cultivator battles, why would we need to fight? We could just compare cultivation levels, the lower realm would surrender directly and offer their heads." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He was still very calm, as if he were an outsider, just looking at the mechanical bird.</p><p></p><p>"You're an interesting person, but too dangerous. Otherwise, I might have asked my master to bring you up to be my pet," Li Qiuchan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan's nose grew a bit longer. He knew the other was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchan was indeed talking nonsense. The cultivators of the Cang Lan Realm were not something he could touch. Not just him, even his master couldn't bring people from the Cang Lan Realm up.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't like how you keep talking nonsense," Qi Yuan looked at Li Qiuchan.</p><p></p><p>"You don't like me, so come kill me?" The mechanical bird taunted crazily. </p><p></p><p>He had the miraculous artifact, he was fearless.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "I will naturally grant your wish."</p><p></p><p>"You're even more stubborn than me, but unfortunately... look, how much longer can your two trump cards last? Three hundred breaths?" The mechanical bird Li Qiuchan said.</p><p></p><p>Battles between Yin Spirits were decided quickly. Those battles that lasted hundreds or thousands of years were probably between Purple Palace realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The victor is still unknown," Qi Yuan still looked confident.</p><p></p><p>The clash between great venerable ones had no fancy tricks, it was purely a collision of divine domains. This kind of collision also had no techniques.</p><p></p><p>The rusty red mechanical bird housing Li Qiuchan's eyes turned slightly: "I'm very curious, what exactly are you relying on?"</p><p></p><p>The other's demeanor didn't seem like an act at all.</p><p></p><p>"Or do you have more trump cards? If so, you'd better bring them out quickly. The Lei Family Four Generals, if they die then they die, I'll just send new ones."</p><p></p><p>To him, the Lei Family Four Generals were just like four large toys.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you need to send people? Just tell me the address of Dark Sun's headquarters, I'll go myself!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you really are confident in defeating the Lei Family Four Generals. What's the harm in telling you Dark Sun's address! It's in... the Ghostly Sky Domain, Wind Thunder Valley!" Li Qiuchan was full of confidence, not afraid of revealing Dark Sun's location at all.</p><p></p><p>"Since I know the address, this boring battle should end," A sharp glint flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had deciphered the flaw in the miraculous artifact. It was time for him to close the net.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Qiuchan still had a punchable expression.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush, after dealing with the Lei Family Four Generals, it'll be your turn," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, do you really take me for some trash you can kill at will?" Li Qiuchan said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan chanted again.</p><p></p><p>A familiar chant, familiar fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Four terrifying figures seemed to walk out from an unknown place. They also appeared puppet-like, with chiseled cold faces and lifeless eyes. </p><p></p><p>The strength of each of these four powerful beings was no less than the previous two.</p><p></p><p>Six great venerable ones attacked simultaneously to suppress the Lei Family Four Generals. The scales of victory had clearly tipped to Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Li Qiuchan's face froze for an instant: "Where did you... get these powerful beings from? You've certainly surprised me, but that's all."</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he still stood undefeated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, six great venerable ones attacked, simultaneously suppressing the Lei Family Four Generals. The divine domains of the puppet-like Lei Family Four Generals continuously collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Qi Yuan smiled mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his figure flashed, bursting forth at extreme speed. His entire person actually bypassed the clashing great venerable ones, his hand grabbing hold of the mechanical bird.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical bird was slightly stunned, then sneered: "So you schemed for so long, just to grab me? But do you really think you've caught me? Sorry, although I'm only at the Purple Palace realm, you're not qualified to kill me, nor can you do it."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so!" Qi Yuan's hand suddenly exerted force.</p><p></p><p>The originally indestructible miraculous artifact suddenly developed a crack at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchan was dumbfounded at this moment: "How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The miraculous artifact was supposed to be able to reflect all the heavens, created by mythical beings and examined by a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How could it be broken!</p><p></p><p>Even myths couldn't do that! After all, even if there were myths in the Canglan Realm, they weren't myths that could reflect across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Just as he thought this, Li Qiuchen immediately felt a thick wave of flames engulf him. </p><p></p><p>His face twisted into a ferocious expression: "You are indeed surprising, destroying the magical artifact, but... do you think this mere Sun True Fire can harm me!"</p><p></p><p>This was only part of his consciousness. Even if it was ambushed and burned away completely, returning to the upper realm would not affect his true body.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword Saint, I'll be waiting for you at Dark Sun headquarters!" Li Qiuchen's eyes blazed, seeming excited. "Next time, after I kill you, I'll destroy the Blood Robe Alliance. I'll take good care of your family and friends, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his consciousness also detached from the magical artifact.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was deep and unfathomable. He paid no heed to Li Qiuchen's threats: "Too bad you won't see me destroy Dark Sun."</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan possibly let an enemy who had danced before him for hundreds of breaths live so long?</p><p></p><p>Given Qi Yuan's personality, he would naturally strike to kill directly!</p><p></p><p>Thinking returning to the upper realm meant safety? </p><p></p><p>That was underestimating him too much.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was used to reaching through network lines to strike people!</p><p></p><p>Even if the other end of the line... was in the upper realm, it wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he glanced over.</p><p></p><p>The six great lords had attacked simultaneously. The divine domains of the Lei family's four generals were already shattered and withering, barely hanging on.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the four Lei family generals and said softly: "Be free."</p><p></p><p>He extended a palm.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the divine infant within his body trembled. Powerful energy gathered in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He gently pushed forward.</p><p></p><p>With just one push of his palm, it landed on the bodies of the four great lords. </p><p></p><p>The four great lords' divine domains were already shattered, leaving them with no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Their massive bodies fell at that moment, but there was no expression in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Return to the world." With Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the Lei family's four generals shattered in that instant, turning to ash, truly returning to the world.</p><p></p><p>No need to be enslaved by enemies after death.</p><p></p><p>Having dealt with the Lei family's four generals, a hint of killing intent flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "You think returning to the upper realm means I can't reach through the network to cut you down? Cleaning up the online environment starts with me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up. Through the virtual realm, he saw the Sun Golden Core in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Golden Core wasn't just something that could be summoned to Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>As long as he knew the coordinates, he could strike wherever he pointed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Middle Three Realms, Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Huang Palace was a hegemon-level power in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>It controlled countless worlds, nearly a thousand in total.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in one of those worlds.</p><p></p><p>In a desolate, uninhabited cave dwelling, a man in purple robes awoke. His eyes still held a trace of lingering fear, his face somewhat pale, but even more so filled with arrogance and confidence.</p><p></p><p>"That guy actually managed to destroy the magical artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Qiuchen was still somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he noticed something.</p><p></p><p>"Sun True Fire?"</p><p></p><p>Within his consciousness, there was a wisp of Sun True Fire so faint it was barely perceptible.</p><p></p><p>When the Blood Robe Sword Saint destroyed the magical artifact, he used Sun True Fire to burn Li Qiuchen's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>That wisp of consciousness being burned counted as a minor injury to him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, he actually managed to wound me. When I ask my master to grant me another magical artifact, I'll definitely imprison him and make him watch as I humiliate his friends!" As a discarded true disciple, Li Qiuchen's personality had long since become twisted, taking pleasure in tormenting others. "Hmph, he thinks he can kill me? At most he just left a trace of Sun True Fire in my body!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about this mark at all.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew the mark served as coordinates, could a lower realm person like the Blood Robe Sword Saint really come up here to kill him? He wasn't in any rush to remove the mark.</p><p></p><p>He got up, his face still somewhat pale, his eyeballs sunken, looking quite fierce.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he went to a cave dwelling, his face showing a respectful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling ahead lived a powerful expert who had taken six steps to ascend to heaven.</p><p></p><p>This expert was his master, and also the disciple of the strongest myth-level expert in this world.</p><p></p><p>In the Canglan Realm, he had treated myths as nothing, killing and humiliating great lords at the peak of six steps to heaven.</p><p></p><p>But in the upper realm, faced with an expert like this, he still had to act subservient.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" An displeased murmur came from within the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple encountered some trouble in the Canglan Realm that needs to be reported to Master!" Li Qiuchen truthfully reported what had happened in the lower realm to his master.</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice from within the cave dwelling was surprised: "The Canglan Realm is indeed full of talent, but no matter. Master will give you another magical artifact. You command Dark Sun to destroy him!"</p><p></p><p>The old man didn't take the Blood Robe Sword Saint seriously.</p><p></p><p>The fate of beings from the Canglan Realm was sealed from birth.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword Saint was nothing but a dead man.</p><p></p><p>"Master also cannot remove the Sun True Fire in your body, but it's no matter. It merely serves as a marker and won't harm you."</p><p></p><p>The aged voice came from the cave dwelling, and Li Qiuchen's last worries dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A vicious look flashed in his eyes as he prepared to return to the lower realm to deal with the Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, the sky of this realm suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchen jerked his head up, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening... the sun is falling!"</p><p></p><p>His voice trembled, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the sky above, a blinding light suddenly shone down.</p><p></p><p>The projection of an enormous star was falling.</p><p></p><p>The entire sky was filled with just the projection of one sun!</p><p></p><p>No, two! There were two suns, carrying an infinite aura of destruction as they fell, as if they would erase the entire world!</p><p></p><p>That endless scorching light, that terrifying heat wave, and the aura that burned everything - it made everyone tremble in fear!</p><p></p><p>The great lord in the cave dwelling was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew about the suns in the sky above, and had reported it to those on duty above. Although they hadn't appeared for long, it was very clear that those two suns were aimed at that person from the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now, the two suns were actually falling towards this realm.</p><p></p><p>This realm... had no Sun God to guard it!</p><p></p><p>However, as the projections of the two suns fell, many powerful experts still acted together to try to block the suns' descent.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to act wildly in Tai Huang Palace territory!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Tai Ling Realm under Tai Huang Palace's jurisdiction!"</p><p></p><p>One great lord after another took action, using divine power to try to block the tyrannical descent of those two suns.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, one sun was more fierce than the other. Their attempts to block had little effect.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we haven't offended any expert of this level. This attack... won't fall on us." The old man in the cave dwelling reassured. He was actually quite curious about which fellow cultivator had angered the unknown expert in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He would have been better off not saying anything. As soon as he spoke, Li Qiuchen's face turned even paler.</p><p></p><p>Because the wisp of Sun True Fire in his body was now exceptionally bright and hot, burning him.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he seemed to understand something, filled with terror yet unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Sun True Fire! The suns in the sky are coming for the Sun True Fire!" Li Qiuchen hurriedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>It seemed only his master could save his life now.</p><p></p><p>"What?" The master was stunned, also somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could do anything, in the next breath.</p><p></p><p>The projections of two enormous suns fell directly above his head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Endless heat and light, endless fire and heat waves swept out in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchen's face was filled with terror. Before his consciousness faded, he thought of the Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand, couldn't comprehend. His body was engulfed in flames, his soul and spirit destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As for his master, even as an expert who had taken six steps to heaven, he couldn't escape under the descent of two Sun Golden Cores.</p><p></p><p>But until his death, he remained somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>How could that Sun True Fire... be the coordinates for the sun?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Canglan Realm, Qi Yuan shrugged: "I hate show-offs the most. How's that? Two Sun Golden Cores through the network line... feels good, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>I recommend a novel, with a link below. Those who are interested can check it out directly.</p><p></p><p>The title is "Bronze and Fire King: The Invincible Path of the Sword Saint"</p><p></p><p>This is a high-powered martial arts profession novel. The protagonist has the inheritance of a giant dragon. Kill kill kill!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

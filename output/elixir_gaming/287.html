        <h1>Chapter 287</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He finally said, "Can we meet in person?"</p><p></p><p>For a business deal worth 100 million, he felt uneasy without seeing the other party face-to-face. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's death would be a small matter, but losing 100 million would be too painful.</p><p></p><p>"Make it quick, I'm very busy," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after some time, when his abilities greatly improved, he wouldn't even care about 100 million anymore.</p><p></p><p>"How about the Star Sea Cruise Ship in Tianyue City two days from now?" the man in the black jacket asked tentatively. </p><p></p><p>In two days, the luxury cruise ship Star Sea would dock in Tianyue City for three days. During those three days, the ship would resupply and also hold a banquet, inviting some social elites to attend.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... you'll cover the ship ticket and transportation costs," Qi Yuan agreed.</p><p></p><p>He could treat it as a free meal.</p><p></p><p>"The invitation will be delivered to you tomorrow, and a chauffeur will pick you up the day after," the man in the black jacket arranged everything very properly.</p><p></p><p>This was actually a show of strength.</p><p></p><p>It was telling Qi Yuan: I know your information and address.</p><p></p><p>"Alright. By the way, bring more Kunqing grass, I'm short on it," Qi Yuan looked at the man in black jacket and continued, "If it's convenient for you, collect some more materials for me. Deduct the cost from our transaction."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and the transaction amount should be after tax."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan briefly mentioned a few other materials he needed, then ended the video call.</p><p></p><p>In the border town, the man in the black jacket's expression was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The conversation had yielded too little useful information, and the other party held the initiative.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the customer is god. </p><p></p><p>But he felt that the person named Qi Yuan was truly god-like.</p><p></p><p>That casual ease, and the confidence in his words, were not something an ordinary person could possess.</p><p></p><p>As an arms dealer, the man in the black jacket had many gunmen under him and had killed before. He had seen all sorts of people, but this was the first time he'd encountered someone like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man's face showed extreme dissatisfaction: "This Qi Yuan is too arrogant, not giving any face at all. This is a 100 million deal!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attitude left the short-haired man quite displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Zhi, remember to prepare the materials Qi Yuan mentioned just now," the man in the black jacket instructed.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired man Ah Zhi was slightly stunned: "Boss, are we really going to collect them?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... if we successfully meet, this deal... we'll probably go through with it," the man in the black jacket understood himself well.</p><p></p><p>Since he was already tempted,</p><p></p><p>This deal would definitely go through.</p><p></p><p>Unless the other party showed major flaws when they met.</p><p></p><p>But the video chat had been flawless, so major flaws during the meeting... were unlikely to appear.</p><p></p><p>"We're really doing it?" Ah Zhi swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>That was 100 million Qin yuan!</p><p></p><p>After tax, no less.</p><p></p><p>If he had that much money, he would have quit this job long ago and gone to enjoy life.</p><p></p><p>"We're doing it," the man in the black jacket said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Ah Zhi seemed to understand something, and said, raising an eyebrow, "Should I arrange some people on the Star Sea to... take care of him..."</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? This is a legitimate transaction! Business requires credibility!" the man in the black jacket glared at Ah Zhi.</p><p></p><p>He understood Ah Zhi's meaning, which was essentially to double-cross the other party.</p><p></p><p>How could they double-cross in a transaction involving cultivation techniques? What if it was real, wouldn't that mean the other party was a cultivator?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Already booked, temporarily rejecting private messages. Stop tipping, no refunds."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then commented this on his video comment section and pinned it.</p><p></p><p>After that, Qi Yuan exited the short video app.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, this is our Mingwu member group. I've invited you, please accept." </p><p></p><p>Second Senior Brother sent an invitation with a group join link.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, thanks Second Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the group named "Mingwu Gathering Place".</p><p></p><p>The group had over 300 members.</p><p></p><p>After joining, Qi Yuan just lurked, reading the group messages.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, secret items are too expensive, completely unaffordable," a female member with the nickname Little Fish complained in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Fish, your husband is about to kick the bucket, and you're still worried about those secret items worth just over a hundred thousand?" a member laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Most of the inheritance is going to his sons, I can only get a small share?" Little Fish's words carried dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, trading three years for an inheritance worth over 100 million, I'm envious!"</p><p></p><p>"@Hall Master, can the secret items be cheaper? They're too expensive, we can't afford them!" Little Fish said in the group at this point.</p><p></p><p>Several other students chimed in as well.</p><p></p><p>"Make them cheaper, we can't afford them!"</p><p></p><p>"We're so poor we don't even have underwear to wear!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group messages, Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask: "What are secret items?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always maintained the good quality of asking when he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"Are you new here, brother? When martial artists reach advanced levels, they need to use secret items to enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and don't think of secret items as some kind of genetic drugs, they're completely natural," a kind student explained further.</p><p></p><p>"At what stage should secret items be used?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"When you've cultivated the 'Mingwu Resonance Fist' to the seventh level, you need to start using secret items, otherwise you can't make progress.</p><p></p><p>Generally, it's senior students like us who have practiced 'Mingwu Resonance Fist' for three or four years or more who use secret items to enhance our strength." This kind big brother said a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother must be very strong after practicing for so long, right?" Qi Yuan asked curiously, "Can you catch bullets with your bare hands?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." That big brother was speechless, "Brother, you're joking..."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like even senior members aren't that strong," Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't say these words in the group chat, that would be too insensitive.</p><p></p><p>He lurked in the group for a while, mostly seeing complaints about how expensive the secret items were.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Qi Yuan gathered from the group, normal martial arts practice required secret items worth several hundred thousand per month.</p><p></p><p>That would be several million a year.</p><p></p><p>No wonder only rich people practiced martial arts.</p><p></p><p>How could ordinary people afford to spend several million a year on martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"I need to hurry and reach the seventh level to see what these secret items really are."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite curious.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was at the first level of 'Mingwu Resonance Fist', still quite far from the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were many differences between the martial path and the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the more difficult to cultivate immortal path, Qi Yuan had already reached the third level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>If he had enough resources, Qi Yuan could immediately build his foundation.</p><p></p><p>But the martial path was different, it required practice.</p><p></p><p>Real practice.</p><p></p><p>Every time Qi Yuan performed the 'Mingwu Resonance Fist', he felt a bit of improvement.</p><p></p><p>This improvement wasn't in proficiency, but in martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"But ordinary people... probably can't keep practicing more than a few times a day... I'm different, I can practice continuously!"</p><p></p><p>In the living room, Qi Yuan practiced the 'Mingwu Resonance Fist' again for a while.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, he began cultivating his immortal techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I probably need to reach the Yuan Dan stage before I can summon the projection of the Solar Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Right now, I'm... too weak, I need to keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was being very low-key right now.</p><p></p><p>For example, selling techniques through videos.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few comments below... Well, if this were in the Cang Lan Realm, Qi Yuan would have tracked them down through the internet.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was just a small newbie at the third level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Track people down through the internet to beat them up?</p><p></p><p>Too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Couldn't be bothered.</p><p></p><p>At least wait until the Yuan Dan stage before considering cleaning up society, right?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, without</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having the confidence to say I don't eat beef.</p><p></p><p>At 10 PM on the second night, Qi Yuan returned again after taking a shower.</p><p></p><p>He lay on the couch, watching the news on TV.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, criminals have infiltrated our city. Please be vigilant about personal safety."</p><p></p><p>"The pearl of Qin Yuan, the sixth princess of Tiancheng, celebrated her coming of age ceremony today. Congratulations to the princess!"</p><p></p><p>"'Canxing' has become the buzzword of the year, with more and more citizens eager to immigrate to Canxing!"</p><p></p><p>"The Yuelang cabinet imposed a 'rainwater tax', with protesters gathering in the streets."</p><p></p><p>The news introduced various events happening around the world.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, in a few days, the sixth princess will be assassinated, and a coup will occur in the country of Yuelang," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He still retained memories of the coming year, though he was unaware of most events.</p><p></p><p>But the innate seed still knew about major events that would become trending topics and headlines.</p><p></p><p>"With those restarters around, this sixth princess probably won't be assassinated this time."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had not yet contacted the Gongyi family, with so many restarters, someone must have already made contact with the Seven Wustar families.</p><p></p><p>Preventing the princess's death was such a great merit, someone would surely do it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's phone rang.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at it - it was a call from Wang Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, how did the blind date go? Was the person Cui Fan introduced reliable?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't work out." Qi Yuan recalled the woman in tight clothes, from whom he had borrowed quite a bit of money.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, there will be better ones in the future. The job I recommended... do you want to consider it?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, thanks monitor. I've found something to do for now that can make money."</p><p></p><p>"You can make money?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, working for others is impossible. I want to do business. We'll talk when we meet tomorrow. Gotta go."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to refuse such kindness, but he was too lazy to say more. He still needed to practice cultivation for a while.</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the line, Wang Xu was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"Do business?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan doing business? This was too unexpected.</p><p></p><p>After all, who didn't know Qi Yuan was mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>Could a mentally ill person do business? Selling what? His body? But the other party had already hung up, so he couldn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Qi Yuan is right, working for others is too tiring. Tomorrow I still have to work hard investigating sea monsters. Damn Sea Star Gorge!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Please have a seat, sir."</p><p></p><p>Inside the residential complex, a burly man in a suit opened the car door. Qi Yuan sat in the car and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>This car was arranged by the man in the black jacket to pick up Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although wearing a suit, Qi Yuan could still smell a faint scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>This man had killed before.</p><p></p><p>Such a person could scare ordinary people in a civilized city, but to Qi Yuan... well, it was just so-so.</p><p></p><p>"Does your boss have a lot of money?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>The driver was stunned for a moment, then answered in the local dialect: "A lot."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. After all, being powerful makes cooperation easier."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was too lazy to look for partners.</p><p></p><p>One partner was enough.</p><p></p><p>Especially since they had gathered all kinds of materials for him, he just needed to cultivate. This was the best.</p><p></p><p>The driver fell silent and didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the car stopped at a port.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, please follow me. The boss is waiting for you on the cruise ship."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and followed the suited man onto the cruise ship.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Star Gorge cruise ship was a medium to large cruise ship in Gongxing, nearly 500 meters long and able to accommodate close to 10,000 tourists.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cruise ship was docked at the port, with uniformed guards watching the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Groups of men and women entered from time to time, smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, there were also young men and women taking photos with phones and cameras.</p><p></p><p>Some were livestreaming, some were checking in.</p><p></p><p>Some conversations also reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"I heard this cruise ship belongs to Prince Tael. I wonder if I'll have a chance to have a beautiful encounter with this prince."</p><p></p><p>"Stop dreaming. You need money to buy tickets. I heard the tickets cost over 10,000!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, there are also ways to get in without paying. One of my sisters and brothers went!"</p><p></p><p>"Special channels?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah... sigh, too bad I didn't pass the physical exam, otherwise I would have had a chance to go in!"</p><p></p><p>There were many wealthy and powerful people on the cruise ship, attracting many young boys and girls.</p><p></p><p>After all, squeezing into such high society could change their life trajectories.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the suited man through the VIP channel, boarding the cruise ship under the envious gazes of those young men and women.</p><p></p><p>The cruise ship was huge, with many people inside, all well-dressed individuals.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, one could see armed guards patrolling.</p><p></p><p>"The security on board is very good. Ordinary guests cannot bring weapons, so Mr. Qi doesn't need to worry about his safety," the suited man emphasized.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not concerned."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was only at the third level of Qi cultivation, his third level was different from others.</p><p></p><p>On this ship, there was nothing that could threaten him.</p><p></p><p>The suited man fell silent and didn't speak again.</p><p></p><p>"Where's your boss? Hurry up, I'm in a rush to get back and practice martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the suited man, weaving through the cruise ship for about twenty minutes.</p><p></p><p>"Soon, we'll be there in a minute. The boss is waiting for you in the hall ahead," the suited man said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he had deliberately led Qi Yuan around to give the boss more time to observe Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded and didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, not far from the cruise ship, a young girl in an evening gown blinked her eyes, as if doubting whether she had seen correctly.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Wuqi?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, I must have seen wrong. I thought I saw a high school classmate, but I must have mistaken him for someone else.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, that high school classmate of mine should be my junior... He was really handsome. At that time, there were several girls in our class who followed him every day.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for frequent training, I might have wanted to have a relationship with him. What a pity... Now that I'm a public figure, I have to be very careful about dating."</p><p></p><p>Wuqi had delicate and beautiful features under her air bangs and pear-blossom hairstyle. Her makeup was on the cold side, with heavy eye shadow on her eyelashes. The black evening gown perfectly accentuated her figure.</p><p></p><p>"Although you can't date openly, you earn a lot. Aren't you still an outstanding alumnus of your school?</p><p></p><p>When people see you, they all call you a big star."</p><p></p><p>"What big star, I'm just a high-class service worker. I still have to go in and drink with guests later..." Wuqi rolled her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the manager couldn't help but say, "If you don't want to socialize, we can arrange to cancel it."</p><p></p><p>Of course, she was just saying it casually. Canceling was impossible.</p><p></p><p>"No, I need to seize opportunities like this. It might be some big resource. I don't want to be an idol without fame for my whole life!" Wuqi said pragmatically. As she spoke, she pulled her evening gown down a bit, revealing more fair skin.</p><p></p><p>This social engagement was something she had actively requested.</p><p></p><p>She also understood that she might even need to offer herself if necessary, but she still agreed to come.</p><p></p><p>Such things were common in various circles, for both men and women.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's not some fat old geezer," Wuqi thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan entered a grand and luxurious reception hall.</p><p></p><p>The hall was very large, decorated lavishly without any attempt at low-key design.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket stood up and looked at Qi Yuan, a smile appearing in his eyes: "Qi Yuan, I am狂欢 (Kuanghuan)."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

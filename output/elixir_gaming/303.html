        <h1>Chapter 303</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the villa was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>It had been over a day and night since Kuanghuan was captured. </p><p></p><p>No one had come to offer condolences at Kuanghuan's villa, making it seem extremely quiet.</p><p></p><p>It was as if everyone had forgotten about Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>In the military camp.</p><p></p><p>The general was in full military uniform, with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>He had just finished a phone call with his superiors.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his assistant asked, "Should we inform Kuanghuan's family?"</p><p></p><p>The general shook his head: "Kuanghuan's family is no longer rational. Saying anything now would be useless. They will only focus on their own interests and won't put national interests first. We can't explain such a major matter to them."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, it was the old moral kidnapping again.</p><p></p><p>The state is a tool of the ruling class, especially in Qinyuan country where the royal family and the Seven Martial Stars jointly rule.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the assistant nodded.</p><p></p><p>He naturally understood the general's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"The higher-ups want to keep this matter low-key and handle it quietly," the general said again. "If Kuanghuan's family comes looking for me again, find an excuse to put them off."</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the assistant acknowledged the order. "This time, it's Kuanghuan's own fault. He should have just stuck to selling arms, but he had to go to the front lines."</p><p></p><p>The general nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>If they had followed the plan to buy arms, Kuanghuan wouldn't have had any problems.</p><p></p><p>In his view, Kuanghuan was not only selling arms but was also greedy and insatiable, doing other business, which led to him falling into enemy hands.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't charged Kuanghuan with any crimes, which was already magnanimous.</p><p></p><p>Now that Kuanghuan had been captured, putting them in a passive position, the general saw this as a major mistake.</p><p></p><p>"He probably won't die, but some physical suffering is inevitable," the general said calmly.</p><p></p><p>With Wugui country being hostile to Qinyuan country, now that they had captured Kuanghuan, he would certainly suffer physical torment.</p><p></p><p>Whether his limbs and internal organs would be intact when he returned was another matter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the villa.</p><p></p><p>Kuangxi looked at the somewhat frail man before her, a flicker of disappointment in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>During this time, she had also investigated some of Qi Yuan's background information. The only information she obtained was that Qi Yuan was an apprentice at the Mingwu Resonance Martial Arts Gym.</p><p></p><p>His encounter with her brother was also a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>As for other information, she couldn't investigate at all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she didn't know that Qi Yuan's improved robot, Zero One, had already hidden and disguised Qi Yuan's online identity information.</p><p></p><p>The information others could find was only the most basic.</p><p></p><p>"So... Kuanghuan is now in the Saqing military camp in Wugui country?" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>According to Kuangxi, Kuanghuan was captured while collecting Dragon Root.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Root was a key material Qi Yuan needed.</p><p></p><p>But this plant grows in Wugui country, and Kuanghuan had taken the risk to go there, resulting in the information being leaked and him being captured by Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we've pleaded with the generals above, but they all made excuses.</p><p>Mr. Qi, do you know any powerful figures who might be able to communicate with Wugui country and get them to release my brother?</p><p>Our Kuang family is willing to pay... any price!" Kuangxi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was the family's hope and held the title of viscount.</p><p></p><p>Her brother also had no children. If he were to die out there, the hereditary viscount title would likely pass to another branch.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know any powerful people," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>He had only been in this world for three months.</p><p></p><p>Today was the first time Qi Yuan had left Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>How could he know any powerful people? Sure enough, hearing Qi Yuan's words, both the young woman and Kuangxi showed disappointment in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm already very happy that Mr. Qi could come," the young woman couldn't help but say, thinking of others' reactions, she felt even more indignant.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan said, "Actually... I'm quite capable.</p><p>If you arrange a special vehicle to take me to the front lines, I'll go rescue Kuanghuan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan had fallen because of him.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was also his little brother, still working for him.</p><p></p><p>He naturally had to rescue Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>He was a good person, lawful and kind, and didn't need to create any selfish persona, so he naturally acted as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for so long, he had never yet clashed with a modern army.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had the chance, he naturally wanted to go kill some.</p><p></p><p>After all, when his strength increased and he returned to his peak combat power,</p><p></p><p>He could destroy the stars in the sky with one punch. At that time, bullying ordinary people would no longer be interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... you'll go rescue him personally?" Kuangxi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>This answer was beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>Not only her, but Kuanghuan's wife was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'll go personally and bring him back from the military camp," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>This matter seemed trivial to him.</p><p></p><p>This statement completely baffled Kuangxi.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, their idea was to have some big shot use diplomatic means and exchange of interests to bring her brother back.</p><p></p><p>Directly rescuing someone from a Wugui country military camp... no one had even thought of such an idea.</p><p></p><p>With Qinyuan country's military strength, they could indeed steamroll Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>But Guwu country was not to be trifled with either.</p><p></p><p>How could Qinyuan country casually start a war just for one Kuanghuan?</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... you're not joking, are you? That's a Wugui country military camp, with a regiment's worth of troops!" </p><p></p><p>According to Wugui country's military system, a regiment had about 3,000 soldiers.</p><p></p><p>About 3,000 soldiers, equipped with various advanced weapons, tanks, armored vehicles, drones, and even fighter jets.</p><p></p><p>Breaking into such a military camp to rescue someone was undoubtedly a dream.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when Qi Yuan said he would go rescue him, how could they not be surprised and feel it was inconceivable?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I know.</p><p>I'll rescue the person, you just need to arrange the transportation," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The young woman was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Kuangxi was also stunned, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their reactions, Qi Yuan said helplessly,</p><p></p><p>"Madam, you don't want Kuanghuan to suffer in the military camp, right? Don't waste time, prepare the personnel to send me to the front lines.</p><p>As for how I'll rescue him, that's up to your imagination."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been time-efficient and never wasted words.</p><p></p><p>The young woman and Kuangxi couldn't help but exchange glances.</p><p></p><p>They were both a bit confused now, as today's events had developed too strangely.</p><p></p><p>They felt that it would be normal if they were dealing with a mentally ill person.</p><p></p><p>However, Kuanghuan's wife could only nod vigorously at this point: "I'll immediately have someone arrange to send Mr. Qi to the front lines.</p><p>Mr. Qi... if it proves impossible, please ensure your own safety!"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's wife spoke very tactfully.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't rescue him, then so be it, just don't get himself involved.</p><p></p><p>Kuangxi also said at this time, "Since my brother trusts you, we'll entrust this matter to you, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan had once told his wife that if they encountered a critical situation, they should rely on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So, Kuangxi and Kuanghuan's wife were willing to arrange for Qi Yuan to go to the front lines.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and make the arrangements, I'm in a rush," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This time, going to the front lines, based on the journey, would probably take several days.</p><p></p><p>There were only two days left until the start of the Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p></p><p>He definitely wouldn't make it back in time.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll arrange it immediately. Please wait a moment, sir," Kuangxi said before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Now, only Kuanghuan's wife and Qi Yuan remained in the room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the young woman and said, "I have some business to attend to. I need to make a phone call."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out his phone and made a call.</p><p></p><p>On the other end, Yang Shan's voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you calling me, kid?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to ask for a favor," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't a privileged person and didn't enjoy special treatment, with a mental illness certificate, using a privilege... shouldn't be a big deal, right?</p><p></p><p>"What kind of favor?" Yang Shan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"A partner of mine got into some trouble. I need to go abroad to bail him out," Qi Yuan explained the origin of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"You're serious about this, kid. Your combat skills are decent, but against gene warriors, you probably won't stand a chance," Yang Shan said, not knowing what had happened. He was afraid that after Qi Yuan reached the limit of martial arts, he would become overconfident and dare to challenge some untouchable entities.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored this and continued, "I won't be able to participate in the martial arts competition two days from now. Can you help me get directly admitted to the national level?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have time to participate in Tianyue City's martial arts competition. He wanted to directly participate at the national level.</p><p></p><p>As a martial artist at the peak of martial arts, Yang Shan was considered a celebrity in martial arts circles. That's why Qi Yuan thought of asking for his help.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan pondered and said, "Your strength is indeed enough to skip the city-level competition and participate in the national one. How about this - when you come back, I'll take you through a special channel to participate in the national competition. But this... will require testing your strength. You'll need to fight someone at that time."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Qi Yuan said, breathing a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>If it didn't work out, he would probably have to visit the organizing unit of the martial arts competition. That would be too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Being able to resolve it was good.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Kuangxi returned. She looked at Qi Yuan, her voice carrying a hint of respect: "Mr. Qi, the journey has been arranged. We'll first take a car to the airport, then fly. When we reach Dian City, we'll switch to a sedan. There will be people specifically assigned to pick us up! The journey will take about two and a half days."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It would be like going on a vacation.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Two days passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in the sedan, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>The driver was a burly man who had a gun at his waist.</p><p></p><p>This burly man was a trusted associate of Kuanghuan, a member of the mercenaries.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the car was driving on the main road. The burly man focused on driving but occasionally glanced back at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know Qi Yuan's identity, but he had been informed from above that Qi Yuan was going to rescue his boss.</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, not knowing how Qi Yuan would carry out the rescue.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Stop the car."</p><p></p><p>The car immediately braked, and the burly man looked confused: "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"There's something interesting. I didn't expect to encounter it here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got out of the sedan.</p><p></p><p>In the distance was a desert-like terrain, with weeds interspersed with some yellow sand.</p><p></p><p>The air was a bit dry, and when the wind blew, some sand would rise.</p><p></p><p>Not far away on the ground, one could occasionally see mineral water bottles and condoms hanging on trees.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped in front of a plant, looking serious.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Emerald Cage Grass, good for purifying bloodlines."</p><p></p><p>Purifying bloodlines had some use in the world of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators with bloodlines inherited from ancient fierce beasts would use materials like Emerald Cage Grass to purify their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>However, this was useless for ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation had nothing to do with bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's cultivation didn't need Emerald Cage Grass either.</p><p></p><p>But in the path of martial arts, it might be useful.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan encountered it, he naturally wouldn't be polite. He bent down and dug up this Emerald Cage Grass.</p><p></p><p>The burly man beside him looked puzzled, not understanding, but his perception of Qi Yuan's oddity increased a bit more.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's get back in the car and continue on."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke and returned to the car.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was wearing a trench coat, and his hair was longer than three months ago.</p><p></p><p>If his hair grew a bit longer and he changed into ancient clothing, he could pretend to be a person from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The burly man continued driving, and as he drove, he said, "The road we're taking now is a smuggling route. Later, we'll join a convoy of smugglers from Yuelang Country, pretending to be one of them, in order to enter Wugui Country."</p><p></p><p>"Oh... Aren't the two countries at war? How are they still smuggling?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Because the smuggled goods are high-end items, things needed by the nobles of both countries. For example, Timi wine is a specialty of Yuelang Country, brewed with spring water unique to Tila Mountain. This wine is particularly popular among the upper class and nobles in Wugui Country. So, even though war has broken out, those in power and the nobles will prohibit smuggling of other things, but not Timi wine. Therefore, the smuggling convoys now actually serve the upper class and nobles of both countries. Although the people below are fighting to the death, the upper class... still needs to maintain their luxurious lifestyle, right?" The burly man's words carried an indescribable tone.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, he belonged to the people below, to the lower class.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder everyone wants to be in power," Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Even the upper class of Wugui Country lives so luxuriously, I can't imagine what kind of life those families in the Seven Martial Stars lead," the burly man's eyes were full of envy.</p><p></p><p>His boss, Viscount Kuanghuan, was already considered a big shot in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But compared to those from the Seven Martial Stars, he was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, not interested in these matters.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the car stopped in a small town.</p><p></p><p>The burly man said to Qi Yuan, "Mr. Qi, please follow my lead later."</p><p></p><p>On the way, the burly man had already told Qi Yuan what was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>Everything had been arranged by the burly man.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the burly man said, "Mr. Qi, it's not too late to back out now. Once we join the convoy, we won't be able to go back directly."</p><p></p><p>These words were also what Kuanghuan's wife had instructed him to tell Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Once they decided to go, they couldn't return directly.</p><p></p><p>The two countries were still at war, and running around on the front lines could result in being killed by drones.</p><p></p><p>"We'll return after rescuing Kuanghuan," Qi Yuan smiled, "Hurry up, let's get this done quickly. The air here is too dry, I don't want to stay too long."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, the burly man didn't know whether to feel relieved or disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Because he would have to follow along for the entire journey.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Qi was going to his death, he would surely die as well.</p><p></p><p>In a way, he rather hoped Mr. Qi wouldn't go.</p><p></p><p>However, if Mr. Qi went, he would follow.</p><p></p><p>His life was given by his boss.</p><p></p><p>He would return it to his boss.</p><p></p><p>For him, the world was that simple.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 295</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was as if being stared at by a terrifying creature.</p><p></p><p>Goosebumps appeared on her delicate, snow-white skin.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, breathing slightly rapidly: "What's so special?"</p><p></p><p>"Your... blood." Qi Yuan looked at Wu Qi, her skin was snow-white, and he could even see the blue veins, with blood flowing slowly through the blood vessels.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"My blood?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't quite understand, and even thought Qi Yuan was a nobleman with strange fetishes.</p><p></p><p>"To me, the most special thing about you is your blood." Qi Yuan shrugged, "Why don't you give me some blood, and I'll grant you some small wishes. </p><p></p><p>Oh... menstrual blood won't do!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan added at the end of his speech.</p><p></p><p>If Wu Qi tried to cut corners and directly brought menstrual blood, that would be too much.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan never underestimated the "base nature" of humans.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Wu Qi, who had always thought herself open-minded and able to accept anything, couldn't help but blush to her ears.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head, not daring to look directly into Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words had too great an impact on her.</p><p></p><p>Now, her mind was in chaos, imagining various scenarios.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that Mr. Qi was a... monster who loved to drink young girls' fresh blood?</p><p></p><p>"How's your consideration going?" Qi Yuan smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's heart was in turmoil, but finally she gritted her teeth, stretched her head towards Qi Yuan, and pulled down her clothing a bit, revealing her snow-white neck.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... take my blood!"</p><p></p><p>She faced death unflinchingly, as if resigned to her fate.</p><p></p><p>The path she had chosen, she had to walk it to the end.</p><p></p><p>Compared to losing some blood, she wanted more to become someone above others.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity was right in front of her, she didn't want to let it go.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm omnivorous, I don't drink human blood. Drinking human blood... is illegal.</p><p></p><p>I never do anything illegal or against regulations.</p><p></p><p>Take your neck back, I'll find you when I need blood in the future."</p><p></p><p>His strength was still too weak now.</p><p></p><p>Although he had discovered that Wu Qi's blood was somewhat special, even if she gave it to him now, he would need to consume considerable energy to research why it was special.</p><p></p><p>For him now, this was not a key matter.</p><p></p><p>So, it was merely leaving a foreshadowing.</p><p></p><p>For him now, improving his strength was the most crucial thing.</p><p></p><p>When his strength was strong enough, he could see at a glance why it was special.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Wu Qi felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"My blood will always be reserved for you, sir!" Wu Qi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I live in the Jun'an Residential Area, you drive."</p><p></p><p>"Jun'an Residential Area?"</p><p></p><p>She set Jun'an Residential Area as the destination.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the general location of Jun'an Residential Area, Wu Qi's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>In high school, she had heard from classmates that Qi Yuan was an orphan of a martyr.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing Qi Yuan on the cruise ship, she had guessed that it was Qi Yuan deliberately hiding his identity to attend school.</p><p></p><p>But now, hearing that Qi Yuan lived in Jun'an Residential Area, many thoughts came to her mind.</p><p></p><p>How could such a big shot, someone even hereditary viscounts tried hard to please, live in such an ordinary neighborhood?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there was some hidden story?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Jun'an Residential Area." Qi Yuan closed his eyes slightly, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wu Qi felt confused and puzzled in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to ask why Qi Yuan would live in such a place.</p><p></p><p>But even though she was confused, she didn't dare to ask.</p><p></p><p>After all, if she accidentally offended Qi Yuan, she wouldn't even know how she would die.</p><p></p><p>In Qinyuan Country, it wasn't a big deal for a nobleman to kill a celebrity.</p><p></p><p>Qinyuan Country, this ancient empire, had clear distinctions between upper and lower classes.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's heart was in turmoil as she drove her car towards Jun'an Residential Area.</p><p></p><p>As night was about to fall, and various colorful lights illuminated this modern city, the car finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the bright daylight on the road, as night approached, not all the street lights near Jun'an Residential Area were lit.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a completely different place compared to where Wu Qi lived.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this ordinary neighborhood, her confusion grew even stronger. This neighborhood had nothing to do with rich areas.</p><p></p><p>It was even inferior to her own neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stretched lazily, looking at the familiar neighborhood, he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"We're here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got out of the car, and Wu Qi hurriedly followed, seeming to want to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for driving me, it must have been troublesome," Qi Yuan said politely.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi quickly replied, "It's no trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Here's... 27 yuan for the fare."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, taking out twenty-seven yuan from his pocket, in both bills and coins.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>Fare?</p><p></p><p>"Take it quickly, I'm not a freeloader," Qi Yuan always abided by the law, "And don't post about me online, saying I'm stingy. When I went to the martial arts gym, the fare was 26, and I added an extra yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held out the money to Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>He gave cash, not a transfer.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was afraid the police uncles might misunderstand.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi took the money with a dazed expression, unable to understand Qi Yuan's actions.</p><p></p><p>Is this the eccentricity of a big shot?</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a cat that can cook at home, so I won't invite you in. Bye-bye."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very polite, but also very direct in leaving, leaving only a bewildered Wu Qi in the wind.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her inner emotions extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>"Does he really live here?"</p><p></p><p>She felt uneasy in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, her manager had told her this morning that maybe that Qi Yuan was just... an ordinary person who had helped Viscount Kuanghuan with something, which was why Viscount Kuanghuan valued him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, Zhao Shiqi... asked me to... say he hopes to meet you and apologize."</p><p></p><p>On the phone, Kuanghuan's voice was a bit nervous and joyful.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he and Qi Yuan had been attacked by a sniper.</p><p></p><p>When he learned it was the work of Earl Heijing, his only thought was to take Qi Yuan and leave, to avoid this storm.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly... Earl Heijing Zhao Renji died suddenly that very day.</p><p></p><p>If this wasn't Qi Yuan's doing, Kuanghuan wouldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>This also made Kuanghuan understand that Qi Yuan was truly a cultivator, able to kill invisibly.</p><p></p><p>Earl Heijing Zhao Renji had so many guards around him, but was still killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Who is he? I don't know him." Qi Yuan had never even heard this name before.</p><p></p><p>"He is Zhao Renji's younger brother, and now... the head of the Zhao family."</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Renji's death, the power shifted.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi wasn't useless either. Although he had his own persistence and beliefs, the power of the Zhao family naturally wouldn't fall into others' hands.</p><p></p><p>In just one day, he had completely taken control of the Zhao family.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, him. I'm too lazy to meet. I've already killed the people I wanted to kill, what's the point of meeting him? Does he want to avenge his brother?</p><p></p><p>Tell him I have a certificate of mental illness, I'm not afraid of him." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Kuanghuan felt both delighted and shocked.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Zhao Renji was killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't been reluctant to pay that 100 million and double-cross Qi Yuan back then.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan could easily kill Zhao Renji, killing him would be just as easy.</p><p></p><p>"I will convey Mr. Qi's words to Zhao Shiqi exactly.</p><p></p><p>By the way, Mr. Qi, I'm afraid Zhao Shiqi doesn't know yet... that Zhao Renji was killed by you. Should I... conceal this fact?" Kuanghuan paused on the phone.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not pretending to be weak to catch the strong, why should I conceal it?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have a certificate of mental illness, what am I afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>With no parents, no children, and a certificate of mental illness, Qi Yuan was already an invincible person in this era.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Kuanghuan agreed on the phone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hung up the phone and continued to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Qi Yuan practiced cultivation according to routine.</p><p></p><p>During the day, he went to the martial arts gym to train, and at night he returned home to refine some medicinal herbs for immortality cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Life was peaceful and calm.</p><p></p><p>If there was any difference, it was that she now had a dedicated driver, Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>And on one occasion when Wu Qi was driving him home, others at the martial arts gym discovered this.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi was considered a minor celebrity in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>This matter caused quite a stir at the gym.</p><p></p><p>Everyone said that Qi Yuan was dating the big star Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's gaze towards Qi Yuan also changed, and she looked directly at him with a strange expression, saying: "No wonder, so you're dating a big star."</p><p></p><p>In the Mingwu Martial Arts Gym circle, apart from people of Xu Tiehua's status, the other rich kids still didn't have the right to look down on Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi picking up and dropping off Qi Yuan every day truly surprised everyone at the gym.</p><p></p><p>Especially Wang Shiqiao, who had learned from her close friend Xing Yu that Qi Yuan was just from an ordinary background.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu's gaze towards Qi Yuan also changed.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Qi Yuan was on the same path as her.</p><p></p><p>She also inexplicably developed a bit of goodwill towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Qi Yuan once again got out of Wu Qi's car and entered the residential complex.</p><p></p><p>The lights in the complex were dim, with an orange glow that felt particularly warm.</p><p></p><p>On a flat area, there was a burly man practicing boxing.</p><p></p><p>His punches were powerful and extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even felt that Xu Tiehua, the top person at Mingwu Martial Arts Gym, was far inferior compared to this burly man.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang, still practicing martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked directly over.</p><p></p><p>The burly man's name was Yang Shan.</p><p></p><p>He had moved in next door to Qi Yuan a week ago, and could be considered Qi Yuan's neighbor.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was in his thirties, with a burly build and an aura of a military man.</p><p></p><p>However, he had suffered some injuries and retired early.</p><p></p><p>Because he also practiced martial arts, and Qi Yuan practiced martial arts, the two became familiar.</p><p></p><p>After all, in terms of martial arts, Yang Shan had gone further down the path.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan would occasionally ask Yang Shan some questions.</p><p></p><p>"You're back? Hmm, another breakthrough?" Yang Shan glanced at Qi Yuan, a sharp look flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent... is very frightening." Yang Shan's expression was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"Just average, third best in the world." Qi Yuan wasn't modest at all.</p><p></p><p>"You probably want to ask me how to break through to become a martial artist?" Yang Shan spoke up at this point, his expression becoming serious.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>At present, Qi Yuan had cultivated the "Mingwu Resonance Fist" to the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>He was just one step away from breaking through to the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the seventh level would allow him to obtain a martial artist certificate.</p><p></p><p>Regarding breaking through to the seventh level, Qi Yuan actually still had many doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"To become a martial artist, you need to form your own innate martial technique!</p><p></p><p>An innate martial technique exceeds the limits of the human body and can exert terrifying energy.</p><p></p><p>It is said that in ancient times, when martial artists reached a certain level, they could even form their own innate killing moves, capable of severing rivers with a single finger! Of course, after research and discussion, experts have said these are unfounded claims, and innate martial techniques simply cannot advance to become innate killing moves."</p><p></p><p>As Yang Shan spoke, a trace of disappointment flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was not only a retired soldier, but also a peak martial artist.</p><p></p><p>On the path of martial artists, he had almost reached the limit.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he was no longer able to defeat those who had taken high-level gene potions.</p><p></p><p>After being injured, he chose to return to his hometown, which was the Military Peace Residential Complex.</p><p></p><p>"Talking about innate killing moves with you now is a bit like discussing mythology, getting off topic.</p><p></p><p>Let's continue talking about innate martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>This is the core of every martial artist, and every martial artist's innate technique is different.</p><p></p><p>For example, the champion of the last Martial Arts Tournament, his innate technique was the Phantom Sound Fist.</p><p></p><p>With one punch, countless phantom images could be seen, making it impossible to defend against.</p><p></p><p>You could say that such an innate martial technique is already close to the Dao, exceeding human limits.</p><p></p><p>After all... we carbon-based life forms are actually... very weak if we don't take high-level gene potions."</p><p></p><p>As Yang Shan spoke, a look of reminiscence appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he first demonstrated his innate martial technique, it was the first time he felt that martial arts were so fascinating.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that he... had embarked on a path of transcendence.</p><p></p><p>After all, an innate martial technique was not an ordinary boxing technique, nor was it any kind of skill, but rather... transcendence.</p><p></p><p>That's right, this was how Yang Shan defined innate martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although this transcendence was weak, it truly was transcendence.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after wasting over ten years, he had already reached the peak of martial arts, but still couldn't break through the limits.</p><p></p><p>Especially after practicing martial arts diligently for most of his life, only to have others easily defeat you after taking a single high-level gene potion.</p><p></p><p>Even innate martial techniques had no effect against those people.</p><p></p><p>Taking gene potions could even awaken gene techniques, completely outclassing innate martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan became disillusioned, feeling that the path of martial arts... had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>For so many years, even with researchers studying martial arts, and some top martial arts experts spending huge sums to establish research labs to study methods of breaking through martial arts limits, they still hadn't succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts had even been reduced to a folk culture in need of protection, as well as a competitive sport.</p><p></p><p>"Transcendence?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he hadn't seen an innate martial technique before.</p><p></p><p>At Mingwu Martial Arts Gym, there were only a few martial artists, and he wasn't familiar with them, and no one casually demonstrated innate techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Calling it transcendence is actually just gilding the lily for martial arts." Yang Shan laughed self-mockingly.</p><p></p><p>If martial arts were truly transcendent, how could taking gene potions allow one to demonstrate techniques similar to innate martial techniques?</p><p></p><p>"Hearing about it a hundred times is not as good as seeing it once.</p><p></p><p>Let me personally demonstrate my innate martial technique for you.</p><p></p><p>Flood Thunder Palm!"</p><p></p><p>As Yang Shan's voice rang out, his gaze also became sharp at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura spread out, and Qi Yuan detected a presence that surpassed ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"Slightly stronger than... Blue Star humans." Qi Yuan made his judgment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only slightly stronger, still unable to withstand swords and blades.</p><p></p><p>"Ha!" </p><p></p><p>Yang Shan let out a loud shout.</p><p></p><p>A powerful palm thrust forward, the air seemed to vibrate, and a muffled thunder sound seemed to ring out in the air.</p><p></p><p>Flood Thunder Palm, as its name suggested.</p><p></p><p>Such a palm strike was enough to astonish ordinary people, and could easily shatter bricks with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Striking an ordinary person, it could even kill them with one palm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan squinted his eyes, seeing something different in this palm strike just now.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, if you lived on Blue Star, performing brick-breaking palm strikes on video platforms every day, you would definitely become a qigong grandmaster of a generation, a big streamer with millions of fans.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this is Arch Star."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan offered his evaluation.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's punch did indeed contain a bit of transcendent factors.</p><p></p><p>On Blue Star, this power could fool quite a few people into thinking he had real kung fu.</p><p></p><p>But this was Arch Star, where many people took gene potions.</p><p></p><p>Some people could even perform feats like bending steel bars with their bare hands.</p><p></p><p>Peak martial artists were nothing special.</p><p></p><p>"What's Blue Star?" Yang Shan asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"A blue planet, well, it's my hometown. Actually... I'm an alien."</p><p></p><p>"...Don't tell me your mental illness certificate is real?" Yang Shan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, he had been warned that this neighbor had a mental illness certificate.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan said he was pretending, because having a mental illness certificate made it easier to get things done, and there were subsidies.</p><p></p><p>He believed it.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed Qi Yuan's mental illness didn't appear to be fake.</p><p></p><p>PS: Starting tomorrow, I'll resume stable updates and gradually make up missed updates. There's quite a bit to make up.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 149</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Palace of Light, the atmosphere was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Last time, there were only a dozen Purple Mansion cultivators here.</p><p></p><p>Now, there were over thirty Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The number had already exceeded half of the Palace of Light's total.</p><p></p><p>These Purple Mansion cultivators gathered together, their expressions not looking very good. </p><p></p><p>The Third Palace Master Purple Zhu spoke, his voice no longer as calm as before: "All Purple Mansion cultivators outside, return to headquarters immediately."</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal had displayed late-stage Purple Mansion strength.</p><p></p><p>Purple Zhu hadn't taken it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Purple Mansion realm had already comprehended the essence of spiritual energy and awakened their innate divine abilities. </p><p></p><p>Killing them would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal killed five Purple Mansion cultivators. In their view, he had clearly exhausted his fighting strength and was recuperating somewhere.</p><p></p><p>As a result, six more Purple Mansion cultivators from the Palace of Light had fallen one after another.</p><p></p><p>The development of events far exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Before the confrontation with the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal is over, all Purple Mansion cultivators are to stay at headquarters," Third Palace Master Purple Zhu spoke, issuing orders.</p><p></p><p>The other Purple Mansion cultivators on the scene looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood-Robed Sword Immortal... how should we deal with him?" one Purple Mansion cultivator asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Palace Master is currently negotiating with the Eastern Land Leader of the Divine Flower Society. </p><p></p><p>Before the negotiation results come out, we only need to hold out at headquarters," Third Palace Master Purple Zhu said, a hint of helplessness in his words.</p><p></p><p>Their Palace of Light, as the righteous leader of Emerald Cloud Continent, had never been so constrained before.</p><p></p><p>However, that Blood-Robed Sword Immortal was clearly no ordinary late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He slaughtered Purple Mansion cultivators with ease.</p><p></p><p>"If... we make peace, it would truly be a great humiliation for our Palace of Light!" a Purple Mansion cultivator spoke up, already foreseeing the outcome.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's innate divine ability was formidable, and he kept moving around. It would be very difficult for the Palace of Light to capture him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if he dares come to our headquarters, we'll make sure he dies without a burial place," an elder spoke up.</p><p></p><p>They were used to being overbearing, and it was hard for them to accept backing down for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal isn't a fool, how would he come to our headquarters to die?" a Purple Mansion elder said, "Those who have cultivated to this level are all shrewd. Sigh, it seems this time our Palace of Light can only swallow this grievance."</p><p></p><p>"He's getting off easy!" the yellow-robed woman spoke up.</p><p></p><p>In the Palace of Light, a meeting quietly came to an end.</p><p></p><p>From today onwards, no one in the Palace of Light mentioned hunting down the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal again, nor did anyone dare to mention this person.</p><p></p><p>All the elders and stewards were waiting for the Grand Palace Master to return.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal who was currently bouncing around on the Divine Flower Society's forum, they could only ignore him.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's brow still carried a trace of worry.</p><p></p><p>The heaven-grade secret technique that Old Man Wutian had taught her still hadn't made any progress during this time.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Qi Yuan and Kang Fulu, waving her slender hand: "Fish Dragon Banquet, are you two interested?"</p><p></p><p>In Jiang Ya's hand was an invitation to the Fish Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who had been on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings would receive this invitation to attend the Fish Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu's eyes lit up: "Interested!"</p><p></p><p>At the Fish Dragon Banquet, there would be a live performance of the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance.</p><p></p><p>This was much better than recordings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "I have a friend who's about to arrive in Cloud City, I need to go meet him. He'll take me to the Fish Dragon Banquet, so I won't go with you."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was also very surprised: "Junior brother, you actually know friends here too?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, met online."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu didn't quite understand the words "online" - met on a spider web?</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, don't get scammed," Kang Fulu advised.</p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple of the Divine Light Sect, he had to look out for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, don't worry." Qi Yuan glanced at the Divine Flower Society's jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He was nervous inside. It was just meeting in person, why were there so many issues? This Rogue Immortal Lord hadn't replied to his messages for two days.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully nothing had happened again...</p><p></p><p>On the spirit ship.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord looked at the man with drooping eyes, squeezing out a concerned expression: "Senior brother, are you feeling better?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, much better." The droopy-eyed man's face was pale, looking quite weak.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Rogue Immortal Lord was speechless inside.</p><p></p><p>This senior brother of his loved making friends.</p><p></p><p>As a figure on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings, he was considered a big shot even on this small flying ship.</p><p></p><p>But a few days ago, this senior brother had made friends with a woman from the Eastern Land Minor Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>This friendship quickly led to the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>If the Rogue Immortal Lord hadn't found him, his senior brother probably would have died from exhaustion.</p><p></p><p>That female cultivator from the Eastern Land Minor Genius Rankings practiced a technique that absorbed yang to nourish yin. The droopy-eyed man had fallen right into her trap.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the Rogue Immortal Lord could only consume his own vital energy to replenish his senior brother's depleted body.</p><p></p><p>After all, his senior brother was the hope of their sect.</p><p></p><p>He was also the only cultivator from their sect to enter the main rankings of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, stay away from those enchantresses in the future," the Rogue Immortal Lord advised earnestly.</p><p></p><p>The droopy-eyed man's face also showed a trace of fear, but with a hint of reminiscence: "Who told those enchantresses to be... so moist.</p><p></p><p>Junior brother, I've learned my lesson this time. Your senior brother definitely won't make this mistake again!"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord didn't believe him at all. This kind of thing had happened to his senior brother more than once.</p><p></p><p>And each time the sect master didn't warn him either, which puzzled the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to think about these troublesome things now.</p><p></p><p>"We're about to reach Cloud City. My friend said he'd meet me down there," the Rogue Immortal Lord thought of Origin Heavenly Lord with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, bring him along and we'll go to the Fish Dragon Banquet together.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, good things don't come easy. Luckily we made it in time for the Fish Dragon Banquet." The droopy-eyed man couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>This journey had truly been full of unexpected events.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an intentional yet casual voice came:</p><p></p><p>"To think a figure from the Eastern Land Genius Rankings would be bewitched by an enchantress.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien, when we reach Cloud City, don't say you're from Thunder Walking Continent."</p><p></p><p>A handsome man with waist-length hair appeared, his eyes carrying a sharp look.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien looked at the handsome man, his expression not very good: "Hmph, Luo Cha, wait until your ranking on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings surpasses mine before you talk!"</p><p></p><p>The handsome man named Luo Cha was from a sect that had long-standing grievances with Gao Jien's sect.</p><p></p><p>The two had never seen eye to eye.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien's ranking on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings happened to be ten places above Luo Cha's.</p><p></p><p>"This time when the Eastern Land Genius Rankings are finalized, I will definitely surpass you," Luo Cha said, his handsome face showing an unwilling expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spirit ship finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>An excited expression appeared on Luo Cha's face as he looked at Gao Jien and boasted: "See that golden-robed man over there? That's Lei Chong, ranked 89th on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings. He's my sworn elder brother. With his help, my ranking will definitely surpass yours this time!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gao Jien looked at Lei Chong with some trepidation on his face.</p><p></p><p>It was good that he was in the top 300 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>But the top 100 were the true geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord wasn't interested in Lei Chong either. He stood beside Gao Jien, constantly searching for something, but unfortunately found nothing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a delighted voice came: "Are you the Rogue Immortal Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord quickly looked over and saw a man wearing a blood-red robe appear in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The man's face was extremely handsome, with a cold and sharp aura about him.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the center of the crowd. If one didn't pay special attention, they might subconsciously overlook his presence.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Heavenly Lord??" The Rogue Immortal Lord looked at Qi Yuan, a delighted expression on his face. "You really came, and you're so handsome!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien also glanced at Qi Yuan and said: "So you're my junior brother's good friend. Indeed a talented individual."</p><p></p><p>In front of others, Gao Jien would still give face to his junior brother.</p><p></p><p>"I never rely on my looks, only on my strength," Qi Yuan said modestly when praised.</p><p></p><p>Today, knowing he would attend the Fish Dragon Banquet,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't attend as his original identity.</p><p></p><p>After all, he came from a small country. What if people looked down on him?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was even a Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator at the Fish Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>He needed to switch to a more impressive persona, like the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, to attend the Fish Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>This way, he wouldn't be looked down upon.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's shameless words, the Rogue Immortal Lord confirmed this was indeed Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's hurry to the Fish Dragon Banquet. If we're any later we'll be too late," Gao Jien said.</p><p></p><p>The Fish Dragon Banquet was very important for geniuses like them.</p><p></p><p>It was a great opportunity to expand their connections.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, it's truly embarrassing for you to associate with people like this.</p><p></p><p>On the spirit ship, that Gao Jien was actually drained of his vital essence by an enchantress, hahaha... it's really laughable." Luo Cha secretly said to Qi Yuan, then left laughing loudly at Gao Jien's frustrated look.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Gao Jien and couldn't help saying: "I didn't expect that despite your unremarkable appearance, you'd still be targeted by an enchantress. It seems your talent... is truly high."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jien was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Was this praising his high talent? Or insulting his looks?</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, Origin Heavenly Lord is very straightforward, don't take it to heart," the Rogue Immortal Lord quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, let's go," Gao Jien said with twitching lips.</p><p></p><p>The group of three headed towards the Fish Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>On the road, Gao Ji'en's mouth kept talking non-stop. </p><p></p><p>However, what he said was all bad things about Luo Cha.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan sigh that Gao Ji'en really held grudges.</p><p></p><p>This kind of person should never be offended.</p><p></p><p>If offended, they must be killed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it will implicate eighteen generations of ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the Rogue Immortal Master had been observing Qi Yuan the whole time.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had been offline restoring his senior brother's vitality.</p><p></p><p>He was not clear about what happened on the forum.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan, he couldn't help but ask: "Origin Venerable, are you really going to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Lady clearly said Origin Venerable was a big shot.</p><p></p><p>But where are there big shots participating in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking?</p><p></p><p>"Mm, of course I'll participate. My senior brother is also participating. This time I'm joining the Fish and Dragon Banquet with others," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master wanted to ask, aren't you at the Purple Mansion level?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, with Origin Venerable's way of thinking, he wouldn't get a reliable answer.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely say something like "I'm at Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, Immortal Grade Golden Core" and so on.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master simply didn't ask, and just treated Qi Yuan as a good friend of the Four Divine Flower Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Great Sun Flame Emperor and Ice Mountain Domineering Lady didn't come. Otherwise, with Ice Mountain Domineering Lady's sister at Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, we Four Divine Flower Emperors would definitely make a name for ourselves at the Fish and Dragon Banquet," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Under his blood-colored robe, he hid his aura of killing and eeriness very well.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master glanced at Qi Yuan and secretly asked: "What about the Blood Robe Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master only knew that the Blood Robe Sword God had killed many divine infants, but didn't know what happened after the Blood Robe Sword God came to Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that me?" Qi Yuan pointed at himself.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master was quite speechless upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to dwell on it anymore.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed, and Qi Yuan, the Rogue Immortal Master, and Gao Ji'en finally arrived at the entrance of the Fish and Dragon Banquet.</p><p></p><p>The Fish and Dragon Banquet was held in the Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace was located in the 300-mile Cloud Lake.</p><p></p><p>The three of them rode on an immortal boat, crossed the 300-mile lake, and saw a magnificent small island.</p><p></p><p>On the island, there was a majestic palace.</p><p></p><p>Various painted boats were moored on the lake, with songs occasionally coming from them.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan on the boat exclaim in admiration: "As expected of a big city, it's grand and prosperous enough."</p><p></p><p>Although he had become the overlord of the Flowing Wind Realm, he had almost always been holed up in Wugui City and hadn't been to other places.</p><p></p><p>Gao Ji'en raised his head: "Compared to our Purple Thunder City in Thunder State, this is far inferior. But the environment is quite elegant, suitable for seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Cloud City in Cuiyun Continent wasn't even considered a prosperous place.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it couldn't compare to Purple Thunder City, the most prosperous city in Thunder State.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Gao Ji'en with admiration: "As expected of someone from a big place, you really have knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this flattery, Gao Ji'en felt somewhat proud.</p><p></p><p>This Origin Venerable was much more pleasing to the eye than Luo Cha.</p><p></p><p>This made Gao Ji'en think that if it weren't for networking, he should spend more time in the future around "low-status people", as this was the way to get flattery.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Luo Cha, who would verbally attack him at every turn.</p><p></p><p>The immortal boat docked, and the three of them disembarked and headed towards the main hall of the Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked left and right, very curious about everything before him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were only young people here, no old folks, and no sign of his beloved.</p><p></p><p>Led by a maid, the three of them entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>In the huge palace, there were thousands of people.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, let's find a quiet place to sit for a while," said the Rogue Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Flower Association's group chat, the Rogue Immortal Master was quite eloquent, but in reality, he was a bit socially anxious and didn't like to interact with too many people.</p><p></p><p>Gao Ji'en glanced at his junior brother and smiled helplessly: "Don't cause any trouble. Your senior brother is going to meet some friends."</p><p></p><p>He didn't insist on taking his junior brother to meet people.</p><p></p><p>Let him chat with his friend there.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in a corner and casually picked up and ate a fruit from the table.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master had now relaxed.</p><p></p><p>For him now, this Origin Venerable was no different from him, both were newbies.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I wonder when I'll be able to enter the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking," the Rogue Immortal Master sighed, looking at the prodigies in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"That's easy, isn't it?" Qi Yuan scanned the room and said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The Rogue Immortal Master became interested.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I kill all the prodigies in the room, there will definitely be vacancies in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking, and you'll get in. Of course, I might not be able to kill that Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment person, but the others, not enough for me to kill," Qi Yuan said arrogantly, very concerned for the Rogue Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Master's expression changed slightly: "Origin Venerable, don't say such things out loud, just use mental communication. If others hear it, it's easy to misunderstand!"</p><p></p><p>This Origin Venerable was still the same as in the group chat, always talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I have no grudges with them, otherwise I really want to kill them all. This way, I probably wouldn't need to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle to enter the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Land Prodigy Battle, once participated in, would probably take ten days to half a month, or even years. Qi Yuan was simply too lazy to participate.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master wanted to cover Qi Yuan's mouth, or rather, stay far away from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was really afraid that some prodigies would dislike Origin Venerable and deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the Rogue Immortal Master had already eaten quite a few spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>And at their table, several more people had joined.</p><p></p><p>These people were probably like them, too lazy to socialize, just randomly finding a place to sit.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, where's your senior brother?" the Rogue Immortal Master asked casually out of boredom.</p><p></p><p>"He should be inside," Qi Yuan guessed that Kang Fulu was being led by Jiang Ya to meet some prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't interested in these things.</p><p></p><p>How could prodigies compare to his beloved?</p><p></p><p>"Inside?" The Rogue Immortal Master was a bit surprised, "This hall is divided into inner and outer halls. Only those ranked in the top 100 of the Prodigy Ranking can enter the inner hall."</p><p></p><p>The others at the table also looked at Qi Yuan with surprised gazes.</p><p></p><p>After all, those in the top 100 of the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking were almost certain to reach the Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>Anywhere they went, they would be considered true geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the one who took my senior brother in is in the top 100."</p><p></p><p>He had heard from his junior sister Jiang Lingsu that her sister Jiang Ya was ranked 17th on the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a woman at the table said, "Why don't you find that friend of yours and take us to see the inner hall too?"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Qi Yuan with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at them but didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>He had no relationship with these people.</p><p></p><p>If the Rogue Immortal Master had suggested it, he might have agreed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan didn't speak, the woman felt a bit awkward, and the gazes of the others towards Qi Yuan became somewhat mocking.</p><p></p><p>They secretly communicated mentally, who knows what they were discussing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored them and continued eating spirit fruits with the Rogue Immortal Master, thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a phoenix cry sounded.</p><p></p><p>From the inner hall, dozens of prodigies walked out.</p><p></p><p>The leader was Huang Tu. Although his ranking wasn't the highest, he was from Cuiyun Continent and was the host here.</p><p></p><p>The prodigies behind him were all giving him face.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Huang Tu's face was full of smiles, looking spring-like and joyous. Where was the sorrow of his master's recent death?</p><p></p><p>He strode forward with a respectful expression on his face: "Heavenly Soul Fairy has graced us with her presence, please come inside quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The phoenix cry signaled the arrival of someone ranked in the top ten of the Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Soul Fairy wore a black tight-fitting outfit, with a voluptuous figure.</p><p></p><p>In the outer hall, almost all the prodigies' gazes fell on Heavenly Soul Fairy.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Soul Fairy was ranked 8th on the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>She was someone they needed to look up to!</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master looked at Heavenly Soul Fairy with admiration: "Heavenly Soul Fairy is at Immortal Grade Foundation Establishment. If her clan had Yin Spirits, she would probably be at Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's gaze towards Heavenly Soul Fairy also became serious: "It seems that talent alone is not enough, you also need family background."</p><p></p><p>The others at this table also looked at Heavenly Soul Fairy with burning gazes. The woman from earlier sighed: "This is a true prodigy, someone who can determine the future situation of the Eastern Lands. Given ten thousand years, she might become someone like the Blood Robe Sword God."</p><p></p><p>"Shh, this is Cuiyun Continent, don't mention the Blood Robe Sword God," someone quickly reminded.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master was stunned.</p><p></p><p>How did even these prodigies know about the Blood Robe Sword God?</p><p></p><p>[The text then includes a recommendation for another book, which I have omitted from the translation as it's not part of the main narrative.]</p>

        <h1>Chapter 223</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"My lord!"</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods on the scene, as well as over a thousand villagers, looked towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Elder's breathing quickened slightly. </p><p></p><p>The Thunder God looked at Qi Yuan, but this time he did not speak rashly.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I visualized quite a few god-observing methods in one go."</p><p></p><p>After the Holy Mother of No Food had eaten her fill, or rather after the Heavenly Pillar was repaired, the visualization of the Observation Mountain became normal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used up all the evil god's spiritual power in his hand and visualized many powerful god-observing methods.</p><p></p><p>Every ordinary villager had one.</p><p></p><p>Wei He stood among the crowd, her young face full of determination. </p><p></p><p>Her brother Wei Ting visualized the Giant Spirit God and had powerful abilities.</p><p></p><p>She also wanted to be able to visualize a powerful deity and possess strong combat power to repay the Origin Lord.</p><p></p><p>"You sixty, come forward." Qi Yuan looked at Wei He, waving his hand, and immediately sixty villagers were separated out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the ancient gods looked at these villagers with curiosity. </p><p></p><p>They were also very curious what level of god-observing methods these ordinary villagers could obtain.</p><p></p><p>Wei He looked up, her small frame radiating an especially resolute gaze.</p><p></p><p>"For you, the Sixty Jiazi Gods."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his large hand, and immediately sixty god-observing methods floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods who had been full of expectation were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p><p></p><p>"Legendary!"</p><p></p><p>"Sixty legendary methods!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"I want a legendary method too!" an ancient god spoke up.</p><p></p><p>After all, even rare-level god-observing methods would be very useful to them.</p><p></p><p>Above rare was epic, and above epic was legendary.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to imagine mythical methods, and even legendary ones they only slightly hoped for.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Origin Lord brought out sixty legendary methods at once.</p><p></p><p>How could this not be shocking?</p><p></p><p>Back then when Qi Yuan produced twenty-one legendary methods at once, it had shaken the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now... sixty at once!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Thunder God's nose almost went crooked with envy.</p><p></p><p>"The Sixty Jiazi Gods, also known as the Tai Sui. Tai Sui are the lords who preside over each year."</p><p></p><p>These sixty god-observing methods fell into the hands of those sixty villagers.</p><p></p><p>The sixty villagers' faces all showed excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>Wei He, holding the Jiazi method, bowed deeply to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord, for your bestowal!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and visualize, you must break through to True God quickly."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the remaining villagers and waved his large hand. Suddenly over a thousand more glittering god-observing methods appeared.</p><p></p><p>The villagers before him were completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient gods were also completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because these god-observing methods... not a single one was below epic level, and most were legendary.</p><p></p><p>"The Thirty-six Heavenly Generals, Seventy-two Earthly Fiends!"</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-four Thunder Department Heavenly Lords!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Soldiers and Generals!"</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Mile Eye, Wind-Following Ear!"</p><p></p><p>"The Gourd Brothers!"</p><p></p><p>These over a thousand god-observing methods had everything, and even some mythical level ones were mixed in.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene had greedy looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I sense it, the one that matches my path is legendary!"</p><p></p><p>"How is it possible... so many powerful deities!"</p><p></p><p>"Even mythical powerhouses may not be able to create legendary level god-observing methods..." An ancient god's voice trembled, feeling somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand epic, legendary, and even some mythical god-observing methods.</p><p></p><p>Just these god-observing methods alone, the deities visualized behind them could easily suppress the Mortal Heart Realm! This... many ancient gods had terrifying guesses in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in the beautiful eyes of the Lotus Fire Elder as she recalled that day when the great sun hung in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Lord... must certainly be a lord of many stars.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not an ordinary lord of many stars.</p><p></p><p>Even among Yang Gods there were strong and weak ones, with extremely large gaps between them.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly visualize and break through to True God. </p><p></p><p>In the future I want to lead a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and generals to slaughter in all directions!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>He inexplicably recalled that day when he killed the golden-haired monkey at the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>He had killed someone else's prodigy, but the Ancient Ape clan had not shown any reaction.</p><p></p><p>Could they be plotting something?</p><p></p><p>If so, he would directly emulate Li Tianwang who holds up the pagoda, leading a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and generals to attack.</p><p></p><p>Should be able to wipe out the Ancient Ape clan, right?</p><p></p><p>These villagers were shaken inside, and one after another they accepted the god-observing methods and began to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the eyes of the over thirty ancient gods turned red.</p><p></p><p>Because those god-observing methods, they all especially coveted! Not just a few, but every single one!</p><p></p><p>Giving such powerful god-observing methods to ordinary villagers, in their view, was like feeding divine realm nectar to pigs!</p><p></p><p>"My lord doing this... is too... wasteful." An ancient god couldn't help but speak up, his voice somewhat stammering.</p><p></p><p>"How is it wasteful? They've followed me for so long, even if they haven't made great contributions they've at least put in hard work. What's wrong with giving out some benefits?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this couldn't even be called giving out benefits.</p><p></p><p>After all, these people would be his foundation in the future, meant to fight for him.</p><p></p><p>That ancient god fell silent, and the Thunder God was also speechless.</p><p></p><p>These villagers had followed the Origin Lord for not even a hundred years, no, not even a full year.</p><p></p><p>This counts as following for a long time?</p><p></p><p>If people from the Blue Star saw Qi Yuan's actions, they would treat him as a crazy spendthrift tycoon god.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan as if looking at an idiot.</p><p></p><p>But once the money is thrown at oneself, sorry, that's not an idiot, that's a godfather!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the villagers and many ancient gods looked at Qi Yuan with this kind of feeling.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Thunder God spoke with difficulty: "Actually, those legendary thunder methods from earlier... I felt they were quite suitable for this old one."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God hinted at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because among those over a thousand god-observing methods, there were a full dozen legendary ones, and nearly a hundred epic ones.</p><p></p><p>Every single one made the Thunder God's eyes burn with desire.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that had already emptied out Qi Yuan's reserves.</p><p></p><p>With nothing powerful left for himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "This time I specially chose a powerful one for you."</p><p></p><p>This time, he had deliberately visualized several more powerful ones.</p><p></p><p>For the Thunder God, the most powerful was the Lord of the Thunder Department of the Heavenly Court!</p><p></p><p>Mastering the lord of a department, how could that combat power be compared to mythical level?</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's knowledge, even the blood-colored stars in the sky were small fry compared to him.</p><p></p><p>Among the many star lords in the Heavenly Court, which one's true body would be weaker than an ordinary Yang God in power? Just take the Seven Stars of the Big Dipper - the true body of any one of them was probably not comparable to that blood-colored star in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention big shots at the level of the Ninth Heaven Responding Element Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful one?" The Thunder God's face was full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"All thirty of you have one." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-one ancient gods from the Ancient God Alliance, eight ancient gods who followed from the Ancestral Land, and the Thunder God - he had prepared god-observing methods for each of them.</p><p></p><p>Due to having too little True God power in hand, he had put quite some thought into these thirty ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>It was all to maximize the combat power of these people.</p><p></p><p>He only had one chance left to return to the past.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God of Gazing at Pines looked at Qi Yuan, his heart trembling.</p><p></p><p>His usually calm twin sister also couldn't remain composed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is what I prepared for you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his large hand, and immediately thirty god-observing methods appeared floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of everyone present froze.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were already prepared, after all they had seen over a thousand epic and legendary methods.</p><p></p><p>When they saw these thirty mythical methods, their breathing couldn't help but quicken.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Myth!</p><p></p><p>They were all myths!</p><p></p><p>And these myths seemed much stronger than imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient God of Pine, yours is the Imperial Teacher Chisong Zi, a great god of antiquity. Do not tarnish his reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Twilight Elder, yours is the Water Official Emperor who resolves calamities!"</p><p></p><p>"Pool Wind Elder, Star Lord of Water Virtue, in charge of all waters under heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"You, Water Luminary!"</p><p></p><p>"You two sisters, one Sun Luminary, one Moon Luminary!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You... Southern Mysterious True Myriad Blessings Celestial Worthy."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Deity... Nine Heavens Responding Original Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Worthy!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan distributed the thirty myth-level deity observation methods as if handing out cabbages, finishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods received the observation methods and immediately immersed their consciousness into them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless pieces of information flooded into their minds.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions showed joy, shock, or bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's consciousness briefly returned as they looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Celestial Worthy, for bestowing these methods!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these thirty ancient gods, his eyes full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can all step into... Great Veneration!"</p><p></p><p>The deity observation method was actually a way of borrowing power.</p><p></p><p>The first visualization had the best effect and provided the greatest improvement.</p><p></p><p>A legendary-level visualization method could allow a true god who had taken one step into heaven to break through over ten divine apertures at once.</p><p></p><p>A myth-level method was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Take Zhu Zhuangshi for example. He visualized the Marshal Tianpeng.</p><p></p><p>He had now taken three steps into heaven, just a hair's breadth away from Great Veneration.</p><p></p><p>This was with his foundation still being thin, as he was merely a divine infant.</p><p></p><p>If he were an ancient god, he might have already reached Great Veneration by now.</p><p></p><p>These thirty ancient gods all received observation methods that matched them. The effect of their first improvement would be even better and more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Thunder Deity - Qi Yuan had high expectations for him.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Deity had only taken four steps into heaven.</p><p></p><p>This time, obtaining such a high-level observation method, breaking through several minor realms would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, do your best. There's a little over a day left. While the heavenly pillar is still here, cultivate quickly."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his form vanished.</p><p></p><p>The thirty ancient gods on the scene had shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner, conveying the dialogue and events described in the original Chinese text.]</p>

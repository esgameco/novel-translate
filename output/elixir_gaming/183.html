        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Nine zhang tall, nine zhang around the waist!"</p><p></p><p>"Wearing a golden crown, clad in golden armor and battle robe, wielding a xuanhua battle axe."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan visualized, a towering figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>This figure was exaggeratedly massive, with height equal to waist circumference. </p><p></p><p>He glared with round eyes, holding an enormous xuanhua axe, his eyes filled with overwhelming fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>This was the Giant Spirit God.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li obeyed the Jade Emperor's order to lead 100,000 heavenly soldiers and generals to kill Sun Wukong.</p><p></p><p>The Giant Spirit God served as the vanguard, being the first to fight Sun Wukong.</p><p></p><p>Although his weapon was broken by Sun Wukong's golden cudgel and he was defeated,</p><p></p><p>He was still a heavenly general of the divine realm, an orthodox deity protecting the celestial palace!</p><p></p><p>"Do these evil gods have enough spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>"If not enough, I'll have to use some of my own."</p><p></p><p>The Solar Golden Pill shone, and the Second Question of Conscience appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>This time, what he visualized was different from the previous two times.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, golden light flashed again on the Mountain of Visualization.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He had also consumed some divine power.</p><p></p><p>The divine power of being the guardian deity of Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had succeeded! At this moment, the atmosphere in the chat group was heavy.</p><p></p><p>Just then, East River suddenly said: "Golden light flashed again on the Mountain of Visualization. Could it be that someone else has visualized an epic?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that fate favors us ancient gods?"</p><p></p><p>"If so, Venerable Tianbao can rest easier."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sky was pitch black. Wei Ting watched his sister sleeping in the room as he sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>His power had already reached the level of Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>In town, he would be considered quite skilled.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to those new gods who possessed sacrificial instruments, he was far behind.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the plague showed signs of improvement, he began training hard.</p><p></p><p>Because his enemy was a terrifying new god, one that even the powerful guardian deity of Qingshui Village could not truly defeat.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a black figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting abruptly stood up and saw the deity under the cold starlight. The deity spoke, his voice frigid: "Wei Ting, do you want to slay gods?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting's heart skipped a beat, and he nodded firmly: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>He felt he had met the right person.</p><p></p><p>Even if he might die this time!...</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light of dawn illuminated the earth.</p><p></p><p>Evil gods gathered in Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>Today, Shelong was hosting a children's banquet, inviting various gods.</p><p></p><p>Outside the grand temple, there was joyous singing and laughter everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In Kuangfeng Town, cages on horse-drawn carriages contained naked children.</p><p></p><p>Those children had dull expressions and blank stares, while some were innocent, laughing at the crowds outside.</p><p></p><p>Temple guards in golden armor escorted these children, slowly walking into the temple.</p><p></p><p>The various gods were dressed in splendid attire, some with white hair but youthful faces, some of unparalleled beauty, drinking fine wine and eating spirit fruits, thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p><p></p><p>"The last time we held a children's banquet was thirty years ago, quite a while back," said an elderly man with white hair and a youthful face, looking nostalgic.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, only three of us were in the Seven Towns of Fehuang City," the yellow-robed elder said with relish. "Back then, two ancient gods who couldn't stand us holding the children's banquet foolishly came to kill us. In the end, Brother Shelong subdued them with one finger and steamed them alive."</p><p></p><p>"Steamed alive? Brother Shelong is... truly creative."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this time, surely no fool would dare to crash our children's banquet, right?"</p><p></p><p>"With only one weak and powerless Ruoyu left, if he dares to come, he'd just be serving himself up!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's steam him alive!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the clinking of cups, there was nothing but joyous singing and laughter.</p><p></p><p>As for the village-level ancient gods under Ruoyu, they didn't even mention them.</p><p></p><p>Were those even considered gods? At this moment, Shelong walked out, wearing purple silk, looking extremely noble.</p><p></p><p>All the new gods hurriedly stood up, raising their wine cups, wanting to offer a toast.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, a sudden rumbling sound was heard.</p><p></p><p>The entire earth shook violently.</p><p></p><p>The wine cups on the table fell and shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>All the new gods were stunned, then turned around with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling grew louder and closer.</p><p></p><p>They looked over and saw a colossal giant suddenly appear between two distant mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>The colossal giant seemed to have its head reaching the sky and feet planted on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a golden crown and clad in golden armor and battle robe, it looked majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>The xuanhua axe in its hand hung down, resting on the peaks of two mountains.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying colossal giant lowered its head, looking down at the many evil gods in Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice rang out, nearly blowing down the houses in Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>"I am Wei Ting, vanguard of the Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Evil gods and false gods, come forth and meet your doom!"</p><p></p><p>The towering figure and thunderous voice exploded by their ears.</p><p></p><p>The residents of Kuangfeng Town showed terrified expressions.</p><p></p><p>Among those new gods, some looked scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>Others wore disdainful looks.</p><p></p><p>"What petty creature comes here seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The evil god of Huangsha Town suddenly stood up and flew towards that colossal giant.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting, transformed into the Giant Spirit God, possessed immense strength, like a bargain version of Pangu.</p><p></p><p>The huge xuanhua axe suddenly trembled and swung towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A single strike seemed to tear apart space itself.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhua axe, as large as a small mountain, could not only split mountains, but seemingly cleave an entire city in two.</p><p></p><p>The evil god at the late Purple Palace stage had just flown into the sky when this axe directly shattered him, turning him to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant killed with one strike, but was not satisfied, glaring with rage.</p><p></p><p>His thick hand reached into the temple.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, over a hundred new gods frantically summoned their ritual instruments, unleashing endless primal divine abilities at that hand.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant looked disdainful, white vapor puffing from his nostrils.</p><p></p><p>"You mere fledgling gods dare to be so reckless!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting, transformed into a giant spirit god, had immense strength. The golden glove on his hand shone brilliantly at this moment, indestructible.</p><p></p><p>It was a shadow condensed from immortal magical treasures - how could these mere primal divine abilities shatter it?</p><p></p><p>The thick hand crushed all the primal divine abilities and grabbed fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The new gods in the temple were seized like chicks. The towering giant exerted force, crushing dozens of new gods to death instantly.</p><p></p><p>Those huge eyes looked at the remaining new gods.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhua axe flew into Gale Town.</p><p></p><p>Its powerful pressure swept through, like Li Kui raiding an execution ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the huge towering giant also charged into Gale Town.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you running!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting's stature was excessively tall, yet he wielded the Xuanhua axe with extraordinary agility.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no need to worry about accidentally harming others.</p><p></p><p>Gale Town fell into chaos.</p><p></p><p>The iron-armored temple guards charged at him recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those temple guards that the townspeople viewed as fierce tigers were like flies in Wei Ting's eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave, over a dozen lives perished.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He roared again, slaying another dozen or so new gods.</p><p></p><p>The remaining new gods looked terrified and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Where had they ever seen such a powerful divine being, who seemed to be merely at the late Purple Palace stage, not even at the peak!</p><p></p><p>Yet one person had them fleeing in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting swung his axe again, felling several more evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The powerful evil gods couldn't even withstand a single axe strike.</p><p></p><p>He continued chopping frantically, reaping lives.</p><p></p><p>Shailang stood behind the new gods, his expression extremely ugly: "You insolent brat, you're forcing my hand!"</p><p></p><p>He was holding back, but could no longer restrain himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he had condensed half a divine aperture, he didn't dare use his divine power.</p><p></p><p>Because this divine power was hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>Using it once would delay his advancement to true godhood by decades, centuries, or even a millennium.</p><p></p><p>However, the towering giant before him gave him a strong sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>He even had a feeling.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't use that half divine aperture, he would be chopped to death by this terrifying giant.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't imagine how such a terrifying figure could appear in Flying Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>This guy claimed to be the vanguard of the Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>There was only one explanation - the God Observing Method!</p><p></p><p>This terrifying giant must have been an unimaginably powerful expert in his past life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, only that Wei Ting could have observed such a god.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shailang speak, the remaining new gods looked relieved: "Brother Shailang, quickly make your move and slay him!"</p><p></p><p>"This giant is truly terrifying. If we let him grow, Flying Desolation City will be in danger!"</p><p></p><p>These people placed all their hopes on Shailang.</p><p></p><p>Shailang was a demigod level expert.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong this terrifying giant was, he was only at the late Purple Palace stage, not even at the peak.</p><p></p><p>"You forced me to this!"</p><p></p><p>Shailang roared, a trace of true god aura dispersing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations in heaven and earth became terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The believers in Gale Town began to wither and crack.</p><p></p><p>The remaining dozen or so new gods finally regained some color in their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Who can withstand the might of a demigod!"</p><p></p><p>Shailang was triumphant as he looked at the towering giant ahead and shouted loudly: "Who dares to kill me! Do you dare?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a slightly cold voice rang out as a white-robed man appeared, his clothes white as snow, like a sword god.</p><p></p><p>"I dare!"</p><p></p><p>Stars flashed as a blood-red sword light streaked past like a meteor.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, even the new gods, saw a flash of red before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their entire vision was filled with red.</p><p></p><p>When the red dissipated and their vision returned to normal, they saw the white-robed man gently blowing on the blood on his crimson longsword, shaking off the droplets.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the headless corpse in the distance, a hint of mockery in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"At the same level, I am invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"Not even a Yin God, yet so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Wei Ting observed the Giant Spirit God, his strength surged, and Qi Yuan's level also increased.</p><p></p><p>Later, when Wei Ting went on a killing spree, slaughtering nearly a hundred evil gods, Qi Yuan's level skyrocketed again.</p><p></p><p>While Wei Ting was slaughtering evil gods, Qi Yuan wasn't idle either, personally taking action to kill temple guards in various towns and villages.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had reached level 72 as a divine being, at the middle Purple Palace stage!</p><p></p><p>At the same level, he had never feared anyone.</p><p></p><p>Shailang was a demigod, but so what?</p><p></p><p>He wasn't a true god. At the same level as Qi Yuan, how could he withstand the primal divine ability Qi Yuan had inscribed on his Solar Golden Core? Just a momentary distraction of one ten-thousandth of an instant was enough for Qi Yuan to slay him with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan looked at the remaining new gods, a cruel smile in his eyes: "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

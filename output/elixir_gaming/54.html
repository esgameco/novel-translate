        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>An indescribable emotion permeated the air, and Jinli couldn't help but ask, "How is he?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Armor Bridal Robe seemed to have anticipated this already: "The master is doing well."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the Crimson Armor Bridal Robe seemed to have lost all its spirituality and did not utter another word.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was at ease, for she knew that this was an elite imperial guard battalion resurrected from the dead.</p><p></p><p>They were already a battle-hardened troop that had perished in the past.</p><p></p><p>She looked towards the Demon Clan Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>And that Demon Clan Sovereign was also staring at her with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"The four divisions of the Divine Palace have long been buried in the mists of history!"</p><p></p><p>"Where in the world is there still the Imperial Guard Battalion?"</p><p></p><p>"You are nothing but illusions, mere demons of the mind!"</p><p></p><p>"You dare to disturb my supreme will, you shall be killed!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Clan Sovereign roared, seemingly about to charge towards the Imperial Guard Battalion and shatter those phantoms with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>However, something that left everyone dumbfounded happened.</p><p></p><p>He had only taken a step forward when he suddenly turned back and flew out of the city.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, from within the Imperial Guard Battalion, one of the ten great commanders, a black-armored archer with a long bow, drew the bow without fully pulling the string, and released the arrow.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The long arrow let out a sonic boom, leaving a long trail in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The lightning-fast feathered arrow pierced straight into the body of the Demon Clan Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Clan Sovereign looked back in disbelief: "Supreme... Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud "bang", the arrow exploded, and the body disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying giant beast, the Demon Clan Sovereign, was effortlessly shot down and exploded, just like a balloon being pierced by an arrow.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the civil and military officials present utterly shaken.</p><p></p><p>It also greatly shocked Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>The thin Sovereign next to him from the Heavenly Mandate Holy Gate was trembling, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>That was a powerhouse almost on par with the Supreme Sovereign, one of the top experts in the Demon Clan, yet he was shot down by a single arrow? Looking at the Imperial Guard Battalion in the sky, like divine generals, he had no thoughts of resistance.</p><p></p><p>The ten commanders at the forefront all had profound auras like the ocean! They were Supreme Sovereigns! And not just ordinary Supreme Sovereigns! Led by ten Supreme Sovereigns and nearly a hundred Sovereigns, this was an army of tens of thousands!</p><p></p><p>What a concept! There was not a single mortal among the soldiers. At the lowest, they were Xiantian experts, even without reaching the Houtian realm.</p><p></p><p>Such an Imperial Guard Battalion, who could stand against them?</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to find a crack in the ground and sneak back to the Heavenly Mandate Holy Gate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sima Ting suddenly burst into manic laughter, "Why? Damn heaven, why do you keep playing with me!"</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the thin Sovereign from the Heavenly Mandate Holy Gate: "He is from the Heavenly Mandate Holy Gate, and all of this was plotted by them!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Sima Ting resigned himself.</p><p></p><p>On the sacrificial altar, Jinli, although she had already guessed, still felt a surge of emotion and disappointment upon hearing the answer.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Land of the Human Clan, the Heavenly Mandate Holy Gate... in the end, they had fallen.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the Imperial Guard Battalion, and she thought of Qi Yuan still in the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>She made a decision in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She would use the Imperial Guard Battalion to quickly sweep away the difficulties she had encountered, and then... go to the ancient Qichu Tree, to see that man.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Qichu Tree, the divine tree of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>It is said that if lovelorn couples meet under the ancient Qichu Tree, they will be blessed by the divine tree.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" A cold expression appeared on Jinli's face.</p><p></p><p>She would once again play the role of the Queen of the Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>She had grown up being revered by the people, and she should do something for this country! At Jinli's command, the silent Imperial Guard Battalion stepped forward, and one of the great commanders, holding a long spear, thrust it towards the thin Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He was nailed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Withdraw the gun.</p><p></p><p>The gun recoiled and the person was extinguished. Sima Ting was also pinned down by a gunshot.</p><p></p><p>All the civil and military officials, seeing this scene, dared not run, only daring to shiver or kneel on the ground, begging for the forgiveness of Empress Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at the officials with terrified faces and those lying in the pool of blood, with no mercy in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Funeral Procession Formation outside the city and several demonic clan rulers were the problems she should have solved.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, kill the enemy!" Jinli's expression was majestic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the grievances suppressed for seventeen years seemed to be completely vented.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she just missed seeing that person, and it would have been perfect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride?" Qi Yuan stood in the space and gently patted Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Little Bride was clinging to his body like an octopus.</p><p></p><p>And Little Bride was dozing off.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Little Bride, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that you don't have a face." Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He didn't disturb Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that Little Bride seemed to have consumed a lot, just like him, and had not yet recovered.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had discovered Little Bride in this state.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he can't be so aggressive in the future.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided that in the future, he should just hide and hide.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the sleeping Little Bride suddenly moved.</p><p></p><p>If she had eyes, Qi Yuan would definitely observe that her long eyelashes fluttered and then she opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Little Bride wake up, Qi Yuan showed a gentle smile: "You're done, you've left the Yiguan Prohibition, and in the short term, you may not be able to see your clansmen."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yiguan Prohibition, there were many other bridal monsters.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride was still tightly clinging to Qi Yuan, like a clingy little dog.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if you will be uncomfortable with the environment, the place we are going to next is called... the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if there are also many monsters in the Five Elements Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>If the Five Elements Forbidden Land has many monsters, Qi Yuan decided that he would fight less with Little Bride, and he could also kill by himself.</p><p></p><p>Without Little Bride, didn't he still break through the Yiguan Prohibition? She was originally silly, she would knock things over when walking, and she would also mysteriously fall.</p><p></p><p>And her body is soft and delicate, small and exquisite. If they combine too often, Qi Yuan is afraid that she won't be able to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan also remembered a brother and sister on a certain TV show, and the elder brother said that even without that sword, he could defeat the enemy army.</p><p></p><p>But the ending was that the sister sacrificed the sword, and the brother died in battle.</p><p></p><p>Such an ending, of course, was not what Qi Yuan liked.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Forbidden Land... I'm coming."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Little Bride's icy cold little hand, and the two of them finally stepped into the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>It was very different from the XuanYuan Prohibition and the Yiguan Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, Qi Yuan did not see any flowers, trees, or other monsters in the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>The environment in front of him was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>On one side was lava, burning with raging flames; on the other side was ice, spewing forth springs; on one side was gold ore, with gold sand dotting the landscape, some even in a liquid state, flowing.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land, the gathering place of the five elements.</p><p></p><p>He tightly held Little Bride's hand and stepped into the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Little Bride's reckless and naturally silly nature, if he walked by himself, what if she fell into the fire and burned her clothes, exposing herself? Of course, the actual concern was what if she got injured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an aged voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Clothing Department, the old man has been waiting for you for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

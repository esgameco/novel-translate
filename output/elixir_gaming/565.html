        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Look, the blood vessels in my body have all ruptured!" </p><p></p><p>"Especially the capillaries, they are all bleeding!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously, extending his delicate white arm to show the Lord of the Flame Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Flame Realm's eyelids twitched violently: "Are you mocking me?"</p><p></p><p>At this level, the injury is also a Dao injury, a rule injury.</p><p></p><p>Even if the head is cut off, it's nothing.</p><p></p><p>Capillary rupture, this is called an injury?</p><p></p><p>"No, absolutely not, I swear on my integrity, quickly dissolve the rules, I'm about to die, hurry up and fulfill me!" As always, Qi Yuan was shameless and his acting was explosive.</p><p></p><p>"Looking for death!" The Lord of the Flame Realm raged, not dissolving the rules, but attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan sighed leisurely, "If you want to die, just commit suicide, why bother me?"</p><p></p><p>The current him was no longer the former him.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Flame Realm self-destructed 23 times, bringing Qi Yuan a massive amount of experience.</p><p></p><p>His strength has increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, in the Lord of the Flame Realm's repeated self-destructions, the flame rules were constantly dissolving, and Qi Yuan, holding the "fire" representative Renqi Guangming, reached an ultimate understanding of the flame rules.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, it would take me a day to kill you, but now, with my mastery of all the flames in the world, I only need thirty breaths."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, a ghostly white flame rose from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of all flames, the origin of all fires, condensed in my hand, burning eternally!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, terrifying and extraordinary flames rose and spread.</p><p></p><p>Underworld Fire!</p><p>Three Realms True Fire!</p><p>Crimson Lotus Hellfire!</p><p>Solar True Fire!</p><p>Yin True Fire!</p><p></p><p>Each flame had an extraordinary and mysterious color.</p><p></p><p>Placed in any realm, they could create extraordinary and mysterious things.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the flames were burning and destroying everything, even the void, the extremes, and dark matter could be burned clean.</p><p></p><p>"Since you don't want to commit suicide, then let me help you!" Qi Yuan's attack was fierce.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible, how can you comprehend the true essence of the flames?" The Lord of the Flame Realm desperately resisted.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was no match for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current Qi Yuan had already reached the Myriad Realms Boundary.</p><p></p><p>And he also mastered the same flame essence, his attacks were devastating.</p><p></p><p>"Ten, nine, eight... three, two, die!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the Lord of the Flame Realm only lasted twenty-nine breaths before falling.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Void Realm, quickly join forces with me, he is not at the Realm Boundary!" The revived Lord of the Flame Realm roared.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the blocking Lord of the Void Realm's expression changed repeatedly, and finally said, "This lord only agreed to help you block his retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The lord in front of him was truly too mysterious and unfathomable, he had somehow mastered the Lord of the Flame Realm's rules.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to take action.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to die!" The Lord of the Flame Realm roared, "After I die, it will be your turn!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Void Realm remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Qi Yuan could even enter the Black Sky? This was impossible.</p><p></p><p>So he chose to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he took action and Qi Yuan also grasped the rules he possessed, it would be a loss.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Flame Realm roared, desperately screaming, and was slain again.</p><p></p><p>Each time he died, he died faster.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the Primordial Star.</p><p></p><p>A group of Ancestral Gods were shocked: "He actually managed to slay a Lord Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"It was all just an act!"</p><p></p><p>"Slaying a Lord Realm, wow!"</p><p></p><p>These Ancestral Gods could not imagine it.</p><p></p><p>Even a Lord Realm could be slain!</p><p></p><p>With such strength, Qi Yuan guarding the Void Sea, who would dare to invade the Shenmu Universe!</p><p></p><p>"We won, we won!" The burly bearded man was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder also showed a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, facing the invasion of the Black Sky and Black Earth, the Shenmu Universe could only retreat step by step.</p><p></p><p>"With the fall of the Lord of the Flame Realm, the Black Sky and Black Earth will certainly be wary, and in the remaining tens of thousands of years, we can focus on forging the Bright Wondrous Treasures!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, once our Bright Wondrous Treasures are numerous, when facing the invasion of the Black Sky and Black Earth, we will no longer be without the means to resist!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Gods present were all excited.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, they hadn't been as joyful and excited as they were today.</p><p></p><p>"He's dead... the Lord of the Flame Realm has been completely slain!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan... has killed a Lord Realm!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Ancestral Gods present were deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Because this time, after the Lord of the Flame Realm died, he never revived again.</p><p></p><p>They witnessed the fall of a Lord Realm.</p><p></p><p>That was a Lord Realm! Without the Renqi Guangming, there was no way to resist their terrifying and majestic existence.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan!"</p><p>"Lord Realm!"</p><p></p><p>All the Ancestral Gods cheered, already without the previous arrogance and superiority.</p><p></p><p>For them, Qi Yuan's slaying of the Lord of the Flame Realm meant that the other Lord Realms of the Black Sky and Black Earth would certainly be wary and would not dare to casually invade the Shenmu Universe, and the Shenmu Universe would also have a period of peace.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a flash of light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yuan, all the Ancestral Gods excitedly said, "Yuan, there's no need to summon the Radiant Dao Master, Lord Qi Yuan has already slain the Lord of the Flame Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Lord of the Flame Realm was slain by Lord Qi Yuan, it was a refreshing and unrestrained battle!"</p><p></p><p>"We... are about to usher in a peaceful and tranquil period of tens of thousands of years!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Gods present all shared their joy and excitement with Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, they could finally hold their heads high and take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also many who noticed that Yuan's expression was not very good.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... what happened?" Sheng Nü asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't seen such an expression on Yuan's face for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The last time, when the Black Sky and Black Earth invaded, Yuan went to the Void Sea alone, and his expression had never been this serious before.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... what happened?" The burly bearded man couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"The line... is gone." Yuan spoke with difficulty, his voice full of despair and endless decline.</p><p></p><p>"Line? What line? The line is gone?!" One of the Ancestral Gods heard this and his expression became dazed, with an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible... the line is gone, don't we still have tens of thousands of years left?" The burly bearded man murmured, with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The line being gone, all the Ancestral Gods present understood the meaning of this sentence.</p><p></p><p>When the line ends, it will be the awakening of the Black Sky and its formal invasion of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>At that time... in just one day, the Shenmu Universe will be completely destroyed!</p><p></p><p>The seven Renqi Guangming were not enough to illuminate all the worlds, not enough to resist the Black Sky, they needed more and more Renqi Guangming.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be, the line was fine, could it be that we saw it wrong?" The white-browed elder looked at Yuan, hoping for a different answer.</p><p></p><p>Now, the huge joy they had felt seemed to have been doused with a bucket of cold water, leaving them unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the Void Sea, quickly tell the Lord Realm, the line is gone!" At this time, one of the Ancestral Gods thought of something.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky's awakening and the devouring of the Void Sea would be the slowest, perhaps taking half a day.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, it would be the devouring of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was in the Void Sea, was now in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many Ancestral Gods sent messages to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, all the Ancestral Gods' expressions froze.</p><p></p><p>Countless people looked towards the Void Sea, their expressions becoming desperate.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky..."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky has truly awakened!"</p><p></p><p>"We're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"We weren't prepared at all, even if we want to escape, we can't!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Gods were in despair.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Void Sea, even the eyes of the Void Realm Sovereign were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens have awakened... How could the Black Heavens awaken prematurely?"</p><p></p><p>On the battleship, countless Yin Spirits and Solar Deities were filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Their despair was not much less than that of the Ancestral Deities of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The awakening of the Black Heavens meant... everything would be destroyed, including... the Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood in the Void Sea, holding the Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity in his hand, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Black Heavens awakened?"</p><p></p><p>He looked deep into the Void Sea and saw a massive black bubble rapidly expanding and devouring everything in its path.</p><p></p><p>Even the terrifying and stable Void Sea seemed as fragile as tofu before this black bubble.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless miles of space were consumed.</p><p></p><p>Countless colors, specks of light, and lines were devoured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, holding the Enlightening Lights of Humanity, stood atop the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>Messages from the Ancestral Deities came through the communication artifact:</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens have awakened, retreat!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe has only one day left.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat?" Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had never fought a battle unprepared, always relying on strength to overcome weakness.</p><p></p><p>But this time, as he gazed at the bubble, he felt his own insignificance for the first time.</p><p></p><p>His right eyebrow was twitching violently.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of this twitching was a million times more intense than when he encountered the Primordial Wasteland, indescribable.</p><p></p><p>But this was his right eyebrow, which meant the utmost danger.</p><p></p><p>Billions of deaths, no life.</p><p></p><p>The black bubble devoured relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"My eyes... cannot perceive any information about the Black Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes had always been able to see hidden information, which was a great asset to him.</p><p></p><p>Many times in critical situations, he had relied on his eyes to break through.</p><p></p><p>He even used his Violet Palace body to forge extraordinary treasures, defying the Great Principles.</p><p></p><p>But now, as he looked at the terrifying, gloomy, and chaotic black bubble, he saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>Even when he faced enemies far stronger than himself on the Viewing Moon Continent, he had never felt this way.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Black Heavens, exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place as the black bubble's devouring speed was extremely fast. Perhaps within an hour, it would reach his current location.</p><p></p><p>"Flee?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he still had no useful information about the Black Heavens, the final boss of this game.</p><p></p><p>And his right eyebrow was frantically warning him that advancing would lead to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>It was an unsolvable dead end!</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a game player, and I'm even afraid of a game virus... That would be too embarrassing, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"And this is a game I've invested in. If I retreat, won't the game be over?"</p><p></p><p>"Stealing my company, a despicable business war?"</p><p></p><p>"You're asking for it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became resolute.</p><p></p><p>"A dead end, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to see just how dead-end it can be!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity emanated boundless radiance.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth in the Void Sea were illuminated by the light, as if it were the only light in the dark and deep abyss.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go meet this so-called Black Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Without any further hesitation, holding the Enlightening Lights of Humanity, Qi Yuan decisively charged towards the massive bubble.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what this Black Heavens was all about.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Sovereign!" When they saw this, all the Ancestral Deities were horrified.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected Qi Yuan to attack the Black Heavens with the Enlightening Lights of Humanity.</p><p></p><p>In the consensus of everyone, the Black Heavens was undefeatable, impossible to match.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even the Void Realm Sovereign of the Zhou Universe, who had once said that if he were to incorporate the Divine Wood Universe into his cycle, he might ascend further, did not dare to come to the Divine Wood Universe because of the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the even more majestic and unfathomable Radiant Dao Master had never descended upon the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens... was truly undefeatable! And now, Qi Yuan, holding the Enlightening Lights of Humanity, was charging towards the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Can he stop it?" Someone hesitated, but despair was evident in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon's Demise, this is the Dragon's Demise!" The white-browed elder's divination pieces fell, forming the Dragon's Demise hexagram.</p><p></p><p>This was the most desperate divination he had ever encountered in all his years of divination.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit Dragon's Demise!" The burly, angry man kicked the divination pieces over.</p><p></p><p>"What we should be thinking about is... what we should do?"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is the Realm Sovereign, holding the Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity... Perhaps he can delay the Black Heavens for seven hours," said the Solar Deity of the Celestial Clan.</p><p></p><p>When the Black Heavens descended before, the Human King had held a half-piece of the Enlightening Treasure and delayed the Black Heavens for half an incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightening Lights of Humanity were Realm Sovereign-level treasures, but they were not ordinary Realm Sovereign-level treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Seven hours..." Yuanmian's expression was calm, his voice cold, "That means we have 19 hours left."</p><p></p><p>"19 hours... too short." The other Ancestral Deities spoke bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"We can't waste time anymore. We must preserve the seeds of civilization!" The burly, angry man said.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sheng Nü looked deeply into the Void Sea, her beautiful face filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Sea, seven beams of light were exceptionally massive, as if they could illuminate the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, countless worlds and countless beings seemed to see these seven beams of light appear, and above them was the deep, dark Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The original Black Earth battleship was shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the Black Earth clan members, including the Void Realm Sovereign, disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The awakening of the Black Heavens also meant the end of the Black Earth, or perhaps a transformation into a new form of existence.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already approached the terrifying black bubble.</p><p></p><p>His right eyebrow was twitching frantically, and Qi Yuan could feel an extremely dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Superstitious nonsense is not to be trusted!"</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>All his most powerful techniques, absolute adaptations, and more were unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity were also playing their due role.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan unleashed his strongest attack in this world.</p><p></p><p>The aura alone from this attack was enough to annihilate the stars.</p><p></p><p>However... the black bubble in front of him remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>And... Qi Yuan's vision had changed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Am I... inside the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned his surroundings, the sky.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth here were endless darkness, a blackness that defied description, and even Qi Yuan could not see any matter, distance, or flow of time.</p><p></p><p>Only within a meter of the Enlightening Lights of Humanity was there a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Just then, countless flickering specks of light suddenly appeared in the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be the eyes of countless terrifying beings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan realized that perhaps billions of horrifying entities were all gazing at him.</p><p></p><p>These were indeed the eyes of living beings! These beings were the former Black Earth clan, or perhaps even more terrifying existences.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Sovereign?" Qi Yuan looked at the nearest figure, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I am and am not the Void Realm Sovereign." The deep, shadowy figure spoke, extending a hand towards Qi Yuan, his expression cold and emotionless, "Welcome to join us!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 569</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Tree is a top-tier rare treasure at the Great Saint level. </p><p></p><p>As soon as it took root within his cosmic universe, it had an immediate and profound effect.</p><p></p><p>"My cosmic universe?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately showed a look of surprise and carefully sensed the subtle changes within his cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Tree's influence on the cosmic universe was multifaceted - the stability of space-time was enhanced, and the operation of the rules became more perfect, and so on.</p><p></p><p>These were all within Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after the Chaos Tree took root, it caused the cosmic universe to be permeated with strands of chaotic qi, just like the chaotic void that filled the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>These strands of chaotic qi caused Lin Yuan's cosmic universe to undergo an even deeper transformation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the edges of the cosmic universe began to expand rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after Lin Yuan had cultivated the "Infinite Void", his cosmic universe had reached a radius of 20 million light-years, which was close to its limit. To achieve further significant expansion, he would need to break through to the Sovereign Realm and enhance the essence of his life.</p><p></p><p>But now, the 20 million light-year cosmic universe suddenly soared.</p><p></p><p>2.1 million, 2.3 million, 2.5 million... In less than a moment, it reached 3 million light-years in radius.</p><p></p><p>3.1 million, 3.2 million... The expansion gradually slowed down as it approached 3.3 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Tree is truly remarkable," Lin Yuan exclaimed in amazement. The Chaos Tree's enhancement of the cosmic universe was simply incredible, nearly doubling its size.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew that to achieve this kind of growth through normal means would require an extremely long time, or a breakthrough to a higher realm to significantly enhance his life essence.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Tuolong must have put a lot of thought into cultivating his successor," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Tuolong was the true form of the Great Saint's soul fragment within Cangyu Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had recognized this ancient Great Saint when he observed the cultivation memory fragments.</p><p></p><p>Each Great Saint had a distinct path, and their fame often spread across the void domains, unless too much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>Tuolong was a Great Saint who excelled in the realm of physical bodies and was stronger than newly ascended Great Saints like Yingmo and Jiufen, though perhaps not as powerful as the supreme Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity..." Lin Yuan sighed. This Chaos Tree had ultimately fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>But it was not entirely a pity, as if Lin Yuan had not intervened, Cangyu Dragon would have eventually handed over everything to the Nine Profound Venerable, and not only would the Chaos Tree and the inheritance space be lost, but Cangyu Dragon himself would not have survived.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it were not for the Chaos Tree, Lin Yuan would not have risked incurring the enmity of a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's cosmic universe continued to expand and the fluctuations of the rules became more stable, a jade gourd in the depths of the cosmic universe began to tremble, and a red-robed young girl with two pigtails appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Why has this cosmic universe..." the red-robed girl observed the cosmic universe, being the guardian of the "Infinite Void" inheritance as the spirit of the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the Chaos Tree?" the girl immediately realized the source of the changes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan manifested a figure next to her.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you also know of the Chaos Tree?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know of the Chaos Tree," the red-robed girl said, glancing at Lin Yuan. "Such rare treasures often fall from the origin of the chaotic void, and they are particularly precious for cultivators of the 'Infinite Void' inheritance."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl explained that true Chaos Trees could only be born from the origin of the chaotic void, and the common belief that a World Tree could transform into a Chaos Tree was essentially impossible.</p><p></p><p>"But you obtaining the Chaos Tree is indeed a great opportunity," the red-robed girl praised.</p><p></p><p>She understood that the effects of the Chaos Tree would be truly remarkable in the hands of a cultivator like Lin Yuan, whose cosmic universe foundation was so profound.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled, acknowledging his good fortune. He then turned his attention to the inheritance space, which was the legacy left behind by the Great Saint Tuolong for the purpose of cultivating a successor.</p><p></p><p>While the Chaos Tree was the most precious treasure, the true importance lay in Tuolong's soul fragment. The guidance of a Great Saint could be invaluable for those seeking to break through bottlenecks and advance further.</p><p></p><p>However, for Lin Yuan, the guidance of a Great Saint would not be of much help, as his path was built upon the foundations of different dimensional rule Dao. The Great Saint's insights would be limited in this regard.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious inheritance space was now the size of a palm in front of Lin Yuan, who had completely mastered it.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look," Lin Yuan said, beginning to examine the inheritance, including the "Nine Calamity Tuolong Body" cultivation technique, which was a method of body cultivation similar to the "Mysterious Yellow Body" and "Unbreakable Demonic Jade Body".</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Sage Tuolong is a wondrous life form 'Tuolong' nurtured by the chaotic void. His physical body and vitality are extremely powerful, and this is even more so after he entered the realm of the Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>With such a formidable physical body and other means, the Great Sage Tuolong has made other Great Sages at the same level extremely troubled.</p><p></p><p>The essence of this "Nine Tribulation Tuolong Body" is to use a special body refining method to bring one's own physical body closer to the wondrous life form 'Tuolong'.</p><p></p><p>During this process, one must overcome nine tribulations. After the nine tribulations, the body refining method of this technique will be considered complete, and the cultivator will then transform into another wondrous life form 'Tuolong'.</p><p></p><p>So far, only one 'Tuolong' has been born in the vast chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Great Sage Tuolong has been very lonely since birth, without a clan to rely on. He has spent a lot of effort creating this inherited legacy, also because he is unwilling for the 'Tuolong' clan to be completely destroyed when he breaks through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as this body refining method is refined to perfection, it will become a new wondrous life form 'Tuolong'.</p><p></p><p>"There are indeed many commendable aspects to it," Lin Yuan said thoughtfully as he carefully reviewed and observed it.</p><p></p><p>In terms of realm, this body refining method is not as good as the "Xuanhuang Body" or the "Unbreakable Demonic Jade Body", as cultivating it to the ultimate perfection will only result in transforming into the physical body of the 'Tuolong'.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the "Xuanhuang Body" or the "Unbreakable Demonic Jade Body", cultivating them to perfection, the physical body alone would be enough to forcefully confront a Chaotic Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>But as a Great Sage-level body refining method, in the subtle aspects, it still greatly amazes Lin Yuan, and it can even be integrated into his own physical body, making it more perfect and flawless.</p><p></p><p>"Tuolong." Lin Yuan's mind conjured up the detailed physical body structure of the wondrous life form 'Tuolong', as the ultimate goal of the "Nine Tribulation Tuolong Body" is to transform into a Tuolong, so naturally it has detailed information about this wondrous life form.</p><p></p><p>"The chaotic void nurtures wondrous life forms, and the cosmic starry sky nurtures special life forms, both are innate nurturing, both are powerful bloodline talents."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful, as the so-called cosmic starry sky and chaotic void are remarkably similar in many aspects.</p><p></p><p>In the inheritance space, in addition to the "Nine Tribulation Tuolong Body", there are also many other inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan browsed and absorbed them one by one, integrating the parts that are helpful to his own path.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds. Lin Yuan's physical body at the microscopic level was slowly changing, even though a peerless Great Sage like the Mysterious Emperor would find it difficult to capture and study a Great Sage-level wondrous life form adept at physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>As fellow Great Sages, even though the Mysterious Emperor is a peerless Great Sage, stronger than a Chaotic Great Sage, capturing a Great Sage is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Even if he could do it, as long as the other party has other life-saving methods, they can erase their physical body and soul with a single thought and then revive through other means.</p><p></p><p>Any powerful being does not want their physical body to be researched by other existences.</p><p></p><p>While Lin Yuan was observing and absorbing the various inheritances left behind by the Great Sage Tuolong, he also began to take stock of the many treasures and resources in the inheritance space.</p><p></p><p>Humming sounds. With a thought, various palaces and pavilions in the inheritance space flew out, emanating various auras of precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>There was a purple crystal the size of ten meters, with visible purple liquid flowing inside.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Jade Nest?" Lin Yuan's heart was delighted. This Purple Jade Nest was a treasure at the Chaotic Realm level, and just this small piece was worth no less than a hundred thousand Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over the other precious treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>There were several yellow pearls that, when colliding with each other, emanated an aura that calmed the mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>There was also a nine-colored grass that had fully grown nine different leaves.</p><p></p><p>"These precious treasures and rarities, if calculated in Chaotic Stones, should be worth around thirty-eight million Chaotic Stones."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied. The inheritance space opened up by the Great Sage Tuolong was to cultivate successors, and in order to cultivate successors, simply pointing the way is not enough, they also need abundant resources.</p><p></p><p>Nearly forty million Chaotic Stones' worth of terrifying resources would be enough to ensure that normal Eleventh Realm beings would not lack any resources before breaking through to the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Directly devouring and absorbing these resources would be a waste, it's better to exchange them for Chaotic Stones and obtain other resources."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>For example, the precious nine-colored grass has the effect of stabilizing the physical body and the internal universe, which would greatly benefit those Supremes who have just broken through, and whose physical bodies and internal universes are rapidly transforming.</p><p></p><p>But directly devouring and absorbing them? The value would be greatly reduced, a terrible waste.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still has some distance before breaking through to the Supreme Realm, and with his solid foundation and endowment, he does not need the assistance of such external objects to stabilize his entry into the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, selling them and exchanging them for suitable treasures and resources would be the best choice.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver." Wanqu Overlord smiled as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Due to the instructions of his teacher, the Ancient Revered One, Wanqu Overlord was very attentive to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan wanted to see him, he would come over even if he was busy.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wanqu." Lin Yuan savored the fine wine in front of him. "This time I'm looking for you to sell some precious treasures and rarities."</p><p></p><p>"Sell precious treasures and rarities?" Wanqu Overlord's face broke into a smile. "Anything that Brother Silver brings out, I, Wanqu, will buy it all."</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan had also sold a few precious treasures and weapons here, and the two of them had a quite pleasant cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Wanqu Overlord's standard is that he would rather earn less, or even not earn at all, as long as he can satisfy Lin Yuan as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with the precious treasures and weapons Lin Yuan had previously sold, Wanqu Overlord had still made some profits.</p><p></p><p>"Take a look first." Lin Yuan waved his hand, bringing out some of the resources from the inheritance space.</p><p></p><p>The ten-meter-sized Purple Jade Nest, the nine-colored leaves, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Wanqu Overlord's expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>The various precious treasures and rarities that Lin Yuan brought out were all at the Chaotic Realm level, and their value in the Chaotic Realm was not low.</p><p></p><p>"So many precious treasures and rarities..." Wanqu's heart was a bit numb, could it be that Lin Yuan had plundered the lair of a Chaotic Realm Revered One?</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Is there a problem?" Lin Yuan looked at Wanqu Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"No, no problem at all." Wanqu Overlord immediately shook his head. "But these precious treasures and rarities are too valuable, I need to consult my teacher."</p><p></p><p>Involving treasures and rarities at the Chaotic Realm Revered One level was not something he could decide on his own, he had to get the approval of the Ancient Revered One.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go ahead." Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give Brother Silver an answer very soon."</p><p></p><p>Wanqu Overlord immediately split off a wisp of his spiritual sense, condensing it into a clone and personally heading to the seclusion place of the Ancient Revered One.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, Brother Silver wants to sell some precious treasures and rarities."</p><p></p><p>Wanqu Overlord found the Ancient Revered One and immediately told him about the matter.</p><p></p><p>"These?" The Ancient Revered One was also surprised. Some of the precious treasures and rarities that Lin Yuan had brought out were even difficult for Chaotic Realm Revered Ones to come across.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, should we collect them?" Wanqu Overlord immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Collect, of course we should collect." The Ancient Revered One glared. "There are so many rare treasures, even if we can't sell them, I'll still collect them."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Revered One's expression was solemn as he gave the price for each precious treasure and rarity. Compared to the market value, the Ancient Revered One basically offered the highest price.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that these precious treasures and rarities were indeed rare. </p><p></p><p>The other was that the Chaotic Dragon Beast's prediction about Lin Yuan was so terrifying that the Ancient Chaotic Revered One wanted to get on good terms with him as soon as possible, how could he dare to lowball the price?</p><p></p><p>After Wanqu Overlord left, the Ancient Revered One's expression quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Revered One."</p><p></p><p>A black-robed youth appeared beside him.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Silver' seems to be the reincarnation of a Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth spoke in a low voice, having heard the conversation between the Ancient Revered One and Wanqu Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." The Ancient Revered One nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the black-robed youth's prediction, the consequences of offending Lin Yuan were certain death. This meant that in the future, Lin Yuan would almost certainly be able to cross into the Great Sage Realm, otherwise how could there be talk of certain death?</p><p></p><p>But who among the Paragon Sovereigns or Chaotic Realm Revered Ones can be sure that they will definitely become Great Sages? Only the reincarnation of a Great Sage would have the confidence to say that he will definitely return to the Great Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Ancient Revered One and the black-robed youth had speculated that Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of a Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing Lin Yuan bring out so many Chaotic Realm level precious treasures and rarities, the Ancient Revered One and the black-robed youth's speculation that Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of a Great Sage had almost been confirmed.</p><p></p><p>These precious treasures and rarities were all at the Chaotic Realm level, and they belonged to the rare and difficult to obtain type.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation for Lin Yuan being able to bring them out was that he had regained some of the memories of his peak Great Sage realm, and retrieved the backup arrangements he had made at that time.</p><p></p><p>"A Great Sage..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Revered One and the black-robed youth looked at each other, their hearts filled with great astonishment.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

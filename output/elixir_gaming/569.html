        <h1>Chapter 569</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku felt like he was getting lost in the book, seeing hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>How could his own name appear in the book, and even the events of his own dreams were recorded in it?</p><p></p><p>It was a bit eerie and strange.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, feeling a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>He continued reading.</p><p></p><p>"Under the shroud of the black sky, none can withstand the fourth layer of the Yang Shen."</p><p></p><p>"Although Qi Yuan has entered the 'pseudo-fourth layer of the Yang Shen', he is ultimately not in the true fourth layer of the Yang Shen."</p><p></p><p>"In the previous one hundred million years, he lost his eyes and could no longer see anything in the world."</p><p></p><p>"In the middle billions of years, he lost his ears, eyebrows and nose, he could no longer hear the sound of the wind or smell the fragrance of the flowers and plants."</p><p></p><p>"In the last one hundred million years, he lost his mouth, the things he lost kept increasing."</p><p></p><p>"One day, he will lose everything, lose his physical body, lose his consciousness, lose his true spirit, and step into the fourth layer of the Yang Shen, becoming another Black Sky."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku looked at these words, his expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"So you have to go see the female lead!" he really wanted to tell the male protagonist.</p><p></p><p>But now the male protagonist has even lost his hearing, would shouting be of any use? At night, Wang Ku entered the dream world again, and he saw that battered figure once more.</p><p></p><p>That figure, thin and frail, features broken, stood tall in the sky, fighting the terrifying black bubbles alone.</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed to have lasted for countless billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, go see the female lead!" Wang Ku shouted with all his might.</p><p></p><p>However, the figure remained motionless, as if it had not heard his voice at all.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, he has no hearing, no vision... How do I tell him... to go see the female lead?" Wang Ku was a little nervous, worried about the male protagonist in the book.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the endless space-time, Qi Yuan's body was shattered, his features melting away, now his physical form was almost non-existent, only a thread of true spirit still preserved his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky... is unstoppable."</p><p></p><p>"The fourth layer of the Yang Shen, cannot be withstood."</p><p></p><p>"Have I finally been defeated?"</p><p></p><p>In all these games, this was the first time Qi Yuan felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, Doing as One Pleases, and Absolute Adaptation were already powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>But he still could not cross the chasm from the third layer to the fourth layer of the Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Now he could only be considered a 'pseudo-fourth layer', so he could barely resist the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>But under the Black Sky, his consciousness, his physique, were constantly dissolving.</p><p></p><p>"Step into the fourth layer of the Yang Shen?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the fourth layer of the Yang Shen, he would be able to truly resist the Black Sky, or even devour it.</p><p></p><p>But with his current strength, after the fourth layer of the Yang Shen, he would become a monster even more terrifying than the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>Now he understood, the so-called fourth layer of the Yang Shen meant abandoning everything, only to pursue strength, preserving the most fundamental qualities.</p><p></p><p>This abandonment includes the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>This also means that once he steps into the fourth layer of the Yang Shen, he will truly perish, and Qi Yuan will no longer exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>This ending, he was unwilling to accept.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no way to break through?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the hope...?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness was muddled.</p><p></p><p>Facing the terrifying Black Sky, he did not know how long he could still resist.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, his true spirit will eventually be extinguished, it's just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly paused, as if he saw countless spirit blood raining down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... my blood?"</p><p></p><p>He remembered that when the game was about to crash, he had used his blood to save it.</p><p></p><p>"What time am I in... my blood is falling... will I descend again?"</p><p></p><p>"No, in any timeline, there is only the true self."</p><p></p><p>In the endless years, Qi Yuan's consciousness was muddled, only a thread of true spirit kept him lucid.</p><p></p><p>What he saw, no longer had any light.</p><p></p><p>What he smelled, no longer had any fragrance.</p><p></p><p>What he heard, no longer had any thunder.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, the true spirit will eventually be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Either he will perish, or he will step into the fourth layer of the Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>He knew that he could skip the fourth layer and step into the fifth layer of the Yang Shen, so he was unwilling to enter the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I can use my blood to observe this world, so I can preserve a thread of true spirit's activity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very mystical.</p><p></p><p>The past affects the present.</p><p></p><p>The future affects the past.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't think too much, or his brain would explode, and it was very tiring.</p><p></p><p>In different space-times, he kept resisting the Black Sky, his features dissolving, fortunately his blood, the human forms it created, replaced him to constantly touch this world, feel the sound of the wind, and enjoy the rain.</p><p></p><p>"But... this is a cycle."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He knew, this kind of life would not last long.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when all his blood returns to his true self, it will no longer be able to replace him to perceive the world.</p><p></p><p>His true spirit... will truly perish.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so tired, I hope a rich woman can see my stubbornness and strength."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had sensed that the Shen Lin was besieged and betrayed, leading to his demise.</p><p></p><p>He also sensed that the transformed mortal Qi Yuan failed to break through to the Ancestral God, sitting alone in the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So... have I been defeated?"</p><p></p><p>The only thread of true spirit was constantly dissolving.</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as Qi Yuan, with the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra and Doing as One Pleases, could not stop the dissolution of the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan thought of many people.</p><p></p><p>He thought of Jin Li, thought of Jin Sinian, thought of Ning Tao, and also thought of the busty disciple sister Jiang Lingsu, and his wife in this world, Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I am also an ordinary mortal, in the final moments of life, I will also use the reminiscence technique."</p><p></p><p>The true spirit flickered like a candle, about to be extinguished at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"A new Shen Lin has been born."</p><p></p><p>"The transformed mortal Qi Yuan... has succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"Is everything over?"</p><p></p><p>"No, why haven't I dissipated yet?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had thought that when all his blood returned to his true self, unable to replace him to perceive the world, that would be the moment his true spirit was completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>But he was still alive.</p><p></p><p>"It's... the new Shen Lin, still replacing me... perceiving this world." Qi Yuan realized something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao is fifty, the Heaven is forty-nine, the imperfect all depart one."</p><p></p><p>"I will give it... a spring."</p><p></p><p>"Spring?"</p><p></p><p>"Catalpa!"</p><p></p><p>"So the missing word on the stone tablet in front of Luori Cliff was 'spring'!"</p><p></p><p>"She gave me the spring!"</p><p></p><p>"The correct one is..."</p><p></p><p>"In the past there was a catalpa, standing solemnly in the profound. Now I think of you, like a tree awaiting spring. Infinitely subtle, do not seek me."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient Qi catalpa tree!"</p><p></p><p>"So... it's the master!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>"She knew this ending, so she kept telling me to leave."</p><p></p><p>"When I obtained the Divine Wood Token, I once heard a 'flee' word."</p><p></p><p>"The stone tablet in front of Luori Cliff was also telling me... not to descend into this world."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Lunar Goddess Yuanjun a silent voice?"</p><p></p><p>"The Lunar Goddess Yuanjun exists in the past, or the future, but not in the present."</p><p></p><p>"So... the master is also in the fourth layer of the Yang Shen."</p><p></p><p>"No, she is the consciousness that interacts with me in the fourth layer of the Yang Shen, or the awakened consciousness."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had sorted out all his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The fourth layer of the Yang Shen has no consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Master Ruan Yixi was originally the catalpa of the fourth layer of the Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan's awakened superpower, related to the mouth, is the ability to speak freely and be heard by the unknown, while also causing strange occurrences.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Profound Transformation.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, the Soundless Voice... finally gave birth to its own consciousness, evolving from the Fourth Layer of the Solar Deity into the Cosmic Tree Universe.</p><p></p><p>But, she is the Fourth Layer of the Solar Deity, knowing the past, present, and future, so she has been preventing Qi Yuan from coming.</p><p></p><p>"So, she... is the female lead that person spoke of?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, can I see you?" Qi Yuan's smile was somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Solar Deity does not exist in the present world. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>This means that unless he also enters the Fourth Layer of the Solar Deity, he will not be able to see her.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Black Sky has already exhausted all of his true spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>To see the Master again... will he be able to see her?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan thought of something, and a happy smile appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Master has also been trying... to see him.</p><p></p><p>In the Abyss of the Cosmic Tree, the initial Illusory Dream was not an illusion, but the Master.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Light Sect... that graceful figure was also her.</p><p></p><p>And... many, many more.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have seen you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's smile was as brilliant as the stars.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the endless river of time.</p><p></p><p>The Vast Expanse Realm.</p><p></p><p>A young and handsome man was breathing the air of the other world, feeling it quite sweet.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blurry and charming figure in front of him, with a curious expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>【She is called Ruan Yixie, and she is your beautiful master on the surface, but she may actually be your wife.】</p><p></p><p>"Just crossed over and got a wife?" The handsome man was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"Master's wife?" He called out.</p><p></p><p>The woman was dressed in a long, deep-colored robe, with wide sleeves sweeping the ground, like a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could not see her face, only her back.</p><p></p><p>But just by her back, she was already a rare beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you speak, are you mute?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, maybe she's shy, Master, wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>"You didn't chase me away, which means you've accepted me as your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, Qi Yuan will be Ruan Yixie's disciple!"</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>The young and handsome young man stretched and casually threw the small wooden fish snack into the mouth of the wooden cat puppet.</p><p></p><p>He lay on the bed, sleeping comfortably.</p><p></p><p>After waking up, he washed up and walked out of the courtyard, looking at the palace in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Another day missing the Master."</p><p></p><p>The clouds on the peak dispersed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a strange light: "So, the Master I knew back then was also missing me?"</p><p></p><p>Another day, Qi Yuan held a first-grade foundation-building spiritual object, the Yellow Flower Fruit: "Master, your disciple Qi Yuan has brought the betrothal gifts."</p><p></p><p>The clouds in the sky gathered, quite magnificent.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Master is very happy?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In the Fourth Layer of the Solar Deity, there is no consciousness, and even if the Master has awakened or revived her consciousness because of him, she may have been in a daze all along, only occasionally having a moment of clarity.</p><p></p><p>Above the Arching Stars.</p><p></p><p>The robot Zero-One looked at Qi Yuan: "Master, the three of us haven't taken a group photo yet, do you want to take one together?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, take a group photo? No problem." The man in the blood-red robe said.</p><p></p><p>The sky was pitch black, the stars dim, he stood on the lawn, Zero-One hugging Xie Xinsu, the three of them showing the signature group photo smile.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a warm and cool moonlight shone down, falling on Qi Yuan's blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>The photo was captured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the photo, pensive: "The moon falling on my shoulder, this can also be considered our group photo."</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes appeared, only to shatter in this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride." Qi Yuan softly called.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a small, exquisite bridal dress appeared.</p><p></p><p>She stood next to Qi Yuan, timid, and though she had no beautiful face, graceful figure, or jade-like feet, she seemed to be the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p></p><p>He held the Little Bride's cold little hand, a smile on his face: "So you've been here all along."</p><p></p><p>"Before, it was you who transformed into the blood armor to protect me, to shelter me, and now... it's my turn to protect..."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Little Bride, and though she had no eyes, there was endless tenderness and deep affection in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"This time... it's my turn to bury myself in the ground."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie."</p><p></p><p>"Who I am, I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>"I only know that I can't see the light, hear the thunder, or smell the flowers. The world is void, barren, and unchanging."</p><p></p><p>"One day, there was a very noisy person who kept talking."</p><p></p><p>"He was so noisy, I really wanted him to shut up."</p><p></p><p>"Well... actually, talking more isn't so bad."</p><p></p><p>"I like to hear those stories."</p><p></p><p>"Awakening the Seven Orifices?"</p><p></p><p>"If I opened the Seven Orifices, maybe I could..."</p><p></p><p>"I failed, and the sky bled."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie, I don't know who I am."</p><p></p><p>"I've lived in the Abyss of the Cosmic Tree since I was young, all alone."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I just snuck out for a trip, sneakily slept in the dirt, why was I dug out by a blood robe?"</p><p></p><p>"The key is, he even tied me up in five ways and carried me off in a sedan chair to forcibly marry me!"</p><p></p><p>"I have a husband now, so I have a family too? Okay, it's just that this husband... is a piece of clothing."</p><p></p><p>"He can't speak, so I made eight wooden tablets for him."</p><p></p><p>"One represents cuddling, one represents happiness."</p><p></p><p>"Having a husband by my side is so good."</p><p></p><p>"Husband... is gone."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie, I remember who I am."</p><p></p><p>"I'm a blind, deaf, mute..."</p><p></p><p>"My eyes were given to me by my husband."</p><p></p><p>"My ears were given to me by my husband."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want... him to give me these things!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie, a failure who has failed countless times."</p><p></p><p>"I have finally become a true person."</p><p></p><p>"My husband, however, has become the true Blood Robe."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll listen to my husband's words."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Abyss of the Cosmic Tree.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe was being consecrated by countless people.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's eyes held a painful and reluctant expression.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is the Water, the eighth primitive rule of the Cosmic Tree Universe."</p><p></p><p>"He is the eighth Human Enlightenment Artifact!"</p><p></p><p>"Only by creating the eight Human Enlightenment Artifacts can the primitive consciousness of the Cosmic Tree Universe be revived for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"She will carry the eight Human Enlightenment Artifacts, wearing the eighth and most powerful one... to slay the Black Sky!" Sheng Nü said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"What will happen to him?"</p><p></p><p>"He's already dead!"</p><p></p><p>Three years later.</p><p></p><p>In the Cosmic Tree Universe.</p><p></p><p>A majestic presence suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>A pure, divine, and beautiful goddess appeared, wearing a blood-red battle armor, her entire body radiating scorching bright light.</p><p></p><p>The moment the scorching light appeared, the black bubbles instantly melted.</p><p></p><p>The goddess's figure and the black bubbles disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky... dissolved.</p><p></p><p>The universe cheered.</p><p></p><p>The "Book of the Cosmic Tree" records that the Goddess revived, carrying the eight Human Enlightenment Artifacts, dispelling the Black Sky, and the world saw the light again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Abyss of the Cosmic Tree.</p><p></p><p>A shadowy figure lingered.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie."</p><p></p><p>"This is my past."</p><p></p><p>The distant sound of a lullaby echoed in the vast Abyss of the Cosmic Tree.</p><p></p><p>"The mountain has the Toon tree, the clouds have the drizzling rain.</p><p>The drizzling rain is lonely, not sharing with me.</p><p>Since I've known the gentleman, my heart is not confused.</p><p></p><p>The mountain has the Toon tree, the wild has the yellow Qin.</p><p>The yellow Qin is lonely, not sharing with me. </p><p>Since I've known the gentleman, my heart is not anxious.</p><p></p><p>The mountain has the Toon tree, the sky has the thunder and snakes.</p><p>The thunder and snakes have no sound, not speaking with me.</p><p>Since I've spoken with the gentleman, my heart is not displeased.</p><p></p><p>The mountain has the Toon tree, the marshes have the luxuriant Qin.</p><p>The luxuriant Qin is lush, not sharing with me.</p><p>If I see the gentleman, my heart will be joyful."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

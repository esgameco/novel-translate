        <h1>Chapter 247</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The others heard this and also agreed with Shen Zhifeng's words.</p><p></p><p>This way, they wouldn't lose face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a lazy voice was heard.</p><p></p><p>"His strength is barely passable, but if you're talking about participating in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings, he still won't be able to get first place."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was dressed in a bright red blood robe, with an exceptionally handsome face and an aura like that of a banished immortal. </p><p></p><p>All the cultivators who saw Qi Yuan couldn't help but show a hint of awe or other emotions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even Jiang Lingsu glanced at Qi Yuan a few extra times, because today Qi Yuan seemed to have dressed up specially, looking particularly pleasing to the eye. With his temperament and appearance, even she felt her heart flutter and her face grow warm.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was that he was holding a rope in his hand, with a pet cleaver tied to the end.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"It's been a few days, but Senior Brother Qi Yuan's charm remains the same." Zhuge Miao from Divine Medicine Peak had a complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>The last time he saw Qi Yuan, he had asked Qi Yuan for advice on improving pill formulas. At that time, he had called Qi Yuan "junior brother". Afterwards, he went to explore a secret realm and gained quite a lot, directly entering the middle stage of Foundation Establishment. He returned feeling proud.</p><p></p><p>But then... Qi Yuan had reached Divine Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>When he heard this news, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Divine Infant cultivators present also turned to look at Qi Yuan, with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Lord Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect our Great Shang would gather such talented individuals today."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it won't be long before Qi Yuan becomes the second Shen Wushen."</p><p></p><p>"The young lord is truly talented, he will surely achieve great things in the future."</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infant cultivators couldn't help but flatter him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but say: "No need to wait for the future, I've already achieved great things now."</p><p></p><p>Saying he would achieve great things in the future, wasn't that an insult? The monk Wu Dian who said this was stunned and laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Zhifeng looked at Qi Yuan and questioned: "Why does the lord say Young Master Shen cannot get first place in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings?"</p><p></p><p>In Shen Zhifeng's eyes, Shen Wushen who came from the upper realm was an immortal young master.</p><p></p><p>How could Divine Infant cultivators from the lower realm compare to her young master? Even Yin Shen Lords had to show some respect to her young master.</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Qi Yuan, curious as to why he would say this. Wasn't this offending Shen Wushen? Shen Wushen's identity was definitely not simple, and there might even be Yin Shen backing him.</p><p></p><p>His status was no lower than Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>"Because... I also participated in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings." Qi Yuan smiled proudly, clearing his throat, as if he had applied Sidankang hair oil and was preparing to make a speech, "I, unworthy as I am, pulled some strings and got first place in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings."</p><p></p><p>When this was said, everyone present was stunned, and then shocked or... surprised.</p><p></p><p>First place in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings?</p><p></p><p>Pulled some strings? The Blood Robe Alliance leader Blood Robe Sword Saint must definitely be Qi Yuan's real father.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he pull strings to become first in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings.</p><p></p><p>A trace of disdain flashed in the depths of Shen Zhifeng's eyes: "If that's the case, Young Master Shen indeed cannot get first place in the Eastern Land Prodigy Rankings.</p><p></p><p>But... can he get first place among Divine Infants in Great Shang?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>She was like a fanatical fan of Shen Wushen, hoping her gege would be number one in the world.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, but the position of first Divine Infant in Great Shang is also taken, by me!" Qi Yuan said humbly.</p><p></p><p>Be low-key when it's time to be low-key, be high-profile when it's time to be high-profile.</p><p></p><p>His Divine Infant was indeed ordinary, currently unable to even kill a Yang Shen when summoned.</p><p></p><p>But his Divine Infant had strong growth potential, especially with the Observing Spirit Method and the high tower of the ancestral land. Once the Divine Infant in his body fully awakened, he could step onto the path of Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Now it was ordinary, but the future was bright, and it was enough to be worthy of the title of first Divine Infant in Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>This title, Qi Yuan naturally didn't want others to snatch away.</p><p></p><p>When this was said, all the Divine Infant cultivators present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu hurriedly transmitted: "Sen...ior Brother, this Shen Wushen is a tough one, he just defeated thirty-three Divine Infants here single-handedly!"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Qi Yuan didn't know what was happening here again because he was playing games.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's somewhat impressive, but not much." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan transmitted back.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Observing Spirit Method, which of his subjects wasn't a true peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>Just Zhu Zhuangshi alone could challenge beyond the realm of Yin Shen.</p><p></p><p>When this Shen Wushen cultivated to the Yin Shen realm, he definitely wouldn't be a match for Zhu Zhuangshi.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't even match a Divine Infant like him, how could he be called the first Divine Infant of Great Shang?</p><p></p><p>Following Qi Yuan's speech, Shen Wushen's gaze fell on Qi Yuan, his eyes brimming with intense fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>He was originally a battle maniac.</p><p></p><p>"You're very strong?" Shen Wushen looked at Qi Yuan excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Just average, third in the world." Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>This was still him being modest.</p><p></p><p>"If you can wound me, this bottle of pills is yours!" Shen Wushen took out the Seven Essence Yang Spirit Pills again.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators present started breathing rapidly, their eyes filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to obtain this bottle of pills, but they had been miserably defeated by Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the pills and yawned: "I'm not interested in these pills, nor am I interested in defeating you."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered a Divine Infant cultivator who wasn't interested in the Seven Essence Yang Spirit Pills.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng couldn't help but sneer: "Perhaps you just don't dare?"</p><p></p><p>The other Divine Infant cultivators had expressions of watching a show.</p><p></p><p>They also felt that Qi Yuan probably wasn't a match for Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strength Shen Wushen had just displayed was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had just entered Divine Infant stage, his speed was fast, but how could his strength compare to Shen Wushen's.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Wushen's identity and status might not be lower than Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>"If you're not my white moonlight, I can't be bothered to make a move." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He usually had three reasons for taking action. The first was to kill white moonlights, which was for gaining benefits; the second depended on his mood, he didn't know when he would act; the third was simple and crude, just purely wanting to show off.</p><p></p><p>"White moonlight, what's that? What are the requirements to be your white moonlight?" Shen Wushen asked.</p><p></p><p>He came to the Cang Lan Realm to seek opponents.</p><p></p><p>And he was not one to force others, but sought fair battles to hone his unique dao and condense his innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>During his last descent to the lower realm, in order to battle a female Divine Infant cultivator, he agreed to that Divine Infant's request.</p><p></p><p>He accompanied that female Divine Infant in seclusion in the mountains for fifty years, playing the zither and dancing with swords with her every day, living a life like immortal lovers.</p><p></p><p>After fifty years, he could finally battle that female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>As a result, that female cultivator couldn't even withstand three of his moves.</p><p></p><p>This left him quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he shook his head at the beautiful female cultivator and said: "Too weak."</p><p></p><p>Then he floated away.</p><p></p><p>That female cultivator kept chasing after him, crying as she chased, even begging to battle him.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen naturally couldn't be bothered to fight a weakling, so he called out: "When you become a hundred times stronger, I'll fight you again."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Qi Yuan, an opponent whose strength and cultivation realm he couldn't discern, he was also willing to sacrifice and go into seclusion with him for fifty years.</p><p></p><p>"You're not an old man, so you don't count as my white moonlight." Qi Yuan shook his head, "However... if you can produce a heaven-grade technique, I might play with you for a bit."</p><p></p><p>Heaven-grade techniques were very rare, usually a Yin Shen only had one heaven-grade technique, and mostly low-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>Even after emptying the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, Qi Yuan hadn't found a high-grade heaven-grade technique.</p><p></p><p>"A heaven-grade technique, that's simple." Shen Wushen casually reached out and a jade slip containing a technique appeared</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is something I obtained by chance," he said.</p><p></p><p>He took out the celestial-level technique as casually as if he were taking out a white radish.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look," Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>After all, due to the different rules of this world, the current Qi Yuan could not use techniques from other worlds to perfect the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>This Shen Wushen clearly wasn't from the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen casually tossed the celestial-level technique into Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>The divine infants present saw this and their breathing quickened. </p><p></p><p>The techniques they cultivated were mostly jade-level, with the occasional low-grade mystic level technique being enough to cause a bloodbath in Da Shang. Yet here they encountered a celestial-level technique.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the person possessing the celestial-level technique was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even if greed arose in their hearts, they didn't dare to have any ideas.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This technique of yours is actually not bad?" Qi Yuan said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The celestial-level technique Shen Wushen gave clearly wasn't from the Cang Lan realm, but it could be used to modify the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>How could he not be surprised?</p><p></p><p>Although this technique seemingly couldn't be cultivated by cultivators of the Cang Lan realm either.</p><p></p><p>But as long as he could use it for reference it was fine, since he didn't cultivate anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have many techniques like this?" Qi Yuan discovered, many ideas arising in his mind.</p><p></p><p>If there were many such techniques in Shen Wushen's world, why not occupy that world and "seize" all the techniques?</p><p></p><p>"Many," Shen Wushen looked at Qi Yuan, battle intent surging in his eyes. "Do you want them?"</p><p></p><p>"I do," Qi Yuan felt Shen Wushen's gaze was odd, but still nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Injure me, and I'll give you five!" Shen Wushen said generously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was tempted.</p><p></p><p>Five celestial-level techniques, this guy was too rich.</p><p></p><p>No wonder his left eye had been twitching non-stop since he woke up this morning.</p><p></p><p>He was about to get rich.</p><p></p><p>"What if I defeat you?" Qi Yuan's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>"If you defeat me, all the techniques I have, even my main cultivation technique, a divine technique... I can give them all to you!" Shen Wushen's battle intent was overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>"Divine technique?" Qi Yuan was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he had never seen a divine technique before.</p><p></p><p>Not even a top-grade celestial technique.</p><p></p><p>"I won't take advantage of you either. If you can defeat me, I'll modify and upgrade your divine technique for free!" Qi Yuan said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>He had never liked taking advantage of others.</p><p></p><p>If he won he would get a bunch of rewards, so Shen Wushen should also get a bunch of rewards if he won.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Jiang Lingsu heard this and was speechless. She muttered to herself: "Senior Brother, how is this modifying for free? You clearly have designs on Shen Wushen's divine technique!"</p><p></p><p>But she still quickly said: "Senior Brother... good luck, and be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The phrase "good luck" was something she had learned from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Junior Sister," Qi Yuan said politely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Zhifeng's eyes were full of smug satisfaction: "Soon you'll know what true power is!"</p><p></p><p>The other divine infant cultivators were mostly like Shen Zhifeng at this point, all feeling that Shen Wushen's victory was a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Lingsu couldn't hold back anymore. She said to Jiang Ran: "Let's cheer for Senior Brother together!"</p><p></p><p>After all, no one was cheering for Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Today was Senior Brother's divine infant gathering, they couldn't let Senior Brother feel it was deserted.</p><p></p><p>So Jiang Ran and Jiang Lingsu seemed to transform into cheerleaders, cheering Qi Yuan on.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Shen Wushen, his expression calm: "I'll let you attack first. Otherwise, if I attack first, you won't have a chance to make a move."</p><p></p><p>The other party was a rich tycoon after all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't mistreat a rich tycoon, his benefactor.</p><p></p><p>He still had to leave him some face.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" Shen Zhifeng couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The other divine infant cultivators also had this feeling, but wary of Qi Yuan's status, no one dared to comment.</p><p></p><p>If they were far away when immortals fought, they might dare to gossip a bit.</p><p></p><p>But right next to them, they naturally kept their mouths shut.</p><p></p><p>"Come then, let me see how much effort you can force me to exert!"</p><p></p><p>As Shen Wushen finished speaking, a vast aura spread out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the power he was exerting was even stronger than when he had faced over thirty divine infants earlier.</p><p></p><p>As the powerful attack fell, Qi Yuan stood motionless in place, as if he hadn't reacted at all.</p><p></p><p>It's over.</p><p></p><p>This thought arose in the minds of the other divine infants, because Qi Yuan not only didn't respond, he didn't even react.</p><p></p><p>Withered Wood True Lord was extremely anxious and quickly flew up, wanting to intervene.</p><p></p><p>But how could he stop it? There wasn't enough time.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen's attack landed squarely on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Something unexpected happened to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't injured at all, he was perfectly fine.</p><p></p><p>This attack hadn't harmed a single hair on his head.</p><p></p><p>A lazy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, it's been a long time since I personally fought such a weak divine infant."</p><p></p><p>All the divine infants were shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Wushen's strength was obvious to all.</p><p></p><p>Such an attack was enough to kill any divine infant present.</p><p></p><p>Yet it couldn't even break through Qi Yuan's defenses.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is actually this strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't he just enter the divine infant stage?"</p><p></p><p>"He has some ability, but compared to the Divine Prince, it's not much!"</p><p></p><p>"You're very strong!" At this moment, Shen Wushen showed no signs of retreating. Instead he became even more excited, as if he had encountered a destined rival. "After defeating you, my divine infant path will reach its end, and I can then condense my Purple Palace! I didn't expect to gain so much this time!"</p><p></p><p>"I advise you to reach Purple Palace sooner. As for defeating me... you're still far from it," Qi Yuan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Shen Wushen and suddenly opened his mouth, gently blowing out.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a look of bewilderment appeared on Shen Wushen's face.</p><p></p><p>A powerful wind swept over.</p><p></p><p>This wind seemed to be casually blown by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Yet he felt that this wind was even stronger than an Origin Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>"God-Slaying Annihilation Technique!" Shen Wushen shouted loudly, unleashing his strongest attack.</p><p></p><p>This attack could even kill those at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>But faced with the wind casually blown by Qi Yuan, his divine ability was like an ant roaring at a tornado.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>That breath of wind, like the strongest divine ability, firmly fixed him in place.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked all the divine infants present.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of technique..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a divine ability, how can it be like this?"</p><p></p><p>"But... the technique Qi Yuan used is clearly... still at the divine infant level!"</p><p></p><p>"The heavens of Da Shang are really going to change this time!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng's face was full of shock, his expression one of disbelief: "How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned at first, then delighted, though with a hint of faint disappointment. She waved her hands: "Senior Brother is mighty!"</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the divine infant cultivators present towards Qi Yuan had already changed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Wushen lowered his head, his expression bewildered, muttering: "I lost... I lost..."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand why he had lost.</p><p></p><p>Why he couldn't even resist the wind Qi Yuan had gently blown.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he raised his head and stared at Qi Yuan: "We're both divine infants, why... are you so strong?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Because your divine infants... are too few in number."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

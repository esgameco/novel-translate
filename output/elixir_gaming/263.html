        <h1>Chapter 263</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dark Sun? What's going on?" Great Venerable Wu Jun immediately questioned.</p><p></p><p>He had notified the headquarters of the Seeking Dao Palace about the establishment of the Original God Sharing Association several days ago.</p><p></p><p>As a result, today, the envoy from the Seeking Dao Palace headquarters told him that Dark Sun was attacking.</p><p></p><p>The headquarters envoy was also a Great Venerable, like Wu Jun, both being palace masters of a domain. Because he was close to Phoenix Sky Domain, he came to attend this celebration.</p><p></p><p>"This news was informed to me by headquarters," this Great Venerable spoke, with a regretful expression. "The Four Generals of the Lei Family are coming."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Gods present looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Those ordinary Yin God Venerables had never heard of Dark Sun and had no idea what it was.</p><p></p><p>However, they understood that Dark Sun was sending powerful figures to cause trouble for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The situation became complicated.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Sun is sending people to cause trouble for me?" Qi Yuan was slightly surprised. "What's the background of Dark Sun? How powerful are their techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Last time he had received a letter saying Dark Sun was coming.</p><p></p><p>The person who warned him had even acted lawlessly right in front of him. Qi Yuan still remembered this.</p><p></p><p>Today, he finally heard about Dark Sun again.</p><p></p><p>The headquarters envoy's gaze changed several times before he slowly said: "Dark Sun... is an unspeakable force in the Azure Waves Realm."</p><p></p><p>Seven Injuries Elder spoke at this time, his voice complex: "The Blazing Flame Great Venerable of the Demon Domain died at the hands of the Four Generals of the Lei Family."</p><p></p><p>"What? Blazing Flame Great Venerable actually died at the hands of the Four Generals of the Lei Family!"</p><p></p><p>"Are the Four Generals of the Lei Family some kind of mythical beings?"</p><p></p><p>The Yin Gods present all showed shocked and fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>After the fall of the Great Phoenix Myth, Blazing Flame Great Venerable was the leader of the Three Domains.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Flame Great Venerable had ruled over the Three Domains for hundreds of thousands of years, and all Great Venerables dared not disobey.</p><p></p><p>Even Jasmine Great Venerable bowed her head to Blazing Flame Great Venerable, intending to offer up the secrets of the Myth.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Flame Great Venerable was a powerhouse at the peak of the Six Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>But... one day, blood splattered across the sky, and Blazing Flame Great Venerable suddenly fell in the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Three Domains were shaken.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin God Venerables trembled in fear, feeling precarious, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>The fall of Blazing Flame Great Venerable also became an unsolved mystery in the Three Domains.</p><p></p><p>As a result, after a hundred thousand years, they suddenly heard news about Blazing Flame Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Flame Great Venerable was killed by the Four Generals of the Lei Family?</p><p></p><p>This Dark Sun... was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Now, Dark Sun had sent the Four Generals of the Lei Family to deal with the Blood Robe Sword God! This was unimaginable! Even Blazing Flame Great Venerable fell at the hands of the Four Generals of the Lei Family, how could the Blood Robe Sword God deal with them?</p><p></p><p>"Is there some misunderstanding here? How did Elder Blood Robe Sword God offend Dark Sun?" Great Venerable Wu Jun asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>There may have been hidden reasons for Dark Sun to hunt down Blazing Flame Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, the Blood Robe Sword God didn't know about Dark Sun, so how could he have provoked Dark Sun's targeting?</p><p></p><p>"Even if Dark Sun is powerful, they can't kill gods without reason!" a Yin God Venerable spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Waves Realm has its own rules. In the cultivation world, everything must be reasonable!" Another Yin God Venerable also subtly spoke up for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation world had its own rules, and he was also speaking for himself.</p><p></p><p>If a major force could unreasonably kill a Great Venerable without reason,</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean they could casually kill them too?</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't stop it, they had to speak up to maintain order.</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Gods also nodded, apparently agreeing with this Venerable's statement.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, even major forces had to maintain face. Even when killing, they needed to find a legitimate reason. How could they kill without cause?</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Great Venerable narrowed her eyes, her expression calm, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Seven Injuries Elder suddenly spoke: "According to my investigation, Dark Sun... may be related to the Great Calamity."</p><p></p><p>His hoarse voice entered everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>The Yin God Venerables present were all startled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Those who were originally prepared to speak up for the Blood Robe Sword God now couldn't say a word.</p><p></p><p>"Great Calamity..."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually related to the Great Calamity..."</p><p></p><p>The Yin God Venerables present looked as if they had lost their parents, their faces filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, the greatest taboo, which all Yin God Venerables could not resist, was the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Dark Sun was related to the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Everything was easy to guess now.</p><p></p><p>Dark Sun... was the claw of the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>If they were facing a righteous major sect, these Yin God Venerables would still dare to speak up for the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>But... facing the claw of the Great Calamity!</p><p></p><p>How could they speak up!</p><p></p><p>Or rather... they didn't dare to speak up.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin God Venerables remained silent, some with anxious expressions on their faces, wishing they could cut ties with the Blood Robe Sword God and leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was deep: "Dark Sun is the claw of the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>Seven Injuries Elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>"So, when I exposed the truth about the poisonous techniques on the Divine Flower Association forum, Dark Sun discovered it, had the Divine Flower Association's president ban me, and then... sent people to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan connected all the dots.</p><p></p><p>His eyes lit up as he looked at the Yin God Venerables present.</p><p></p><p>"Do you believe now that the techniques you're cultivating are poisonous?"</p><p></p><p>These Yin God Venerables had all lived for over ten thousand years, and they roughly understood that what the Blood Robe Sword God said about the techniques being poisonous was probably true.</p><p></p><p>Such shocking statements, if spoken out, no one would believe.</p><p></p><p>But Dark Sun, which was entangled with the Great Calamity, had sent people to kill the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God had even been banned from the Divine Flower Association forum.</p><p></p><p>This proved that everything was true.</p><p></p><p>"It seems our techniques really do have problems." Some Yin Gods were in a daze, examining their own techniques.</p><p></p><p>"To think that our techniques actually have problems. The techniques we've cultivated for tens of thousands of years... were all wrong?"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods now fully believed Qi Yuan, feeling incredibly absurd.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan continued: "I established the Original God Sharing Association to deal with the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Among the techniques I uploaded, some are non-poisonous and can be cultivated safely.</p><p></p><p>I'm very happy that you all came to support the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Now, the dogs of the Great Calamity, the claws of Dark Sun, the Four Generals of the Lei Family, are coming.</p><p></p><p>We need to unite and work together to kill these claws of the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke passionately.</p><p></p><p>Justice was on his side, and he had won people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Gods present looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought that the Blood Robe Sword God was organizing this force merely to collect techniques.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't dealing with the Great Calamity just a slogan? When many countries, forces, and sects were established, didn't they often shout slogans about fairness and justice, or eliminating evil?</p><p></p><p>They also thought that the Original God Sharing Association's dealing with the Great Calamity was just a slogan.</p><p></p><p>The poisonous techniques were just a gimmick.</p><p></p><p>But now, you're serious? You're really going to deal with the Great Calamity? The Great Calamity has even sent people to kill you?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing Qi Yuan's invitation, these Yin Gods all retreated.</p><p></p><p>The first to speak was actually Jasmine Great Venerable: "Blood Robe Sword God, there are still matters in the Phoenix Palace. This servant must take her leave."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Yin Gods also began to make excuses to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, my granddaughter gave birth to a child today. I need to go back and see."</p><p></p><p>"Elder..."</p><p></p><p>Almost all the Yin Gods present stood up to say goodbye.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Great Venerable Wu Jun was very angry and said thoughtfully: "The Great Calamity is the enemy of our generation. Our life and death are all controlled by the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>At this time, shouldn't we be even more united in our hatred and cut off the claws of the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>A Yin God Venerable came forward, his face showing a difficult expression: "Elder, it's not that we don't dare, it's just that... the Four Generals of the Lei Family could even kill Blazing Flame Great Venerable. If we go,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It would just be going to our deaths."</p><p></p><p>"With the great calamity approaching, we haven't arranged our affairs yet. We can't face the calamity directly right now."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, our strength is too weak..."</p><p></p><p>These words seemed to be etched on the faces of the Yin spirits, as if they were in a hurry and wanted to flee.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to resist in the face of the calamity's minions. </p><p></p><p>Even the great Blazing Flame had perished, how could they possibly fight back?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Great Master Jasmine smoothed her hair and said: "Blood Robe Sword Saint, why must you make things difficult for these Yin spirit elders? They have their own difficulties too."</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan could speak, Great Master Wu Jun couldn't help but interject:</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity isn't just Blood Robe Sword Saint's concern. It affects all of our lives and fortunes."</p><p></p><p>The other Yin spirit elders lowered their heads, not daring to meet Wu Jun's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, a brilliant smile on his face: "Wu Jun, they are guests. Whether they stay or go is up to them."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan considered himself lawful good.</p><p></p><p>Lawful meant following the rules.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always followed his own rules.</p><p></p><p>As for good, that goes without saying. If he were on a bus, he would give up his seat for the elderly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Yin spirits all breathed sighs of relief. </p><p></p><p>However, they still didn't dare to move.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knew if Blood Robe Sword Saint and Great Master Wu Jun were playing good cop, bad cop?</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword Saint was infamous for his killing. He killed Yin spirits, killed Purple Mansion cultivators, and even traveled thousands of miles with his Purple Mansion squad to personally execute mere Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He even left behind many famous sayings.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was a certain person, most famous for being a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Why was he so famous? Because a Yin spirit traveled a thousand miles to personally execute him.</p><p></p><p>He was the first and only person in ten thousand years to be killed by a Yin spirit in this city.</p><p></p><p>These Yin spirit elders didn't believe Qi Yuan could be so kind-hearted.</p><p></p><p>There must be some scheme!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one Yin spirit elder tremblingly said: "Many thanks for Your Excellency's magnanimity. This old one cannot help Your Excellency face the great calamity, but is willing to offer my cultivation techniques to the Original God Sharing Association to assist Your Excellency!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Yin spirit elder unceremoniously uploaded his techniques into a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Then, he placed the jade slip on the table.</p><p></p><p>"This old one's eyes are failing, so I won't cultivate the techniques in the Sharing Association."</p><p></p><p>His meaning was to return the jade slip to the Original God Sharing Association and righteously cut ties with them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Jun was furious inside. If it were any other time, he would have already lost control and attacked.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he cursed the ancestors of these cowards eighteen generations back.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Very good, very good."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Yin spirit elders immediately followed suit.</p><p></p><p>"I am also willing to offer my techniques to assist Your Excellency!"</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>"This old one as well!"</p><p></p><p>They all hurriedly uploaded their techniques to the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Compared to life and death, what were cultivation techniques worth? In just a short while, Qi Yuan discovered over twenty new techniques in his jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He looked at one of the Yin spirit elders with an approving expression: "You did very well, uploading three heavenly-grade techniques."</p><p></p><p>The praised Yin spirit elder smiled humbly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other Yin spirit elders' hearts rippled.</p><p></p><p>Was Blood Robe Sword Saint hinting that they had only uploaded one heavenly-grade technique? Otherwise, why specifically praise that one?</p><p></p><p>These words must have deeper meaning.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, the Yin spirit elders all said: "I have more techniques I'm willing to donate to the Sharing Association."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, these Yin spirit elders frantically offered up all their techniques.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid that if they offered too few, Blood Robe Sword Saint would make an example of them and kill them with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Blood Robe Sword Saint may have had some reservations.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Dark Sun's people coming, Blood Robe Sword Saint's only chance at survival was to flee.</p><p></p><p>Before fleeing, wasn't it reasonable to harvest their techniques?</p><p></p><p>Even though it pained them, they still offered up all their techniques.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, another large wave of techniques appeared in Qi Yuan's jade slip.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan beam with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of charisma?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt his personal charisma increasing.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he captivated Great Master Jasmine, he had even charmed these Yin spirit elders into offering their techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Yin spirit elders kept uploading techniques one after another.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan looked at Great Master Jasmine expectantly: "These people I've only just met are all supporting my entrepreneurship. You love me so much, don't you want to donate the Mythic Secret Treasury to support my business?"</p><p></p><p>Great Master Jasmine narrowed her eyes: "This servant cannot make decisions about the Mythic Secret Treasury. This time, this servant will donate three heavenly-grade techniques."</p><p></p><p>Great Master Jasmine also felt it unwise to offend Blood Robe Sword Saint right now.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword Saint was already at the end of his rope, so she wouldn't argue with him.</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Great Master Jasmine directly transmitted her techniques into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but say: "You're so stingy before we're even married. It's a good thing I didn't accept your confession, otherwise... sigh."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>This made the expression on Great Master Jasmine's face freeze.</p><p></p><p>If she wasn't wary of Qi Yuan's strength, she would have attacked long ago.</p><p></p><p>She was also furious inside.</p><p></p><p>Being called stingy?</p><p></p><p>She deeply regretted using Blood Robe Sword Saint as an excuse when rejecting Great Master Wu Jun back then.</p><p></p><p>Now he brought it up to mock her every day.</p><p></p><p>And she couldn't even refute it.</p><p></p><p>The Yin spirit elders quickly finished uploading their techniques, anxious to leave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the increasing number of techniques in his jade slip with a beaming smile.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking about whether he should open branches of the Original God Sharing Association in all realms.</p><p></p><p>If he held a celebration in each realm, wouldn't he be able to obtain countless techniques?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has shown such great virtue. I've noted all your kindness. Would you like to stay for a meal before leaving?" Qi Yuan politely asked.</p><p></p><p>"No need." The Yin spirit elders hurriedly waved their hands in refusal.</p><p></p><p>Now, they just wanted to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>What if Dark Sun's Four Generals of the Lei Family arrived and implicated them? That would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>"But the food is already prepared. Wouldn't it be wasteful not to eat it? Someone come and pack food for these Yin spirit elders. Remember, they are honored guests. When packing, give them more dishes and more meat. Don't just give rice and vegetables, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan earnestly instructed those Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Purple Mansion cultivators were all a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Packing food for Yin spirits? In their half a lifetime, this was the first time they had encountered such a thing.</p><p></p><p>But since Blood Robe Sword Saint ordered it, they could only... start packing food for the Yin spirit elders.</p><p></p><p>Before long, all the Yin spirit elders present were holding large and small packages.</p><p></p><p>Because Blood Robe Sword Saint had instructed not to let these Yin spirit elders leave empty-handed, but to send them off fully loaded.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. No fighting or arguing, no brawling over the packed meals. Yin spirits truly have high quality." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan praised.</p><p></p><p>As expected of old monsters who had cultivated for tens of thousands of years, they all had high standards.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone... you may return now."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the Yin spirit elders finally felt the weight lift from their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Why had they endured so much, standing here holding large and small packages of food? It was all for this one sentence from Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan finished speaking, these Yin spirit elders hurriedly waved goodbye and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

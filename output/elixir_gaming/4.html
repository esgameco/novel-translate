        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu stood in place, she couldn't quite believe her ears.</p><p></p><p>She... the mighty...</p><p></p><p>Was building her own house? A thatched hut??</p><p></p><p>Her magical powers, used for this?</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to say something to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan seemed not to have noticed her expression.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the clouds in the sky and said, "You'd better hurry up, it might rain at night."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu paused, blinking her eyes: "Senior brother, what if I don't finish in time?"</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to send her senior brother a voice message: Help me.</p><p></p><p>"There's a bench in my room," Qi Yuan said, "If you're afraid of getting rained on, you can sleep on that bench."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Qi Yuan went into the thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu clenched her fists, looking at her senior brother's back.</p><p></p><p>Resigned to her fate.</p><p></p><p>After all, she wasn't the kind of woman who would force others to coddle her.</p><p></p><p>Her own matters, she would do them herself.</p><p></p><p>She followed Qi Yuan into the courtyard, then started carrying bundles of thatch and some wood to build her own... nest?</p><p></p><p>Troublesome as it was, Jiang Lingsu still remembered the purpose of her coming here.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to do was to find that eminent person.</p><p></p><p>Although the peak lord of the Seven-Color Peak, Ruan Yixi, had the highest probability of being that eminent person, there might also be someone else.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, maybe under the Divine Light Sect, there is an ancient seal, with a supremely powerful being slumbering within.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, she would just treat him as an ordinary senior brother, not getting too close, nor deliberately keeping her distance, just going with the flow.</p><p></p><p>The clouds gathered and dispersed, Jiang Lingsu was busy building her thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>The originally empty space now had a thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>Although she had never built a house before, nor lived in a thatched hut, she had cultivated magical arts after all.</p><p></p><p>And she had quite a few treasures hidden on her person.</p><p></p><p>The house wasn't very stable, but just placing a "Paralysis Talisman" would prevent it from collapsing, right?</p><p></p><p>After finishing the house, it was still early.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu clapped her hands, looking at the house, feeling extremely satisfied within.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother."</p><p></p><p>She went outside Qi Yuan's hut and called out.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, she had joined the Seven-Color Peak, so she needed to go through the motions.</p><p></p><p>She needed to cultivate the magical arts of the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Qi Yuan's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu hurriedly went in.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she entered the room, she saw Qi Yuan holding a square jade slip in his hand.</p><p></p><p>She had seen this type of jade slip before.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, are you playing a game?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world of today was no longer the gloomy one of the past.</p><p></p><p>Entertainment was also extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>Alchemy gambling.</p><p>Visiting brothels and listening to music.</p><p>Sword immortal dance.</p><p>Even games were very abundant.</p><p></p><p>The square jade slip in Qi Yuan's hand, judging from its appearance, was a game jade slip.</p><p>These jade slips usually store various types of games.</p><p>Such as combat, exploration, farming... all kinds.</p><p></p><p>However, these game jade slips were not cheap.</p><p>Especially the more complex large-scale games, which even had formations engraved on them, and the character backgrounds were lifelike, as if they were real.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that jade slip games were particularly popular.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were quite a few titles that were too obscene and could only be circulated in secret.</p><p></p><p>And those who could afford to play jade slip games were not too short on money.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan played the game, not even looking up: "Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, have you been playing games all afternoon?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how she had been working hard the whole time, while her senior brother was here playing games, she felt a bit imbalanced.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother hasn't..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation? If I'm not mistaken, Senior Brother should have already reached the peak of Qi Condensation, just one step away from Foundation Establishment." Jiang Lingsu was also at the peak of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm cultivating right now," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Playing games is cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Although some game jade slips do have benefits for cultivation, those kinds of game jade slips are extremely rare and precious.</p><p></p><p>"Playing games? Cultivation?" Jiang Lingsu paused, then suddenly realized something. "Senior Brother, you belong to the Infatuated Sect, what is the object of your infatuation?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Infatuated Sect is quite different from other sects.</p><p></p><p>For other sects, when cultivating, one needs to find the cultivation method that suits their spiritual root and cultivate on their own.</p><p></p><p>The Infatuated Sect, however, needs to find their own object of infatuation.</p><p></p><p>Infatuated with an object.</p><p></p><p>It could be jade, flowers, or even swords.</p><p></p><p>According to the elders of Jiang Lingsu's clan, the cultivation of the Infatuated Sect emphasizes the power of the mind.</p><p></p><p>Wholeheartedly devoted to the object of infatuation.</p><p></p><p>When the infatuation reaches its peak, it becomes madness.</p><p></p><p>Towards the outside world, they seem a bit out of place.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, cultivators of the Infatuated Sect are extremely difficult to communicate with.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu has seen cultivators of the Infatuated Sect before, but never one who is infatuated with games.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, those who are infatuated with games will be sent by their clan to receive treatment, with lightning therapy being the most popular.</p><p></p><p>After all, the traditional cultivation world does not really recognize game infatuation as part of the Infatuated Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Is this also considered infatuation?" Qi Yuan said without looking up. "If so, then I'm infatuated with it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Should she apply for lightning therapy for her Senior Brother? Does game infatuation have any prospects?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, isn't this a bit unreliable? I've never heard of any great cultivator who is infatuated with games."</p><p></p><p>The objects of infatuation in the Infatuated Sect can vary in potential.</p><p></p><p>For example, infatuation with a tree - a thousand-year-old dragon blood tree is better than an ordinary tree, and a Heaven-Blessed Tree is even better than a thousand-year-old dragon blood tree.</p><p></p><p>Games... what prospects could they have? "In the new era, we must accept new things," Qi Yuan said calmly, looking at Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained this game jade slip a year before he transmigrated to this world.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, this jade slip is like a game console.</p><p></p><p>But this game console is a bit special, it seems... to be able to connect to a network.</p><p></p><p>After he transmigrated to this world, this game jade slip has become closely related to him.</p><p></p><p>Even his eyes' ability to see hidden information might be related to this game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>In this world, he has also seen many other game jade slips, some similar to his, but completely different in reality.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was speechless.</p><p></p><p>However, she remembered the purpose of her visit.</p><p></p><p>She continued, "Senior Brother, can you give me the cultivation method of the Seven-Colored Peak?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu seriously and said, "The cultivation method of the Seven-Colored Peak cannot be cultivated."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that her Senior Brother knows some hidden secrets? Is it related to the Peak Master?</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation method is poisonous."</p><p></p><p>"Pfft..." If Jiang Lingsu had water in her mouth, she would have surely spat it out.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, the current Qi Yuan is just a strange and eccentric madman.</p><p></p><p>However, considering the information she had investigated before coming here, this Senior Brother of the Seven-Colored Peak was indeed a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>So it's not that surprising.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, I don't mind, please give me the cultivation method." Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slowly took out a jade slip and handed it to Jiang Lingsu: "This is the cultivation method of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>However, it's only half complete.</p><p></p><p>The first part is the original cultivation method, and the second part is what I've modified, but not fully completed."</p><p></p><p>He handed the cultivation method jade slip to Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

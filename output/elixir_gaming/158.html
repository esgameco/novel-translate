        <h1>Chapter 158</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A childish voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"The sun in the sky has changed again. I don't know if this is... a good thing or a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>A charming female voice chuckled lightly: "This at least involves the struggle of great powers. We shouldn't worry about these useless things. We should think about whether we've made efforts in recent years, whether we've opened another divine aperture?"</p><p></p><p>"The Emotional Venerable One is still as interesting as ever." An elderly voice sounded, "Such matters, let's not mention them again."</p><p></p><p>These three were the three Yin Gods of the Eastern Land, and also the organizers of the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in reality, the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle was entirely organized by the Impoverished Venerable One. </p><p></p><p>The other two never inquired about it, and what they were communicating now was just an avatar.</p><p></p><p>Their true bodies had long been in secluded meditation, working on opening divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>"In half a month, the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle will end, and the gates of the Moon-Gazing Continent will soon open. I wonder... if we can have a place on the Moon-Gazing Continent." The charming female voice said, with an inexplicable sadness in her tone.</p><p></p><p>"The Moluo clan... is truly powerful." The elderly voice lamented, "Without borrowing the power of other Yin Gods, we cannot contend with the Moluo clan."</p><p></p><p>The childish voice then spoke up: "Seek help from other Yin Gods? That would be handing over the Moon-Gazing Continent, absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Moluo clan has experts at the second step of Sky Treading!" The elderly voice said again.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the second step of Sky Treading, the other Yin Gods present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They were all at the first step of Sky Treading, with only a few scattered divine apertures opened.</p><p></p><p>Facing Yin Gods at the second step of Sky Treading, they were no match at all.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the charming female voice said: "I heard that some time ago, a Blood-Robed Sword God destroyed the Palace of Light. The battle products that fell out of the virtual realm are not simple. This indicates that a battle at the level of the second step of Sky Treading took place in the virtual realm. Is this Blood-Robed Sword God at the second step of Sky Treading?"</p><p></p><p>"No, he has no divinity on him at all, he's not a Yin God."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he also has a powerful Yin God artifact?" The female voice became greedy.</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't this old man have a Yin God artifact!" The elderly voice complained.</p><p></p><p>"Without reaching the second step of Sky Treading, a Yin God's own divine power is not enough to open divine apertures, let alone spend it on condensing a Yin God artifact? If the Blood-Robed Sword God dies on the Moon-Gazing Continent, that would be good." The charming female voice laughed, "Then, I could pick up that Yin God artifact."</p><p></p><p>"You really are daydreaming, would the Moluo clan give up a Yin God artifact?"</p><p></p><p>"Impoverished One, you sending the Blood-Robed Sword God into the Moon-Gazing Continent, what a deep calculation."</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable One did not calculate against him, it was his own wish to enter the Moon-Gazing Continent. This Venerable One merely fulfilled his small wish. As for dying on the Moon-Gazing Continent, that can't be blamed on me." The childish voice said righteously.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Undercurrents surged in the Eastern Land.</p><p></p><p>Even the small Great Shang was not peaceful at this time.</p><p></p><p>The sect master of the Divine Light Sect, True Lord Withered Wood, had been worried for days.</p><p></p><p>With Wood Void dead in the Divine Light Sect, the Red Sword Gate would have more reason to make trouble for the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although the elder of the Red Sword Gate was still severely injured, he was after all at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Purple Palace and Divine Infant realms were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yin Gods and Purple Palace cultivators were not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>The sect's grand formation had already been activated, just waiting for the Red Sword Gate's elder to come and fight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura swept across the sky.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood's expression changed slightly: "Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The elders and stewards of the Divine Light Sect also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"They really came!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, the Divine Light Sect is finished!"</p><p></p><p>"No, not just one, but two Purple Palace experts!" True Lord Withered Wood sensed two powerful auras, and his heart sank into complete despair.</p><p></p><p>One Purple Palace expert could easily destroy the Divine Light Sect, let alone two.</p><p></p><p>That undying old Purple Palace expert from the Red Sword Gate even found help?</p><p></p><p>How shameless!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, let's fight them to the death!" A Golden Core elder said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"We'll defend the sect to our last breath!"</p><p></p><p>The sect was united in purpose.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the sect, Mei Shan and Xu Yeli looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Did we come to the wrong place?"</p><p></p><p>"We shouldn't have."</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like they see us as great enemies?"</p><p></p><p>The two were confused.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Shan of the Blood Robe Alliance has come to visit the sect master of the Divine Light Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yeli of the Blood Robe Alliance has come to visit the sect master of the Divine Light Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Their voices rolled through the mountain-protecting formation, directly entering the ears of all the Divine Light Sect disciples and elders.</p><p></p><p>These elders and disciples looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Alliance, what's that?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, isn't it supposed to be the Red Sword Gate?"</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood looked puzzled, and Elder Xuan Chong was also bewildered.</p><p></p><p>The elders flew to the front gate of the sect and looked out.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood's eyes showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Because the two old men before him both had auras as deep as the sea.</p><p></p><p>Especially the one in front, who didn't seem to be an ordinary Purple Palace expert.</p><p></p><p>What were such powerful experts doing at the Divine Light Sect?</p><p></p><p>"Are you the sect master of the Divine Light Sect?" Mei Shan looked at True Lord Withered Wood, his attitude exceptionally amiable towards a Divine Infant realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the elder of the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"This junior is Withered Wood, sect master of the Divine Light Sect. May I ask who you two are?" True Lord Withered Wood was puzzled inside.</p><p></p><p>"Our Blood Robe Alliance's leader has a gift to give to you." Mei Shan spoke.</p><p></p><p>A purple-gold gourd appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Facing the mountain-protecting formation of the Divine Light Sect, the gourd seemed to pass through without hindrance, directly entering the Divine Light Sect and landing in True Lord Withered Wood's hand.</p><p></p><p>"The purple-gold gourd?" Looking at this familiar gourd, True Lord Withered Wood's eyes showed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>It was the lost treasure of his Wood clan!</p><p></p><p>For a thousand years, he hadn't seen this clan treasure!</p><p></p><p>Now, it suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>Xuan Chong looked at the purple-gold gourd, his eyes also fixed on it.</p><p></p><p>The other members of the sect were confused, not knowing why the sect master and Elder Xuan Chong had such a big reaction.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood was excited inside, holding the treasure, with various memories flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the treasure, but a puzzled expression flashed across his face.</p><p></p><p>The purple-gold gourd was listed as a reward for the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>How did it appear here?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of Qi Yuan and Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>He had only revealed the matter of his identity and the treasure to these two people.</p><p></p><p>Now that the treasure had returned, it must be related to these two!</p><p></p><p>Who was it?</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood first ruled out Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>After all, Kang Fulu was his son-in-law, and he knew his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Only Ruan Yixi's disciple Qi Yuan was truly unfathomable to him.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan, that pretty boy, had caught the eye of the Blood Robe Alliance's leader?</p><p></p><p>It must be said, True Lord Withered Wood really thought this was possible.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was not very proper in his behavior, he was very handsome, privately ranked as the tenth beauty of Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>If not for his outstanding personality, he might have been ranked first.</p><p></p><p>It was quite possible for him to be taken as a Dao companion by a senior.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had sacrificed a lot for him, and True Lord Withered Wood felt moved.</p><p></p><p>Were these the two subordinates of Qi Yuan that Jiang Lingsu had mentioned?</p><p></p><p>If so, it would be easy to explain.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood asked: "May I ask, senior, is the leader of the Blood Robe Alliance male or female?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's a man."</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood's expression froze, his gratitude increasing immeasurably.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's sacrifice... was too great.</p><p></p><p>"The leader also said that you are his elder, having taken care of him a lot, and he has another gift for you." Mei Shan spoke.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Elder?</p><p></p><p>Taken care of?</p><p></p><p>What he had thought earlier was all wrong?</p><p></p><p>He knew the leader of the Blood Robe Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>As for the gift, he didn't think much about it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Mei Shan's eyes held a smile: "Please look, who is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli pushed with his hand, and a figure fell into the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a Purple Palace expert?"</p><p></p><p>The figure's aura was weakened, bound by immortal-binding ropes, but any Divine Infant realm cultivator could see at a glance that it was a Purple Palace expert!</p><p></p><p>A Purple Palace expert, bound by an artifact, thrown before them like a dead dog, how could they not be shocked!</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first time in their lives they had seen a Purple Palace expert up close.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong's eyes saw the face of that Purple Palace expert, and his heart skipped a beat, countless emotions surging up.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Lian... that old bastard!"</p><p></p><p>The person before them was none other than Hong Lian, that old bastard!</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had forced the Holy Consort to her death, destroyed the Wood clan, and killed his entire family and clan!</p><p></p><p>How could he forget that face?</p><p></p><p>He saw that arrogant face in his dreams day and night!</p><p></p><p>True Lord Withered Wood's excitement was no less than Xuan Chong's.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at Hong Lian, his heart shocked, elated, and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The leader said, this person is for you to dispose of as you see fit. We must return to report to the Blood Robe Alliance immediately. To avoid any accidents, you might as well behead Hong Lian and display his head publicly." Mei Shan suggested.</p><p></p><p>The so-called public beheading meant cutting off his head and displaying it.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Indeed. After all, how could simply killing them easily satisfy such a deep blood feud? In the Cang Lan Realm, beheading ceremonies were often held.</p><p></p><p>Kumu Zhenjun looked at Mei Shan and Xu Yeli, and bowed solemnly to them: "Thank you both, and thank you to the leader of the Blood Robe Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't know who the leader of the Blood Robe Alliance was, but they must have a deep connection with Qi Yuan, perhaps even...</p><p></p><p>He looked at Hong Lian, hatred pouring from his eyes. </p><p></p><p>He wished he could eat his flesh and swallow his bones.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>The beheading ceremony began. </p><p></p><p>Kumu Zhenjun's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Hong Lian was like a dead dog, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"If you kill me, the Water Fairy Continent will go to war with the Emerald Cloud Continent!" He struggled, not wanting to die.</p><p></p><p>Even more, he didn't want to die at the hands of a weak Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Many elders and disciples of the Divine Light Sect watched this scene with shocked expressions. </p><p></p><p>After all, they had never seen a Purple Mansion cultivator in their lives.</p><p></p><p>The first time they saw one, it was to behead him - how rare.</p><p></p><p>Kumu Zhenjun held a long sword, waiting to behead him with one strike to avenge his clansmen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another terrifying aura swept over them again.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Light Sect, you dare kill my disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that after being out of sight for too long, the name of Purple Mansion no longer carries weight?"</p><p></p><p>"Today, the Divine Light Sect will surely be in chaos!"</p><p></p><p>A Purple Mansion expert in a brown robe appeared outside the Divine Light Sect, his face filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Kumu Zhenjun, his gaze freezing.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw a bound Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The aura of that Purple Mansion cultivator was deep and powerful, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>How could such a powerful cultivator be bound here?</p><p></p><p>He was confused.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an impassioned voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"The auspicious time has come, sacrifice! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>With that voice, the long sword in Kumu Zhenjun's hand glowed.</p><p></p><p>Slash!</p><p></p><p>With one strike, Hong Lian's head fell to the ground and rolled.</p><p></p><p>His soul was also bound by celestial ropes, slowly fading away.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the others look at the brown-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>The elder stood in mid-air, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What had he just seen? A mid-stage Purple Mansion expert beheaded by the Divine Light Sect?</p><p></p><p>Had he come to the wrong place, or was he not fully awake?</p><p></p><p>"You may continue... I took a wrong turn..." The situation was too strange, it was better to leave first.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a gentle voice came from behind: "Friend, please stay."</p><p></p><p>The brown-robed elder's body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>A late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator...</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the progress on the Golden Core Dao is pleasing. The accumulated Solar True Fire... is it enough to swallow a star now?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he felt it was better to accumulate more.</p><p></p><p>After all, swallowing a star was not the same as swallowing a planet.</p><p></p><p>The two were completely different.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if he remembered correctly, the stars around him were all bigger than him.</p><p></p><p>He had swallowed over a dozen planets, but compared to those stars, the difference was still too great.</p><p></p><p>"Accumulate some more Solar True Fire, then swallow a star in one go. That should be enough to defeat Ye Qiong Venerable, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Before swallowing a new star, I should keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why is my Golden Core in other worlds? If it were in this world, I'd dare to directly challenge a Yang Shen!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan was just saying this.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing how strong a Yang Shen was, he wouldn't rashly challenge one.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader!" The leader of the Cloud Palace called from outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Has the Eastern Land Genius Competition ended?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's over. The Moon-Gazing Continent has opened," the Cloud Palace leader entered the hall.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was somewhat delighted: "Let's go, I want to go to the Moon-Gazing Continent."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Cloud Palace leader's expression became solemn: "The situation in the Moon-Gazing Continent is unclear. Apart from those three Venerables, probably no one knows exactly what's happening inside.</p><p></p><p>If the Alliance Leader enters rashly, it could be dangerous. Why not send some juniors to enter first and scout?"</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Emerald Cloud Continent only had the Blood Robe Sword Saint as their Yin Shen foundation.</p><p></p><p>If anything happened to the Blood Robe Sword Saint, these Purple Mansion cultivators would have no chance of survival in the face of a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense," Qi Yuan nodded, "If Ye Qiong Venerable ambushes me, it would be a huge loss."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Cloud Palace leader's face showed a smile: "Shall I make arrangements now?"</p><p></p><p>"Why arrange for others when I can go myself?" As Qi Yuan spoke, his facial features changed dramatically, and his blood-colored robe was replaced with a black robe. "I was originally a Yuan Dan cultivator, I just disguised myself as a Purple Mansion in front of you before. Now I've returned to my original appearance.</p><p></p><p>As a Yuan Dan, if I enter, no one should pay attention to me, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader fell silent, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the entrance to the Moon-Gazing Continent.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses gathered.</p><p></p><p>The top nineteen from the Genius Rankings were all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoyao wore a black robe. With his Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, he undisputedly won first place in this Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord stood still, eyes closed, dozing off.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was also among the crowd, her expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen's eyes were now full of sharpness.</p><p></p><p>After the Light Palace was destroyed, he no longer held back. His Solar True Fire burned everything, allowing him to enter the top twenty.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the last person? When will they come? I'd like to see which genius dares to use connections to get in," a woman from the Water Fairy Continent spoke, her voice tinged with mockery.</p><p></p><p>She was ranked third on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings, her water techniques far surpassing others. Geniuses ranked 20th to 30th on the Eastern Land Genius Rankings were no match for her.</p><p></p><p>The gathered geniuses looked at Ling Jiao, their eyes filled with wariness.</p><p></p><p>Ling Jiao had reason to be proud.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, her talent was very strong.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, she came from the Water Cloud Palace, which possessed a Yin Shen artifact.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, her mother was the most beloved youngest daughter of a Yin Shen from the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>She was truly a female genius born with a golden spoon in her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, sorry, I'm a bit late," a voice came at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over and saw a "plump" man.</p><p></p><p>The man was wearing layer upon layer of magical robes, at a rough glance, there were at least dozens of layers.</p><p></p><p>Each robe looked extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>On his head, he wore a dragon crown that covered his face, making it impossible to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>Most ridiculously, he had a turtle shell on both his back and chest.</p><p></p><p>In his hands, he carried bags big and small.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit late, please everyone have some buns and soy milk."</p><p></p><p>This "plump" person was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For this entry into the Moon-Gazing Continent, he had made many preparations, wearing many defensive magical robes with dense talismans pasted inside.</p><p></p><p>Before swallowing a second star, Qi Yuan decided to change his ways and keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to disguise his identity so that Ye Qiong Venerable wouldn't recognize him.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, he arrived a bit later than the others.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wasn't really late, as there was still some time before the entrance to the Moon-Gazing Continent truly opened.</p><p></p><p>The buns and soy milk left his hands and flew towards the gathered geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The other nineteen geniuses looked at each other in bewilderment, catching the buns and soy milk.</p><p></p><p>Only Ling Jiao snorted coldly, waving her hand to knock the soy milk and buns to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ling Jiao with a face full of self-reproach: "Sigh, I thought everyone was like me and liked sweet soy milk, so I bought sweet ones.</p><p></p><p>I didn't expect you to like salty ones. If I had known, I would have bought salty ones for you."</p><p></p><p>Ling Jiao looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with disdain: "I thought it was someone who used connections to get in, turns out it's just someone who hides their face and doesn't dare show their true appearance."</p><p></p><p>She was puzzled in her heart.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't the Blood Robe Sword Saint who came? The person before her showed no signs of being a strong expert, certainly not the Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>So who was it? She needed to find out who exactly had replaced the Blood Robe Sword Saint to enter the Moon-Gazing Continent.</p><p></p><p>This was a task her mother had given her.</p><p></p><p>That's why she deliberately picked on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The other gathered geniuses also looked at Qi Yuan curiously.</p><p></p><p>Only Xu Tongchen's expression was strange, not daring to look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"How have I not shown my true appearance? I'm just wearing a few more clothes.</p><p></p><p>Aren't you wearing clothes too? How can you say I'm not showing my true appearance?</p><p></p><p>Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black!</p><p></p><p>How about this, you take off one piece of clothing, and I'll take off one too. We'll both show our true appearances?" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Jiao's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>How many pieces of clothing was she wearing? The man before her was wearing dozens! Shameless!</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses saw this scene and revealed expressions of watching a good show.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Great Wisdom True Lord, who was eating a bun, spoke up: "I think what this brother says makes sense. Let's all strip together."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Ling Jiao snorted coldly, not speaking further.</p><p></p><p>In her heart, she had marked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Before, her provocation was due to her mother's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had truly formed a grudge!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

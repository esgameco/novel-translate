        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I won't sleep in the bridal chamber, I don't like lying on a hard board," Qi Yuan said seriously to the little bride behind him.</p><p></p><p>The little bride followed silently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan jumped into the pit.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a loud thud came from outside the pit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately climbed out of the pit and saw the little bride knocked down by a rock.</p><p></p><p>He helped the little bride up and brushed the dirt off her.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, without eyes, she just can't help but fall down!"</p><p></p><p>During this time of being with the little bride, Qi Yuan had already discovered many of her attributes.</p><p></p><p>For example, she was easy to fall, and also easy to bump and knock things over in the house.</p><p></p><p>"In the future when I get married, I must find someone with eyes," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then embraced the little bride like gathering clothes in the rain, and then crawled back into the pit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>In a certain valley, dozens of coffins were arranged.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The coffin lids flipped open.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of humanoid beings sat up.</p><p></p><p>They were both male and female, emanating a vast aura.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan saw these people, he would definitely be dazzled.</p><p></p><p>They were all level 90 NPCs!</p><p></p><p>Even some were level 95 and above!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the strongest of this group of humanoid beings, a man with a vertical pupil on his forehead, his gaze pierced through the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land, as if he had seen the Clothing Taboo.</p><p></p><p>He slowly spoke, his voice neither male nor female: "Another fellow traveler will soon arrive in the mortal world."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, unexpectedly, the evil demons from the outside world have penetrated the heavenly realm, and even someone has been able to step into the divine domain."</p><p></p><p>Since thousands of years ago, when the celestial gods disappeared, the Wuyue Continent had undergone a terrifying change.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists cultivated, from the Posterior Heaven (levels 0-9), Prior Heaven (levels 10-19), Master (levels 20-29), King (levels 30-49), Emperor (levels 50-69), Divine Realm (levels 70-89), to the God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a martial artist broke through the Emperor level and entered the Divine Realm, a fishing line would fall from the sky above, enter that martial artist's body, and suck out their brain and flesh.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the fishing line would leave, leaving only an empty human skin.</p><p></p><p>So, on the Wuyue Continent, for thousands of years, there have been almost no new powerful figures in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know his origins?" said a lady in white robes, who was a 97-level bigshot. In the distant past, she had a fleeting romance with the celestial gods.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Zang Hua, he is from the Clothing Taboo, and most likely relied on the resources of the Empress of the Bridal Robe to reach this step," an old man said, stealing a glance at the lady.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it seems that fellow Jinye has left a lot of good things for that stinky woman," Elder Zang Hua said with a hint of mockery.</p><p></p><p>Jinye was the name of the celestial god.</p><p></p><p>The others heard this and did not respond, not wanting to provoke Elder Zang Hua's wrath.</p><p></p><p>The man with the vertical pupil, with a towering figure, spoke, his voice like rumbling thunder: "Since he is about to enter the God Realm and is the new husband of the Empress of the Bridal Robe, he should also be our fellow traveler.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years from now, when the celestial dog swallows the moon, that will be the weakest time for the evil demons from the outside world. That will be the time for us to attack the Earthly Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>The evil demons from the outside world occupied the Earthly Forbidden Land, causing chaos in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>These former Divine Realm, now God Realm experts, could only hide in the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land and the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>They have been cultivating in secret for thousands of years, accumulating strength, just waiting for the time when the evil demons from the outside world are at their weakest, to hold a great demonic subjugation and attack the Earthly Forbidden Land together.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the evil demons from the outside world completely occupy the Earthly Forbidden Land and can appear in the Wuyue Continent in their full form, even with the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land and the Five Elements Forbidden Land, they would be unable to stop the evil demons, and would only perish.</p><p></p><p>"This token of demonic subjugation..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The invitation to the conference should be presented." The slit-eyed man spoke.</p><p></p><p>"But he has not yet entered the divine domain, and he may not even be able to get past the Ugly Robe Weird Emperor." A man said, while also fawning on the Funeral Flower Immortal Lady.</p><p></p><p>The Funeral Flower Immortal Lady did not like the Empress of the Robe, so she naturally would not like the husband of the new Empress of the Robe.</p><p></p><p>He had always admired the Funeral Flower Immortal Lady, so he naturally spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"With the Empress of the Robe there, it's just a matter of time before he slays the Ugly Robe Weird Emperor.</p><p></p><p>What a pity... Why did the Empress of the Robe choose him as her husband?</p><p></p><p>If it was Tong, or even us, our strength would also greatly increase, and our chances of success in the Demon Slaying Conference would be greater.</p><p></p><p>What a pity, in just three hundred years, even with the support of the Empress of the Robe, his combat power is likely to be only slightly below the weaker overlords."  An old man lamented.</p><p></p><p>Tong, that is the slit-eyed man, was their leader, a peak expert in the divine domain.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of three such powerful experts, one in the Yin-Yang Forbidden, and two in the Five Elements Forbidden Lands.</p><p></p><p>The former gods were experts at this level.</p><p></p><p>While the Funeral Flower Immortal Lady and the others at levels 95 to 98 were overlord-level experts in the divine domain.</p><p></p><p>But the husband of the new Empress of the Robe, who has not yet entered the divine domain, even after these few hundred years, with the divine abilities of the Empress of the Robe's help, his combat power would likely only be slightly below the overlords.</p><p></p><p>And these overlords, if they had the Empress of the Robe's assistance, might be able to display peak divine domain strength, or even surpass it.</p><p></p><p>They would have a better chance against the evil demons from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of saying these things? Do you dare to leave the Yin-Yang Forbidden and go find that Empress of the Robe?</p><p></p><p>And we don't even know if a new Empress of the Robe has been born in the world?" A chubby man mocked, he was also an overlord.</p><p></p><p>Some people were dissatisfied when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Some remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"I just feel that the Empress of the Robe marrying that man is such a waste!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the evil demons from the outside are terrifyingly powerful, even the gods could not match them.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years later, in the Demon Slaying Conference, can we win?"</p><p></p><p>The gods were the most talented experts of the past tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Tong and the two peak experts in the Five Elements Forbidden Lands were all suppressed by the gods.</p><p></p><p>The gods were defeated? Could they... win?</p><p></p><p>"Don't admit defeat before the battle, Old Tang, are you afraid? I remember your most beloved grandson was hooked and devoured by the evil demons from the outside!"</p><p></p><p>"Every bit of power is extremely important to us.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the one from the Robe Forbidden is our fellow, how can we speak disrespectfully?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just... the Empress of the Robe is such a waste, if she was with Tong... it might not be able to create a second god, or even stronger!"</p><p></p><p>The people argued, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Tong spoke up at this time, his voice cold: "Enough, the great enemy is at hand, no infighting.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li, issue an invitation, invite that fellow disciple to attend the Demon Slaying Conference."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir." The man named Mo Li replied.</p><p></p><p>In the Robe Forbidden, Qi Yuan, who was about to log off, paused.</p><p></p><p>"Invitation?"</p><p></p><p>An invitation appeared on the Little Bride's body.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred years later? The Demon Slaying Conference?"</p><p></p><p>"Like hell I'll go!"</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred years, my daughter will have ruled the ages by then!"</p><p></p><p>Recommended a great novel by the author! "From Water Monkey to Becoming a God"</p><p></p><p>"Can you stop worshiping young girls to me, I really am not the Water God!"</p><p></p><p>Excellent author, good reputation, mutation cultivation style, with beast taming elements, can be read.</p><p></p><p>The link is below, you can go directly there!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

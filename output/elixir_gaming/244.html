        <h1>Chapter 244</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still adhered to ethical and moral principles.</p><p></p><p>For example, when he saw Ruan Yixi, he realized she was his wife.</p><p></p><p>So he always called Ruan Yixi "wife".</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Domineering Woman was quite a bit older than him, so naturally he had to address her respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"I'm young and beautiful, you people are making me sound old!" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman gritted her teeth as she sent this message.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when she was at the peak of the Purple Palace realm, she didn't put on airs in the group chat. Even when facing Qi Yuan, she didn't show any signs of inferiority.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman is a peerless beauty in the prime of her youth!" Rogue Immortal Master flattered her at the right moment.</p><p></p><p>The current Rogue Immortal Master had already accepted his fate. His talent was lacking, and Origin Celestial Lord, who used to band together with him in the group chat, had suddenly become a super big shot. He was now the only true newbie in the group.</p><p></p><p>So he only needed to focus on flattery and cling to the powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Although breaking through to Divine Infant True Lord feels great, I also have my worries - the breakthrough was too fast," Qi Yuan said with concern on his face.</p><p></p><p>He really had broken through too quickly.</p><p></p><p>He had traveled a long way back to Seven-Colored Peak, and before he could even get settled, in the blink of an eye he had gone from early Elemental Core stage to Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>This speed could be considered unprecedented, with no one likely to match it in the future.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Rogue Immortal Master was completely lost. Someone was actually complaining about breaking through too fast? According to Origin Celestial Lord, wasn't this just humble-bragging?</p><p></p><p>"If I break through to Yin Spirit, I'll definitely follow Origin Celestial Lord's example and show off in front of my sisters. I'll say... sigh, breaking through to Yin Spirit was too simple, not challenging at all, no sense of accomplishment."</p><p></p><p>"In this group, Origin Celestial Lord is the most skilled at showing off."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not showing off, I'm truly troubled. </p><p></p><p>I went to great lengths to find Old Man Wutian and moved all the cultivation methods from the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But now, I've used up all the methods, only progressing to the part about breaking through to Divine Infant."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was genuinely troubled.</p><p></p><p>For the Elemental Core part, there were two paths - one was to continue on the Stellar Golden Core path, the other was to break through to Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had used up all the methods, he hadn't finished the Golden Core path, and he had no clue about the Divine Infant path.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, he could be considered a Divine Infant True Lord, but he could also be an Elemental Core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words once again left the Four Divine Flower Monarchs confused.</p><p></p><p>"You've moved all the methods from the Ascending Heaven Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the master of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion is only at the peak of Purple Palace realm, even Yin Spirit Venerable Ones deeply admire him. Origin Celestial Lord... you're truly formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, don't mention it. I'm too poor now, I'm in desperate need of cultivation methods. Where else can I find a place with... as many methods as the Ascending Heaven Pavilion?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask for help.</p><p></p><p>His Golden Core path was a bottomless pit.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant path also required various cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya from the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, that rich lady, had already been emptied out. Qi Yuan had to find other ways.</p><p></p><p>And by the way, he needed to check on the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Among the Thirteen States of the Eastern Land, the Ascending Heaven Pavilion has the most cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Origin Celestial Lord, if you want to find more methods, you may need to leave the Eastern Land," said the Great Sun Flame Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, go to other regions?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Qi Yuan had returned from Wangyue Continent and received Little Li's tip from the Fox Den. He had gone on a killing spree, slaying those who slandered him through the network.</p><p></p><p>However, his actions were limited to the Eastern Land.</p><p></p><p>He had never been outside the Eastern Land before.</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't Origin Celestial Lord come to the Phoenix Sky Domain? It's adjacent to the Eastern Land. The Three Realms branch of the Dao Seeking Palace is in the Phoenix Sky Domain. Origin Celestial Lord might be able to obtain quite a few methods from the Dao Seeking Palace," the Great Sun Flame Monarch introduced.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, there were a total of thirty-six domains.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Eastern Land, Central Heavenly Domain, and Northern Polar Ice Plains were each considered one domain.</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Sky Domain was next to the Eastern Land and was also where the Great Sun Flame Monarch resided.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Phoenix Sky Domain was a notch above the Eastern Land. Most importantly, there were Great Venerable Ones in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Seeking Palace was an organization established by Purple Palace realm cultivators, encompassing Purple Palace cultivators from most domains, jointly pursuing the path of Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The main branches of the Dao Seeking Palace for the Eastern Land, Phoenix Sky Domain, and Demon Yao Domain were located in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Does... the Dao Seeking Palace have many cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>"The Phoenix Sky Domain branch of the Dao Seeking Palace has slightly fewer methods than the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, their members all have quite a few methods in their possession, just not submitted to the organization," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman explained.</p><p></p><p>"What Dao Seeking Palace, this is clearly my Moonlight Palace!" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>According to his standards for moonlight, the members of this Dao Seeking Palace were all vigorous despite their age, meeting his moonlight criteria.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether they were his moonlight or not still depended on taking a look, to see if there was any affinity.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go. Once I finish hosting the Divine Infant Conference, I'll immediately come to the Phoenix Sky Domain to meet you," Qi Yuan said to the Great Sun Flame Monarch.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ice Mountain Domineering Woman suggested: "We Four Divine Flower Monarchs have never gathered together before. Why don't we take this opportunity, while Origin Celestial Lord is coming to the Phoenix Sky Domain, to meet up?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem, if everyone is coming, I'll make the arrangements!" Great Sun Flame Monarch said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Master hesitated for a moment before saying, "I have some free time for now as well."</p><p></p><p>"It seems our Four Divine Flower Monarchs can finally meet face to face," Qi Yuan was also excited.</p><p></p><p>He was quite enthusiastic about meeting online friends in person.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was a form of revenge meeting after the... alternative failure of meeting Jin Li in person back then.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's set the location as Qinghong City in the Poluo Continent of the Phoenix Sky Domain!" said the Great Sun Flame Monarch.</p><p></p><p>The branch of the Dao Seeking Palace was located in Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>Qinghong City was also a rather famous city in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>"What about the timing?" asked the Great Sun Flame Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"I can probably... be there in half a month," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>He was currently still in the Hundred Countries and needed quite some time to get there.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month, no problem for this old lady."</p><p></p><p>"Works for me too."</p><p></p><p>The group members discussed enthusiastically, quite excited.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Lord, what do you look like? Are you as imposing as the legends say?</p><p></p><p>My little sisters are all very eager to see the legendary Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no images of you have spread from the Eastern Land."</p><p></p><p>"I'd say I'm quite handsome," Qi Yuan became more confident as he recalled how his junior sister Jiang Lingsu had chosen to offer herself to him.</p><p></p><p>If he weren't handsome, his junior sister would probably have chosen to repay him by being his servant in the next life.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen Origin Celestial Lord before. He's arguably the most charismatic and handsome cultivator I've ever seen!" Rogue Immortal Master said in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of cultivation realm, I may not rank highly in the Cang Lan Realm, but... when it comes to looks and appearance, if there were a list of handsome men in the Cang Lan Realm, I would undoubtedly be at the top!" Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his looks, even the two Stellar Golden Core suns in the sky seemed dim and lackluster.</p><p></p><p>"So confident?" Great Sun Flame Monarch was surprised, "You're not exaggerating, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to exaggerate, I can subdue all enemies in the world!" Qi Yuan said boastfully.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the jade slip of the Divine Flower Society, cultivators came to build new cement houses.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Qi Yuan couldn't stay in his own room, so he strolled down the mountain peak with his pet cleaver.</p><p></p><p>He stopped under a big tree where True Lord Deadwood and the empress of the Great Shang Kingdom, now the Empress Dowager, had once met in secret.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the small grass on the ground.</p><p></p><p>[This is a somewhat unusual blade of grass. It has caught a whiff of Qi Yuan's aura]</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some changes occurred.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan widened his eyes, a curious expression appearing in them.</p><p></p><p>"It can really smell Qi Yuan's aura?"</p><p></p><p>The last time he saw the small grass, the information he saw was that the grass had smelled the moon's aura. </p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan was pondering whether it would be possible for this small grass to smell Qi Yuan's aura tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he saw it today.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia, look quickly, this small grass is a bit strange!" Qi Yuan held Xiao Jia's red sleeve, and they both stared at this ordinary-looking small grass.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remembered that last time someone trespassed on Seven-Color Peak, they were killed by this small grass.</p><p></p><p>"Hey... can you speak?" Qi Yuan asked, looking at the small grass.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the small grass remained silent, just like an ordinary grass.</p><p></p><p>"Although you look ordinary and unremarkable, I still noticed you at first glance."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said this and that to the small grass, but it remained quiet and still, just like a normal grass.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran, who was passing by, saw this scene and couldn't help but smile lightly. </p><p></p><p>This senior brother of Seven-Color Peak... was truly special.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior brother." Jiang Ran gracefully bowed, her eyes filled with reverence and confusion.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, Jiang Lingsu had found her and said she wanted to be a door guardian and needed a companion.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran came to be that companion.</p><p></p><p>If it was just being a companion, that would be fine.</p><p></p><p>But this time, being a door guardian meant guarding against the Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>She had specifically asked the disciples and elders of the Divine Light Sect, and tomorrow there would indeed be a Divine Infant Conference, and moreover... it was being held for Qi Yuan of Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>How could Jiang Ran not be shocked? Probably at this moment, all the disciples of the Divine Light Sect who received this news were dumbfounded, finding it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Who in the Divine Light Sect didn't know Qi Yuan's name?</p><p></p><p>And now... he had reached Divine Infant stage?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Sect Master's order that outsiders were not allowed to enter Seven-Color Peak casually, Seven-Color Peak would definitely be extremely lively now.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples and even executive elders would probably have entered Seven-Color Peak by now to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"Going to find your junior sister? Go quickly then." Qi Yuan didn't say much to Jiang Ran.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran looked at Qi Yuan, complex emotions flashing through her mind.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Senior Brother Qi Yuan had stood up for her, getting into conflict with Chu Tianxiong of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>That night, Chu Tianxiong and a group of Black Mountain Sect disciples died, and soon after, the evil Black Mountain Sect was wiped out.</p><p></p><p>This incident became an unsolved case in Da Shang for a long time. No one knew who the culprit was, only that they used a special knife.</p><p></p><p>Now, Jiang Ran glanced at the cleaver hanging behind Qi Yuan, and many thoughts arose in her mind.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had been hiding his strength all along.</p><p></p><p>Was it possible that the Black Mountain Sect was destroyed by Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Ran felt grateful and couldn't help but ask, "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, was the Black Mountain Sect... destroyed by you before?"</p><p></p><p>If so, Senior Brother Qi Yuan would definitely be her great benefactor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked around, seeming very guilty: "I'll tell you, I destroyed them, but you absolutely must not tell anyone else. Otherwise, if the hidden experts in the Black Mountain Sect go to Blue Star and kill all my fellow townspeople, that would be bad!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>It really was Senior Brother Qi Yuan! Back then, when there was conflict with the Black Mountain Sect, Senior Brother Qi Yuan had stood up, and Jiang Ran had been worried about Senior Brother Qi Yuan's strength. She never expected that he had actually wiped out the Black Mountain Sect overnight.</p><p></p><p>The latter part of Qi Yuan's words also shocked Jiang Ran.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect still had hidden experts? Even stronger than Senior Brother Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>She felt endless remorse in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, Senior Brother Qi Yuan had gotten into conflict with the Black Mountain Sect because of her.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Qi Yuan, for eliminating evil for the people and helping me escape danger!" Jiang Ran thanked him solemnly.</p><p></p><p>She was only at the Qi Refining stage now and didn't even have spirit stones, let alone being able to give a thank-you gift.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." Qi Yuan waved his hand, "Who told the Black Mountain Sect to bully people too much, always secretly plotting to attack me. I couldn't stand it anymore and wiped them out in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>You know, when a common man is pushed to anger, blood will splatter five feet!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran didn't expect there to be such inside information. So the Black Mountain Sect had long been secretly bullying Senior Brother Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Qi Yuan was taking revenge.</p><p></p><p>After thanking him several more times, Jiang Ran headed to a higher part of Seven-Color Peak to look for Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>Now only Qi Yuan's low voice talking to the small grass remained here.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you lack the sun's illumination!" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Golden Core of the Fixed Star in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had entered the Divine Infant realm, the spiritual energy in his dantian was much more abundant than when he was at the Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it took a long time to accumulate spiritual energy to summon the Golden Core of the Fixed Star once.</p><p></p><p>Now it was no longer necessary. He could summon it many times at once.</p><p></p><p>As for Ning Tao's phantom, he could even summon her down to stay by his side constantly.</p><p></p><p>However, now that the Golden Core of the Fixed Star was at a critical moment of devouring the third golden core, Ning Tao couldn't leave easily.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan's plan was to summon Ning Tao to play together after the third Golden Core of the Fixed Star was successfully formed.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe next time we play games, I can also call Ning Tao down to play together.</p><p></p><p>If the new game is set in modern society, that would be great. I could get a marriage certificate together with Xiao Jia and Ning Tao."</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan grew up on Blue Star. Compared to ancient marriage books and contracts, he found it easier to accept a marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I don't have any money. I'm so poor I'm jingling. I'm not afraid of dividing property in a divorce."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Damn heaven, why am I so poor!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was indeed very poor.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blood Robe Alliance had been collecting techniques continuously, which was quick to take effect, it was still just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go to the Dao-Seeking Palace to obtain more techniques, but he had no money to buy them.</p><p></p><p>"If only I could hold a Divine Infant Conference for each Divine Infant I form, I could definitely empty out all the spirit stones of the Divine Infant experts in the Da Shang Kingdom!" Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when holding a Divine Infant Conference, other participating Divine Infant True Lords would bring congratulatory gifts.</p><p></p><p>If he could hold one for each Divine Infant, Qi Yuan would definitely make a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about emptying out the Da Shang Kingdom, the money earned wouldn't be that much, so Qi Yuan killed this idea.</p><p></p><p>"If I could hold Divine Infant Conferences in the Azure Waves Realm that anyone could participate in, holding over four thousand of them, I would definitely be the richest in the Azure Waves Realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fantasized wildly.</p><p></p><p>It was like when he was a child, hoping everyone in the world would give him a dime.</p><p></p><p>This fantasy was even more intense. Not only would everyone give a dime, but they would give it over four thousand times, equivalent to everyone on Blue Star giving over 400 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it would barely match the debt of a certain company.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped this meaningless fantasy. Now on Seven-Color Peak, many cultivators were still building his cement bungalow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked into the distance: "When that dead girl Qi Jianjun comes back, she'll definitely be very surprised to see the house so changed?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, a little girl supported a fishing rod, angling in the large lake ahead.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, a shiny spirit fish was caught, and a brilliant smile appeared in the little girl's eyes.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>About tens of breaths passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks and held his breath.</p><p></p><p>"This is Lü Fei's room, right?"</p><p></p><p>"White Moon, I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood outside the room, his body hidden in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, only the sound of water came from the room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened for a long time, but gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan did not give up, he was very patient.</p><p></p><p>That was a profound-level cultivation technique, and the more profound-level techniques he could find, the more complete his "Qi Yuan Classic" would be.</p><p></p><p>And the more cultivation techniques he mastered, the more it would benefit him.</p><p></p><p>For example, with his eyes, he could see different levels of cultivation techniques and obtain different information, and see different loopholes.</p><p></p><p>For instance, before obtaining the profound-level techniques, when he looked at a jade-level technique, he could see seven loopholes and improve the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the profound-level techniques, when he looked at that jade-level technique again, he could see ten loopholes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even felt that if a heaven-level technique was placed in front of him now, he would not be able to see its loopholes.</p><p></p><p>The more cultivation techniques he understood, the more information he could see.</p><p></p><p>The night grew deeper, and Qi Yuan kept his ears open, listening intently.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the darkness, with people passing by from time to time, but no one noticed his presence.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Has it begun?"</p><p></p><p>He finally heard Lü Fei's inner voice during her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Boundless, qi flowing through the cinnabar field, the emperor's way and..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan widened his eyes, listening carefully, afraid of missing anything.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a satisfied expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Maiden's Profound Cultivation? How malicious!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan obtained the profound-level technique "The Yin Maiden's Profound Cultivation". This technique was worthy of the name of the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate this technique, one needs to cultivate with seven men who are deeply in love with oneself, and kill them at the most passionate moment.</p><p></p><p>"The people on the Blue Star aren't even this miserable, this Lü Fei is simply too much.</p><p></p><p>Not only does she need to lick, but she'll also lose her life while licking! Such a malicious person is not worthy of being my White Moon, the wild wolf is better, he's a rich and handsome man with many cultivation techniques!"</p><p></p><p>After stealing the cultivation technique, Qi Yuan's feelings for Lü Fei instantly disappeared, feeling a sense of ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a man in a black robe appeared in Qi Yuan's sight.</p><p></p><p>"A thief?"</p><p></p><p>"An adulterer?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe entered Lü Fei's room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan crouched outside the room, his thoughts racing.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the man in the black robe gave Qi Yuan a heart-pounding feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Demonic Immortal Elder?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, feeling that it would be better to quickly flee.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he didn't know if he could defeat the Demonic Immortal Elder.</p><p></p><p>If the Demonic Immortal Elder discovered him, he might be in danger, so it's better to flee.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he listened for a while outside the room, found that there seemed to be a technique to isolate sound, and then quietly slipped away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>During these two days, many things happened.</p><p></p><p>The first thing was that this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm was somewhat different from the first Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the first Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, only cultivators under the age of thirty could enter.</p><p></p><p>But in this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, it was discovered in these two days that cultivators over a hundred years old could also enter.</p><p></p><p>This caused a stir.</p><p></p><p>Many princes without the backing of the three major sects united to change the previous rules of the Dragon Seizing Competition, allowing Yuandan cultivators to participate as well.</p><p></p><p>This caused a lot of waves in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Later, a Yuandan Venerable from the Divine Light Sect killed a Yuandan cultivator, and this storm was finally calmed.</p><p></p><p>This proposal was also rejected by the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Seizing Competition would still follow the previous rules.</p><p></p><p>Many princes were dissatisfied, but faced with the three major sects, they were powerless.</p><p></p><p>At this time, countless Foundation Establishment cultivators gathered at the entrance of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Various princes gathered here, some joyful, some worried.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a divine light flashed above the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present felt a suppressive and powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>They saw an old white-haired man appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master!" Kong Fulou quickly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Uncle!" Although Qi Yuan was a killer of old men, he was actually very respectful and caring towards the elderly.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, True Lord Taigang!" All the cultivators on the ground paid their respects, looking at the old man in the sky with awe.</p><p></p><p>Because that old man was the peak master of the Divine Light Sect's Five Lights Peak, the True Lord Taigang! A Demonic Immortal-level expert.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Great Chu, he was considered an absolute top expert.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm has encountered some twists and turns, and cultivators under the age of a hundred can also enter.</p><p></p><p>To prevent some cultivators from sneaking in secretly, this time I will be stationed at the entrance of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm," said True Lord Taigang.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the faces of many princes turned pale, while the three princes supported by the three major sects, especially Dong Xian, showed excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>Originally, his foundation was very shallow, and if people were allowed to sneak in, he would be even further from the throne.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulou stood next to Qi Yuan, with a smug expression: "With Master here, there will surely be no accidents in this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have too much feeling, he was thinking about the mysterious expert who seemed to be a Demonic Immortal that he saw last night, wondering who it was.</p><p></p><p>After about the time of an incense stick, the entrance of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm was completely opened.</p><p></p><p>A huge amount of spiritual energy gushed out, and the originally mundane city outside immediately became filled with a majestic spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual energy permeated the area, and for the next few decades, the spiritual energy here would be quite abundant.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people who live here long-term will have their illnesses disappear and their lifespan extended.</p><p></p><p>Some wandering cultivators will also choose to come here and build their dwellings to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Smells nice." Qi Yuan was not impressed by the spiritual energy here, as it was not as abundant as on the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm opened, a rich floral fragrance permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smelled the thick flower scent.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Dong Xian explained: "The Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm is said to be an external secret realm.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, it drifted to our Great Chu nation.</p><p></p><p>In this secret realm, there are bird songs and flower fragrances, with all kinds of rare flowers and grasses.</p><p></p><p>Centuries ago, when our Great Chu nation's ancestors entered the first secret realm, they once saw a crystal coffin, in which a special being was sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Our ancestors suspected that this special being was the master of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, our ancestors exhausted countless efforts, but could not open the crystal coffin.</p><p></p><p>Even, it seemed to have triggered the formation of the crystal coffin, and that crystal coffin was teleported away.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if in this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, we can see that crystal coffin again.</p><p></p><p>That should be the most precious treasure in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm. Whoever obtains it will immediately become the emperor of Great Chu."</p><p></p><p>This information, Dong Xian partly knew from the imperial archives, and partly from what Elder Qi had told him, such as the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm coming from the external world.</p><p></p><p>After all, Great Chu obtained the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It definitely caught the attention of some other major powers, and powerful figures from outside the realm came to the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm and gave their judgments from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>It was not uncommon for immortal realms from outside the Azure Waves Realm to wander over.</p><p></p><p>"I can only do my best to help you snatch precious treasures." Right now, Qi Yuan was preoccupied with his white moonlight Polang, and was not too concerned about the imperial treasury of the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother." Dong Xian was extremely excited inside, as he knew Qi Yuan's strength was not weak, and that cleaver was a precious treasure. With Qi Yuan holding it, he might be able to contend with Yuandan.</p><p></p><p>If all went well, he had a high probability of winning the championship in the Snatching the Dragon competition.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Elder Qi secretly transmitted a voice message: "You don't need to be too delighted now, that cultivator named Polang, whose foundation is established, is very strong and may be able to ascend to the Eastern Land Genius Ranking, capable of defeating Yuandan in a battle across realms."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Dong Xian heard this and felt somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all the princes began to enter the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother Qi, why have you been so cold to your sister these days?" A licentious voice came, and Lu Fei walked past Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? I don't know you." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Since she was no longer his white moonlight, they were strangers now, and it was best to have no further contact.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not approve of the kind of people who would have a breakup session or even an occasional "friendship session" after a breakup.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fei's smile slightly stiffened, but she still joked, "Junior brother Qi, you really love to tell jokes. Don't you like to look at your sister? Come into the secret realm, and your sister will let you look your fill."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she deliberately lifted her chest, making it look even more voluptuous.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at it, not wanting to look.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even find the sword immortal girl in the game token given by Dong Xian as good-looking.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know you, stop bothering me." Especially after thinking about the terrifying "Yin Female Cultivation Method", Qi Yuan had no desire to get too entangled with Lu Fei.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Fei's smile completely froze: "I'll remember you."</p><p></p><p>The last person who said this to Qi Yuan was Polang.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lu Fei's words, Qi Yuan was quite helpless: "I don't want you to remember me."</p><p></p><p>He just wanted his white moonlight Polang to remember him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fei left angrily, and Qi Yuan saw Polang also enter the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, and he felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that Polang had not entered the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, come with me." Dong Xian said at this time, his face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Kong Fulu also shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, Dong Xian, and Kong Fulu three people entered the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm together.</p><p></p><p>What met their eyes was a forest of birdsong and fragrant flowers.</p><p></p><p>Towering ancient trees, gurgling streams.</p><p></p><p>All the princes were teleported into the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm separately, so it was quiet around Qi Yuan, with only Dong Xian and Kong Fulu.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened the jade slip of his Spirit Flower Sect.</p><p></p><p>He showed a disappointed expression.</p><p></p><p>He could not communicate with the people in the Spirit Flower Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kong Fulu's expression became complicated, and he looked at Dong Xian and slowly said, "There is something I need to tell you."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian heard this and hurriedly said, "Please speak, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>"Your father the Emperor passed away last night.</p><p></p><p>We three major sects have suppressed this news for the time being, to avoid any unexpected incidents in the Snatching the Dragon competition."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was stunned.</p><p></p><p>His father the Emperor had died?</p><p></p><p>Although he had no feelings for his father and had seen him even less than he had seen Elder Mu, he was still his nominal father.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly hearing this, he still felt a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother, for informing me. This will not affect me!" Dong Xian's emotions changed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also had a momentary lapse.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had looked at the old Emperor, and the information prompt showed that the old Emperor had another month to live.</p><p></p><p>But now, in less than two days, he had died.</p><p></p><p>There must be some changes in between...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Sect Master and the Empress were seeking excitement, and were discovered by the old Emperor, so the Sect Master had no choice but to kill the old Emperor? Qi Yuan maliciously speculated.</p><p></p><p>But he immediately discarded this idea, after all, he had no evidence, how could he make such unfounded guesses.</p><p></p><p>No one brought up the matter again, and the white-haired Kong Fulu took a deep breath, the rich spiritual energy entering his mouth: "The spiritual energy here is even stronger than on the Five Light Peak, no wonder the Great Merchant Kingdom was able to rise up instantly when it obtained the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm a thousand years ago."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also agreed with this.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, he felt it was even faster than on the Seven Color Peak. He might even be able to step into the middle stage of Foundation Establishment in just two or three years.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it was still too slow.</p><p></p><p>It was better to just keep killing and fighting in the game.</p><p></p><p>"Where the spiritual energy is abundant, the probability of encountering precious heavenly materials and earthly treasures is also higher. We need to go deeper into the secret realm!" Kong Fulu said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Dong Xian both agreed.</p><p></p><p>The good things in the deeper parts of the secret realm must be more, and Qi Yuan also felt that he would have a greater chance of encountering his white moonlight.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the deepest part of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, there was a gushing of spiritual energy, with misty fog swirling.</p><p></p><p>In a pool of water, the spiritual energy seemed to have solidified into substance, constantly flowing.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the pool, there was a crystal coffin.</p><p></p><p>This crystal coffin, not knowing how many years it had experienced, had an awe-inspiring, moving aura on it.</p><p></p><p>And inside the crystal coffin, there quietly lay... a delicate and exquisite bridal gown.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivators who came here would feel that this bridal gown was not an ordinary garment, but a living being with spirituality.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"There are so many good things here." Qi Yuan wandered in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He stopped in his tracks and picked a mushroom.</p><p></p><p>This mushroom was called the Spirit Spraying Mushroom, which could absorb thin spiritual energy and spray out rich spiritual energy, worth several spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan transformed into a little girl picking mushrooms and quickly picked more than ten of them.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was also tempted, a trace of greed flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm belonged to him, he would definitely have a chance to quickly advance to the Divine Infant Realm, or even have the hope of entering the Purple Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he soon discarded this thought.</p><p></p><p>After all, this second Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm could not be controlled by the imperial family, but belonged to the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go deeper, there must be even better things." Kong Fulu said.</p><p></p><p>The group continued to fly deeper into the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Dong Xian stopped flying: "A corpse?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, there was a corpse.</p><p></p><p>The three of them all stopped.</p><p></p><p>They found three corpses on the ground: "Fifth Brother?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian looked at the man in the python robe and recognized him as his fifth brother at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"The Regretful Dragon Palm?" Dong Xian lifted up his fifth brother's python robe and saw the golden palm print on his abdomen, revealing a disappointed expression.</p><p></p><p>The Regretful Dragon Palm was a secret technique of the Great Merchant imperial family that every prince had to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he found the Regretful Dragon Palm's mark on his fifth brother's body meant that he had been killed by his own brother.</p><p></p><p>Just after entering the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, he encountered such an event, Dong Xian's mood could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu on the side narrowed his eyes, recognizing the other two corpses on the ground.</p>

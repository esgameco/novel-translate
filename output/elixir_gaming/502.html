        <h1>Chapter 502</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The celestial clan where the tattered robe was located had once experienced the erosion of the Dark Sky, and the world was on the verge of collapse, ultimately being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The celestial clan had always pursued the forging of luminous divine treasures, hoping to use them to confront the Dark Sky, but they failed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the tattered robe also gave Qi Yuan a gift, called the Embryo of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the same world?"</p><p></p><p>"Just at different ends of the timeline?"</p><p></p><p>"Or... is it that the forging techniques are not unique to the celestial clan's world?"</p><p></p><p>After all, the forging techniques may not be exclusive to the celestial clan's world.</p><p></p><p>And the forging techniques in this world also came from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"This... can be considered a good thing," </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Am I now considered a venerable immortal who has returned to the city?"</p><p></p><p>"Or a powerful being reborn 500 years in the past, possessing various advanced forging techniques?"</p><p></p><p>During the celestial and earthly anomalies, Qi Yuan had learned many forging techniques, but due to the lack of materials, he had never put them into practice.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the foundational forging techniques and began to study them carefully.</p><p></p><p>"To cast weapons, one must awaken the heart fire..."</p><p></p><p>The forging techniques were not particularly difficult for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>During the celestial and earthly anomalies, he had cultivated many of them.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some differences in the forging techniques of this world, the principles were the same.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grasped them quickly.</p><p></p><p>"The way of casting weapons, the heart fire is the soul.</p><p>The blazing fire, illuminating the furnace, melting all things.</p><p>The heart fire originates from the heart, circulates in the dantian, and is nurtured by the thoughts..."</p><p></p><p>"Rise!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's shout, a weak flame ignited in his heart and burned ever more intensely in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan extended his hand, the flame suddenly burst into a blaze in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Not a celestial technique, an interesting flame."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the white flame, Qi Yuan was somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>In the immortal realm, with a single technique, he could also conjure flames.</p><p></p><p>However, the essence of the two flames was different, and the principles behind their appearance were also different.</p><p></p><p>"There are many great ways in the world, the immortal way in the immortal realm, the martial way of the starry sky, and the way here..."</p><p></p><p>"Old man, go get me some materials, just say I want to forge weapons."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>With the heart fire awakened, it meant that Qi Yuan could now forge weapons.</p><p></p><p>"I need withered wood, mysterious bamboo, and iron saber water..." Qi Yuan told Chen Kangbao what he needed.</p><p></p><p>These materials, according to the forging techniques Qi Yuan had learned in the celestial and earthly anomalies, could be used to forge flying magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>If Shen Lingxuan didn't let him ride in the future, he could ride the flying magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan didn't know if the Shen family had these materials.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't, he could only modify the forging techniques and find alternative materials.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Chen Kangbao swallowed the steamed bun and went out to collect the materials for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then continued to temper his heart fire.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a craftsman is also related to the intensity of their heart fire.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the heart fire is too weak and only burns for a short while, it wouldn't even be able to fry an egg, let alone forge magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao had not yet returned when an uninvited guest arrived in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, this is someone from the Law Enforcement Hall, just answer him casually, don't be nervous."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng brought in a thin-looking middle-aged man, who was a Yellow-ranked Imperial Guard.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and said in a low voice, "Routine matters."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and ask," Qi Yuan had a guess.</p><p></p><p>Probably, Shen Baitai's body had been discovered.</p><p></p><p>If this was leaked out, it would be quite unfavorable for Qi Yuan's current situation.</p><p></p><p>The thin man took out a notebook and a pen.</p><p></p><p>"Did the young master encounter a strange spirit in Ninghe County and have his soul taken away?" the thin man asked.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a faint glow flashed in his eyes, as if he was checking whether Qi Yuan's soul was intact.</p><p></p><p>"I did encounter a strange spirit, but my soul was not taken away. I'm fine," Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>The thin man secretly wrote a few lines in the notebook.</p><p></p><p>"According to observation, the soul is intact.</p><p>In Ninghe County, it seems the soul was not taken away by the strange spirit.</p><p>Communication is smooth, mentally stable."</p><p></p><p>The thin man finished writing and continued to ask, "Yesterday morning, did you have a conflict with Shen Baitai?"</p><p></p><p>"No conflict, I'm just a son-in-law, he wanted to bully me, so I let him bully me," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What brother-in-law, that kid actually wanted to bully you?" Shen Lingfeng angrily said beside him.</p><p></p><p>"How did the young master know that Shen Baitai wanted to bully you?" the thin man asked.</p><p></p><p>"Well... I actually have a superpower, I can hear people's thoughts, and I heard Shen Baitai cursing me in his heart, so I knew he wanted to bully me.</p><p>As a son-in-law, being bullied is normal, right?</p><p>So I went to find him and let him bully me."</p><p>Qi Yuan answered honestly, with a sincere expression.</p><p></p><p>The thin man was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The things Qi Yuan said seemed simple, but when heard, they felt a bit dizzying.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention this superpower?</p><p></p><p>Why should a son-in-law be bullied, and he would actively go to be bullied?</p><p></p><p>He thought for a while, crossed out the "mentally stable" he had recorded earlier, and modified it to "confused thoughts with strong delusions, estimated to be not soul-taken, but psychologically traumatized by the strange spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Last night, Shen Baitai died, found dead in his pond, suspected of being pushed in by someone. Young master... was it you who pushed him?" the thin man had already determined that this matter was unrelated to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, he still asked as a routine inquiry.</p><p></p><p>"No, it wasn't me, I didn't push him!" Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>It really wasn't him who pushed Shen Baitai, Shen Baitai had grabbed him, and then like a green tea character in a palace drama, he fell into the pond by himself, and then tried to frame Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The thin man's pen was flashing across the notebook: "Young master, I'm done asking. Excuse the interruption."</p><p></p><p>The thin man said and then directly left.</p><p></p><p>Shen Baitai's death was shrouded in mystery, even the Imperial Guard at the level of the clan couldn't find any clues.</p><p></p><p>Such a mysterious matter naturally had nothing to do with Qi Yuan, the son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the public conflict between Qi Yuan and Shen Baitai yesterday, they might not have even come to question Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, if anyone bullies you in the future, come find me!" Shen Lingfeng patted his chest, very righteously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "I actually hope someone will bully me. Oh, by the way, go ask your mother when she's going to take a bath, remember to call me."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng heard this and his expression became difficult: "Brother-in-law, I don't dare to help with this."</p><p></p><p>He still had some brains, knowing what kind of favors he could and couldn't do.</p><p></p><p>"Then, help me this time, and I'll teach you some new romantic lines to help you pick up girls!" Qi Yuan also had to pay a price.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's eyes lit up when he heard this: "I'll go ask my mother right away, wait for my good news!"</p><p></p><p>He said and then ran off in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, only Qi Yuan was left.</p><p></p><p>The sun was setting, and night fell.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao returned with many forging materials, but Qi Yuan had not received Shen Lingfeng's good news.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng seemed to have disappeared, not coming back.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the people of this Shen family also don't like to bathe, sigh."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Begin... forging the artifact!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shen mansion, Shen Wanshan sat on the main seat, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"How is he... doing?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei stood beside him, head lowered, and said, "Regarding artifact forging, the young master is quite interested."</p><p></p><p>He told the patriarch about what had happened that day.</p><p></p><p>"Does he have the talent for artifact forging?" Shen Wanshan asked, his tone complex. "I hope he doesn't cut off the inheritance of the Qi family."</p><p></p><p>"This... the path of the artifact master is quite complicated. It depends on whether the young master is willing to study diligently. Talent alone is not enough," Chen Xianwei said tactfully.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, "The young master is already crazy, and you still want me to teach him. Is it even useful?" </p><p></p><p>He had taught the history of artifact forging the entire day, but as for the actual practice, he hadn't taught anything.</p><p></p><p>After all, if a madman really started forging artifacts, Chen was afraid that Qi Yuan would ignite his inner fire before even melting the materials, and end up burning himself.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wanshan saw the difficulty on Chen Xianwei's face. He promised, "Thank you, sir. If Qi Yuan can forge a yellow-grade artifact, I will increase your salary in the Shen household by 40%."</p><p></p><p>"How about 20%? 30% feels a bit uneven, a bit strange," Chen Xianwei felt that 30% was not a nice round number, and it made him uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wanshan's expression was odd. "40%."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Xianwei felt much more at ease. He thought of something and suddenly asked, "Master, I don't know the name of the young master's father, who was also an artifact master. Have I heard of him before?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei was quite curious about Qi Yuan's father's identity. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was able to marry into the Shen family and marry Shen Lingxuan. He must have ridden on the coattails of his father's reputation.</p><p></p><p>His father had already passed away, but he could still bring Qi Yuan such great opportunities. Likely, he was a earth-grade artifact master.</p><p></p><p>But a earth-grade artifact master surnamed Qi, why had Chen never heard of him before?</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chen Xianwei's question, Shen Wanshan's expression slightly changed, as if recalling some old events. "His name has been erased, I don't remember it either."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei's expression also changed abruptly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>To be able to erase a person's name? Such methods?</p><p></p><p>There must be deep waters here.</p><p></p><p>He knew he could not inquire further.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Young master, what is this?" </p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Chen Kangbao looked at the thing Qi Yuan had forged, his expression strange.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a drone." Qi Yuan held the drone, looking quite proud.</p><p></p><p>"Somehow it feels a bit like a fly?" Chen Kangbao muttered.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, I can't forge large drones for now, so I just forged a small one."</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the materials, Qi Yuan had forged all kinds of things in a mess. He did manage to forge a flying artifact.</p><p></p><p>However, since it was his first time, the forged... well, it was almost like a decoration.</p><p></p><p>A tiny drone, the effect it produced was "the power of ten mosquitoes."</p><p></p><p>It was truly a waste.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to Chen Kangbao's calculation, the materials consumed for this drone could have bought thousands of meat buns.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I can still improve." Qi Yuan was not bothered. "To play the role of a god, just forging a drone is not enough. I need to forge grenades, speakers, flashlights, projectors, cameras, lightsabers... </p><p></p><p>Using these things to act godly, the effect will be amazing."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the cameras and other things he forged were also of the otherworldly kind.</p><p></p><p>After all, the rules of this world were slightly different from the Blue Star. It's not just a matter of forging them.</p><p></p><p>This required Qi Yuan to utilize his ability to see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>"We're lacking money to buy materials, right? When I forge some useless artifacts, I can sell them on the black market.</p><p></p><p>For example, the lightsaber, I find it very interesting. Some show-off people will definitely love it, think it's very cool."</p><p></p><p>The materials required for artifact forging were very precious.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's current assets, he couldn't even gather the materials for artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>He was usually very hardworking, and didn't want to keep taking the Shen household's artifact forging materials.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the amount he was taking now was small and not valuable. The Shen household didn't mind, but if it was a large quantity and valuable... the Shen household wouldn't give it to him.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, if the Shen household discovered the artifacts he forged were for acting as a god, then... wouldn't his god-acting be exposed?</p><p></p><p>Those drones, flashlights and other props, he definitely couldn't expose them.</p><p></p><p>Once exposed, the mystery and grandeur of the god would be completely gone, and he would just be a small clown pretending to be a god.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, quickly forge the artifacts, let's sell them and buy buns to eat!" Chen Kangbao's mind was active, his gaze excited.</p><p></p><p>"...Somehow it feels like you've become the master, and I'm the one working for you?" Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>But remembering that Chen Kangbao could still help him carry the spirit stones, he didn't dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>"The artifact forging materials are too scarce. Sigh, am I not a kitchen knife? I wonder if I can melt myself and forge an artifact."</p><p></p><p>The next day, Chen Xianwei taught Qi Yuan again, just like yesterday. The content was still just history.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his view, Qi Yuan was a bit crazy, so it's better not to teach the profound artifact forging techniques for now.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that he was afraid Qi Yuan wouldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The other was that he was afraid Qi Yuan would end up burning himself.</p><p></p><p>Time gradually passed, nearly half a month had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei looked at himself in the mirror, straightened his collar, and walked out of his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped out, he ran into his "arch-rival" Wu Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, hehe, I recently accepted a disciple, and in just half a month, he has already awakened his inner fire. I just went to the Artifact Pavilion to exchange some materials for him, let him get familiar with melting the materials first, before actually forging the artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Wu Zhen spoke with great pride. Awakening the inner fire in half a month was considered quite good among artifact masters. If there were no major problems, he had the potential to become a spirit-grade artifact master.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." Chen Xianwei casually commented.</p><p></p><p>"I saw Qi Yuan at the Artifact Pavilion. I heard he's now learning artifact forging under you. </p><p></p><p>I suppose he has already awakened his inner fire, right? I saw him take a lot of materials." Wu Zhen said with a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>Artifact forging disciples who couldn't forge artifacts would mainly focus on melting materials after first awakening their inner fire.</p><p></p><p>He naturally didn't think Qi Yuan had already awakened his inner fire.</p><p></p><p>He had checked the artifact forging material records, and saw that on Qi Yuan's first day of learning artifact forging, he had someone go to the Artifact Pavilion to withdraw materials.</p><p></p><p>It was very obvious that he was probably just reselling the artifact forging materials.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei's expression changed slightly, then returned to normal. "He is the son-in-law of the Shen family, taking some artifact forging materials is normal."</p><p></p><p>He was also a bit puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In these ten days, he had been teaching Qi Yuan the history of artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had also listened attentively without any objections.</p><p></p><p>So why did he suddenly take artifact forging materials? Was he trying to start practicing? He had to hurry over, lest Qi Yuan forge artifacts incorrectly. Without a master by his side to guide him, if he were to suddenly awaken his inner fire, he might end up burning himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chen Xianwei also felt a bit self-reproachful.</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have taught so much history, he should have formally started teaching Qi Yuan the basics.</p><p></p><p>"I envy you, being able to take the young master of the Shen family as a disciple. In the future, when you rise to great heights, don't forget about me." Wu Zhen chuckled in a sinister tone.</p><p></p><p>He and Chen Xianwei didn't have any real major conflicts, this was just their usual "banter."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

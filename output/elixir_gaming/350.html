        <h1>Chapter 350</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The canary was discussing seriously.</p><p></p><p>No matter what the topic, she could always follow Qi Yuan's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded in agreement: "What you say makes sense. So... fortune or misfortune, it's not caused by me, it may simply be fate."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, whatever you do, it won't be wrong," the canary's beautiful eyes seemed to sparkle like stars.</p><p></p><p>"The same goes for you," Qi Yuan was also good at repeating.</p><p></p><p>He opened other chat apps as well. </p><p></p><p>On them were some miscellaneous useless information, as well as holiday greetings from acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was a classmate who had sent a message seven months ago: "Are you there? I'm a bit short on cash, old classmate."</p><p></p><p>Then a day later, late at night, he sent another message.</p><p></p><p>"You're really materialistic. I didn't actually want to borrow money, I just hadn't been in touch with an old classmate for a long time and was just asking casually..."</p><p></p><p>Followed by a long string of text.</p><p></p><p>Then seven days later, late at night, another message came.</p><p></p><p>"Urgent need, short on cash for turnover, considering we're old classmates, can you lend me some money? Not much, just 30,000!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these messages, Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"What is this all about?"</p><p></p><p>After complaining, Qi Yuan directly blocked and deleted this classmate as a friend.</p><p></p><p>He continued browsing his social media apps.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a private message caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Canary, look at this, do you think this person has a secret crush on me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan handed the phone to the canary.</p><p></p><p>The canary's eyes widened, her previous drowsiness instantly replaced by excitement: "Let this young lady take a look and assess for you!"</p><p></p><p>On Qi Yuan's phone was a private message.</p><p></p><p>This message was received on the day Qi Yuan, the canary, and Little Jia got their marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan had shown off a bit and then ignored it.</p><p></p><p>As a result, someone had sent another message.</p><p></p><p>The message was simple.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on your wedding."</p><p></p><p>Just six words, but Qi Yuan seemed to see through the phone screen to someone on the other end, dejected yet forcing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It must be a secret admirer, otherwise why would they spend money to send me a private message congratulating me on my wedding. </p><p>Sigh, it's not good to be too charming, there are little fangirls everywhere." Qi Yuan's expression was calm, but he seemed a bit annoyed.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was somewhat socially anxious.</p><p></p><p>But his looks and charm were impossible to hide.</p><p></p><p>What if he became an internet celebrity? How troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, they might not be a little fangirl, they could be a little fanboy," the canary opened the person's profile picture and, looking at the past videos of the well-wisher, made her judgment.</p><p></p><p>"A guy?" Qi Yuan was slightly stunned, "A cunning little sissy, how terrifying. This isn't Sichuan, how could I encounter such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt it was inauspicious. </p><p></p><p>His sexual orientation had always been very normal.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not talk about this. Canary, give me some spiritual energy, I want to break through to the Divine Infant realm quickly."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan focused his gaze on the canary's moist lips.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, he couldn't fall behind in martial arts, and naturally couldn't fall behind in the immortal path either.</p><p></p><p>Improving his strength in all aspects would, after all... benefit his true self.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan hadn't put much effort into cultivating the immortal path in this game, treating it rather casually, advancing in realm was still very helpful for him.</p><p></p><p>Even though his Divine Infant wasn't as effortlessly capable of killing mythical beings as those in the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>But it could still easily slay Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The canary looked at Qi Yuan, her fair neck swallowing, and leaned towards him.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy as sweet as the mountains and seas, accompanied by her small fragrant tongue, entered Qi Yuan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, unconsciously wrapping his arms around the canary's waist.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder everyone loves to cultivate immortality, who could resist this feeling?"</p><p></p><p>That night, holding the canary, Qi Yuan officially entered the Divine Infant realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Qi Yuan opened his eyes, a look of joy appearing in them.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, all the Divine Infants have appeared."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked inward at his body, where over four thousand Divine Infants had appeared.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infants were all formed in the Mortal Heart realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that my body in this game is too weak to unleash the power of these Divine Infants."</p><p></p><p>Long ago, Qi Yuan had discovered that his game self was his "spirit".</p><p></p><p>In more common terms, it could be called his soul.</p><p></p><p>But this "soul" was somewhat unusual, no different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>And in each new world, it started out very weak.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan simply called it his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Divine Infants were different from Stellar Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Stellar Golden Core hung in the universe, and could be projected out at any time as long as there was sufficient spiritual power in the body.</p><p></p><p>Divine Infants were different.</p><p></p><p>Their power was too strong.</p><p></p><p>If projected out, his "spirit" couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>So, these Divine Infants currently couldn't be converted into his battle power in this world.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>A profound look appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "This world is truly a large-scale farm for raising divine beings and demons!"</p><p></p><p>The previously encountered Wu Qi, as well as the Yaji siblings found in the Wu Gui country, both had special bloodlines. Qi Yuan could send out the Divine Infants in his body in the form of grandfathers and grandmothers to reside in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>As they grew stronger, Qi Yuan's Divine Infants would also gradually awaken completely, eventually recovering to their original realm, or even advancing further.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that each of Qi Yuan's 4,752 Divine Infants was extremely terrifying, with profound foundations, possessing... the potential to become Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>In fact, ordinary Yang Spirits might just be their starting point.</p><p></p><p>For example, the old Thunder Venerable had once contemplated the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation of the Nine Heavens, and later even contemplated one of the Six Emperors, the Southern Pole Longevity Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This kind of foundation could be said to be unrivaled across all heavens.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, this contemplation was not aimless.</p><p></p><p>What the contemplation method consumed was the mysterious energy from the ruins of an ancient race.</p><p></p><p>Those ruins had an astonishing origin.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirit Venerables could only be considered malnourished, needing to consume divine realm immortal liquid, which was like a mild oral solution for robust growth, to barely develop normally, open up divine realms, and be considered normal children.</p><p></p><p>Well, although the canary had the strength of a great venerable, in that world she would be... hmm, underage? Or perhaps, just come of age.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked inward at himself, with 4,752 Divine Infants suspended in his inner world, extremely dormant.</p><p></p><p>They were like fragile infants, or perhaps embryos.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan knew that if any one of them came out, it could turn this star-spanning world upside down.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to find some hosts for them, to nurture them," Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>If in this world, each of his Divine Infants was nurtured and entered the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying would that be? Would he even need to fight himself?</p><p></p><p>He could directly summon the Divine Infants, and four thousand Yang Spirits would appear at once.</p><p></p><p>You think you're the Yang Spirit of the Supreme Radiance Palace? You think you're the great calamity?</p><p></p><p>You think you're the Yang Spirit of the Demon Clan?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held grudges, this</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three great enemies were currently recorded in the little notebook.</p><p></p><p>"In the world of the bloodline ancestors, there are over a hundred... corpses. </p><p></p><p>Well, as they say, fallen flowers are not unfeeling things, they turn into spring mud to better nurture the flowers.</p><p></p><p>Your descendants have transformed into demon creatures to ambush me.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't you also atone for your descendants' sins? Let them be used to nourish... my divine infant."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the unknown world, corpses and remains lying in various corners all flickered with blood light. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was locating them.</p><p></p><p>His blood and the remnant spirits of the primordial seeds all served as coordinates for positioning.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to send his divine infant over.</p><p></p><p>Those remains were all great tonics, perfect for nourishing the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Countless spiritual energies poured forth, even the sun in the sky seemed to flicker. Qi Yuan exerted all his strength to send the divine infant within his body over.</p><p></p><p>This sending was like smuggling.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the obstacles were still great. Qi Yuan's spiritual energy was continuously consumed.</p><p></p><p>"It's not working, the obstacles are too great, my spiritual energy is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was rarely so serious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had to ask his wife for help.</p><p></p><p>"Goldfinch, lend me some spiritual energy!" At this time, Qi Yuan was especially grateful that Goldfinch was by his side.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also felt that being a kept man was really nice.</p><p></p><p>Especially being kept by such a beauty as Goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, your servant is here." Ning Tao wore a black gauze dress, her delicate figure若隐若现.</p><p></p><p>When she arrived, there was no flirting or banter. Her moist lips directly landed on Qi Yuan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, vast spiritual energy continuously poured in.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt energized, and his kidneys were no longer deficient.</p><p></p><p>The surging spiritual energy continuously dragged the divine infant, smuggling it towards that special world.</p><p></p><p>"Finally... one succeeded, let's do another!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's eyes revealed a happy expression, as if being able to help Qi Yuan solve problems was an extremely joyful thing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Black seawater, extending for who knows how many tens of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>This place was dead silent.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, one could see dilapidated wooden fragments, or tattered robes.</p><p></p><p>However, garbage of this level was probably too lazy to even be picked up by garbage collectors.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the black seawater, ripples suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Following the ripples backwards, a thousand meters away, a bronze ship was slowly sailing.</p><p></p><p>The shape of the bronze ship was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>At the bow of the ship, there was something that looked like a large cannon.</p><p></p><p>The muzzle was covered in layers of bronze rust, having weathered who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>On the bronze ship, there were also five iron chairs, with a fishing rod next to each chair.</p><p></p><p>However, the anglers had long since disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And the fishing lines of the rods were still dangling in the black sea.</p><p></p><p>Following the fishing line, looking through the sea surface, if one looked inside, one would find that... at the end of the fishing line, there were actually... five mummies being fished! No, not mummies, but living beings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the mummies being fished by the lines moved their lips.</p><p></p><p>"The spatial fluctuations are becoming more and more frequent. It seems... the Dawn's Call has advanced again. I'm afraid... it won't be three thousand years before everything... comes to an end."</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was a snake-like creature, its entire body dried up. In the center of its head, there was still a vertical pupil.</p><p></p><p>However, this vertical pupil seemed to have been removed by someone.</p><p></p><p>"Only three thousand years left?" A round, egg-like creature spoke up, its words full of sighs.</p><p></p><p>"East Lord has restarted time and again, giving the world a glimmer of hope, but... is it still impossible to avoid the Dawn's Call?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that East Lord loves so deeply, guarding this dead world alone, yet unable to awaken that one."</p><p></p><p>"Endless illusions, endless fantasies, all to construct one truth."</p><p></p><p>In the deep sea, the voices of these five beings dangling from fishing lines were quite desolate.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, such matters are beyond the involvement of us small Martial Lords. Let's talk about something interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, for some reason, just now, I suddenly caught the scent of my mortal enemy. Strange, it had been missing for 30,000 years, how did its scent suddenly appear?" The snake-like creature asked suspiciously, its words carrying a puzzled tone.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Just now, I also seemed to smell an unusual scent."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that some change has occurred?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." The unidentified creature as fat as an egg shook its head, but when it shook its head, it was as if its entire body was shaking.</p><p></p><p>"Qianyu Martial Lord, I heard that in the Mountain and Sea Scroll, you have a descendant with some talent?" The snake-like creature looked at the egg-shaped creature.</p><p></p><p>This world was called the Origin Land by all Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Land was the source of everything.</p><p></p><p>All living beings, all civilizations, were born in the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>However, a great battle destroyed the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>All living beings perished.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Land also became a forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>It was cut off in the river of time, unknown to anyone.</p><p></p><p>All the Martial Lords were trapped within, unable to be freed, their true names unknown.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that East Lord's most beloved person also perished in this great battle.</p><p></p><p>In order to revive the Origin Land, and also to see his lover again, East Lord used the Mountain and Sea Brush to create the Mountain and Sea Scroll, gathering the power of all the world's Martial Lords to evolve countless worlds.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the End Land, he gathered those with destiny, using the edges of the Origin Land as their base. These destined ones were called Bloodline Bearers by them.</p><p></p><p>These Bloodline Bearers entered the Mountain and Sea Scroll to complete various tasks.</p><p></p><p>All of this was to make the Origin Land flourish again and return to its normal trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Land was the beginning, the Dead Land was the end, the outcome already determined;</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and Sea Scroll was the past, the history, but also had infinite futures; the End Land was the present, which was also the future, and also represented death.</p><p></p><p>East Lord's goal was to find a perfect timeline in the Mountain and Sea Scroll to reshape the past, present, and future.</p><p></p><p>But the time left for them was not much. According to the information left from ancient times, when the Dawn's Call sounded again, the Origin Land, End Land, and Mountain and Sea Scroll would collapse in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this was rumor. Who could say what was truly real?</p><p></p><p>After all, matters of time and space were not for these Martial Lords to consider.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to follow East Lord's plans and execute them.</p><p></p><p>In the battle back then, these Martial Lords were merely on the fringes.</p><p></p><p>The egg-shaped creature nodded: "Mm, the talent is not bad, seems to have already reached the Martial Spirit realm, which is rare."</p><p></p><p>"Nurture him well, he could become a Martial King. If the Dawn's Call can be avoided, you could use him for breeding, to multiply your lineage," the snake-like creature said enviously.</p><p></p><p>For these bloodline ancestors, besides themselves, offspring and descendants were ingrained in their instincts.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a bloodline ancestor depended on themselves, and also on the prosperity of their descendants.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial King realm is just average. If he could step into the Martial Lord realm, he would be qualified to be a second-generation ancestor.</p><p></p><p>However, for him to enter the Martial Lord realm, my realm must improve first, allowing his bloodline to advance and helping him step in.</p><p></p><p>But now we can barely protect ourselves, how could we break through? He also has no chance for his bloodline to advance and enter the Martial Lord realm." The egg-shaped creature said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

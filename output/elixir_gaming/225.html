        <h1>Chapter 225</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Twilight and Fire Lotus, the leader of the Ancient God Alliance sensed an unrivaled aura.</p><p></p><p>This indicated... they were not simply at the fourth step of Treading the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>How could the three great venerable ones of the Ancient God Alliance not be alarmed, feeling this must be an illusion. </p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also watched this scene, shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Kill," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Venerable Twilight and Venerable Fire Lotus no longer held back.</p><p></p><p>Facing their former leader, they were decisive in their killing. Their powerful divine domains erupted at this moment, directly pressing down on the three great venerable ones of the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Ancient God Alliance's face changed drastically: "The fifth step of Treading the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Another great venerable one was terrified.</p><p></p><p>"We're all on the same path, all this fighting and killing isn't good!" One of the Ancient God Alliance's great venerable ones said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, without instructions from Qi Yuan, Venerable Twilight and Venerable Fire Lotus would not show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>Two terrifying divine domains pressed down, instantly water and fire directly and forcefully shattered the divine domains of the three great venerable ones of the Ancient God Alliance!</p><p></p><p>The god Venerable Twilight visualized was the Water Official Great Emperor who Resolves Calamities, controlling all the waters under heaven.</p><p></p><p>How could these three possibly match the divine domain he condensed? These three didn't even have divine offices, and the divine domains they condensed were like hastily assembled porcelain dolls.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of Venerable Twilight and Venerable Fire Lotus, they were full of flaws.</p><p></p><p>In just one breath, the divine domains of the three great venerable ones directly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Their entire bodies were unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>This was not only suppression in realm, but even more so suppression in divine domains.</p><p></p><p>The difference in strength between great venerable ones lies in their divine domains.</p><p></p><p>Divine domains with divine offices and those without are completely different concepts. </p><p></p><p>To make an imperfect analogy, one is like a college student using mathematical formulas to solve problems, mastering the formulas but not knowing their true meaning; the other is like the mathematician who created a certain formula.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the two can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>The divine domains of the three great venerable ones of the Ancient God Alliance shattered.</p><p></p><p>Then powerful divine force swept over, and these three great venerable ones... died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>Fear, shock... various emotions swept across the faces of the ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the corpses of the three great venerable ones, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh: "Sending divine force a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the sentiment is heavy. To repay your kindness, I've decided to eat three extra bowls of white rice today."</p><p></p><p>The deaths of the three great venerable ones didn't cause any ripples in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He even had a good appetite, wanting to eat three bowls of white rice.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the gazes of the other ancient gods present towards Qi Yuan changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's actions had been constantly breaking his understanding.</p><p></p><p>Three great venerable ones... killed just like that.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that even if the three great venerable ones of the Ancient God Alliance had killing intent in their hearts, they didn't directly kill without breaking face.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, on the other hand, didn't say much and killed directly!</p><p></p><p>He still had doubts in his heart - how did Venerable Twilight become a great venerable one, and even... at the fifth step of Treading the Heavens?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the many ancient gods with fearful faces and said softly: "Everyone, don't be afraid. I'm not a bloodthirsty person. They were people from the main hall of the Palace of Light, and had great enmity with me. When I was at Foundation Establishment, they bullied me in every way! But fortunately, one day I turned from slave to master and sang songs, wiping out the Palace of Light! Who knew they would set up their main hall here again, so I had no choice but to kill them ruthlessly. Don't worry, I'm a good person. I never implicate the innocent, nor do I wipe out entire clans."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone present laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun very much wanted to say to Qi Yuan:</p><p></p><p>Brother Qi, do you want to bring a speech draft when you talk in the future? Do you see how your opening and closing statements match? You just said you wiped out the Palace of Light, then immediately said you don't wipe out entire clans?</p><p></p><p>Yuan Kun, the clan leader of the Ancient Ape clan, was sweating profusely: "My grandson offended the Origin Venerable One. The Venerable One killed well, killed wonderfully. I, Yuan Kun, apologize to the Origin Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly changed, and a bone-chilling chill swept over Yuan Kun.</p><p></p><p>He then heard: "The leader of the Ancient God Alliance was your grandson? Could it be... you're a hidden expert?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough!" Yuan Kun hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"So it's the Ancient Ape clan. You scared me. I was thinking today that you haven't come looking for me recently, wondering if you were biding your time to avenge that golden-haired monkey. I was even preparing to bring some great venerable ones and venerable ones to visit your Ancient Ape clan. Don't worry, I have no ill intentions. I was just planning to send a wreath for the golden-haired monkey, and have a meal while I'm at it." Qi Yuan's face was amiable, full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Yuan Kun's face was uglier than crying, and his body couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe a word when the Origin Venerable One said he had no ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>Bringing great venerable ones and venerable ones to send a wreath? Have a meal?</p><p></p><p>More like wiping out the clan!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Kun felt grateful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he came this time.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable One, my entire Ancient Ape clan is willing to submit to you and become your subjects!" Yuan Kun gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>He was mainly afraid the Origin Venerable One would change his mind and wipe out his Ancient Ape clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he killed three great venerable ones of the Ancient God Alliance just like that.</p><p></p><p>He was scared!</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>How come today someone was rushing to be his subjects? In the past, when he recruited true gods as his subjects, he had to beg and plead.</p><p></p><p>Now, an entire clan directly joining? Could it be that his luck was very good today?</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Qi Yuan blinked his eyes, with a smile in them, and looked at the other ancient gods: "What about you?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to test if his luck was good.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun was stunned for a moment, looking at Qi Yuan's bright and amiable smile. A dense chill arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't quite understand Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Was this a fit of madness, or was he threatening them?</p><p></p><p>He recalled the Candle Dragon, Five-clawed Golden Dragon and others that Qi Yuan had mentioned before. He gritted his teeth and said: "My Well Dragon clan is willing to become subjects of the Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately smiled from ear to ear.</p><p></p><p>His luck today really was quite good.</p><p></p><p>"What about you all?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the leaders of the other clans felt grief in their hearts, and also very wronged. Some had other thoughts when they saw Venerable Twilight.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to become subjects of the Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods all swore allegiance one after another.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very pleased: "It seems my luck today really is quite good. It's a pity there's no lottery shop here, otherwise I'd definitely buy a few tickets."</p><p></p><p>The many ancient gods present looked at each other, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Little Seven," Qi Yuan called out at this time.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi in her green dress appeared again. She glanced at the three corpses on the ground, then withdrew her gaze: "Godfather."</p><p></p><p>"Where are the basic information registration forms? These people say they want to become my subjects. Register their information."</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed across Qi Qi's face: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a stack of basic information forms was handed out.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan added: "Remember to register the true gods in your clans who didn't come today as well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Kun hurriedly nodded: "Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with Qi Yuan, all the ancient gods present were extremely fearful.</p><p></p><p>This was a god of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Killing three great venerable ones at the drop of a hat left a deep impression on them.</p><p></p><p>After the forms were filled out, they were handed to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an old man came forward and cautiously asked: "Venerable One, now that war is about to break out in the Azure Eternal Continent, where should we go?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Where to?" </p><p></p><p>An ancient god also spoke up: "The Evil God Army Lord's forces are powerful. We should quickly all move to the North Sea God's Eye and rely on its natural defenses to resist the Evil Gods!"</p><p></p><p>Many ancient gods on the scene debated amongst themselves. Most of them had come here for this matter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan shook his head: "Hiding in the North Sea God's Eye is not my style."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Heavenly Venerable have other arrangements?"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were puzzled, not understanding what Qi Yuan meant.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I have arrangements. I've even made detailed plans for this," Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qi Qi was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Another... plan.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods didn't know about this and looked curious.</p><p></p><p>"What plan?"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of one who rules a domain!"</p><p></p><p>"However, my plan is too intricate, where pulling one thread affects the whole. If it leaks out and the Evil Gods find out, they may be prepared in advance. I'll tell you today's plan now, but you must not leak it," Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>"There's a plan for today too?"</p><p></p><p>"We swear to the heavens we won't leak it!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were very curious about what the plan could be.</p><p></p><p>After all, could there be a better place than the North Sea God's Eye?</p><p></p><p>"Right now my subordinate armies are resting. After half a day's rest, I will deploy all my troops to launch a surprise attack on the Evil Gods' headquarters in Qingheng Continent and wipe them out in one fell swoop! Hmph, they dare to plot against Qingshui Village - they're courting death. As the ancients said, the best defense is offense. They definitely won't expect me to mobilize the entire village's strength to kill all the Evil Gods in Qingheng Continent!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan passionately explained his strategic guidelines and thinking that incorporated "The Art of War".</p><p></p><p>Such a perfect plan would surely make the ancient gods present applaud in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."  </p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's plan truly frightened them.</p><p></p><p>Mobilizing the entire village's strength to counterattack the Evil Gods' headquarters in Qingheng Continent?</p><p></p><p>How... fantastical was this?</p><p></p><p>But fearing Qi Yuan, none of the ancient gods present spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held curiosity: "Is my plan not good? Why aren't you applauding in amazement?"</p><p></p><p>"Amazing," Ye Liuyun said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Kun also said in a muffled voice: "Amazing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods also said "Amazing" one after another.</p><p></p><p>This plan was indeed amazing.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you applauding? Are you afraid of using too much force and breaking the Qingmu table?" Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ye Liuyun couldn't help but say: "Origin Venerable, you weren't serious about your plan just now, were you?"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat familiar with Qi Yuan, so he mustered the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm serious. I've already made the plans. All the villagers say the plan is good and very supportive! You're all newcomers and too weak, so you don't need to participate in this plan. But in a few days, when I counterattack the Heavenly Pillar, you can join then," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Counter...counterattack the Heavenly Pillar? Us?" Yuan Kun looked dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>If the previous plan was called outrageous, what would you call this?</p><p></p><p>Them, this group of weaklings, counterattacking the Heavenly Pillar? </p><p></p><p>Was this suicide? Forget counterattacking the Heavenly Pillar, they'd probably die on the way there.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my plan is very thorough. You just need to be diligent cogs in the machine, following my guidance to turn empty talk into action. From now on, the people of Fanxin will once again become the masters of the Fanxin Realm. We have firm beliefs - gods exist to serve the people, children have good schools to attend, neighborhoods are safe and harmonious, jobs are stable and dignified... We will make the Fanxin Realm great again!" As he spoke, Qi Yuan directly plagiarized the speech of a certain "stable genius" from the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>He was contemplating whether to find time to destroy the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the plagiarism was discovered, it would be somewhat embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan felt these words were very high-level.</p><p></p><p>He got so fired up saying them that he even wanted to go straight to the factory and tighten screws for 24 hours.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods must be very excited now, right?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the silent ancient gods, Qi Yuan said: "I understand, my words were passionate and you need time to digest them. I won't disturb you further."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan's form vanished. He came quickly and left just as fast.</p><p></p><p>At this point, everyone present finally dared to breathe deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Too scary!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan was there, they were intimidated and didn't dare speak freely.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan had left, things were much better.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their minds were in chaos, feeling that today's events were beyond ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Liuyun looked at the Dusk Venerable who had not yet left: "Great Dusk Venerable, are you really going to fight... the Liyang Army Lord today?"</p><p></p><p>A smile flashed in the Dusk Venerable's eyes: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the ancient gods present started breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>It was actually true!</p><p></p><p>"This... isn't this suicide?" an ancient god murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the tall Fire Lotus Venerable spoke up: "If it's suicide, it's the Liyang Army Lord committing suicide."</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Venerable's face was full of longing and awe: "The Venerable's strength is unimaginable. Even that being above True God in the Heavenly Pillar is not fit to tie the Venerable's shoes when facing the Venerable's true form!"</p><p></p><p>The many ancient gods who had received gifts from Qi Yuan had various guesses about Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most widely accepted was that the Venerable was the reincarnation of a supreme powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The gods they observed through their divine sight techniques were all former subordinates of the Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The current Venerable was still very weak, but had great potential.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present looked at each other in confusion, not really understanding the Fire Lotus Venerable's words.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know the Venerable's strength and terrifying nature, so such reactions are normal. But everything the Venerable does, he certainly has the ability to accomplish. Since he dares to counterattack the Liyang Army Lord and destroy the being above True God in the Heavenly Pillar, he must have the capability. Let me tell you just the tip of the iceberg about the Venerable. The falling of the great sun today... did you see it? That great sun, the Venerable said, was his golden core!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"The great sun belongs to the Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"This... how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene were in an uproar, or rather shocked, drawing in sharp breaths.</p><p></p><p>The great sun in the sky... was actually the Origin Venerable's! Doesn't that mean...</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Venerable slowly said at this point: "The Origin Venerable's strength is not even one ten-thousandth of his peak. He may still be in danger facing a being above True God. Actually... I don't know what the outcome will be either. But... isn't this our last chance?"</p><p></p><p>The Fanxin Realm had long since run out of chances.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Myth Plan to escape the Fanxin Realm was just self-deception.</p><p></p><p>In the Fire Lotus Venerable's view, did taking a few people from the Fanxin Realm away mean the Fanxin Realm still existed? This was truly laughable.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable's plan is the only hope for the Fanxin Realm!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 136</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, the weapons pointed forward.</p><p></p><p>Under the formation specially improved by Qi Yuan, the Supreme Ones flowed like steel towards the Ten Thousand Zhang Plain.</p><p></p><p>One hundred thousand Supreme Ones, like heavenly soldiers, crushed all before them. No one could stand against them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current formation was created jointly by all the great Supreme Ones of the Liufeng Realm, then improved by Qi Yuan after he spotted flaws with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this formation far surpassed that used by the Supreme Ones who had besieged Ning Tao before.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mighty, they advanced directly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in mid-air, his red robe more vivid than blood.</p><p></p><p>His face wore a lazy expression: "Now this is... playing a game."</p><p></p><p>Now he finally had the thrill of a pay-to-win player.</p><p></p><p>A group of minions, constantly advancing.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to lift a finger himself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the brutal battles in Di Jue, this was extremely relaxing.</p><p></p><p>Now he truly seemed like a great villain, constantly bombarding the righteous side, overwhelming them with sheer force.</p><p></p><p>Faced with enemies ten times their number, how could the Supreme Ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm dare to truly fight? They had long since scattered and fled.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were already surrounded on all sides by the hundred thousand red-robed Supreme Ones.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred Supreme One camps constantly closed the distance, continuously unleashing primordial divine abilities in long-range attacks.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to cast divine abilities in specific areas, without targeting any particular Supreme One.</p><p></p><p>Using endless divine abilities to forcibly kill those beast race Supreme Ones.</p><p></p><p>The situation was completely one-sided. The Supreme Ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm, viewed as true great enemies by the Liufeng Realm, had absolutely no way to fight back under Qi Yuan's troop surge.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p></p><p>The once lofty and spirited Supreme Ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm felt small and helpless for the first time, utterly confused and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Their cries were drowned out by the primordial divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>These Supreme Ones had no idea how to break through the defenses, nor which divine ability they should try to block.</p><p></p><p>There were too many.</p><p></p><p>Too many.</p><p></p><p>Far too many.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a hundred thousand Supreme Ones steamrolled the Supreme Ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm. Countless died.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Zhang Plain was blasted into an abyss.</p><p></p><p>Here, the primordial energy was incomparably dense.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Supreme Ones would likely perish just by entering.</p><p></p><p>Like a battlefield after a nuclear weapon leak, no living being could enter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in mid-air in his long robe.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's face showed intense guilt: "Blood Lord, the Venerable One... has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>At this time, he did not call Qi Yuan "big brother", but "Blood Lord".</p><p></p><p>Now that almost all great enemies had been crushed and killed, only the Venerable One's whereabouts were unknown.</p><p></p><p>It was too strange that the Venerable One had inexplicably vanished under the advance and encirclement of a hundred thousand Supreme Ones.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was not surprised. His eyes held a smile: "It seems the final boss has some skills to be the final boss after all.</p><p></p><p>As for her... she should probably be... there!"</p><p></p><p>He already roughly knew Shang Yanran's identity.</p><p></p><p>Indeed... she was a tricky boss.</p><p></p><p>But that was only for others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze pierced an extremely long distance, seeming to pass through time itself, landing on the Liufeng Realm's final stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>The army of a hundred thousand blood-robed Supreme Ones charged towards the final stronghold together.</p><p></p><p>This scene was incomparably magnificent, even... terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Ones in the stronghold had lived most of their lives. What scenes had they not witnessed?</p><p></p><p>But this scene, they truly had never seen before!</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought the final battle would be the most horrifying battle.</p><p></p><p>They might have to fight to the last drop of blood for the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, in the final battle, they would have no part to play at all.</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand Supreme Ones charged towards the Myriad Beasts Gate, directly overwhelming the Supreme Ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was truly... inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>And now, the blood-robed army, like a cloud of blood, was sweeping towards them.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the vast and orderly military formation had arrived before the city.</p><p></p><p>The army parted neatly, and a blood-red figure emerged from within. All the Supreme Ones looked at that blood-colored figure, their eyes filled with intense reverence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the black-dressed young woman in the distance.</p><p></p><p>His gaze softened considerably: "I've come."</p><p></p><p>This time, unlike in the first world, no accidents occurred.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be speaking to the young woman, and also to the others in the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The young woman Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan. For the first time, her steps faltered. A thousand words in her heart finally became one sentence: "I've been waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Today she wore light makeup and had specially changed into black stockings.</p><p></p><p>Under the black lace dress, the young woman's figure looked especially petite, tiny. The jade bowls on her chest, not big or small, were exquisite. Her slender white legs, wrapped in black stockings, were like a yandere girl who had walked out of an anime.</p><p></p><p>Her skin was very white, cold white, seeming to match her personality.</p><p></p><p>But she seemed out of place in this world.</p><p></p><p>In her, Qi Yuan saw the shadow of a canary.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a coquettish voice came from within the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Great Demon, actually making me lose one life."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was none other than the Venerable One who had vanished earlier.</p><p></p><p>She had appeared inside the stronghold!</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>"How is she here!"</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of Supreme Ones in the stronghold were all shocked, and also extremely wary of the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One hiding in the stronghold was using them as shields.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One's strength was incredibly powerful, only slightly inferior to the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But of course she could not withstand the siege of a hundred thousand Supreme Ones alone.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was mixed among the Supreme Ones, making the Blood Lord hesitate to attack.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Shang Yanran: "Actually, I really want you to die now, but... I'm somewhat reluctant."</p><p></p><p>If Shang Yanran died, the game would end.</p><p></p><p>Every time a game ended, Qi Yuan felt somewhat melancholy.</p><p></p><p>It was like finishing a manga he had been following, or a TV show ending.</p><p></p><p>Having stayed in the Liufeng Realm for so many years, even longer than in the Canglan Realm, he had grown somewhat accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran did not understand Qi Yuan's words, but she also said: "I feel the same way about my teacher. I hope teacher could perish, yet also hope... teacher could remain in this world."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she seemed especially wistful.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Yayi's eyes flashed with anger: "Shang Yanran, how can you be so shameless? Now that the situation is decided, what more do you have to say?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's expression was calm as she looked at Qi Yuan: "I have always believed that justice will triumph over evil!"</p><p></p><p>"Hah, you're justice? That's utterly ridiculous!" Ling Yayi cursed.</p><p></p><p>Though called demons, the Thirteen Northern Demons had not committed every evil deed, despite killing many pursuers.</p><p></p><p>"Everything I've done has been for the Liufeng Realm. I have no regrets!" Shang Yanran's expression was frank. "Ask Baize, which of my actions was not for the Liufeng Realm, for all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>Her voice became passionate and stirring.</p><p></p><p>A hint of a mocking smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Is the final boss trying to whitewash herself before death, to perfect her character?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran ignored Qi Yuan's words and looked towards Baize, questioning: "Wasn't the North-South decision to eliminate demonic qi? Wasn't luring the Supreme Ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm to suppress demonic qi?"</p><p></p><p>Baize was silent for a long while before saying: "Yanran, your methods were too extreme."</p><p></p><p>"If I wasn't extreme, if I didn't play the villain, the Liufeng Realm would have been finished long ago! Ten thousand years ago, I sacrificed one life to send out nearly three thousand elderly Supreme Ones!</p><p></p><p>Now, it's me again, actively becoming the sinner to build your reputation, Baize!" Shang Yanran's voice was hysterical.</p><p></p><p>"Once the amount of demonic qi in this world reaches a certain threshold, the Liufeng Realm... will truly collapse. Even the Heavenly Dao will be truly polluted! This realm will become a true paradise for demonic qi."</p><p></p><p>Baize remained silent.</p><p></p><p>A pained expression appeared on Shang Yanran's face: "You, Baize, were unwilling to kill, unwilling to kill Supreme Ones, so I did the killing.</p><p></p><p>But what's the result... Baize, look, who is truly the sinner of this world.</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand Supreme Ones... what a grand gesture, an enormous gesture!</p><p></p><p>Do you think these hundred thousand Supreme Ones will peacefully pass away? If even one-tenth... are unwilling to pass away peacefully.</p><p></p><p>This realm is already abandoned by the gods. The Heavenly Dao will be polluted in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, all Supreme Ones, including you and me, will turn into demonic qi."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran looked at everyone, her expression agitated.</p><p></p><p>"So tell me, who is the true Great Demon, who is the true great villain bringing calamity to all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she stared straight at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As if saying he was the true sinner.</p><p></p><p>While she was the pitiful, misunderstood kind-hearted flower.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings present were all shaken by her words. Could it be that what the Venerable One said was all true?</p><p></p><p>Everything she had done was just to eliminate demonic evil and prevent the Liufeng Realm from truly... perishing.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the White Emperor, as if wanting to get an answer from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>A complex expression flashed in the White Emperor's eyes: "Once the number of demonic evils in this realm reaches a certain amount... the Liufeng Realm will indeed truly fall. </p><p></p><p>This was the warning from the Heavenly Dao, information I received when I was granted the Heartless Lotus."</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings present all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Even among the Thirteen Northern Demon Beasts, the supreme being who had objections to Shang Yanran was now conflicted and hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Why wasn't this matter announced and made public?" a great supreme being couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's face was cold: "Human nature... is selfish. What use would it be to make it public?</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't want to be the one to die of old age?</p><p></p><p>Would everyone really be selfless and sacrifice themselves for the sake of the world?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some people, knowing this, would deliberately create large numbers of demonic evils.</p><p></p><p>As long as people are selfish, this world... will ultimately head towards destruction."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Shang Yanran looked at Qi Yuan: "Master, are the 100,000 people behind you... all selfless people willing to sacrifice themselves?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ze also looked up at the 100,000 supreme beings in the sky, his expression bewildered.</p><p></p><p>The demonic evils spawned by 100,000 supreme beings... would be enough to truly destroy the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shang Yanran's words, the 100,000 supreme beings behind Qi Yuan also experienced a moment of confusion and emotion.</p><p></p><p>An expression of endless hesitation and sorrow appeared on Shang Yanran's face: "Fortunately, the reincarnations of the Great Demon and the Demon Woman have already been found.</p><p></p><p>The demonic evils of the Liufeng Realm all began with the Great Demon and Demon Woman, and should also end with them."</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan and Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>As if saying these two were the reincarnations of the Great Demon and Demon Woman.</p><p></p><p>Only with their deaths could the Liufeng Realm be at peace.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, following Shang Yanran's words, the gazes of everyone present towards Qi Yuan changed.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Qi Yuan was truly the Great Demon, then the calamities of this realm originated from him.</p><p></p><p>Only with his death could this world be at peace.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme beings would no longer have to worry about dying of old age.</p><p></p><p>With one speech, Shang Yanran had sown discord in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her words also contained a hint of bewitchment.</p><p></p><p>Many people seemed to have been influenced by her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "Manipulating people's hearts, how interesting.</p><p></p><p>You lecture me about human nature, about depth, trying to morally bind me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body emanated a surging blood energy.</p><p></p><p>"Today I'll show you what so-called human nature is... nothing more than this.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful thing in the world is... strength!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan addressed the 100,000 supreme beings behind him: "Am I the Great Demon?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of confusion appeared in the eyes of the 100,000 supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun and Chen Huan hurriedly shouted: "The Blood Lord is not the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Remembering the Blood Lord's terrifying power, that supreme origin divine ability that killed supreme beings like slaughtering chickens, the 100,000 supreme beings behind him no longer hesitated and shouted in unison.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord is not the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The sound rolled and echoed within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in mid-air: "You see, this is what true popular will is! What bullshit about the big picture, what about all living beings! I am the big picture!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes held a contemptuous look.</p><p></p><p>"The many supreme beings of the Blood Palace fear me, are afraid of me, even want to kill me, so what? Now they still obediently serve me!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was like an arrogant and domineering great villain.</p><p></p><p>Yet, no one could do anything about him.</p><p></p><p>"Calling a deer a horse, how interesting." Qi Yuan raised his palm, "Shang Yanran is the Great Demon."</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan and Yang Hun understood Qi Yuan's meaning and hurriedly shouted: "Shang Yanran is the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The 100,000 supreme beings behind him also quickly shouted in unison: "Shang Yanran is the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The sound was like the roaring of mountains and seas, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed ridiculous, yet was enough to shock people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"You see?" Qi Yuan pointed at the supreme beings all around, "This is what popular will is!"</p><p></p><p>For the first time, a hint of urgency appeared in the depths of Shang Yanran's heart.</p><p></p><p>She had manipulated people's hearts and sunk into various realms, yet she had never seen someone like Qi Yuan before.</p><p></p><p>However, she still did not lose courage: "Master, when you were the Great Demon, you once killed your most beloved Demon Woman for the sake of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>At the ends of the earth, to contain the demonic evils, you entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons alone, sacrificing yourself to feed the demons.</p><p></p><p>Today, can you also sacrifice yourself for the sake of this world, for the billions of living beings in the Liufeng Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran spoke righteously, her voice full of incitement, spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile on Qi Yuan's face grew: "You're even more nauseating than the Palace of Light, still trying to morally bind me?"</p><p></p><p>"I know these words may be too selfish, but for the sake of the world, for the big picture, I'm willing to be the villain and say such things!" Shang Yanran continued.</p><p></p><p>The disgust on Qi Yuan's face grew stronger. Since coming to this world, it was the first time he used vulgar language.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, still blabbering on, I'll chop you to death!"</p><p></p><p>"I have no manners, I'm a college student, I don't care about the big picture!"</p><p></p><p>With a shake of Qi Yuan's hand, the blood-colored long sword in Ning Tao's hand returned to his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Holding the long sword, he swung it towards Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan had long since reached the limit of this world.</p><p></p><p>As the sword struck out, endless desire erupted in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even in Shang Yanran's eyes, a moved expression appeared.</p><p></p><p>Because this body of hers originated from this world, it could also be affected by heart demons.</p><p></p><p>As the sword struck out, Qi Yuan's invincible supreme origin divine ability was not as smooth as before.</p><p></p><p>One sword only wounded Shang Yanran, and did not draw out her heart demon.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's face turned pale. She severed her own arm to neutralize this supreme origin divine ability, and couldn't help shouting: "Bai Ze, why aren't you making your move? Only by killing the Great Demon can this world truly be at peace!"</p><p></p><p>In the stronghold, Bai Ze's eyes were filled with endless hesitation and conflict.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of the world, the Buddha once killed his most beloved Demon Woman.</p><p></p><p>Now, if you kill the Great Demon, Master will not blame you.</p><p></p><p>The one before you now is not Master at all, but the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Killing the Great Demon is also Master's dying wish!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ze stood motionless in the stronghold. In his heart, myriad emotions flashed by, constantly struggling. A terrifying aura emanated from the Heartless Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan sensed a hint of danger.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze also fell on the Heartless Lotus, a trace of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Dusty Great Sun Golden Lotus, the relic formed after the Great Sun Light Buddha's nirvana, can mold a flawless golden body of glazed tile.</p><p></p><p>Its power is infinite. Once it truly manifests in the world, it can incinerate everything in the world.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Great Sun Golden Lotus at this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>His supreme origin divine ability was forgetfulness, the Great Forgetfulness Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>It required remembering all past events in his heart, then forgetting them, then recalling them again.</p><p></p><p>The plot of this world's game had been recalled countless times in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were many puzzling points and plot holes.</p><p></p><p>Back then, on Mount Jiupan, he had instructed Bai Ze and Shang Yanran to investigate the matter of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and report back to him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he glanced at Bai Ze, and the information presented in his eyes was that Bai Ze was a monk.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but smile at Bai Ze and Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>Later, through the Destiny Stone Tablet, he finally confirmed that Shang Yanran was the spirit of the Destiny Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>And there had once been a great Buddha who enlightened the Destiny Stone Tablet, which was also the Deception Tablet.</p><p></p><p>He then became certain in his heart that Shang Yanran was the Demon Woman, and also the Deception Tablet.</p><p></p><p>And his disciple Bai Ze was the former Buddha, the former demon.</p><p></p><p>The source of all demonic evils.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still one thing Qi Yuan didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>What was Shang Yanran doing all this for? Could it be just to make the Buddha fall and turn into the Great Demon?</p><p></p><p>If so.</p><p></p><p>She only needed to release the information that Bai Ze was the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>Then wouldn't Bai Ze fall?</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the Great Sun Golden Lotus at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He completely understood.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's target had always been only the Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't dare push too hard, didn't dare to truly face Bai Ze.</p><p></p><p>Once Bai Ze awakened the memories of being the Great Demon, perhaps Bai Ze would become the Great Demon again.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the dusty Great Sun Golden Lotus would incinerate everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>The demonized Bai Ze would, like the former Great Demon, kill the Demon Woman again.</p><p></p><p>The Liufeng Realm would be completely destroyed, and even she, as the Destiny Stone Tablet, would not be spared.</p><p></p><p>So she changed her approach.</p><p></p><p>She identified Ning Tao as the Demon Woman and the Blood Lord as the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>She forced Bai Ze to make a move against the Blood Lord and Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened to Yuan Qi's impassioned speech for a long time before saying: "I guard No Return City, which has nothing to do with Great Xia. Simply because I am the guardian of No Return City."</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to receive favors from others for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Qi was momentarily confused. </p><p></p><p>But he quickly understood.</p><p></p><p>This guardian must be the type of person who cares for all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Though not originally from Great Xia, he was unwilling to see the southern lands fall into northern hands, so he came alone to the Central Plains to guard No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Not confined by small families or small countries, but for all living beings under heaven.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a great cultivator! Yuan Qi's respect grew even greater.</p><p></p><p>However, he thought of his own brother, and finally asked in a deep voice: "When you arrived at No Return City, did you happen to see any Great Xia soldiers from the Song Regiment?"</p><p></p><p>"Not long after I arrived, two ordinary soldiers from the Song Regiment came here. </p><p></p><p>They said they had encountered an attack on the road, their entire army was wiped out, and only the two of them escaped with severe injuries. In the end... they didn't last more than a few days before dying in No Return City," Qi Yuan recalled those two men.</p><p></p><p>One was called Zhang Sheng, the other Chen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>If they had changed their names, perhaps their fate would have been different, Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"They are buried deep within No Return City."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Qi felt heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>He had already guessed this before coming.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the reality made his heart ache even more.</p><p></p><p>His grandfather, his father, his elder brother - three generations of his family had all died in No Return City.</p><p></p><p>"What you're carrying on your back must be Daughter's Fragrance wine, right?" Qi Yuan smelled a faint wine aroma.</p><p></p><p>"That's correct," Yuan Qi replied in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He had traveled thousands of miles to No Return City just to let the soldiers here taste their hometown wine again, to let them know that Great Xia had not forgotten them.</p><p></p><p>"When Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao came here, the wine they drank had gone bad.</p><p></p><p>It's good that you've brought good wine, you can go offer some to them," Qi Yuan still remembered the Daughter's Fragrance wine Chen Jiao had raised before dying - it really didn't taste good.</p><p></p><p>Probably only Chen Jiao and Zhang Sheng could drink it with relish.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first offer a cup to you, sir," Yuan Qi said, about to take down the wine he was carrying.</p><p></p><p>"I don't drink," Qi Yuan said, then flew up onto the city wall. He gazed out at the vast desert in the distance and said loudly, "In the future, you people from Great Xia should stop coming to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>I guard this place, it's as solid as iron, no one can steal my home.</p><p></p><p>If you must come, just bring some military flags."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know how many years he would guard this place.</p><p></p><p>It was always good to have more military flags come.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they couldn't attract demons, that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Qi felt a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the thin figure on the city wall and bowed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>On the road to No Return City, he had never thought about returning.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know which day the city might fall and everyone perish, but he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qielan City, Guardian Dong Long's face was covered in a beard, his hair mostly gray.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the majestic giant city wall, the military flags of Great Sui erected, fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The guardian looked at Liu Wentai, surprise in his eyes: "He's unwilling to come?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian of Qielan City was truly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Great Xia was a small country, its national strength not even a tenth of Great Sui's.</p><p></p><p>In over ten years, Great Xia had lost No Return City and was about to be annexed by Great Sui.</p><p></p><p>Now, No Return City had a new guardian, and a national protector at that. Dong Long naturally had thoughts of winning him over.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Since the other party was unwilling to come, Dong Long couldn't force it.</p><p></p><p>One person guarding a city, without support or supplies, would eventually be overwhelmed by the increasingly powerful demon armies.</p><p></p><p>He lamented the passing of a hero.</p><p></p><p>"You may go." Since he wouldn't come, Dong Long stopped considering it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was organizing a large army to counterattack Misang, and had reached a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>He was determined to kill Misang and the other demon controllers.</p><p></p><p>When this matter was finished, he could return to Great Sui once. When he left the capital, his granddaughter had just been born. This time when he returned, his great-grandson, whom he had never met, was probably about to get married.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Kill! </p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Below No Return City, Qi Yuan held his sword, facing an army of over a thousand demons ahead.</p><p></p><p>His eyes blazed red as he continuously slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Powerful demons were like laughable weeds in Qi Yuan's hands, constantly harvested by his broken sword.</p><p></p><p>The experience bar was skyrocketing.</p><p></p><p>Demon essence was also continuously accumulating.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed that, perhaps due to the demon essence, he became more and more excited as he killed, as if thirsting for blood.</p><p></p><p>He was like a cold-blooded, emotionless war machine, going in and out of the demon army. In less than half an hour,</p><p></p><p>The demon army of over a thousand was completely annihilated by him.</p><p></p><p>"Work's done!" As usual, Qi Yuan blew the blood off his broken sword, then returned to the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The city wall stood tall and majestic. Since Qi Yuan began guarding it, no demons had climbed up again.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Yuan Qi looked at Qi Yuan, as valiant as a god descending, his eyes full of respect.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations sir, for repelling the enemy again and slaying over a thousand demons!"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just exercising my skills a bit." Qi Yuan glanced at Yuan Qi beside him.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi had been in No Return City for three years now. His face was much more cracked and yellowed than when they first met.</p><p></p><p>The once handsome young man had become a weather-beaten middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, there's more good news. Just yesterday, Guardian Dong Long of Qielan City besieged Misang and dealt a heavy blow to the demon army. Misang fled with severe injuries. This area will have several years of peace." Yuan Qi said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he also deeply admired Guardian Dong Long of Qielan City.</p><p></p><p>After all, Great Xia's attempts to guard No Return City had all ended in total annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Yet Qielan City had successfully counterattacked! How could it not be inspiring! Now that Misang was severely injured, the pressure on No Return City would also be lessened.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression didn't change at all: "I hope more of the fleeing demon armies come to No Return City."</p><p></p><p>Such exciting news didn't affect him at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the smile faded from Yuan Qi's face.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, the world turning pitch black.</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear again.</p><p></p><p>"You're becoming more and more like a demon."</p><p></p><p>In the underground palace, Ning Tao's pale face showed deep fatigue.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, whom she had trapped, with a particularly complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Do I really resemble a demon that much?" Qi Yuan's consciousness shifted from No Return City to that mass of flesh.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that you resemble one, you are one." Hearing Qi Yuan's voice, a smile appeared on Ning Tao's small face. "I'm increasingly suspicious that you are the legendary Blood Demon that plagues the world."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was smiling, as if proud of knowing Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm the Blood Demon, and you've trapped me here, doesn't that mean it's very dangerous for you?" Qi Yuan said. "Let's make a deal, you let me out."</p><p></p><p>"If I let you out, wouldn't that be giving you what you want, to go plague the world?" Ning Tao smiled charmingly. "I'm petty, I don't want you to harm everyone, I only want you to harm me alone."</p><p></p><p>"You actually don't trust my character. Although I can't compare to moral paragons, I often help others.</p><p></p><p>That Blood Demon, plaguing the world stuff, it's all made up.</p><p></p><p>Harm you? I'm sitting here virtuously</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Liuxia Hui!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable One is the number one person in the North, one of the two strongest beings in this world. How could her words be false?" Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan, "Be a good boy and listen, if you don't obey, I'll hand you over to the Venerable One. Then, you'll never see your charming little wife again."</p><p></p><p>"Not seeing her would be great," Qi Yuan said immediately.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the influence of the Source of Sin or not, every time Ning Tao appeared before him in a black dress and black stockings, the scene of him tearing open his junior sister Jiang Lingsu's dress that day would float into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that image had mutated.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he tear Jiang Lingsu's dress to shreds, but he also pinned Ning Tao against the wall, took off her stockings, and wrapped them around Jiang Lingsu's jade legs.</p><p></p><p>Besides lust, the other six sins of the Source of Sin were also affecting Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Especially when his consciousness entered this flesh that housed it, these seven deadly sins were amplified.</p><p></p><p>Not seeing Ning Tao might mean strange images wouldn't appear in his mind, which would be good.</p><p></p><p>Of course, today Ning Tao wasn't wearing stockings. Her delicate white feet were wrapped in gossamer-thin silk socks, her small and exquisite jade feet could be held in one palm.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really want to leave me here alone, unbearably lonely, for hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years?" Ning Tao stared at Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with intense possessiveness.</p><p></p><p>"If I really were a blood demon, leaving me here would be your downfall," Qi Yuan retorted. "All the supreme beings in the North would probably not spare you."</p><p></p><p>Ever since he started cultivating the "Qi Yuan Scripture", Qi Yuan had a feeling of being the only sober person among drunkards. The more he looked at anyone, the more he felt there was something wrong with their heads.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a frost flashed across Ning Tao's slender and somewhat cold eyes: "I summoned you, only I can decide your fate. If others want to kill you, they'll have to ask me first."</p><p></p><p>"You're really wasting your talents not playing the role of a domineering female CEO," Qi Yuan quipped weakly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five years later.</p><p></p><p>At the Northern Demon Control Camp.</p><p></p><p>A burly man in iron armor appeared, making the ground shake.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Mi Sang in the distance with a mocking expression: "What a waste. The land of Yu Province has nine cities, and you still couldn't conquer them after fighting for so many years. Instead, you were severely injured and fled in disgrace. You're really a disgrace to our Northern lands."</p><p></p><p>The burly man in iron armor laughed, and his subordinates all burst into laughter as well.</p><p></p><p>Mi Sang's face darkened: "The land of Yu Province is powerful, it's not easy to conquer."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, useless people shouldn't make excuses for themselves," the burly man in iron armor said. "Not to mention Qielan City, even the weakest Wugui City, with only one Guardian defending it, you couldn't take it. It's truly laughable."</p><p></p><p>When Mi Sang heard about Wugui City, a look of fear flashed in his eyes: "Wugui City is not that simple. That Guardian is not an ordinary Guardian.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong, apart from you, none of your subordinates are a match for that Guardian.</p><p></p><p>Even if you were given ten years, you couldn't take Wugui City."</p><p></p><p>"Mi Sang, you'd better stay here and recover. If you can't take the land of Yu Province, I, Wu Tong, will!" Wu Tong said, then strode away with his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>In the room, it took a long time for the gloomy expression on Mi Sang's face to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, an unremarkable-looking woman angrily said: "Wu Tong is too much!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mi Sang didn't get angry. Instead, a relaxed expression appeared on his face: "Don't curse him, I should thank him properly for going to Yu Province in my place, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>The unremarkable woman heard this and looked confused, not understanding her master's meaning.</p><p></p><p>Mi Sang looked at the woman and slowly said: "Do you really think I'm no match for that Dong Long from Qielan City?"</p><p></p><p>"Master is wise and powerful, taking down Dong Long would naturally be a small matter. It was Dong Long who sent people to ambush you..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mi Sang looked somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, there were too few clever people in this world, and not many who understood him.</p><p></p><p>"My defeat to Dong Long was intentional, in order to leave the land of Yu Province," Mi Sang said arrogantly. "The land of Yu Province is a deadly place. Wu Tong going there... hehe... he will surely die."</p><p></p><p>The unremarkable woman heard this with a look of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong was at the peak of Guardian level, just one step away from becoming a Terrestrial Myth.</p><p></p><p>Mi Sang continued: "Do you remember the Guardian of Wugui City?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a hateful expression appeared on the unremarkable woman's face: "The Seven Rainbow Sisters all died at his hands!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Rainbow Sisters were Mi Sang's right-hand women.</p><p></p><p>At first, the weakest, Caixia, was sent to attack Wugui City, but she didn't return, dying in Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>Later, Caixia's sister Caiyi led a stronger demonic force to go, but also perished outside Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>After that, two more of Caixia's sisters went, and still died.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Caixia's eldest, second, and third sisters went together. These were two Guardians, along with many powerful demonic forces, but they still didn't return.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a case of sending bigger forces after the small ones were defeated, and then sending the oldest after the big ones were defeated.</p><p></p><p>When Mi Sang, who had just come out of seclusion, learned of the annihilation of the Seven Rainbow Sisters, he found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>At first, he also wanted to send troops to destroy Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>But later, he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He investigated the whole story thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>He came to a terrifying conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"When the Guardian of Wugui City first arrived, he was just an Overlord-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But in just a few short years, he grew stronger with each battle, becoming a Guardian, and not just an ordinary Guardian! Such a person has great fortune on him. He must be killed in one strike, otherwise, going to die one by one like the Seven Rainbow Sisters will only become his stepping stone!" Mi Sang was very cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Is he really that powerful?" The unremarkable woman thought of something and quickly asked, "Why didn't Master gather a great army of demons to kill him while he was still weak?"</p><p></p><p>Mi Sang gave the woman a sideways glance.</p><p></p><p>How would I have known who he was when he was weak? Now, that Guardian of Wugui City has already established his power.</p><p></p><p>If he sent a great demon army now, who knows if he wouldn't end up like the Seven Rainbow Sisters? He looked at the sky and suddenly said: "Do you know about the number one person in the South, the White Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"I know, he's as powerful as the Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>"Dozens of years ago, a group of disciples left the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>These imperial children were ordered by the White Emperor to come to the Ten Thousand Eight Thousand Cities to gain experience.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian of Wugui City has great fortune and grows stronger with each battle. I suspect he is a disciple of the White Emperor." Mi Sang shared his speculation.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he attacked Qielan City, deliberately rushing to his death, and finally fleeing the battlefield severely injured.</p><p></p><p>He left that troublesome land of Yu Province.</p><p></p><p>"A disciple of the White Emperor?" An excited look appeared in the unremarkable woman's eyes, "If we capture him, wouldn't that be a huge gain?"</p><p></p><p>She was very excited.</p><p></p><p>That was a disciple of the number one person in the South. If they captured him, even the Supreme Ones might personally receive her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mi Sang was somewhat speechless: "I shouldn't have told you these things. With your brain, it's probably hard for you to understand.</p><p></p><p>Is there any use in capturing a disciple of the White Emperor? Moreover, is the relationship between the White Emperor and the Venerable One really as simple as just being enemies?</p><p></p><p>We'd better not meddle in the affairs of great figures."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the unremarkable woman looked aggrieved, not knowing where she had gone wrong.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: There's a funeral in the family, I'm on my way back to my hometown. Updates might be unstable for the next few days, sorry.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 551</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dozens of henchmen wielding weapons rushed forward, like a group of gangsters.</p><p></p><p>"You're the one who's crazy!" Qi Yuan stood in the middle of the road, holding a hoe handle, looking like a fierce bandit.</p><p></p><p>In the neighboring courtyard, Wu Xiang looked anxious: "What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>The situation was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Now that the members of the Blood Tiger Gang were blocked, it was the best time for them to escape.</p><p></p><p>But this did not fit his indecisive nature.</p><p></p><p>He would get entangled and stay that way for half a day.</p><p></p><p>During the time he was entangled, Qi Yuan charged into the crowd with the hoe handle.</p><p></p><p>"All who obstruct my path to divinity are my enemies!"</p><p></p><p>In order to achieve this divine transformation, after arriving in the Kuijin Realm, Qi Yuan had specifically asked Chen Kang and Shen Lingxuan to keep their distance and not contact him for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After all, this divine transformation was related to entering the realm of the Ancestor Gods.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the realm of the Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not know how many Yin Gods he had to kill in order to enter the realm of the Yang Gods. According to the law of conservation of energy, it might be an astronomical number.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he succeeded in the divine transformation, he would naturally be considered to have taken a step towards the heavens, which would be very profitable.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see you try to obstruct my divine transformation!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare a mere wooden stick challenge our swords and knives!" The small leader of the Blood Tiger Gang still looked down on Qi Yuan, although he inwardly valued him.</p><p></p><p>In a gang fight, the most important thing was not to lose one's momentum.</p><p></p><p>"All things are equal, why can't a wooden stick clash with swords and knives?"</p><p></p><p>"Smash him!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan demonstrated what it meant to have the power to make bricks fly.</p><p></p><p>Without any technique, he simply struck with great force.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the power of this strike was too great, as the wind of the stick arrived before the stick itself.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Instantly, seven inner disciples were sent flying dozens of meters away, and when their bodies hit the ground, they were no longer breathing. Their internal organs were all shattered.</p><p></p><p>The score was 7-0.</p><p></p><p>"With such strength, you dare to obstruct my divine transformation? Do you get paid a lot, a monthly salary of three thousand, to come and fight me to the death?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan charged into the crowd again like a fierce bandit, not giving the remaining members of the Blood Tiger Gang a chance to react.</p><p></p><p>His wooden stick swept across, and not a single one of them was a match for him.</p><p></p><p>He was like a mad god.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, all the members of the Blood Tiger Gang on the scene were beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the corpses on the ground, very angry: "The Blood Tiger Gang has committed heinous crimes, and my acting score is still 0%."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that if the Blood Tiger Gang members had not made a move, perhaps his acting score could have increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Mighty!" At this time, the originally hesitant and indecisive Wu Xiang finally appeared, looking at Qi Yuan with awe, and asked, "Senior should be a Mysterious-level Armored Soldier, right?"</p><p></p><p>This display of power was at least that of a Mysterious-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, I'm just an ordinary person." Qi Yuan gave Wu Xiang a glance.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What ordinary person could knock down seven members of the Blood Tiger Gang with a single stick? And the stick even had a blade-like aura. Seeing that Wu Xiang did not believe him, Qi Yuan added, "I'm just a bit stronger."</p><p></p><p>To achieve the divine transformation, he naturally had to make people realize that he was in the process of doing so.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, we can arm wrestle, or you can try kicking me." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>This completely confused Wu Xiang.</p><p></p><p>What was he here for?</p><p></p><p>How did arm wrestling come into it?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you have killed the members of the Blood Tiger Gang, so it won't be long before they come to seek revenge. It might be very dangerous for you to stay in Yunxue City. Why don't you come with me to the wilderness?" Wu Xiang extended an invitation.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang itself was not that powerful, but the Blood Tiger and the Thorny Blood behind them were the real tough ones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave Wu Xiang a cold look: "I don't want to join your rebel army, I just want to live a peaceful life in the city."</p><p></p><p>His ability to see hidden information was his superpower, his innate talent. Using it shouldn't be considered using a supernatural ability, right? Wu Xiang was stunned, he didn't expect Qi Yuan to know his background.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not going to waste time with you. I have important things to do, I need to go wipe out the Blood Tiger Gang. Bye."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left directly.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Tiger Gang had gone too far, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and Qi Yuan could no longer tolerate it.</p><p></p><p>"Senior?" Wu Xiang called out, anxious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Qi Yuan to be so ruthless.</p><p></p><p>Going to take on the Blood Tiger Gang with just a broken hoe?</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan took out a specially made communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>This communication talisman was given to him by the Immortal Handsome before he left.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Immortal Handsome was in the same domain, he could communicate with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan was facing a dilemma, he naturally continued to ask this NPC guide.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I'm facing a problem."</p><p></p><p>"What problem?"</p><p></p><p>The NPC guide was always professional, available at any time.</p><p></p><p>"I'm preparing for the divine transformation, to break through to the realm of the Ancestor Gods."</p><p></p><p>"Wait... Ancestor Gods?" The Immortal Handsome couldn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just a Venerable before? </p><p></p><p>It's only been a few days and he's already an Ancestor God?</p><p></p><p>If he's an Ancestor God now, wouldn't that make him as mighty as his ancestor?</p><p></p><p>In the Zhou Universe, the Ancestor Gods are the Yang Gods, capable of controlling a domain.</p><p></p><p>The size of a domain is three thousand worlds.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had some doubts about himself, doubts about life.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't know Qi Yuan, he might even think the other party was lying to him.</p><p></p><p>But this is too fast? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that I can't read?</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Gods are just myths? Thinking about this, he quickly searched for information and found that the Ancestor Gods are the Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>He fell silent completely.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan... what kind of being is this?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I've been restraining myself from killing for a night, but my divine transformation progress is still 0%." Qi Yuan voiced his worries.</p><p></p><p>He had worked hard for a night, well, it was a bit of an exaggeration, it wasn't actually a whole night.</p><p></p><p>After not killing for so long, not even finding mosquitoes to duel, according to reason, his acting score should have increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>But it was still 0.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of divine transformation, I remember a secret." The Immortal Handsome said.</p><p></p><p>"What secret?"</p><p></p><p>"My ancestor once said that when cultivating outside, one must be kind to others and value harmony. I have always followed these principles. </p><p></p><p>Do you know why?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that how it should be?"</p><p></p><p>"... In our Zhou Universe, there are often powerful families that are mysteriously destroyed, and the reason for the downfall of these powerful families is often because they have inadvertently slain an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>"Divine transformation?" Qi Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Immortal Handsome sighed, "Realm Lords are divided into Rule, All-Knowing, and Primal Chaos.</p><p></p><p>To reach the Primal Chaos realm, one needs to know all things and integrate the rules.</p><p></p><p>But how difficult is it to know all things and integrate the rules? According to what my ancestor said, Realm Lords at the All-Knowing level rarely show themselves, because... they incarnate into countless forms, falling into the mortal world... experiencing the endless cycle of reincarnation, to truly know all things and integrate the rules."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Handsome was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the All-Knowing realm, further advancement becomes extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Many All-Knowing Realm Lords will use a thread of their true essence as a guide, transforming into mortals and experiencing countless reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Countless mortals, experiencing countless reincarnations, gain a more profound understanding of the world and the universe, of all things from grass to trees, birth, aging, sickness and death, joy and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Anger, Sorrow, Joy.</p><p></p><p>This is an extremely long era, perhaps a period of an entire universe, and yet it is still impossible to truly know all things and integrate the rules.</p><p></p><p>An era is the time it takes for a universe to open and then be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, if there are no external forces or special factors, an era lasts for 490 billion years.</p><p></p><p>In this vast expanse of time, the realm masters of all things transform into myriad forms, with a thread of true spirit constantly reincarnating, constantly being reborn, seeking to know all things and integrate the rules.</p><p></p><p>During this period, some realm masters of all things may have their true spirit dim and permanently sink, ultimately returning to dust in the process of becoming mortal.</p><p></p><p>So it is said in the universe of Zhou, realm masters of all things rarely die in battle, almost all perishing from failure in the process of becoming mortal.</p><p></p><p>And in the universe of Zhou, the fastest from the realm of all things to the Heavenly Realm is the supreme being of the universe, the creator of the Void Paradise, the Void Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>From the realm of all things to the Heavenly Realm, he only took half an era.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Immortal Handsome felt his own insignificance even more deeply.</p><p></p><p>He was merely an Yin Deity Venerable, far from being a Yang Deity, let alone the existence of a realm lord at the level of the realm of all things.</p><p></p><p>As for the majestic existences above the realm of all things, they were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused.</p><p></p><p>The becoming mortal of the realm lords of the realm of all things, how was it so similar to the roles he had played? Qi Yuan's Yin Deity path had long been planned, and that was to become a true god who could create the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>To open up the heavens and the earth, to create all things, the prerequisite is to know all things and master the rules.</p><p></p><p>And the roles Qi Yuan had played were actually all manifestations of his own vital essence.</p><p></p><p>The roles he played were not just human characters, but also knives, stones, divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>The realm lords of all things had plagiarized him!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was certain of this!</p><p></p><p>Because, according to the Immortal Handsome's words, the realm lords of all things incarnated into myriad forms, often becoming human or animal or plant, various life forms, to comprehend the existence of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was different, he had also played the roles of inanimate objects like stones and knives.</p><p></p><p>So, the realm lords of all things had plagiarized him! But their skills were not up to par, they had only plagiarized half of it.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I'm too weak now, if I become an Yin Deity, I'll definitely go find them and collect the royalties!" Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he realized that he was a fallen wealthy tycoon.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad realms, countless universes, all those realm lords owed him royalties!</p><p></p><p>However, he also understood that to repay a great kindness with enmity, if he were to reveal this, it might bring the pursuit of the realm lords upon him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he could only bite and swallow this matter into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the becoming mortal of those top existences is naturally different from your becoming mortal, but you can also learn a thing or two from it. Although you cannot achieve the realm lord's level of reincarnation, you can seal your own memories and restart your life anew," the Immortal Handsome answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Qi Yuan thanked him sincerely.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he did not agree with the Immortal Handsome's suggestion of sealing his memories.</p><p></p><p>The becoming mortal of the realm lords was all plagiarized from him, so there must be many loopholes.</p><p></p><p>His becoming mortal was the authentic version.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Immortal Handsome was telling him these things, it was a bit like the news from the Blue Star being reposted to the outside network, and then being reposted back to the internal network, becoming outside news.</p><p></p><p>"So my approach was not wrong."</p><p></p><p>"The reason I've been unsuccessful in becoming mortal all this time is that there are too many people obstructing me. As long as I kill them all, won't I be able to become mortal in peace?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt his reasoning was sound.</p><p></p><p>The problem was that there were too many villains in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to kill the Blood Tiger Gang?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, the Blood Tiger Gang is too weak, I'll just wipe out the Thorny Blood instead!"</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the small fry, Qi Yuan took a different path, not attacking the elders, but directly going to kill the Supreme Elder.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Blood Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang received the news, their eyes filled with thick killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Resurrected from the dead... Well, well, a mere cultivator, if you had just quietly cultivated, I wouldn't have bothered with you, but you actually killed my Blood Tiger Gang's inner disciple, you're really bold!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang leader was burly, his arms as thick as an ordinary person's thighs.</p><p></p><p>He was also born with divine strength, and with his cultivation, he was comparable to the lowest-level Earth Realm Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>Just then, one of the gang members walked in and handed a letter to the Blood Tiger Gang leader.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the letter, squinting his eyes to read it, a mocking expression appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Has the old Wang lost his mind?"</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed the letter to the ground, tapping his leg.</p><p></p><p>The military strategist did not look at the letter, but he probably also knew the content.</p><p></p><p>This old Wang was a wealthy man in the city.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when the Blood Tiger Gang leader was weak, old Wang had saved his life.</p><p></p><p>Later, old Wang became a middleman, often bringing money to the Blood Tiger Gang leader to redeem the rebel army members.</p><p></p><p>Although the rebel army was rebelling, business still had to be done.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang leader had also done a few such deals.</p><p></p><p>Now, the letter mentioned that if Qi Yuan could be spared this time, someone was willing to pay 10,000 taels of silver to redeem him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, my dozen or so brothers are only worth 10,000 taels of silver, the price needs to be raised!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang leader said indifferently, he raised three fingers and said to the subordinate, "Three thousand taels."</p><p></p><p>The subordinate understood immediately.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Blood Tiger Gang's military strategist said, "Leader, this time... that cultivator has an extraordinary background, if we do this deal, we may incur the displeasure of the higher-ups."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I naturally know this, at worst I'll just take the money and not release him."</p><p></p><p>When doing business, one had to maintain a good reputation.</p><p></p><p>But after completing this deal, the Blood Tiger Gang leader would have accumulated enough silver to meet the Blood Tiger Lord, who could then transform him into a half-human, half-demonic aristocrat.</p><p></p><p>Once he became an aristocrat, who would still call him the Blood Tiger Gang leader or a high-level henchman?</p><p></p><p>"Leader is mighty!" the military strategist said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, follow me to see where that damn cultivator is now!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang leader walked out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Outside the hall, in the square, more than a hundred gang members in uniform uniforms were gathered, holding large cleavers, exuding a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these gang members, the Blood Tiger Gang leader's face showed a look of pride.</p><p></p><p>Just then, another gang member came walking from the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, that guy went to the inner city area!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Blood City was ruled by the Thorny Blood, and to better manage it, they had many devices called Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>These Sky Eyes were similar to flying surveillance cameras.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang had a few of them.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan had slain the Blood Tiger Gang's inner disciple, the young Sky Eye had flown out to search for Qi Yuan's whereabouts and monitor him.</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing in the inner city area?" the Blood Tiger Gang leader was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Except for the aristocrats, the members of the Thorny Blood, and the servants, ordinary people were not qualified to enter the inner city area.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the footage from the Sky Eye, let me take a look!" the Blood Tiger Gang leader said.</p><p></p><p>The military strategist flatteringly said, "Perhaps he can't get out of the city, so he went to the inner city area to see if he could be taken in as a slave by some big shot."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang leader's expression changed repeatedly, if he was really taken in as a slave by someone else, this matter would not be easy to handle, perhaps he would have to ask the Blood Tiger Lord for help.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 261</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"They've faced off so quickly, they're really in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun exhaled fragrantly. In her plan, there was this step where the Blood-Robed Sword God and Wujun Dazun would confront each other.</p><p></p><p>She was surprised that this day came so fast.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient mirror in front, a man in a navy blue robe had his back to Jasmine Dazun as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think will win this battle?"</p><p></p><p>"That goes without saying, of course it will be Wujun Dazun." Jasmine Dazun's slender fingers brushed her hair back.</p><p></p><p>Wujun Dazun was a powerhouse at the peak of the fourth step of Treading the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the Canglan Realm, the Blood-Robed Sword God was at most at the fourth step of Treading the Heavens, no match for Wujun Dazun.</p><p></p><p>"My view differs from yours." The voice from the silhouette in the ancient mirror was low.</p><p></p><p>"What, could the Blood-Robed Sword God actually win?" Jasmine Dazun chuckled lightly. "If he could win, I might truly fall in love with him. What's wrong with being star-crossed lovers for a day?"</p><p></p><p>The silhouette in the ancient mirror seemed not to have heard Jasmine Dazun's words, and continued speaking: "He's the one who challenged Wujun Dazun. I've always believed that whoever issues the challenge will be victorious."</p><p></p><p>In his view, if the Blood-Robed Sword God wasn't confident, how could he challenge Wujun Dazun?</p><p></p><p>After all, at that level, how could one act without certainty?</p><p></p><p>This was the same reason why, although Jasmine Dazun had controlled the Mythical Secret Treasury for many years and many powerful beings secretly coveted it, no one dared to openly seize it.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't met the Blood-Robed Sword God before, I might have believed what you said. But that man... can't be judged by common sense." Jasmine Dazun recalled her meeting with the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>When most Dazun meet, their conversations are polite, like water flowing over mountains.</p><p></p><p>How could he be like that, constantly saying things like "You love me so much, why don't you give me the Mythical Secret Treasury?"</p><p></p><p>He spoke without leaving himself any way out.</p><p></p><p>"Then we shall wait and see." The silhouette in the ancient mirror said, then fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun stood up, draping colorful robes over her perfectly proportioned body. Her exposed calves were wrapped in gossamer-thin silk stockings, and in the faint glimpses, one could seemingly see kiss marks like tattoos.</p><p></p><p>"This servant will go to the Seeking Dao Palace to watch the excitement."</p><p></p><p>At this time, throughout the Phoenix Sky Domain, all the Yin Gods who were not far from the Seeking Dao Palace were rushing there.</p><p></p><p>They regretted not being able to witness this agreed battle, but they had to rush to the scene to see the results firsthand.</p><p></p><p>In such a battle between Dazun, with one misstep, life and death could be decided.</p><p></p><p>Of course they had to go join the excitement. A life-and-death battle between Dazun was rarely seen in ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Before long, several terrifying auras descended upon the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>A full six Yin Gods arrived.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods were led by Jasmine Dazun and Seven Injuries Elder.</p><p></p><p>With six Yin Gods descending, the Purple Palace cultivators at the Seeking Dao Palace trembled. When in their lives had they ever seen so many Yin Gods at once?</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity this divine battle happened so hastily, we missed the chance to watch." Seven Injuries Elder was a Dazun from the Demon Beast Domain, his true form was a demon beast, though no one knew what kind.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had taken up residence in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and stood beside Jasmine Dazun.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun's gaze was coquettish: "I wonder if there will be another chance to see that interesting man."</p><p></p><p>She was referring to the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>When Dazun clash, it was very possible for a Yin God to fall.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian and her granddaughter stood to the side, their expressions bewildered. The events of today were too exaggerated and absurd; right now, they still felt as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Jasmine Dazun's words, both their faces turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood-Robed Sword God... were to fall, what would they do?</p><p></p><p>The two were in turmoil, but none of the cultivators present paid them any attention.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Virtual Realm.</p><p></p><p>A vast divine domain, as large as a star, permeated with the purest essence of metal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm as he looked at Wujun Dazun before him: "Now you know... how small your divine domain is?"</p><p></p><p>Wujun Dazun swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>After that terrifying figure deployed his divine domain, Wujun Dazun's own divine domain collapsed almost instantly.</p><p></p><p>Though both were of the metal attribute, he and the terrifying figure before him were simply not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a divine domain in the world? "What is this?" Wujun Dazun lost his composure. His previous pride, arrogance, and fighting spirit were all shattered by the appearance of the Golden Virtue Taibai Taihao Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Is your eyesight bad?" Qi Yuan gave Wujun Dazun a look. "Such a large divine infant, can't you recognize it? This is my divine infant."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke truthfully, with a hint of showing off.</p><p></p><p>Wujun Dazun was speechless.</p><p></p><p>At first, the Blood-Robed Sword God had indeed summoned a divine infant.</p><p></p><p>But after the divine infant said "As you command", it transformed into a majestic... mythical powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Although the mythical powerhouse before him seemed to be in an unusual state, with an excessively large divine domain.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Blood-Robed Sword God... must be joking." Wujun Dazun lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>A legendary mythical powerhouse, standing at the pinnacle of the Canglan Realm, had actually challenged him.</p><p></p><p>Bullying him, a new Dazun at the fourth step of Treading the Heavens - was there any justice?</p><p></p><p>"I concede this battle!" Wujun Dazun lowered his head and admitted defeat directly.</p><p></p><p>How could this battle continue? The gap in realms was too great; it was better to concede immediately.</p><p></p><p>His heart was quite complex.</p><p></p><p>He very much wanted to say to Qi Yuan: If you're a mythical being, just say so. Why bother challenging him?</p><p></p><p>"Concede?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. "Hand over your techniques."</p><p></p><p>Before the agreed battle, the two had made a bet.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan won, he would obtain all the techniques Wujun Dazun had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan lost, he would stay away from Jasmine Dazun forever and not touch the Mythical Secret Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Wujun Dazun handed a jade slip to Qi Yuan, saying respectfully: "These are all the techniques I have cultivated."</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>Today's events were too unreal, even making one feel as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's go back. I'm in a hurry, I have other urgent matters to attend to." Qi Yuan said seriously, not bothering to waste words here.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Wujun Dazun quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their forms disappeared from the Virtual Realm.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed, and a rusty red mechanical bird appeared in the Virtual Realm.</p><p></p><p>This mechanical bird seemed to be forged entirely of fine iron, but perhaps due to the long passage of time, its entire body was covered in rust. It had only one eye; the other eyeball was shattered.</p><p></p><p>A mechanical voice also sounded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Target: Blood-Robed Sword God. Trump card: Unknown mythical powerhouse. This mythical powerhouse is in an unusual state, suspected to only be able to exert strength at the peak of the sixth step of Treading the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>This rusty red mechanical bird analyzed the information, then transmitted it to the Four Generals of the Lei Family.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Seeking Dao Palace, a ripple suddenly passed through space.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin Gods present looked over, curiosity in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to see who would come out, and how many people.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, before anyone came out, a voice resonated in the minds of all the Yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>"So many Yin spirits are here, what day is it today? New Year's? Are we having a feast?"</p><p></p><p>Along with this voice, Qi Yuan appeared, wearing a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun, clad in blood armor, stood behind Qi Yuan like a little follower.</p><p></p><p>This scene truly shocked all the Yin spirits present.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun's actions and reactions had already indicated the outcome of this battle.</p><p></p><p>He... had lost! The Purple Mansion cultivators from Qiu Dao Palace wore expressions of disbelief on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Their Qiu Dao Palace, Wu Jun Da Zun - the behind-the-scenes ruler of the three realms, had actually been defeated by the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Wu Jun Da Zun, seemingly unable to accept this result, wanting to hear his personal admission.</p><p></p><p>"I... lost." Wu Jun Da Zun spoke, admitting it directly without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yin spirits present changed their expressions slightly, and their gazes towards Qi Yuan also changed.</p><p></p><p>Especially Mo Li Da Zun and the Seven Injuries Elder - if before they had merely treated the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal as a junior with some strength, now they treated him as a peer.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal's techniques are astonishing, this old man admires you," the Seven Injuries Elder also showed goodwill towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li Da Zun batted her eyelashes at Qi Yuan: "When will you come to Phoenix Palace to discuss the Dao with this servant?"</p><p></p><p>The other Yin spirit elders also introduced themselves one after another, congratulating Qi Yuan on his victory in this battle.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun stood silently behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan greeted the Seven Injuries Elder, then his gaze fell on Mo Li Da Zun.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you like me? </p><p>Today I defeated Wu Jun Da Zun, aren't I impressive and manly?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said as he raised his arm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, as a cultivator, he no longer sweated, so there was no smell.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li Da Zun narrowed her eyes, hearing Qi Yuan's words, she had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, she then heard Qi Yuan say:</p><p></p><p>"You must love me even more now, right? Shouldn't you take this opportunity to confess to me? As long as you give me the Mythical Secret Treasury as a gift, I'll reluctantly agree to be your boyfriend for a day."</p><p></p><p>The Yin spirits who heard this all couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword Immortal was indeed as legendary - a witty person.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Mo Li Da Zun's face froze. She laughed awkwardly: "You're being too... hasty, this servant will get shy."</p><p></p><p>"A high-quality man like me would be in hot demand on the dating market.</p><p>If you don't act quickly, you won't have the chance to be this close to me in the future," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Right now he still found Mo Li Da Zun attractive.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, after playing another game, he might become someone Mo Li Da Zun couldn't hope to match.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li Da Zun smiled coyly, but didn't answer directly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to say more, and just shrugged. Suddenly, he looked towards the Purple Mansion cultivators who had surrounded him earlier.</p><p></p><p>He said resolutely to Wu Jun Da Zun: "I challenged you and won, now it's my turn to challenge these old monsters, right?"</p><p></p><p>He looked towards those Purple Mansion cultivators, full of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>A month ago, these old guys would have been his most cherished ideals.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed, these old guys have aged and lost their appeal, much less attractive than before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words confused the Yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>Those Purple Mansion cultivators also looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Is he serious?! He just defeated a Great Venerable, and now he wants to challenge Purple Mansion cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those Purple Mansion cultivators trembled in fear, not daring to speak when facing Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword Immortal was bullying them for being old and weak! The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal killed without mercy. If they spoke up and displeased him, they might be killed with one sword strike. Then they would truly die, with no one to avenge them.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun was also quite depressed, unable to understand Qi Yuan's thought process.</p><p></p><p>He said in a deep voice: "On behalf of Qiu Dao Palace's Purple Mansion cultivators... I admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>"Wu Jun Da Zun, how can you cover the mouths of Qiu Dao Palace's Purple Mansion cultivators? They haven't expressed their opinions yet, and you've already spoken.</p><p>What if they don't want to admit defeat, and want to have a proper battle with me?" Qi Yuan's expression showed confusion as he looked at those Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anyone among you who dares to accept my challenge?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun was completely speechless.</p><p></p><p>Among that group of Purple Mansion cultivators, the Slovenly Daoist appeared trembling at this time, his voice extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, this junior admits defeat and is willing to offer my techniques to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Purple Mansion cultivators also hurriedly said respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to admit defeat and offer our techniques to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Purple Mansion cultivators admitted defeat simultaneously, their expressions extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't dare to accept the challenge even if given ten thousand guts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, apart from admitting defeat and offering their techniques, what else could they do?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled broadly and looked at Wu Jun Da Zun: "See that? This is the will of the people. They are captivated by my personal charm and voluntarily admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>So this is what it means that those who follow the Dao gain support, while those who lose the Dao lose support.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun didn't dare to respond at all. He was very afraid that if he said they were forced, it would cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"I accept your admission of defeat, and I also accept your techniques. Don't be so enthusiastic, it's embarrassing," Qi Yuan said as he accepted the techniques, feeling smug inside.</p><p></p><p>If only the old guys from Guang Ming Palace had been this sensible.</p><p></p><p>If they had been sensible and offered their techniques to him, they wouldn't have ended up without even bones left.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Qi Yuan continued: "What about the remaining Purple Mansion cultivators? When will they return to Qiu Dao Palace so I can challenge them one by one?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun replied expressionlessly: "All the Purple Mansion cultivators will return within today."</p><p></p><p>This time he was smarter and didn't say to have those Purple Mansion cultivators come admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded. "Since I have now defeated everyone in your Qiu Dao Palace, according to our agreement, shouldn't Qiu Dao Palace work for me?"</p><p></p><p>The original agreement was that if Qi Yuan defeated Wu Jun Da Zun and all the Purple Mansion cultivators,</p><p></p><p>Qiu Dao Palace would give him all their techniques and work for his Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun was silent for a moment, then said in a deep voice: "A bet is a bet. From now on, Qiu Dao Palace is at the senior's disposal!"</p><p></p><p>When these words were spoken, all the Yin spirits present changed their expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li Da Zun and the Seven Injuries Elder also revealed meaningful looks.</p><p></p><p>If Wu Jun Da Zun's defeat to the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal was unexpected but still within their acceptance range,</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Da Zun's current attitude was directly like pledging allegiance.</p><p></p><p>This showed that Wu Jun Da Zun had not only lost, but lost very, very badly. Otherwise, how could he say "at your disposal"! In their hearts, their evaluation of the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal went up another level.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan, who had barely subdued Qiu Dao Palace, turned his gaze to the six Yin spirits present.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said: "It's good that most of the Yin spirits of Feng Tian Realm are here today. I have something I want to tell you.</p><p></p><p>Since you're all here, I'll notify you now.</p><p></p><p>I've established an Original God Sharing Association, um... to deal with the great calamity. I hope you can support it."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 498</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying?" </p><p></p><p>Zhishuang gritted her teeth, really wanting to send Qi Yuan to the asylum.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, please be mindful of your status!"</p><p></p><p>"My status? Am I not just a son-in-law?" Qi Yuan pondered, "As a son-in-law, can I not ride you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the young master is a deity descended from heaven, it is your honor to be ridden by him!" Chen Kangbao said solemnly from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't talk nonsense, she's not up to par, I don't want to ride her."</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to be in harmony, making Zhishuang extremely angry, her brows lightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the map, Jining Prefecture is long and narrow, resembling the shape of a "clamp".</p><p></p><p>Fengshan County is located on the left side of the "clamp", and if Jining Prefecture is considered a province, then Fengshan County would be the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Fengshan County, also known as Tucheng.</p><p></p><p>The Tu family is the number one aristocratic clan in Fengshan County, with formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>The third young master of the Tu family even married the daughter of the Prince of Zhennan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the third young master of the Tu family was leaning on the railing, his waist adorned with white jade, the cloud patterns on his robe intricate.</p><p></p><p>"Victorious younger brother, I heard you went to Ninghe County recently, did anything pleasant happen?" The third young master of the Tu family said casually while holding a wine cup.</p><p></p><p>"No, I just met a friend." Wang Kaixin was a man with narrow eyes and a harsh appearance.</p><p></p><p>The third young master of the Tu family smiled: "It seems you still have the Shen family's young miss on your mind..."</p><p></p><p>"The Shen young miss is a beauty from heaven, who would not think of her?" Wang Kaixin's eyes were filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, your methods are too crude. The Shen young miss is a lady of refined character, and after returning from Yishan Lake, she will likely see through your schemes at a glance."</p><p></p><p>"By the time she returns, that son-in-law will already be dead!" Wang Kaixin said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>The third young master of the Tu family smiled, finding Wang Kaixin more and more brainless.</p><p></p><p>To win the heart of a beauty, such methods would not work at all. Moreover, that Shen family young miss, even the third young master of the Tu family did not dare to provoke, let alone the small Wang Kaixin.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for... he would not have met with Wang Kaixin.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that a major event has occurred in Ninghe County these past few days." The third young master of the Tu family said, looking into Wang Kaixin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What major event?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Red Cloud Stronghold, a powerful demonic spirit has appeared, capable of unleashing spiritual attacks that even a Mysterious-rank Armored Warrior cannot withstand."</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cloud Stronghold is doomed." Wang Kaixin said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He did not care about the downfall of a single stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"No, at that time, an old man and a young man suddenly appeared at the Red Cloud Stronghold and slew the demonic spirit." The third young master of the Tu family continued.</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." Wang Kaixin seemed uninterested in these matters.</p><p></p><p>"You went to Ninghe County recently, I wonder if you happened to see these two powerful individuals." The third young master of the Tu family said, his face filled with deep apprehension.</p><p></p><p>The information he had obtained was enough to shock anyone.</p><p></p><p>Eighty-seven Yellow-rank demonic spirits were slain one by one by that young man wielding a gun.</p><p></p><p>And that young man even claimed to be a deity descended from heaven.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cloud Stronghold is no ordinary place, from the information I've gathered, it is a place where the Thorny Blood nurtures demonic spirits, and there... there were a total of eighty-seven Yellow-rank demonic spirits, yet they were all easily slain by that young man!" </p><p></p><p>"What?" Wang Kaixin was also somewhat shaken.</p><p></p><p>To have such a ruthless person? With such strength, he might even be able to enter the top ranks of Ninguo's Prodigies.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family young miss is currently ranked among the top ten Prodigies of Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who has entered the Ninguo Prodigies ranking has the potential to reach the Earth-rank and become a true regional overlord.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that he is so jealous and dissatisfied to see the Shen family young miss marry the waste Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What characteristics did they have?" Wang Kaixin asked.</p><p></p><p>"The weapon used by that young man was very special, it was a thick and long spear!" The third young master of the Tu family said.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, spears are long and thin, and few people use thick spears.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kaixin shook his head: "Ninghe County is just a remote and impoverished place, I have never seen the person you mentioned."</p><p></p><p>"He claimed to be a deity descended from heaven, I don't know what his origins are." The third young master of the Tu family's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>His identity is special, and he has been investigating the Thorny Blood for these years, even going so far as to conceal his identity and become a member of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was unable to enter the core, unable to truly understand this massive entity.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this person is too arrogant, daring to call himself a deity descended from heaven." Wang Kaixin had a disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>The third young master of the Tu family was not surprised by Wang Kaixin's reaction.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Wang family, Wang Kaixin was not highly regarded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, Wang Kaixin's face changed drastically: "That son-in-law Qi Yuan... how is he not dead?"</p><p></p><p>He was leaning on the railing of the high building, overlooking the streets of Fengshan County, especially the wide street in front of the Shen family mansion.</p><p></p><p>He immediately spotted a familiar figure - it was Qi Yuan! Wang Kaixin's face changed repeatedly: "Young Master Tu, can you accompany me to the Shen family? I want to go..."</p><p></p><p>"No, I still have matters to attend to." The third young master of the Tu family frowned slightly, looking at Wang Kaixin as if he were a fool.</p><p></p><p>The Wang family had protected him too well, he didn't even know his own worth.</p><p></p><p>What the third young master of the Tu family was most concerned about now was the man who claimed to be a deity descended from heaven.</p><p></p><p>Having slain so many demonic spirits of the Thorny Blood, if he were to come into close contact, he could feel the bloody aura from the talismans he obtained from the Thorny Blood, and discover the other's identity.</p><p></p><p>As for the son-in-law Qi Yuan, he wanted to see him, to ask about that mysterious Armored Warrior who claimed to be a deity descended from heaven, but not now.</p><p></p><p>After all, with such an incident happening in Ninghe County, the Shen family must have confined Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"After confronting the old Zhong, the matter in Ninghe County will be clear!" Zhishuang looked at Qi Yuan, her face as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I also want to see what this old Zhong is up to, framing me." Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao looked at the mansion in front of them, his eyes shining: "Young master, with you, your old servant's life is better than an emperor's, ten steamed buns per meal!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that my wife is so young, it would be better if she were eighty or ninety years old." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>That way, he could live off her wealth.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point that after a while, he could just eat and inherit a lot of her inheritance.</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Zhishuang's eyes, but she said nothing, already used to the bizarre remarks of the two before her.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah, how dare you bully my sister, cuckold my sister, you're asking for it!" </p><p></p><p>A loud shout came from the courtyard, and a slender young man appeared, his lips red and teeth white, looking like a handsome youth.</p><p></p><p>He was carrying a huge wooden log, his aura fierce as he came to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, no, no!" A group of servants and maids followed behind him, their faces anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, don't hit yourself!"</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man hugged the huge log, his face flushed red with anger as he glared at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense." Qi Yuan looked at Shen Lingfeng calmly.</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's brother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had only met him once before, but they were not close.</p><p></p><p>"Still denying it, I heard you've been eyeing that widow!" Shen Lingfeng hugged the huge log, angrily shouting.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuang couldn't help but facepalm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's actions in Ninghe County had tarnished the Shen family's reputation, and only a portion of the Shen household was aware of it.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Shen Lingfeng was yelling and directly exposing it.</p><p></p><p>Those servants and maids, although trying to stop Shen Lingfeng, were already eager to gossip.</p><p></p><p>What, the brother-in-law... cuckold the young miss?</p><p></p><p>How dare the brother-in-law do that? </p><p></p><p>That's the young miss, a beauty without equal! "Young master, be careful with your words!" Zhishuang sighed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Miss Ming was clearly very intelligent, so why was her brother so dull-witted.</p><p></p><p>After today, it's likely that the Shen family will know that the son-in-law Qi Yuan has cuckolded the eldest Miss.</p><p></p><p>If the Shen family knows, won't the Feng Shan Commandery know as well?</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, I'll kill him!" Shen Lingfeng grabbed a huge log and charged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Ah, young master, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Well, he didn't hit Qi Yuan, but ended up tripping and falling, with the huge log pinning him down.</p><p></p><p>The servants and maids all tensed up and quickly helped Shen Lingfeng remove the log from on top of him.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng got up, panting with anger, glaring at Qi Yuan: "I'm going to..."</p><p></p><p>"Enough!" Just then, a cold shout rang out.</p><p></p><p>The servants and maids present all bowed their heads respectfully: "Madam!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than the Madam of the Shen family, Shen Lingfeng's mother.</p><p></p><p>She was around thirty years old, with her beauty seemingly untouched by the passage of time, radiantly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Her figure was voluptuous, with the mature charm of a young woman.</p><p></p><p>Her black hair was pinned up with a golden hairpin, revealing her forehead, and her looks were quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>Even now she was so alluring, let alone in her younger days when she must have been a true beauty.</p><p></p><p>Son-in-law? Qi Yuan recognized the newcomer, and he wondered if he should draw the Madam's bath water tonight.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the duty of a son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"Madam, I've brought the son-in-law back. He said that the matter in Ninghe County was a setup, and if we can confront the old Zhong, everything will be clear!" Zhishuan said respectfully while bowing her head.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhong is dead." The Madam spoke.</p><p></p><p>"What, dead?" Zhishuan's expression changed, so there would be no evidence now.</p><p></p><p>"Surely this boy killed Old Zhong to cover up his own shameful deeds!" Shen Lingfeng quickly said.</p><p></p><p>He looked quite pleased with himself, thinking he had come up with a clever idea.</p><p></p><p>The Madam looked at her foolish son helplessly: "Old Zhong's body was found this morning, and according to the autopsy, he has been... dead for half a month."</p><p></p><p>"Half a month?" </p><p></p><p>At these words, Zhishuan's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, Old Zhong had not yet accompanied the son-in-law to Ninghe County.</p><p></p><p>But... Old Zhong had died half a month ago.</p><p></p><p>Then who accompanied the son-in-law to Ninghe County? A chill went through Zhishuan's heart, and the icy beauty became even colder.</p><p></p><p>She frowned, sensing a conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible hand was manipulating everything.</p><p></p><p>Could this conspiracy be targeting the Miss? </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhishuan felt guilty for misjudging the son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"Even though Old Zhong is dead and there's no evidence, the fact that he cuckolded my sister can't be ignored!" Shen Lingfeng said cleverly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one present paid him any attention.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, the Ninghe County matter seems to be a misunderstanding. These days, try to stay within the Shen residence and go out as little as possible." The Madam said indifferently, "I will help you find the true culprit behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan wanted to say something but held back.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng looked completely bewildered, his brain unable to handle such a complex situation.</p><p></p><p>"Mother-in-law?" Qi Yuan called out softly.</p><p></p><p>Hm? The Madam looked at Qi Yuan, a bit strange about this form of address.</p><p></p><p>Where would someone call their mother-in-law "mother-in-law"? "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you bathing tonight?" Qi Yuan asked boldly.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I mean, taking a bath!" Qi Yuan explained, afraid the Madam didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"As a son-in-law, I should do something for this family.</p><p></p><p>Drawing bath water for the mother-in-law is my duty as a son-in-law!</p><p></p><p>Mother-in-law, when you're bathing, call me, and I'll personally draw the bath water for you!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, all the servants and maids present looked shocked and horrified.</p><p></p><p>Where... does one talk like this? Drawing bath water for the mother-in-law, what is this? Could it be... an improper relationship?</p><p></p><p>The Madam's phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, as if suppressing her anger. She abruptly waved her sleeve and left.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Madam, the son-in-law was sent to a mental asylum in Ninghe County, so he may have lost his mind and is acting strangely and erratically. Please forgive him!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how she had misjudged the son-in-law along the way, treating him as a villain who had dishonored a woman, she felt guilty.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." The Madam sighed, "Troubled times."</p><p></p><p>"The son-in-law said there is the shadow of Wang Kaiyuan behind this." Zhishuan thought for a moment and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"He... is just a bit smarter than Lingfeng, but he has likely become a pawn for certain people without realizing it." The Madam said calmly, a flash of murderous intent suddenly appearing in her eyes, "You go to the Wang family, and if they don't hand over Wang Kaiyuan, tell them I will pay them a personal visit!"</p><p></p><p>The Wang family was a powerful clan, but compared to the Shen family, the gap was vast.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhishuan's heart tightened, she knew the Madam was angry.</p><p></p><p>"Marrying into the Shen family, he is one of us. Daring to touch someone from the Shen family, he is courting death!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Young master, what do you think about taking that woman as a mount?" Chen Kangbao said while stuffing his face with steamed buns, full of the self-awareness of a strategist.</p><p></p><p>"She's my mother-in-law, a relative. If I ride her and someone finds out, I might be accused of incest!" Qi Yuan still had a strong sense of morality.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Kangbao paused: "Young master, why would you want to take your own relative as a mount? If discovered, wouldn't you also be accused of incest?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened thoughtfully, feeling there was some truth to it.</p><p>He quickly realized: "You're an idiot who can't even be a fool!"</p><p></p><p>He almost let Chen Kangbao lead him astray.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, I've come to apologize. I misjudged you, you didn't cuckold my sister!" </p><p></p><p>A thin voice came, and Shen Lingfeng walked over, his expression sheepish.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when God closes one door for a person, he will open a window for them.</p><p></p><p>All of Shen Lingfeng's doors were closed, but his sister's window was wide open.</p><p></p><p>The eldest Miss of the Shen family was brilliant and talented, completely different from the dull-witted Shen Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this personality was not entirely innate, and was related to the talisman Shen Lingfeng controlled.</p><p></p><p>The talisman could also influence the personality of the one who wields it to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, as long as the misunderstanding is cleared up." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>This little brother-in-law wasn't bad, just a bit dull-witted.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I always thought you were weak and useless, just good-looking, but today when I came at you fiercely, you didn't flinch! I'm ashamed of myself." Shen Lingfeng said, admiration in his tone.</p><p></p><p>"Mother said that when three people travel together, there is bound to be a teacher among them. Brother-in-law, I will learn more from you in the future!" Shen Lingfeng's words were loaded.</p><p></p><p>Because of his personality issues, the Madam often told him to observe and learn more.</p><p></p><p>"Learn what?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>As a son-in-law, should he be tutoring his sister-in-law in her studies?</p><p></p><p>Since there was no sister-in-law, he could only tutor his brother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng hesitated, then whispered: "Brother-in-law, you're young and already have a wife, I... cough cough, I want to learn how to... "</p><p></p><p>"Pick up girls?" Qi Yuan looked at Shen Lingfeng calmly, "I have a lot of experience in that!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Qi Yuan became energetic.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

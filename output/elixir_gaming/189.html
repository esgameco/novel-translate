        <h1>Chapter 189</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"I once saw an exceptional prodigy who was just one step away from reaching the realm of True Divinity. Unfortunately, his talent was too strong, even surpassing the Foodless Holy Mother. Even if given more treasures, he could not break through to True Divinity," said the Thunder God Lord, his eyes filled with endless sorrow.</p><p></p><p>This is why even if a true dragon is born, it cannot break through to True Divinity.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you, kid... don't have talent that's too extraordinary. Otherwise... it would be interesting if you can't break through to True Divinity." The sadness on the Thunder God Lord's face came and went quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face went blank upon hearing this: "So you're saying if talent is too high, surpassing the Foodless Holy Mother, using the treasures she transformed into won't allow breaking through to True Divinity."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Thunder God Lord nodded vigorously, smiling as he said, "Don't worry, your talent is very good, but compared to the Foodless Holy Mother, it's certainly much less. In this world, how many could have talent surpassing the Foodless Holy Mother? On the path of cultivation, talent... doesn't represent everything."</p><p></p><p>"I'm doomed. What if I'm stronger than her?" Qi Yuan felt this was very possible. "Does the Foodless Holy Mother have Heavenly Dao Foundation or a Star Gold Core?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Lord felt choked: "Can you stop boasting? Even Chosen Ones of Destiny don't boast as much as you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt very dejected: "So having talent that's too good is also a mistake. Before when I heard people say rich people have their own difficulties, I scoffed. What difficulties could there be in eating ten steamed buns in one meal? Now I understand, this is the pain of rich people - their stomachs are too small, they can only eat one steamed bun at a time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi beside him smiled gently: "Godfather, let's go find some more treasures. You'll definitely be able to enter True Divinity."</p><p></p><p>"No, I suddenly feel I was thinking too optimistically before. I used to think about visualizing all the powerful immortals in our Heavenly Court. But now it seems many immortals are much stronger than that Foodless Holy Mother. Even if I visualize them, they won't be able to break through to True Divinity." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very disappointed. Saying this, it seemed he could only visualize some small fry.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it the Chinese Dragon Team? How did it become the Heavenly Court?" The Thunder God Lord had a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"They were in the Heavenly Court first, then joined the Chinese Dragon Team," Qi Yuan said. "In the end, they even followed the Crooked-Mouth Dragon King."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Lord didn't want to speak: "Stop boasting. Origin Supreme, is your Heavenly Court really so full of talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded. "The Four Heavenly Kings are just small fry. Li Tianguan, Nezha, Zhenwu Emperor, Zhenyuan Immortal, Buddha Tathagata - any one of them could easily suppress the others!"</p><p></p><p>"Are these people very strong?" The Thunder God Lord looked doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!"</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of them. Are you just making this up?"</p><p></p><p>"How could a god make things up!" Qi Yuan felt he wasn't making anything up, those gods truly existed in his memory.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Lord looked unconvinced: "I'll just wait and see when you visualize them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the worry on Qi Yuan's face deepened: "Besides these treasures, are there other methods to break through to True Divinity?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless... the broken pillar of heaven is restored," said the Thunder God Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "We can go reconnect the heavenly pillar!"</p><p></p><p>"Legend has it that within the broken heavenly pillar, there is an evil god above True Divinity circling inside. Origin Supreme, I have high hopes for you. If you reconnect the pillar, you'll be a great benefactor to our Mortal Heart Realm. This old man will have to call you Master!" The Thunder God Lord said teasingly.</p><p></p><p>"Yang God?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately gave up the idea.</p><p></p><p>He had heard his daughter Qi Jianjun say that a Yang God going all out could even swallow a star. His Star Gold Core was far away in another universe. Even if summoned, it would only be a star's shadow, completely unable to deal with a Yang God. </p><p></p><p>Facing a Yang God, he still felt very weak.</p><p></p><p>"A Yang God is nothing. From your Chinese Dragon Team, or was it Heavenly Court, just send out a Buddha Tathagata and it would probably be fixed," said the Thunder God Lord.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense, but... if I visualize Buddha Tathagata, my people using this visualization method still won't be able to break through to True Divinity. They also won't truly possess Buddha Tathagata's great power, so how could they reconnect the heavenly pillar?" Qi Yuan pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>The visualization method only allowed his people to cultivate quickly, borrowing some power from the visualized gods. It didn't mean they would become those visualized gods.</p><p></p><p>"You're really taking this seriously?" The Thunder God Lord was speechless seeing Qi Yuan actually thinking about these things.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Qi blinked her eyes beside them: "Thunder God Lord, why don't you give some supreme treasures to my godfather? See how many he needs to break through to True Divinity?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder God Lord spread his hands: "I'm just a lonely old bachelor. I don't have any treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, looking at your face, I can tell you can't drop gold coins," Qi Yuan said from the side.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Lord glared angrily at Qi Yuan: "Don't insult me with words I don't understand!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not insulting you, I'm just saying you're an old fogey," Qi Yuan said seriously. "Old fogey means respected elder. I'm praising your knowledge."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Lord looked suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Old Fogey Thunder God, since you're so knowledgeable, can you tell me if there are any other ways to break through to True Divinity?" Qi Yuan humbly asked.</p><p></p><p>"There's no way, unless you reconnect the heavenly pillar," the Thunder God Lord said firmly. But thinking of something, he continued, "You've led me astray. How could your talent possibly be higher than the Foodless Holy Mother? Just find more supreme treasures and it should work. Why think so much about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, how can sparrows understand the ambitions of wild geese!" Qi Yuan sighed, not saying more.</p><p></p><p>He felt that if this problem wasn't solved, in the future he could only visualize beings at the level of the Four Heavenly Kings. Any stronger wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>Right now, what he lacked most was True Divinity battle power. </p><p></p><p>Beings at the Four Heavenly Kings level could just use these treasures to break through to True Divinity.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Qi Qi walked along a country path followed by her maid Xiao Xue.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an old woman appeared in her vision again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked surprised and said to the old woman: "I don't know you, and I don't want to leave my godfather to go with you."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old woman stretched out her withered hand: "Invitation, for you."</p><p></p><p>A gold-trimmed invitation fell into Qi Qi's hand. The old woman looked at Qi Qi, her eyes becoming cloudy again: "If you go, there are good things, you can also..."</p><p></p><p>Before finishing, the old woman's form disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked confused. She opened the invitation and read the contents: "Hundred Flowers Gathering, what is this? An invitation for godfather?"</p><p></p><p>When encountering something she didn't understand, she would go ask the Thunder God Lord.</p><p></p><p>Now in Qingshui Village, the Thunder God Lord was like a living immortal. </p><p></p><p>Whenever Qi Qi didn't understand something, she would go ask him.</p><p></p><p>Some villagers' chickens ran away, and they would go ask the Thunder God Lord for help.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the Thunder God Lord was now the most popular among older women in the village.</p><p></p><p>Holding the invitation, Qi Qi found the Thunder God Lord lying in a reclining chair: "Thunder God Lord, look at this invitation. What's going on? Is it dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Lord took the invitation, looking surprised: "Qi Yuan shouldn't qualify to attend the Hundred Flowers Gathering."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Qi told the Thunder God Lord about her encounter with the old woman.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the Thunder Lord heard this, he immediately understood: "You have phoenix bloodline in your body. The phoenix clan has close relations with the Northern Sea water tribes, so this is normal."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan walked out of the divine temple: "What phoenix bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>"Phoenix clan bloodline!" said the Thunder Lord. </p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan was crazy, how could he change his goddaughter's race?</p><p></p><p>"I've heard of this thing before."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The Thunder Lord became interested, wanting to use this to understand the Origin Lord's true identity in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have read a book before that recorded swallowing this phoenix bloodline has endless benefits. A female cultivator's cup size even grew from C to B," said Qi Yuan. That's how it was recorded in the book, growing from C to B.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Lord felt he still couldn't find out about the Origin Lord's background.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you lacking a supreme treasure to break through to True God? Here's your chance." The Thunder Lord tossed the invitation to Qi Yuan. "The Hundred Flowers Gathering is held once every hundred years. Inside, there are countless rare treasures. There are quite a few supreme treasures that can help one break through to True God. As long as you can stand out, there will be many treasures."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Many?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, depends on your abilities," the Thunder Lord said casually. </p><p></p><p>He had only heard of the Hundred Flowers Gathering. He didn't know the specific details.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to be my bodyguard and accompany me to the Hundred Flowers Gathering?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Not interested." The Thunder Lord gave Qi Yuan the cold shoulder.</p><p></p><p>For a powerhouse of his level to be a bodyguard? Moreover, if he went to the Hundred Flowers Gathering and his identity was exposed, many powerful experts might come to surround and kill him.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity," Qi Yuan said. "There are only three days until the Hundred Flowers Gathering. I need to prepare."</p><p></p><p>After all, leaving Qingshui Village and traveling outside was very unsafe. </p><p></p><p>He needed to visualize more True Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly visualize the Four Heavenly Kings," said the Thunder Lord beside him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to know if Qi Yuan had the goods.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go do it now. I'm about to go on a long journey, so I need to get more security," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>So this time, he planned to visualize at least five deities at the level of the Four Heavenly Kings.</p><p></p><p>Any stronger wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then entered the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, without thinking, the Thunder Lord also entered his chat group.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the messages in the group became lively.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, why did you come in? Are you going to start visualizing?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you still have the goods?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, no, recently there's an ancient god who's been pestering me, wanting to take me as his master. But I'm not impressed by him. However, he was entrusted to me by a friend, so I still need to look after him. Now he's preparing to start visualizing, so I'm seeing if I can go to Visualization Mountain to watch over him," the Thunder Lord said in the group.</p><p></p><p>"How can you watch over him? Thunder Lord, just tell the truth, what are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I heard he can visualize a legendary level god visualization method, so I came to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"A legendary level god visualization method? This seedling... is pretty good. I happen to need a disciple, how about giving him to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, you already have seven disciples, you still want more?"</p><p></p><p>"A legendary level god visualization method is indeed not bad, but compared to being a closed-door disciple, it's still far off. My closed-door disciple visualized two legendaries and seven epics," someone boasted proudly in the group.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder Lord was very pleased: "Sigh, it's just that his talent is too poor, otherwise I would reluctantly accept him as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Lord's purpose for entering the group was very simple - to show off. </p><p></p><p>But before showing off, he had to first lower expectations.</p><p></p><p>Wait until the Origin Lord suddenly bursts out with three legendaries, dazzling their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That guy is about to start. I estimate in a while we'll be able to see the golden light on Visualization Mountain and hear the sound of hundreds of birds chirping. If he visualizes three, this old man will reluctantly accept him as a registered disciple," the Thunder Lord said randomly in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, you're boasting too much. Visualize three and still only accept as a registered disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, stop pretending. The one who just entered was the Origin Lord, right? Wasn't it this old man who recommended him to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't expose my bottom line!" the Thunder Lord quickly said.</p><p></p><p>He divided part of his consciousness and descended onto Visualization Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, golden light flashed brightly and hundreds of birds chirped.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in the Thunder Lord's eyes: "Good, one legendary."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, worthy of being a registered disciple indeed," an ancient god said in the group.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods in the group were all quite excited seeing the bright golden flash.</p><p></p><p>Because with one legendary, given enough time, it was very possible to create a great lord.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, golden light flashed again on Visualization Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This time, it flashed twice.</p><p></p><p>"Three?" The people in the group were completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, you came in just for this?"</p><p></p><p>"Such deep scheming!"</p><p></p><p>"This ancient god is indeed qualified to be your personal disciple. Such a good seedling, White Ancient Lord, why didn't you recommend him to me?"</p><p></p><p>The group was chatting.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan was on Visualization Mountain, looking at the remaining pile of evil god spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>A delighted expression appeared in his eyes: "The Yin God level is so useful? Visualizing three of the Four Heavenly Kings and still over 90% left? No, I need to visualize more. How about... the Eighteen Arhats!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, preparing to continue visualizing.</p><p></p><p>At this time in the chat group, hearing the old man's flattery, the Thunder Lord was very excited: "Adding the previous one, now there are four legendaries. Barely acceptable."</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, we flatter you once and you start boasting? If you don't want such a seedling, I do!"</p><p></p><p>"Give me twenty supreme treasures and I'll let you have him." The Thunder Lord opened his mouth wide like a lion.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, supreme treasures are still more important! Your disciple is very good, but not strong enough to... be worth twenty supreme treasures."</p><p></p><p>Just as the words fell.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, on Visualization Mountain, golden light flashed brightly again.</p><p></p><p>Once, twice, thrice... ten times...</p><p></p><p>The people in the group were a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Ten sudden golden flashes, what did this mean? The Thunder Lord also couldn't understand, and a terrifying idea arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The golden light continued.</p><p></p><p>With each flash, the hearts of the great lords on the scene pounded heavily.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it stopped at eighteen flashes.</p><p></p><p>On Visualization Mountain now, where was it just hundreds of birds chirping, it was a full thousand birds chirping.</p><p></p><p>The great lords who were just talking in the group widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Did I just see wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen flashes... how is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>"All legendaries??"</p><p></p><p>"This can't be your disciple, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, where are you now? Twenty supreme treasures are ready. I'm coming to take my disciple back right now!"</p><p></p><p>PS: Let me recommend a book - "Shocking, the Female Emperor is Stuck in My Wall!"</p><p></p><p>Actually, I really wanted to write this concept before - ancient gods and immortals stuck in walls. But since I didn't have time to write it, I recommended it to some author friends to write. It's very interesting!</p><p></p><p>Recommendation: If one day you wake up and find an empress stuck in your house, what would you do?</p><p></p><p>There's a link below!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

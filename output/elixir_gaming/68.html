        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>An endless sea of flowers!</p><p></p><p>On the heavenly ladder, Qi Yuan held his sword, and all the insights from burying the flowers became his own.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, on the entire arena, there appeared over a thousand terrifying blood-red armored figures, each standing ten meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand towering Qi Yuans, each wielding a sword, their gaze fixed on the enemy in front of the arena.</p><p></p><p>It was a 0.5-meter-tall giant beetle, a mutant species of the beetle clan, its size ten times that of an ordinary beetle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it looked at the countless illusory figures above it, its head filled with question marks.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pointed his sword at the giant beetle: "As the saying goes, shoot the leading bird first. Who told you not to be low-key? Looking so big and stupid, you must be the blue giant of the beetle clan!"</p><p></p><p>If the 0.5-meter-tall giant beetle could speak, it would surely say, "You're fucking ten meters tall, and you call me a big stupid one?"</p><p></p><p>Under the enhancement of the endless sea of flowers, the swords of the over a thousand Qi Yuans converged on a single point, stabbing towards the giant beetle.</p><p></p><p>The giant beetle died.</p><p></p><p>After forensic examination, its body was full of holes, with not a single intact piece of flesh.</p><p></p><p>After killing it, Qi Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"The insights from burying the flowers have deepened even further."</p><p></p><p>Today, he had experienced hundreds of battles, constantly gaining insights into Zang Hua's combat techniques and cultivation experience.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I can boldly say that no one understands Zang Hua better than me."</p><p></p><p>"Continue, the next battle!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan dragged his burly body, ready to enter the next battle.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had already reached level 97, his strength reaching an astonishing degree.</p><p></p><p>"Even Long Pan is only at level 99, the peak of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Is level 100 a new realm?</p><p></p><p>But... is the Divine Realm only from level 90 to 100?</p><p>That's too short, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>And when I merged with Xiao Jia, I was able to display a strength of level 102, but I didn't feel that sense of a great realm breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>In the endless battles on the Ascension Platform, as his level increased, Qi Yuan discovered many problems.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Realm is from level 70 to 89.</p><p></p><p>Is the Divine Realm really just from level 90 to 99?</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into level 90 from level 89, Qi Yuan clearly felt a qualitative change in his strength.</p><p></p><p>However, when he forcibly broke through to level 100 by wearing Xiao Jia, the feeling of his strength surging was not that strong.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Ying, Long Pan, and Yu are not actually at the peak of the Divine Realm?" A terrifying guess suddenly arose in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But if they are not at the peak of the Divine Realm, why do they feel that they are?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there is an extremely powerful being who has changed their perception?</p><p></p><p>Or... is there someone restricting their breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>This feeling is like a person at the Qi Refinement Fifth Layer, being forcibly changed in their perception by a powerful expert, believing that the Qi Refinement Fifth Layer is the peak of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Then, one day they start building their foundation.</p><p></p><p>What awaits them is probably a fall.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but feel that this game world might have an even greater boss.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look at the Ascension Platform and the countless seats on it.</p><p></p><p>"Who was once observing the battles here?"</p><p></p><p>"The enemies I'm facing now are already level 80. The strongest fighters on the Ascension Platform... how high is their level?"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Qi Yuan pushed these thoughts aside.</p><p></p><p>The battle was still ongoing, and he began to slaughter, earning experience.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Long Pan stood up, looking up at the sky, seeing the ancient Gui Chun tree, and couldn't help but blurt out, "I didn't expect that so many years have passed, it has grown so big."</p><p></p><p>Yu also looked up at the tree with Long Pan: "The seed of the ancient Gui Chun tree was obtained by you from the Five Elements Forbidden Land and offered to the Celestial Deities.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this seed has absorbed all the determination of the Empress Jia, allowing it to grow so large."</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, the Celestial Deities were defeated, and the evil forces from the Outer Realm ravaged the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>They either died or were injured, only retreating to the Forbidden Lands, relying on the Forbidden Lands to temporarily escape the evil forces from the Outer Realm.</p><p></p><p>And Yu was the most skilled in divination. He calculated that the day when the Celestial Wolf devours the moon would be the weakest moment for the evil forces from the Outer Realm.</p><p></p><p>This led to the Demon Slaying Assembly three hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the four major Forbidden Lands and the two Forbidden Zones, ancient and mysterious, even we who have been in the Five Elements Forbidden Land for so long, and can be considered the masters of the Five Elements Forbidden Land, are unable to uncover the true secrets hidden in the Forbidden Lands," Long Pan sighed inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>"The Master of the Robe Sect should have gone to the Mortal Realm, right?" Yu asked.</p><p></p><p>The Mortal Realm refers to the lands outside the four major Forbidden Lands and the two Forbidden Zones.</p><p></p><p>"Our insights and experiences either need to be distilled through battles, or we need to go to the Mortal Realm for a while," Long Pan said. "Although Zang Hua is foul-mouthed, he can be considered well-intentioned."</p><p></p><p>They knew that Zang Hua's battle with the Master of the Robe Sect was to help the Master of the Robe Sect digest his insights and experiences.</p><p></p><p>This was an enormous consumption for Zang Hua.</p><p></p><p>Because her power was accumulating, waiting for the Demon Slaying Assembly to unleash her strongest strike.</p><p></p><p>If the power was consumed, there would be a little less, and it would be very difficult to replenish.</p><p></p><p>They were all the same, willing to do as little as possible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Long Pan's battle with Ying was unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, these old fellows would certainly be willing to crawl out of their coffins to be sparring partners for the Master of the Robe Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Doing our best, leaving it to fate. Three hundred years from now, we will all come out and defeat the evil forces together!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan woke up from his dream, his back covered in cold sweat, soaking his clothes, and his forehead was also damp.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the wooden cat puppet on the bedside table, its red and black paint somewhat faded from age.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked out of the thatched hut and stood in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The cold moonlight fell on him, and he felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>"Killing too many people, no wonder I have nightmares."</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too positive, it's just some residual images."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and a water mirror appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his reflection in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Stunningly handsome, with a hint of wickedness in his eyes, and a faint aura of killing intent around him.</p><p></p><p>"The killing intent is still too strong."</p><p></p><p>"Who would believe that I've trained myself to have this much killing intent just by playing a game?"</p><p></p><p>After all, in his previous life, some people had killed over a hundred million monsters in games, but they didn't develop this much killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had decided that if he couldn't refine or conceal the killing intent, he absolutely wouldn't reveal his identity outside.</p><p></p><p>Even if he went out, he couldn't expose his true identity.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan didn't go back to sleep, but took out the cultivation techniques he had brought from the Black Mountain Sect, searching for techniques to conceal his killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect was notorious for its evil deeds, and some cultivators also needed to hide their killing intent, so there must be techniques for this.</p><p></p><p>After searching for a while, Qi Yuan found three similar techniques for concealing killing intent:</p><p>"Mysterious Clear Spiritual Great Technique", "Gloomy Ghost Domain Dispelling Technique", and "Concealing Technique".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully studied the three techniques. Each had its own merits.</p><p></p><p>But the first two were of a higher level, requiring at least Foundation Establishment to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was unable to cultivate them. Moreover, to Qi Yuan's surprise, the second one, the "Gloomy Ghost Domain Dispelling Technique", was not a cultivator's main cultivation technique, but rather a functional Tao technique. After cultivating it, there was even the possibility of it becoming a certain existence's spiritual food.</p><p></p><p>"This world has too many problems..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very worried, "Even some Tao techniques cannot be practiced recklessly."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the final "Lian Zi Jue" (Concealment Technique). This Tao technique could be cultivated by practitioners who had refined their qi.</p><p></p><p>It could not dispel the killing intent, but rather conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous two, it was inferior, but still quite good.</p><p></p><p>[This is the Lian Zi Jue, if 145 parts of it are modified, there may be unexpected results.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and modified the Lian Zi Jue according to the prompts he saw.</p><p></p><p>After the modification, he had a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"My eyes really understand me, what I saw is so suitable for me!"</p><p></p><p>The newly modified Lian Zi Jue had a completely different appearance.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he conceal his own killing intent, but he could also secretly project it onto others.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel that if someone said he had a heavy killing intent and wanted to exorcise him, he could openly counterattack.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>On the ascension platform, Qi Yuan, who had merged with Xiao Jia, was facing the attack of ten powerful experts from the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now he had reached the level of ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the ten thousand level, Qi Yuan encountered experts whose strength had undergone a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>The weakest were at the Divine Realm level.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing the attack of ten 91-level Divine Realm experts, Qi Yuan was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi in his body seemed to condense into a tangible form, and the blood-red armor became even more enchanting.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally reached 99 levels."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice also became a bit enchanting.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have come from hell.</p><p></p><p>With a single sword strike, the afterimages of the ten Divine Realm experts were unable to resist and were slaughtered by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With Xiao Jia equipped, Qi Yuan could exert the strength of the 104th level.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength was something that these newly entered Divine Realm enemies could not cope with.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, Qi Yuan also had the combat experience and insights of those 84 Divine Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could say without any politeness that he understood those people better than they did themselves.</p><p></p><p>The combat experience and techniques had all been integrated into his own being.</p><p></p><p>"In the upcoming battles, I should also integrate all the combat experience and techniques, and make them my own."</p><p></p><p>"And can't I also learn the combat experience and techniques of the enemies?"</p><p></p><p>"There are still more than 20,000 battles to go!"</p><p></p><p>"How many enemies?"</p><p></p><p>"At least 20,000 Divine Realm experts, or even 200,000?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Lian Zi Jue won't be overwhelmed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan re-entered the game to continue his slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly. </p><p></p><p>One day in the game was equivalent to a year or even a century on the ascension platform.</p><p></p><p>The information about this was not told to Qi Yuan by the Golden Armored General.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the General did not expect Qi Yuan to reach such a high level.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps he thought Qi Yuan would die in a certain battle, staining the arena with blood and becoming a part of the guardians.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tirelessly slaughtered in the game. </p><p></p><p>He did not know how many lives he had taken.</p><p></p><p>Now in front of him were fifty 93-level Divine Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>If it had been before, Qi Yuan would have quickly fled.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing tens of thousands of battles, fully accepting the combat experience of the 84 Divine Realm experts, and absorbing the combat experience of the guardians, he had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>He was like a ghost dancing on blades and swords, wielding a blood-red sword, weaving through the dozens of Divine Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Every sword strike seemed effortless.</p><p></p><p>Every attack, evasion, and release of martial arts techniques were exquisitely beautiful, beyond the criticism of even the most discerning.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's massive figure, with his blood-red armor and spikes, seemed even more sinister and terrifying than an evil demon from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>After slaying all the enemies, a series of experience points were obtained.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes: "Still at 99 levels? Unable to advance to 100 levels?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could not remember how many Divine Realm experts he had killed.</p><p></p><p>The result was that his experience bar was stuck at 99 levels, unable to rise further.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible force had confined him to the 99th level.</p><p></p><p>"At least the experience points are still there." This was the only thing that made Qi Yuan feel better.</p><p></p><p>There was just a restriction that prevented him from leveling up.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through that restriction, he could level up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was wondering how high he could level up? At least 110 levels?</p><p></p><p>And there were still 10,000 steps left, with even more Divine Realm experts inside.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly my grinding paradise!" Qi Yuan thought, and then exited the Ascending Ladder.</p><p></p><p>He had killed enough for now, it was time to log off.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had experienced countless battles in this time, in reality, only half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>In this half month, the transformation of the water and fire qi in Qi Yuan's body had been completed.</p><p></p><p>When the water qi was transformed, the entire Shenguang Sect experienced a rain. </p><p></p><p>However, this rain was red, like blood.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivators who were drenched by this rain would have nightmares when they slept.</p><p></p><p>In their dreams, they saw a huge blood-colored figure that seemed to be slaughtering everything.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying figure exuded a horrifying aura, extremely frightening.</p><p></p><p>This caused many ordinary disciples in the Shenguang Sect to have trouble sleeping, and some even cried out in their dreams, seeing a demon.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment and Elixir Dao cultivators found this amusing.</p><p></p><p>What's so scary about a dream?</p><p></p><p>And hearing those disciples describe the blood-red terrifying figure as a demonic god, they found it even more laughable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's inner qi and the ordinary people were just too short-sighted, anything could be called a demonic god.</p><p></p><p>Some Foundation Establishment and Elixir Dao cultivators who had already reached the state of Fasting were interested in the dream, and actively fell asleep. When they saw the terrifying blood-red figure, their reactions were not much stronger than the qi-refining disciples and ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to their broader experience, they better understood the terror of the blood-red figure, and many had their spiritual defenses shaken.</p><p></p><p>The entire Shenguang Sect, for several consecutive days, the qi-refining disciples dared not sleep at night, staring at their panda eyes and cultivating, until five days later, everything returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>The various strange occurrences that had recently happened in the Shenguang Sect had already spread throughout the Great Merchant Kingdom, attracting the attention of many.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan opened the chat interface, embracing Xiao Jia's slender waist in a comfortable position, and began to chat with Jin Li again.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, there are too many enemies in this Tianjue, killing every day, I'm already tired of killing." Qi Yuan couldn't help but vent some negative energy to Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he rarely expressed negative energy.</p><p></p><p>Now, after experiencing major battles, he would always find Jin Li to chat and soothe his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even without experiencing major battles, he had already gotten used to chatting with Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>And Jin Li was also particularly understanding, sometimes listening, sometimes speaking.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like in another half a month, I'll be able to break through Tianjue." Qi Yuan sent the message.</p><p></p><p>PS: There are still two more chapters, a bit late, everyone can read them tomorrow morning!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It should have been a grand national ceremony, but only the Minister of Rites was performing the rites, how truly sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>Qin Nai and Yuguogong stood below the platform, their eyes filled with a deep sense of powerlessness as they watched Jinli on the stage.</p><p></p><p>Jinli ascended the sacrificial platform, praying for the Qingtang Army to descend, but it was all just an illusion, a dream.</p><p></p><p>They were truly powerless to change the course of events.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, some of the civil and military officials beside Sima Ting were watching Jinli's performance with an air of amusement.</p><p></p><p>Especially those officials who knew the origins of the sacrificial platform, they mocked her, some even secretly felt bitter, the Empress had run out of options.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the beautiful and short-lived, Empress Jinli would ultimately perish for this empire.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the multitude, Empress Jinli slowly ascended the sacrificial platform.</p><p></p><p>This time, she walked with steadiness.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was filled with various emotions.</p><p></p><p>The one that predominated was her worry for Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan had not responded to her for four days.</p><p></p><p>However, the important matter was at hand, worrying would be of no use, so she cast aside her other emotions and proceeded with the sacrificial rites according to Qiyuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>She held the long jade scepter in her hand, her expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>When Empress Jinli had ascended two-thirds of the platform, Kong Qi prostrated himself on the ground, his body curled up, tears streaming down his face.</p><p></p><p>This was the most humiliating ceremony he had ever presided over.</p><p></p><p>Even more humiliating than when the Empress was enthroned.</p><p></p><p>And this time, it was likely to be his last ceremony, as well as the last rite for the Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He, like the Empress, would become a mere footnote in history, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>Sima Riyue sat among the officials, his legs sprawled out, with no semblance of propriety. He pointed at the sacrificial platform and said, "I wonder, if the Empress were to leap from this platform, would it become an eternal legend?"</p><p></p><p>The last Empress of the empire, leaping from the sacrificial platform, might become an immortal ballad.</p><p></p><p>The officials remained silent, no one answered him.</p><p></p><p>It was the demonic tribal ruler who opened his mouth, revealing a mouthful of sharp, white teeth, "I hope she doesn't land head-first, or else my exquisite wine vessel will be shattered."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he drank his wine in a peculiar manner, biting the cup and swallowing it whole.</p><p></p><p>This strange behavior also caught the attention of many.</p><p></p><p>Sima Riyue, watching the demonic tribal ruler consume the wine cup, then glanced at Empress Jinli's beautiful, cloud-like hair, and a sense of fear inexplicably welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this extraordinary man before him seemed to be from the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he couldn't help but say, "Your Lordship has unique tastes, truly a refined gentleman."</p><p></p><p>The demonic tribal ruler poured a cup of wine for Sima Riyue, and the two men drank together, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>As for the Empress on the sacrificial platform? Who would pay attention to her?</p><p></p><p>Empress Jinli had ascended the sacrificial platform.</p><p></p><p>On the two-zhang-high platform, she raised the jade scepter in her left hand and threw a jade ring into the stone brazier with her right hand, shattering it into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Empress Jinli's voice rang out, clear as mountain springs, and majestic as the sound of a cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"The gods have mercy on my thoughts, with the jade scepter in hand!"</p><p></p><p>As her voice rose, the flames flickered.</p><p></p><p>"My heart is anxious, I seek solace from the heavens above."</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant heavens, shine down upon the world!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The incantation of the summoning ritual was not long, with a portion provided by Kong Qi.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial part, however, was the one given by Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>It was also very short, just two lines.</p><p></p><p>Jinli recited the first line carefully.</p><p></p><p>The last line did not need to be recited, she could simply think it in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Qiyuan, the Minister of Attire, has commanded, the Attire Forbidden Army, hear the order!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the sun in the sky remained the same sun.</p><p></p><p>The civil and military officials below were still listless, not taking this sacrificial rite seriously at all!</p><p></p><p>Yuguogong seemed to have already anticipated this scene, the last glimmer of hope in his eyes had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Qin Niang looked at Jinli, recalling the events in XuanYuan's forbidden palace. She still had a glimmer of hope in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial platform could not summon the legendary Attire Forbidden Army, but if the mysterious and powerful Qiyuan were to come, with his combat prowess, he might be able to resist the allied demonic tribal rulers, and break through the formations outside, and take Jinli away. This would be the best possible outcome.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Jinli becoming the Empress was due to coercion, and she was not suited to be the Empress anyway.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the Southern Qian Kingdom could continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>Kong Qi prostrated on the ground, his eyes burning with pain, his expression neither joyful nor sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>As for Jinli at this moment, she felt a mysterious connection with something in the depths of her heart.</p><p></p><p>She felt that as long as she thought about it, the Attire Forbidden Army that Qiyuan had spoken of would immediately appear.</p><p></p><p>She had almost unconditionally trusted Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>She did not immediately recite the last line, but instead looked down at the officials and military officers below the platform.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's voice was cold and carried a hint of indignation. "Sima Ting, I ask you, is there not a 'Soul-Burying Banner Formation' outside the imperial city? You have colluded with the demonic tribes and set up this formation outside the city, intending to plunge all the people of Southern Qian into eternal ruin?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli's cultivation was not high, but her voice thundered, echoing through the venue.</p><p></p><p>Many of the civil and military officials were moved, and some felt that this was Empress Jinli's final desperate struggle.</p><p></p><p>Some secretly glanced at Sima Ting, waiting for his response.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting stood up, his already tall stature towering over the rest. Facing Empress Jinli's accusation, he was calm and unhurried. "Your Majesty, why do you have to stir up trouble? Do you think these petty tricks can affect the grand scheme of things? As the ruler, you must act with dignity and righteousness, defeating evil with justice.</p><p></p><p>Demonic tricks are not the way of a true ruler! Your Majesty, you are skilled in the ways of women, indecisive and lacking in strategy and wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I am not worthy to be the ruler."</p><p></p><p>"I only ask you, is there a 'Burial Soul Entering Banner' formation outside the city?" Jinli asked again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Prime Minister Sima Ting's response, the civil and military officials present were greatly relieved.</p><p></p><p>The South Qian was Sima's, how could Sima collude with the demonic tribe and bury his own roots? Sima Riyue, who was standing aside, could no longer bear it. He stood up and boasted loudly, "Empress Jinli, this is too boring. I was hoping to see you use the Sacrificial Altar to summon the so-called Divine Court Army and have them slaughter us all!"</p><p></p><p>Sima Riyue's words sparked a burst of laughter in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone did not take the Empress Jinli seriously.</p><p></p><p>The surname of the South Qian had been Sima for twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Jinli remained unperturbed, her expression stern: "Is there a formation outside the city?"</p><p></p><p>The repeated questioning made many officials feel that Empress Jinli had exhausted her tricks.</p><p></p><p>Many secretly laughed, and some felt that Empress Jinli was doomed to an unfortunate fate, pitiful and lamentable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the demonic tribe's ruler, who had been drinking alone, unexpectedly spoke: "Beautiful Jinli, you are right. There is indeed a 'Burial Soul Entering Banner' formation set up by my demonic tribe outside the imperial city!"</p><p></p><p>This statement shocked the entire hall.</p><p></p><p>"Prime Minister?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this person? The 'Burial Soul Entering Banner' formation is actually real!"</p><p></p><p>The civil and military officials were stunned for a moment, then became terrified.</p><p></p><p>The demonic tribe's ruler had a ferocious smile on his face: "Sima Ting, is what I said true?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sima Ting's expression was neither joyful nor sorrowful: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>The civil and military officials were now all in a state of shock and panic, the hall erupting in commotion.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the demonic tribe's ruler suddenly roared, "A bunch of useless trash!"</p><p></p><p>He unleashed the power of a royal-level expert, and with a single wave of light, dozens of officials were killed by his hand.</p><p></p><p>The demonic tribe's ruler had a cruel smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The more chaotic, the more bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>The more blood spilled, the stronger the Bloodless Imperial Scepter he had created.</p><p></p><p>After indiscriminately slaughtering the officials, his gaze fell on Qin Shi, who was guarding the Sacrificial Altar, with a look of contempt.</p><p></p><p>Even in her prime, Qin Shi was no match for him, let alone now when she was injured.</p><p></p><p>"Vessel, I'm coming for you!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic tribe's ruler said, and his figure suddenly grew, towering over the Sacrificial Altar at three zhang (about 10 meters) tall.</p><p></p><p>Facing the royal-level expert, he still showed respect.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious beast looked at the world with mockery.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shi saw this and took to the air, her thin figure standing in front of the Sacrificial Altar.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qin Shi heard the solemn and serious chanting of Empress Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"All troops, hear my command, kill!"</p><p></p><p>And with this chanting, an unexpected event occurred that almost no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>On the Sacrificial Altar, the previously clear sky suddenly produced a large cluster of black clouds.</p><p></p><p>The thick, dense black clouds gathered together.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire imperial city was shrouded in darkness.</p><p></p><p>An aura of solemnity, mystery, and profundity permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was filled with fear, as if they could hear the thundering of thousands of troops and the awakening of the divine.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?" The demonic tribe's ruler's face showed bewilderment for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The several demonic tribe rulers outside the capital also had a look of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cold voice rang out from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Obey the order of the Head of the Robe Department, Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"Respond to the summons of South Qian Empress Jinli!"</p><p></p><p>"The four departments of the Divine Court, the Robe Department's Forbidden Army, eliminate the evil!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a beam of bright sunlight pierced through the thick black clouds.</p><p></p><p>The sky brightened.</p><p></p><p>And then it darkened again.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, near the Sacrificial Altar, there appeared thousands upon thousands of troops.</p><p></p><p>In black armor and black robes, holding golden halberds, they stood in the air.</p><p></p><p>They surrounded Empress Jinli, and at the forefront were ten powerful figures emanating a terrifying aura, all wearing black armor.</p><p></p><p>No one spoke, but they exuded an endless pressure.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have traversed the long river of history, emerging from the depths of hell like a demonic army.</p><p></p><p>They did not look down at the people below, as if disdaining to do so, but everyone felt an unbearable pressure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Robe Department's Forbidden Army formed a battle formation, holding long spears and golden halberds, announcing their arrival to the world.</p><p></p><p>Duke Yueguo stared with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The four departments of the Divine Court... the Robe Department's Forbidden Army, they have truly come!"</p><p></p><p>The prostrate great sage Kongqi was also completely stunned, weeping with joy: "Heaven blesses South Qian, Heaven blesses our Empress!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shi's heart was also shaken: "So it's all true, the Head of the Robe Department? Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>After countless eons, was there still a Divine Court, still a Robe Department?</p><p></p><p>Yes! And at this moment, the solemn and silent Robe Department's Forbidden Army finally moved. A Forbidden Army soldier in crimson armor silently flew to Empress Jinli, his voice mechanical.</p><p></p><p>"Our Mistress, I bring two messages."</p><p></p><p>"The Master says he wants to give you a cheesy love line, and with him here, no one in the four seas and eight directions can harm you."</p><p></p><p>"The Master also says..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these two messages, a resolute expression flashed in Jinli's eyes, and she looked up at the ancient Qi Chun tree at the center of the world, her eyes shining like twinkling stars.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

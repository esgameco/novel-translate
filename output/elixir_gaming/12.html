        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu did not reject Qi Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>The path of obsession is different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>As for being obsessed with games, whether there is potential... this actually depends on the person.</p><p></p><p>A sword dao prodigy, who cultivates the basic sword techniques, can also surpass the mediocre cultivators of the Nine Heavens Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>Of course, is the senior brother a prodigy? In Jiang Lingsu's view, he can be considered a genius, but he is still far from being a true prodigy.</p><p></p><p>The Great Shang Kingdom is too small.</p><p></p><p>And the Canglan Realm is too vast.</p><p></p><p>Even the family she is in is not really anything in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, remember to cultivate well, and take care of me in the future." After saying this, Jiang Lingsu returned to her thatched cottage and continued to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>He took the cultivation technique jade slips given by Jiang Lingsu and carefully read through them.</p><p></p><p>"Diabolical Soul Technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Four Ascension Technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Three Yuan Cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly read through the cultivation techniques in the jade slips.</p><p></p><p>And his innate talent of being able to see hidden information was also constantly being displayed.</p><p></p><p>【This is the Four Ascension Technique, created by the four gentlemen of Jin. On the surface, it is a high-grade cultivation technique, but in reality, it is a dual cultivation technique. If four people cultivate it together, they can reach the Jade-grade.】</p><p></p><p>The cultivation techniques are divided into Initial-grade, Intermediate-grade, High-grade, Jade-grade, Mystery-grade, and Heaven-grade...</p><p></p><p>The higher the grade, the more difficult the cultivation, but the greater the power and potential.</p><p></p><p>The jade slips contained a total of 627 cultivation techniques, most of which were Initial-grade and Intermediate-grade, High-grade was very rare, and there were only a few Jade-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was immersed in the cultivation technique jade slips for two consecutive days, and he didn't even open the game jade slips.</p><p></p><p>For him, accumulating this knowledge was of great help.</p><p></p><p>With his ability to see hidden information, he could easily create a cultivation technique, one that would not become a burden.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this cultivation technique might have limited potential.</p><p></p><p>For example... when cultivated to the Great Perfection realm, the effect would be comparable to doing a hundred push-ups in a day.</p><p></p><p>On the second night, Qi Yuan had dark circles around his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly burst out laughing, "I've got it, Dao Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, he had finally, based on the cultivation techniques collected by the Divine Light Sect and the techniques given by his shijie Jiang Lingsu, randomly created n cultivation technique prototypes, and finally succeeded with one.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>【This is a cultivation technique full of loopholes. During cultivation, there is a certain probability of memory confusion, but it can be cultivated to the Refined Qi Perfection stage.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that cultivating this technique will not become a burden for any existence.】</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very excited.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that he had studied hard and made such efforts in this period.</p><p></p><p>"I should give this technique a resounding name." Qi Yuan thought seriously.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique he successfully created naturally deserved to be treated seriously.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, he finally decided on the name of the technique.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, it shall be called the 'Qi Yuan Sutra'!"</p><p></p><p>The name was simple and easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After the excitement, Qi Yuan suddenly felt a strong sense of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed consumed too much.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I can only cultivate it to the Refined Qi Perfection stage.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, I need to attend some major lectures to fully understand the Foundation Establishment stage, and try to perfect the technique to that stage."</p><p></p><p>He picked up the game jade slip, wanting to enter, but in the end, he was too exhausted, and his eyelids involuntarily closed, and the game jade slip also merged into his body.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Jinli is doing..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Forbidden, rarely visited by people.</p><p></p><p>The Forbidden Land represents great terror. The interior of the Forbidden Land is extremely dangerous, and the Forbidden Land...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The outer area is also full of danger, and few people come to the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>Especially the legendary Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, which even the supreme emperor is said to be unable to enter.</p><p></p><p>At this time, however, a group of uninvited guests have come to the outside of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>They are seven women of extraordinary attire, and three men dressed as prisoners.</p><p></p><p>The strangest thing is that they all have a ladder on their backs.</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked towards the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, there seems to be a protective shield.</p><p></p><p>This shield, even the emperor cannot break through.</p><p></p><p>Through the shield, one can see things hundreds of meters inside the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>But even these few hundred meters, Jinli saw many terrifying beasts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the commander of the forbidden army stepped forward, her face filled with reverence: "Your Majesty, we just investigated the people nearby, and they all said that the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land is no different from before, and there is no movement from inside."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a trace of confusion appeared in Jinli's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Qiyuan had told her that he had been grinding monsters inside the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>If he was grinding monsters, then there should be some movement from inside the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land. </p><p></p><p>But the information received was like this, and she was a little hesitant.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the forbidden army next to her also had many doubts in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However, she was loyal to the Empress, unwavering in her allegiance, and would firmly carry out what the Empress commanded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Jinli gently parted her vermilion lips, her voice cold and majestic, "You, with the ladders on your backs, go to the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>Six elite forbidden army members immediately drew their swords, pointing them at the three prisoners.</p><p></p><p>Those three prisoners were all death row inmates, brought here without knowing what they were supposed to do.</p><p></p><p>They knew that the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land was a place that even imperial-level experts could not enter.</p><p></p><p>How could they go in?</p><p></p><p>But with swords pointed at them from behind, they could only slowly walk towards the forbidden land with the ladders on their backs.</p><p></p><p>Next to them, the commander of the forbidden army also finally asked, "Your Majesty, do you want to enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land? But can they really go in this way?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli was also a little uneasy in her heart, but she trusted these six women very much: "A friend told me that carrying a ladder... may be able to enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>"This... is a bit far-fetched." The commander of the forbidden army said.</p><p></p><p>The other forbidden army members also felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>And in the tall tree hundreds of meters away, there were two men.</p><p></p><p>They were people arranged by the Prime Minister Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>Since the Prime Minister did not have high expectations for Jinli's expedition to the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, the people he sent were not experts.</p><p></p><p>These two men looked down from above, their eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"What does this Empress mean? To break into the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>"Breaking into the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land is one thing, but why carry a ladder!"</p><p></p><p>"It's really ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, the world is mostly ruled by men, it's rare to see a woman as an emperor, this Empress... is too funny."</p><p></p><p>Carrying a ladder to enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, this could be said to be outrageous.</p><p></p><p>It's like saying that whoever farts the loudest can ascend to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the two men's expressions changed to one of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Because they saw that the so-called protective shield of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, which even imperial-level experts could not break through, actually let those three prisoners carrying ladders enter it openly.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's heart was also extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>What Qiyuan said was actually true.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the forbidden army and the other members all had expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But even though Jinli was excited, she maintained her composure: "Huayue, go deal with those two bugs behind."</p><p></p><p>The forbidden army member named Huayue disappeared from sight at the order.</p><p></p><p>And Jinli's gaze became profound.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, her expression complex.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing what she was thinking about.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Facing the legendary Supreme Overlord, they dared not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>According to legend, when the Supreme Overlord is angered, corpses will litter the land for miles.</p><p></p><p>The City of Evil was able to exist precisely because it had a Supreme Overlord guarding it, which was why they feared him so much.</p><p></p><p>Yet, that thunderous bolt contained a terrifying power, rushing straight towards the group.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, no!"</p><p></p><p>Those five powerful experts wanted to flee, but how could they withstand that thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>The thunderbolt struck their bodies, and they watched helplessly as their bodies turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>The five controllers of Bloodshed City perished there.</p><p></p><p>"Pu!" Ning Lao's small frame was also flung away like a kite with a broken string, landing far away.</p><p></p><p>Just the aftershock of that thunderbolt had injured her severely.</p><p></p><p>Blood seeped from the corner of her mouth, yet a sweet smile graced her face: "My lord, were you warning me?"</p><p></p><p>"Only a powerful man is worthy of me, Ning Lao!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you still care for me. This primal divine art that injured me, it's because you want me to better comprehend the primal divine arts, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao's face bore a sweet smile, looking like an obedient little wife.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were to hear Ning Lao's words, he would surely say, "Little beauty, you're reading too much into it."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know that the girl with the childlike voice was actually older than him.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raged: "Damn game, flirtatious game, always making an NPC call me 'my lord' to seduce me, yet not letting me play!"</p><p></p><p>After his divine soul had grown significantly, he tried to forcefully enter the game.</p><p></p><p>But to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Just as his divine consciousness was about to reach the game icon, it was met with an extremely powerful counterattack.</p><p></p><p>He could only let out a furious roar! At the same time, he also heard fragments of Ning Lao's thoughts, where she addressed him as "my lord".</p><p></p><p>He cursed vehemently.</p><p></p><p>"No, I must strengthen my divine soul and show this game who's boss!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Nearly two months passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes and looked at the meager increase in his spiritual power, speechless.</p><p></p><p>His strength was growing too slowly.</p><p></p><p>In these two months, Qi Yuan had focused on cultivating techniques to enhance his divine soul, while also practicing the "Qi Yuan Sutra" as a supplementary cultivation.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had tried to enter the game numerous times, but all attempts had ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>And he had heard Ning Lao's voice seven times, responding to four of them, while being too lazy to respond the other three times.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the last three instances, she hadn't addressed him as "my lord".</p><p></p><p>Others might not even be calling him, so he didn't want to eagerly approach Ning Lao.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, the Dragon Seizing Struggle is about to begin, you must go out." Jiang Lingsu, in the form of a celestial cat spirit, called out to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan looked at his disciple sister wearing a slightly thicker dress in the spring breeze, and walked out of his wooden house.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rong City, originally a mortal city under the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, in the past two months, this city had undergone a drastic transformation.</p><p></p><p>Mortals would occasionally see immortals soaring in the sky.</p><p></p><p>There were also reports of a stone giant, standing three zhang tall, carrying wooden materials and boulders, constructing palaces outside the city.</p><p></p><p>In just under two months, a series of palaces had sprung up, turning the area outside Rong City into a veritable immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, three streams of light flashed across the celestial dome.</p><p></p><p>Several voices reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"The mortal kingdom of the Great Merchant has become a cultivation realm, and this is closely related to the opening of the Dragon Celestial Realm within the city.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dragon Celestial Realm, there are many precious treasures. It is precisely because of these treasures and resources that the Great Merchant has risen to become the most powerful force within the Great Merchant Kingdom." The white-haired Kang Fulü, with his vast experience, said, "But in recent years, as the Demonic Desire Gate has grown in strength, the Great Merchant Kingdom is no longer as prosperous as it once was."</p><p></p><p>Dongxian listened to this, his heart as calm as a deep well.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the Great Merchant Kingdom was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of wanting to restore the Great Merchant Kingdom to its former glory.</p><p></p><p>For him, being strong himself was true strength.</p><p></p><p>"Now, a second Dragon Celestial Realm has been discovered outside Rong City.</p><p></p><p>That is why the location of the Dragon Seizing Struggle has been moved to the Dragon Celestial Realm of Rong City." This information was no secret, and if Qi Yuan didn't know, Kang Fulü wouldn't bother to explain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this: "So this Dragon Seizing Struggle is not only a struggle for the throne, but also a fight for resources."</p><p></p><p>He found it a bit strange, though. Rong City was so close to the Divine Light Sect, yet the second Dragon Celestial Realm had opened, and it should have been completely under the control of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan remembered that this sect seemed to be full of problems.</p><p></p><p>So it wasn't a big deal.</p><p></p><p>The sect master was a spy, and many of the elders and disciples had issues.</p><p></p><p>Even Kang Fulü, the sect master's son-in-law, had some minor problems.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that in the entire sect, he might be the only one who was truly pure and upright.</p><p></p><p>"Our biggest enemies this time are threefold: the first is the Crown Prince, backed by the Floating Mountain; the second is the Seventh Prince, backed by the Demonic Desire Gate; and the third is the Eighteenth Prince, the youngest prince, backed by... the Hall of Light."</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of Light?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up at this.</p><p></p><p>Was his white moonlight here? "The Hall of Light has deep backing, coming from the Eastern Lands. The one coming this time is called破狼, a Nascent Soul cultivator. He is not to be trifled with, and we must be cautious."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sharpened his blade eagerly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Merchant Kingdom was too poor.</p><p></p><p>It was just a village-level unit.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he hadn't encountered a single Profound-grade martial art in the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But Zhu Lianhua of the Hall of Light, his first white moonlight, was truly a person from a great land, exuding an aura of...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Profound Martial Technique.</p><p></p><p>The first White Moon Light died tragically in the Great Merchant Kingdom, and the second White Moon Light has arrived, with strength definitely stronger.</p><p></p><p>So the things on his body might be even better.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan extremely anticipate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." The man lay on the bed, his face pale, as he coughed up fresh blood, coughing incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"Father Emperor." Seeing this, the Eighteenth Prince showed an anxious expression.</p><p></p><p>This coughing man was the supreme Emperor of the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Leave." The Empress, dressed in a purple-gold long dress, with a stern countenance, said, "Your father the Emperor needs to rest."</p><p></p><p>The Eighteenth Prince left with a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, only the Emperor and Empress of the Great Merchant Kingdom remained.</p><p></p><p>"Zitong, while I was in seclusion healing, fortunately the court affairs were handled by you, thank you for your hard work." The Great Merchant Emperor wanted to reach out and hold the Empress's hand.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Empress directly stood up: "Your Majesty, you should rest now."</p><p></p><p>The Empress said, then directly left.</p><p></p><p>She had someone else to see.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, she did not want to stay here keeping company with this puppet-like Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>In the palace, the Emperor's coughing became even more miserable and desolate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteenth Prince returned to his temporary palace in Rongcheng.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even gone in yet when he heard the sound of a woman's panting from the room.</p><p></p><p>His expression was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Because that woman was his queen.</p><p></p><p>He stood outside the room, like a eunuch.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, a mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Eighteenth Prince, since you're back, then come in, I like you watching by the side."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Eighteenth Prince immediately lowered his head and entered, his face full of humble smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Broke Wolf."</p><p></p><p>He glanced around and saw his concubine on the bed, her eyes full of affection, her body half-covered in a thin veil.</p><p></p><p>Broke Wolf was already dressed, his snake-like eyes revealing dense sharpness: "How is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Eighteenth Prince lowered his head and stammered, "Mother Empress... does not wish to speak to me."</p><p></p><p>"Useless." Broke Wolf cursed him in a low voice, looking down on the Eighteenth Prince even more.</p><p></p><p>But it was this useless Eighteenth Prince that they could control the best.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Empress is unwilling to cooperate with us in the Bright Palace, then let it be for now." Broke Wolf's eyes flashed with displeasure, and he thought of something, asking, "Have the people from Shenguang Sect arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"They just arrived at the palace." The Eighteenth Prince lowered his head, full of humility, but thought of something and said in a low voice, "Mr. Broke Wolf, Seventeen Brother... is very good, in the Dragon and Tiger Immortal Realm, can you... spare him this time."</p><p></p><p>Seventeen Brother was Dongxian.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian and the Eighteenth Prince were both not favored.</p><p></p><p>And Dongxian had taken good care of him, and the two had a good relationship.</p><p></p><p>"For your sake, I can spare his life.</p><p></p><p>But those two from Shenguang Sect, I have to keep them." Broke Wolf said, a trace of murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua died in the Great Merchant Kingdom, at the hands of the Shenhua Association.</p><p></p><p>This was a great humiliation for Broke Wolf.</p><p></p><p>This scheme for the Hundred Nations was led by his master.</p><p></p><p>Once successful, his master's status in the Bright Palace would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Zhu Lianhua was killed, and it was near the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although it was the people of the Shenhua Association who killed him, they were definitely not unrelated to the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Of the two people from Shenguang Sect who came this time, whose strength is stronger?" Broke Wolf thought of something and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Kang Fuluo from Wuguang Peak has stronger strength, he is a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, and is also the son-in-law of the Sect Master of Shenguang Sect, and the closed-door disciple of the Peak Master of Wuguang Peak. He is also ranked among the top three of the Ten Talents of the Great Merchant Kingdom," the Eighteenth Prince had met Kang Fuluo and heard his long self-introduction, and remembered it.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Talents of the Great Merchant Kingdom referred to the ten young geniuses among the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Talents of the Great Merchant Kingdom?" Broke Wolf's eyes flashed with disdain.</p><p></p><p>He was a man ranked among the top seven hundred on the Eastern Land Genius List.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he looked down on the Ten Talents of the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>To him, he could kill them with a single sword.</p><p></p><p>"You and I should go out, I have a friend who also wants to enjoy, he doesn't like having people around." Broke Wolf thought of something and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteenth Prince's face still had a fawning smile as he obediently left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, it's even more luxurious than my Foundation Establishment cottage." Qi Yuan was in the palace.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the golden cups and jade plates, really wanting to take them back to the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fuluo, on the other hand, was calm and composed, slowly saying, "Soon we will meet face to face."</p><p></p><p>Now, people from all sects have arrived.</p><p></p><p>All the princes have also come.</p><p></p><p>They need to meet and then open the Dragon and Tiger Immortal Realm to compete for the Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded, he was also looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>His Broke Wolf White Moon Light.</p><p></p><p>There was still some time before the meeting, and Qi Yuan was very bored.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, his spiritual sense spread into the jade slips of the Shenhua Association.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw that in the group of the Four Great Shenhua Emperors, there were a lot of messages.</p><p></p><p>"Tell you all a good news, today I ranked 300th on the Eastern Land Genius List." The one saying this was the Rogue Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, please take care of me!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the group commented.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also had great respect for the Rogue Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was at most a top ten village-level Foundation Establishment cultivator, while his group friends were all provincial geniuses.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

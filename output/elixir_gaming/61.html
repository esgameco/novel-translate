        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The four people present had their eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>This was the Flowing Sand of the Five Elements, carried on one's person, which could increase the chance of perceiving the Qi of the Five Essences.</p><p></p><p>In the Tempering Grounds of the Five Elements, this was a precious treasure! How could the Patriarch of the Clothing Sect have it?</p><p></p><p>He was so fierce, and with the Flowing Sand of the Five Elements...</p><p></p><p>"This is what I encountered in the Core Region yesterday, and this thing is almost useless to me.</p><p></p><p>It should be of some use to you, so I'll give it to you."</p><p></p><p>The other four heard this, and their suspicions dissipated.</p><p></p><p>However, after hearing the subsequent words, they fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Useless... Useful.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Patriarch of the Clothing Sect's chance of perceiving the Qi of the Five Essences was 100%, so it was truly useless to him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, they held the Flowing Sand of the Five Essences, and their excitement had diminished.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tan Yan thought of something and suddenly said, "Patriarch of the Clothing Sect, didn't you complain that the Five Elements Perfection was too slow? Seeing this Flowing Sand of the Five Elements, I have a method, I don't know if it can be used or not."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, it seems this Flowing Sand of the Five Elements was given to the right person!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, by doing more things in the game, perhaps some new plot would be triggered.</p><p></p><p>"What method?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The formation conditions of the Flowing Sand of the Five Elements are very harsh. If it is formed, it means that there must be something in the vicinity that makes the Five Souls fear.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Clothing Sect can go to the place where the Flowing Sand of the Five Elements is formed and find that thing.</p><p></p><p>Relying on that thing, the Patriarch of the Clothing Sect can slay the Five Souls and perceive the Qi of the Five Essences faster."Tan Yan truthfully said what he knew.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and felt it made sense.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the formation of the Flowing Sand of the Five Elements was that it was scorched by the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>This means that the Five Souls fear the Great Sun! </p><p></p><p>The Great Sun is the nemesis of the Five Souls!</p><p></p><p>If he had the Great Sun, wouldn't he be able to quickly sweep away and kill all the Five Souls in the Forbidden Grounds of the Five Elements? Uproot them!</p><p></p><p>After all, they didn't call him to the party!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's desire for revenge was strong.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Great Sun... Qi Yuan immediately thought of the Daydream Incantation.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you all, I'll take my leave!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ran off in a flash, he had to find a safe place and dig a hole to bury himself.</p><p></p><p>The four people on the scene, looking at Qi Yuan's retreating figure, had different expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan recorded the fragmented Daydream Incantation.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the content on it, with a hesitant expression: "Should I really practice it? Won't there be any problems?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own "Qi Yuan Sutra".</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the problem is not that big. Cultivating the 'Qi Yuan Sutra' occasionally causes mental confusion and memory loss.</p><p></p><p>But I also feel that I'm doing well now, my spirit is very good... It's not bad either?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I don't need to fully cultivate it, I just need to simulate the aura of the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>Then use the Great Treasure Sword to unleash it, to startle those Five Souls!"</p><p></p><p>After convincing himself, Qi Yuan immediately focused his attention on the Daydream Incantation.</p><p></p><p>He did not fully cultivate it, but focused on simulating the aura of the Great Sun within it.</p><p></p><p>This kind of cultivation is very simple, and it is not a complete mastery of the technique, but it is very effective.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Qi Yuan successfully simulated it.</p><p></p><p>He was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel a bit cold?"</p><p></p><p>After coming out of the focused state of cultivation, Qi Yuan noticed a cold feeling, like a knife cutting his skin.</p><p></p><p>"Am I too empty?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but be puzzled, and then he was stunned: "Am I too empty?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he had accidentally discovered the essence of the world.</p><p></p><p>The legendary Emptiness might just be an extremely empty universe that needs to drink Kidney Treasure.</p><p></p><p>He added some more clothes to himself, but the coldness on his body had not completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>He lit a fire in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After the firewood was lit, he got up and went out, only to see the also pale-faced Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>"No... No problem." Jiang Lingsu looked a little dazed when she saw her Shixiong.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why, but recently the ice had been entering her body more and more frequently.</p><p></p><p>She now felt very cold.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that her Shixiong also seemed very cold, she couldn't help but speculate, could it be that her ice had already affected the surrounding environment? It seems that the problem with her body is quite serious.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, if you're cold, why don't you come to my courtyard? I just lit a fire, you can warm up a bit." Qi Yuan said warmly.</p><p></p><p>"No need." Jiang Lingsu curled up her body.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid of making her Shixiong cold.</p><p></p><p>She turned and went back to her room, crawling into the quilt.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu's retreating figure and couldn't help but say, "On the Seven-Colored Peak, there are two cold ones, one is Shidi, and the other is Shifu."</p><p></p><p>"No, there's also that moon!" Qi Yuan looked at the cold moon on the peak palace and blurted out.</p><p></p><p>"My enthusiasm is like a fire, it must be able to burn the ice cold in the world!" Especially after simulating the aura of the Great Sun, Qi Yuan felt even more confident.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After entering the game.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, as usual, merged with Xiaojia, and then broke into the Core Region.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Soul, Wood Soul, and the other Five Souls, seeing Qi Yuan, were enemies meeting, and were extremely resentful.</p><p></p><p>They roared and charged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, seeing this, was not flustered.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sun!"</p><p></p><p>He shouted loudly! On the blood-red treasure sword, a layer of white light appeared.</p><p></p><p>This light did not have too strong an attack power.</p><p></p><p>It really didn't increase the power of Qi Yuan's sword strike.</p><p></p><p>However, with the light appearing, the originally fierce Five Souls looked as if they had seen their natural enemy.</p><p></p><p>The organ similar to their eyes revealed a fearful expression.</p><p></p><p>The Five Souls not far from Qi Yuan, their bodies became strange.</p><p></p><p>The closer they were to Qi Yuan, the greater the effect on them, their bodies became soft and flabby, like flowing sand.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, they were like lambs awaiting slaughter!</p><p>"It really works!"</p><p>Qi Yuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He wielded the great treasure sword, slaughtering in the core region, causing heaven and earth to be overturned.</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>All the five souls he caught up to lost their combat power in a short time and were easily slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan kept killing, his eyes turning bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>The experience bar kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>The five elemental energies were also collected more and more.</p><p></p><p>"I'm tired."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had grown tired of killing.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person, even if they killed thousands of pigs, they would get tired, no, they would collapse.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the historical examples of a few hundred or even a thousand people defeating tens of thousands of troops.</p><p></p><p>He thought, those large armies were too stupid, they should just stick their heads out and let the enemy cut them down, tiring the enemy out, and the survivors would then win.</p><p></p><p>That day, Qi Yuan caused a heaven-shaking, earth-overturning slaughter.</p><p></p><p>His level had risen to 94, and his experience bar had also increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>However, he later logged off, as his body could not withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The next day, he went online on time again, continuing his slaughter in the core region.</p><p></p><p>At noon, Qi Yuan slew a water soul.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, and five colors surged in his eyes: "The five elements are now complete."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with the great sun's help, he had been rampaging tyrannically in the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>In just a day and a half, the five elements had been completed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tan Yan's voice transmission came from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Lord of the Robe Department, the five elements are complete!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Lord of the Robe Department, come out of the tempering ground quickly. We in the Five Elements Forbidden Land will have a great gift for you!"</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Forbidden Land will henceforth be under the control of the Lord of the Robe Department!"</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan's five elements were complete, five halos appeared on him, symbolizing the solidification of the five elemental energies.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Tan Yan, his eyes now bloodshot: "I'm already aware of this matter, but I won't leave here for the time being. </p><p></p><p>Give me a day, and I'll finish killing all the five souls here before going out."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then buried his head in killing the five souls again.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beings from the Outer Realm were too strong.</p><p></p><p>He was only at level 94 now, not a match for them at all.</p><p></p><p>There were monsters here, and he had to quickly kill some to gain more experience.</p><p></p><p>Tan Yan, hearing Qi Yuan's response, was somewhat surprised, and he called out loudly: "We will wait for the Lord of the Robe Department outside then."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Tan Yan's figure retreated.</p><p></p><p>Li Qin looked at Qi Yuan's towering and majestic figure: "The Lord of the Robe Department has really gone berserk, unable to stop, hasn't he?"</p><p></p><p>Constant killing can make cultivators enter a state of obstruction, turning them into merciless killing machines.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the man in red robes swallowed hard: "The Lord of the Robe Department is too ruthless."</p><p></p><p>He now regretted why he had spoken ill of the Lord of the Robe Department behind his back, and even been overheard by the Lord himself.</p><p></p><p>If the Lord of the Robe Department had gone berserk and finished killing all the five souls in the core region, would he also be killed by a single sword strike?</p><p></p><p>He was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Father! Father! Father!"</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Robe Department is suave and heroic!"</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Robe Department is truly a dragon among men, the king among monkeys!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, thinking about the imminent divine imprint he would give the Lord of the Robe Department, he quickly self-suggested that he had been calling the Lord "Father" all along in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This way, when the Lord of the Robe Department received this information, he would surely forgive him, right?</p><p></p><p>He had always been so shameless.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Level 95 already?" Qi Yuan didn't know how long he had been killing.</p><p></p><p>But there were less than a thousand five souls left in the core region.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were glowing red, and there were five halos surrounding his body, making him clearly not an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"But it's still not enough, too weak."</p><p></p><p>Now, with the help of Xiao Jia, he could only display the strength of a level 100 cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength would be no problem in dealing with the peak of the divine realm of the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>But for the demonic beings from the Outer Realm, Qi Yuan felt it was not secure enough.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating to level 999, he would have a glimmer of a chance.</p><p></p><p>At the level of nine million, he would feel a little safe.</p><p></p><p>At the level of nine million times nine million, he would dare to kill people and boldly leave his name behind.</p><p></p><p>"The killer is Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>But he knew, it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>There were only so many monsters in the four forbidden lands.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the last thousand-plus five souls and charged towards them.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Qi Yuan slew the golden soul and stopped swinging his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Almost level 96 now."</p><p></p><p>He sighed.</p><p></p><p>This time he came to the Five Elements Forbidden Land, his level had risen quickly.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, he had reached level 96 and even broken through the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>This was a good thing for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I need to take full control of the Five Elements Forbidden Land now."</p><p></p><p>"And the Five Elements Forbidden Land is going to give me a great gift, what could it be?"</p><p></p><p>After so much slaughter, Qi Yuan felt his mental illness was about to be cured, his entire being exuding a cold and ruthless aura.</p><p></p><p>He separated from Xiao Jia, and Tan Yan and the others immediately flew up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Robe Department."</p><p></p><p>They looked at Qi Yuan, and a trace of fear flashed in their eyes involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid of the killing intent emanating from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only Xiao Jia, as always, tightly grasped the hem of Qi Yuan's robe, standing behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've finished killing here, let's go out." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The group of them walked out of the Five Elements Forbidden Land together.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they left the Five Elements Forbidden Land, Qi Yuan saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>That green-robed young lady, her eyes red-rimmed, was glaring at Qi Yuan from afar.</p><p></p><p>"If you cannot slay the demonic beings from the Outer Realm, I will never be at peace with you for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>The young lady spewed her threat and then quickly left, her small and thin figure appearing somewhat desolate.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to [Foxhunter] and [Book Friend 20220606225403924] for your donations!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

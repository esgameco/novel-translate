        <h1>Chapter 348</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored the gazes of everyone and walked towards the Blood Jade Wall.</p><p></p><p>Using the Ancestral Regression Pill required the aid of the Blood Jade Wall. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also very curious about how much improvement the Ancestral Regression Pill could bring him.</p><p></p><p>According to what others said, the stronger one's innate talent and deeper one's fortune, the greater the enhancement would be.</p><p></p><p>With his brilliant aptitude, surely the ancestor at the source of this body's bloodline, the primordial seed, must think highly of him?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... invest a bit more? Directly elevate him to the realm of Ten Thousand Dao Martial God?</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan walked towards the Blood Jade Wall, the others at the base followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>They had long known that the reward for the previous mission was the Ancestral Regression Pill. Some bigwigs even thought about exchanging their Ancestral Regression Pills after Qi Yuan and the others successfully completed the mission.</p><p></p><p>Of course, now it seemed that could only remain a thought.</p><p></p><p>At present, those who followed were very curious to see what kind of achievement this ruthless Qi Yuan could attain within the Blood Jade Wall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the martial artists cultivating beside the Blood Jade Wall all woke up one after another.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan surrounded by surging blood energy, they revealed fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the group of people from the base following behind, they silently retreated from the Blood Jade Wall.</p><p></p><p>After all, the situation was unclear, so safety came first.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation? What was that?</p><p></p><p>So when Qi Yuan stepped into the Blood Jade Wall, those originally facing the wall to cultivate all withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned. He turned his head to look at everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Have you all cursed me before? Otherwise why are you so afraid of me that you're unwilling to stand with me?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the originally nervous crowd's expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No... no, we just aren't worthy... to stand with you!" Lin Yeshan boldly said.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, not worthy!" The others chimed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you bunch of old feudalists, still living in the past. Nowadays what's emphasized is... equality for all!" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Among the people at this base, a small portion were modern people, but most were actually ancient people.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lin Yeshan was an escort from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>So to say these people had feudal and stubborn thinking was probably correct.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to say more to these people. He leapt in, stepping into the location of the Blood Jade Wall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also swallowed the Ancestral Regression Pill.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, he looked inward and found that about one-tenth of the blood in his body was now glowing red like fireflies.</p><p></p><p>This blood happened to be what Qi Yuan had obtained from devouring demon races after using the Devouring Primordial Body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's body was like a leaky teapot, with red light leaking out.</p><p></p><p>"He's reacting to the Blood Jade Wall so quickly, his talent... is indeed very strong, no wonder!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is the source of his bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>"He's so strong, the ancestral bestowal from his bloodline source must be very abundant, right?"</p><p></p><p>These people were extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was already strong. If he received the favor of his ancestors, how terrifying would he become? It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a brilliant light suddenly shone from the Blood Jade Wall.</p><p></p><p>A thick beam of blood-red light leapt into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"A low-grade dormant bloodline, it's actually this... his future prospects are worrying!"</p><p></p><p>An elder who saw that blood-red light had a disappointed look flash across his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Bloodline sources were also divided into grades.</p><p></p><p>The lowest was low-grade, then mid-grade, then high-grade, and the highest was titled grade.</p><p></p><p>However, besides grade divisions, these bloodline sources had other classifications.</p><p></p><p>That was whether they were dormant or active.</p><p></p><p>Dormant meant the ancestor at the bloodline source was already dead.</p><p></p><p>Active meant the ancestor at the bloodline source was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the more active and higher grade, the greater the future prospects and gains.</p><p></p><p>A low-grade dormant bloodline was almost at the bottom level.</p><p></p><p>"Such a bloodline probably won't help him much, what a pity!"</p><p></p><p>"What pity? You're just at the Qi Blood Realm and you're pitying others? The realm he's reached without using his ancestral bloodline is one you can't reach in this lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Right, for Qi Yuan, this Ancestral Regression Pill was at most icing on the cake.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan closed his eyes, and a drop of blood inside his body boiled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... just boiled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His strength also increased a tiny bit at this moment.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, his eyes locked onto that drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless pieces of information flooded into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Through infinite time and space, he saw a blood-red world.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw a slender bone dripping with blood.</p><p></p><p>Following this bone, he seemed to see its owner.</p><p></p><p>It was an ugly-looking crawling demon beast with a large head and small limbs.</p><p></p><p>This was the bloodline source of that drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Yin God?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw the strength of the bloodline source at a glance - comparable to a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... here... why do I feel there's another me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Now, due to the Ancestral Regression Pill, his consciousness briefly stayed at the location of the bloodline source.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized there seemed to be another him here.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's part of the primordial seed's spirit!"</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, Qi Yuan figured out what that other him was - it was part of the primordial seed's spirit.</p><p></p><p>After the world reset, he had completely devoured the primordial seed and returned to himself.</p><p></p><p>As a result... there was still an overflowing part of the spirit here.</p><p></p><p>This was quite... peculiar.</p><p></p><p>"Strange... this part of the spirit seems to be dormant.</p><p></p><p>Is it... a spirit that died ten years later?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Before the world reset, the Qi Yuan transformed from the primordial seed died, and his departed soul... drifted to this place?</p><p></p><p>After the world reset, it was still here.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flickered as he thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze fell on that fragment of bone on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You're already so old, yet you're still worrying even after death. Give me your blood.</p><p></p><p>I'm someone who respects the elderly and loves the young. I'll give your blood back to you. Oh right... and give me some of my blood too!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very generous. After all, this blood had all been transformed from demon essence blood through the Devouring Primordial Body.</p><p></p><p>Giving a bit more back wasn't a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the Blood Jade Wall, everyone saw... a flash of blood light pass over Qi Yuan's body and fall onto the Blood Jade Wall.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were dumbfounded seeing this.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"How come the bestowed blood... is being taken back?"</p><p></p><p>"Did they make a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"Recognized the wrong bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>"Did the ancestor discover it's not his biological descendant? Was there a cuckold?"</p><p></p><p>These people were completely confused. This was the first time they had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>However at this moment, suddenly, another beam of blood light flew out from the Blood Jade Wall towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The originally puzzled crowd suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"They really did make a mistake. This is the real one!"</p><p></p><p>"A mid-grade dormant bloodline. Though very ordinary, it's not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Could this be Qi Yuan's true ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>But before they could think further, the Blood Jade Wall shone with brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>They saw one beam, two beams, three beams... ten beams... over a hundred beams of blood light shoot out in succession!</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of beams of light, densely packed, swarmed in like a flood of traffic, rushing towards Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... how does he have so many ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>"Low grade, medium grade, high grade, there's even titled ones!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, did the blood jade tablet break?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... his maternal ancestor... hooked up with many, and all these bloodline ancestors... recognized him as their own son?"</p><p></p><p>The people at the outpost, both ancient and modern, let their imaginations run wild, coming up with all sorts of exaggerated ideas.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they looked at Qi Yuan with strange expressions, as if watching a show and eating melon seeds.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Qi Yuan's overwhelming strength and bloody aura, they would have even wanted to pull up small stools to sit on, cracking melon seeds while making up all kinds of wild stories.</p><p></p><p>"This could totally be made into a... 'Searching for Ancestors' show!"</p><p></p><p>"Where are the ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>Wary of Qi Yuan's formidable power, they spoke very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, they recognized the wrong descendant. See, most of the blood went back!"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like those returning bloodline ancestors at most just held hands with the maternal ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"How pitiful!"</p><p></p><p>The men and women at the outpost were bursting with curiosity. They wished they could travel back to ancient times to see what kind of charming figure Qi Yuan's maternal ancestor was, to have so many... ancient ancestors wrapped around her finger.</p><p></p><p>They all thought Qi Yuan was their descendant.</p><p></p><p>Now, after entering Qi Yuan's body for a lap, they realized - hmm... he's not their descendant after all, just had a bit of their scent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these people didn't know that the red blood lights returning were... just the remnants of bloodline source ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan respected the elderly and loved the young. Not wanting these people to worry even in death, he left his blood on their remains.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for when he could connect with that part of the primordial seed's remnant soul, he could use the blood as coordinates to find those ancestors.</p><p></p><p>As for his purpose, naturally it was to respect the elderly and care for the young... to provide for them in their old age.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to join the department.</p><p></p><p>"Are these... the bloodline ancestors of the primordial seed's body? The gift... should indeed be generous. The strength... mythical?"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan's power was no longer there, his discerning eye remained.</p><p></p><p>The low and medium grade bloodline ancestors had the strength of Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>The high grade bloodline ancestors could reach the level of Great Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>As for the titled bloodline ancestors, they were mythical powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Is this what a Martial Lord is? Then... is a Martial God... a Yang Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>He dared to send blood to those dead ancestors.</p><p></p><p>For those still alive, he wouldn't bother to worry about them.</p><p></p><p>After all, when elders bestow gifts, one cannot refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. Now I'm afraid I've reached the peak of the Martial Spirit realm. One more step and I'll be a Martial King!"</p><p></p><p>Having received so many gifts, Qi Yuan's strength increased considerably.</p><p></p><p>The Martial King realm was comparable to the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Above that was Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"So killing demons is still the fastest way to improve. Hopefully next time I'll go to a more intense world with more demon beasts, and give me more... lovely ancestors."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The crowd that had been discussing animatedly suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Some people who had been wearing expressions of wonder now became completely still.</p><p></p><p>All the sad events of their lives flashed through their minds, just afraid that they might laugh at this moment and anger Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the crowd that had been both laughing and crying now all wore extremely serious expressions. Some even had sorrowful looks, with tears falling involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Did your... fathers die?" Qi Yuan's eyes showed a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jun'an Residential Complex.</p><p></p><p>New buds sprouted green leaves, adding a touch of green to early spring.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi wore a light shirt, not feeling cold at all.</p><p></p><p>"Principal, this is our residential complex. Looks nice, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi was simple-natured and at a playful age.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she was very talented and popular at Tianxuan Tower. All the teachers were friendly to her, so she wasn't afraid of cultivators like Xie Tang and was quite bold.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, there are quite a lot of people." Xie Tang nodded, casting a faint glance at the complex.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, a very ordinary mortal residential area.</p><p></p><p>"Our complex may look ordinary, but there are many impressive figures here.</p><p>For example, my dad, hehe, he's a martial artist, considered a warrior king!" Wang Zhiqi boasted.</p><p></p><p>Her father Yang Shan was indeed a legendary figure, on par with a warrior king.</p><p></p><p>This was something she couldn't brag about to her ordinary classmates and had to keep secret, but it was different with cultivators like Xie Tang.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, he can be considered outstanding among mortals!" Xie Tang praised.</p><p></p><p>Genius disciples naturally needed to be pampered.</p><p></p><p>"There's also a cat in our complex that's an internet celebrity with millions of followers!" Wang Zhiqi said excitedly. "Principal, this cat has become a spirit. It can not only cook, but also solve Rubik's cubes!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Wang Zhiqi took out her phone.</p><p></p><p>She played a video for Xie Tang to watch.</p><p></p><p>In the video, a pitiful-looking cat wearing an apron and holding a spatula was cooking. It occasionally added salt and seasonings, looking quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>"This cat is so clever. I've even held it before. It belongs to my neighbor!" Wang Zhiqi chattered on.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang watched the video with a slightly dazed expression. For some reason, she felt a sense of familiarity from this cat.</p><p></p><p>"In a world like yours, this cat is indeed extraordinary. But in the Fire Spirit Realm, it wouldn't be anything special.</p><p>Some cats in our Fire Spirit Realm have even developed spiritual awareness, with intelligence no different from humans."</p><p></p><p>"Principal, do you think this cat has talent? Could it cultivate like us?" Wang Zhiqi asked.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult." Xie Tang shook her head. "Our Xuantian Sect doesn't have cultivation methods for other species."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Wang Zhiqi looked a bit disappointed, but she raised her head and suddenly said to Xie Tang, "Principal, if you registered an account, you'd definitely have lots of followers and become a big internet celebrity!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Is that so?" Xie Tang smiled gently, her star-like eyebrows and sword-like eyes striking.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've seen someone with... eyebrows like stars! I've seen people described as having sword-like eyebrows and star-like eyes, but Principal, you have star-like eyebrows and sword-like eyes. It's so unique!" Wang Zhiqi's eyes sparkled.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang smiled: "My eyebrows are nothing special. If you saw my senior sister, you'd discover that some people's eyebrows... can actually resemble turtles!"</p><p></p><p>"What, turtles? That's so cool!" Wang Zhiqi was amazed. "When I've cultivated enough, I want to change my eyebrows into... suns!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang looked at Wang Zhiqi indulgently.</p><p></p><p>If others joked about her eyebrows, she would have cut them down with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>But Wang Zhiqi was different. She knew Wang Zhiqi had an innocent nature and meant no harm.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, her star-like eyebrows suddenly twitched, and her eyes lit up with joy: "Your residential complex really is a place of outstanding people. I've discovered two more little ones with good talent!"</p><p></p><p>Those two actually surpassed Wang Zhiqi considerably in terms of talent.</p><p></p><p>How could Xie Tang not be excited?</p><p></p><p>To think there would be such a harvest this time!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But no one took it seriously.</p><p></p><p>They just felt these two were talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi stood not far from Qi Yuan, her eyes showing curiosity. She secretly asked, "Senior, what did you comprehend? What kind of Purple Palace... are you planning to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a secret." Before completing it, Qi Yuan did not intend to tell others what kind of Purple Palace he was preparing to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi didn't say anything more, but Xie Tang glared at her.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the exchange meeting also began to get into the groove.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infant cultivators were all expressing their insights about the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Without Qi Yuan, the discussion of the Dao also got on track.</p><p></p><p>Seeing it was boring, Qi Yuan took out his phone, preparing to make a post to ask how to improve the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Collective wisdom is always better than thinking alone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the elder with the pure red mask looked at Qi Yuan and warned, "No photos or videos allowed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled and said, "I understand. Play is play, but no photos during Dao discussions."</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked elder didn't say anything more to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infant cultivators continued to discuss the Dao of the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then made a post.</p><p></p><p>"Asking those with 20cm and 36D, how to build the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>After posting the question, Qi Yuan closed his eyes to rest, but was actually pondering how to cultivate his own Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Purple Qi and the Underworld, hmm... both are very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Purple Qi goes without saying, it mostly appears at the beginning of the world's creation.</p><p></p><p>As for the Underworld, it's even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean I have to threaten the Heavenly Dao of this world?</p><p></p><p>But... why doesn't this world have a Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the Great Venerable realm, one can sense the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful Great Venerables can even capture the Heavenly Dao of small worlds and devour them.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, Qi Yuan couldn't detect any Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>How can you threaten the Heavenly Dao when it's not home?</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infants present all had joyful expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this Dao discussion meeting was quite fruitful for them.</p><p></p><p>Many Divine Infant True Lords praised each other, some even exchanged contact information.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, this Dao discussion meeting is now concluded," the elder with the pure red mask spoke, announcing the end of the meeting.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators on the scene still seemed somewhat reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, they still wanted to hear more teachings from that Purple Palace Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the pure red masked Divine Infant cultivator changed the subject: "Actually, this one invited all fellow Daoists to participate in this Dao discussion meeting for two purposes. Discussing the Dao is one, and inviting everyone to jointly plan a major undertaking is the other."</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked elder spoke, his gaze surveying everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Those who were about to leave all returned to their seats, wanting to know what the second purpose was.</p><p></p><p>"As for what the second purpose is, this old one cannot say for now. However... it is like exploring a secret realm, full of dangers and unknowns, but the rewards are also very rich.</p><p></p><p>If you are willing to go, please stay, and this old one will explain clearly what it is.</p><p></p><p>If you are unwilling, please leave immediately on your own."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone present was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually like exploring a secret realm. This world... doesn't seem to have any secret realms."</p><p></p><p>"This old man just gained some insights from the Dao discussion, so I won't get involved in these matters."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not going!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's been some years since I've had any activity. This old man is quite interested in this matter."</p><p></p><p>The nearly twenty Divine Infants present quickly communicated, and about five or six Divine Infants immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>After all, these people didn't know each other, and doing such things was very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Then, a few more Divine Infants withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Only twelve Divine Infant cultivators remained on the scene.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao approached Qi Yuan and asked softly, "Husband, are we going or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see." Qi Yuan used his ability.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his left eyebrow twitched strangely.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed a joyful expression: "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Left eye twitching means wealth, right eye twitching means disaster.</p><p></p><p>This time the left eyebrow twitched quite strongly, indicating there would be quite a lot of wealth.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Xie Tang was in a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if it were her younger self encountering such an exploration of a secret realm without knowing the specific details, she wouldn't go.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world is cruel, and many geniuses have died in secret realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, with her senior sister Xie Xinsu still missing and the Xuantian Sect in a precarious situation with scarce resources,</p><p></p><p>She gritted her teeth and decided to take the risk this time to earn resources.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>As for Wang Zhiqi, she naturally returned to the sect.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator also pondered for a while before saying, "I'll go!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining Divine Infant cultivators turned their gazes to the Purple Palace cultivator in the purple robe, anticipating his decision.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is also quite interested. I'll go."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the Purple Palace Grand Master was going, some of the remaining Divine Infants breathed sighs of relief, while others were secretly worried.</p><p></p><p>The reason for relief was that this Purple Palace cultivator was very powerful, and with him there, this exploration of the secret realm would be safer.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, during the Dao discussion, this Purple Palace Grand Master had a kind personality, and the Dao he taught was also mostly gentle.</p><p></p><p>The worry was that you can't judge a book by its cover. If this Purple Palace cultivator were to make a move, everyone present would probably suffer.</p><p></p><p>Those who remained were skilled and daring.</p><p></p><p>"Since everyone is going, those unrelated can leave first," the pure red masked elder spoke.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi and other disciples, as well as the younger generation of Divine Infants, all left.</p><p></p><p>The cruise ship became spacious, and the pure red masked elder cleared his throat: "The secret realm we are going to explore this time is not a cultivation secret realm, but... an alien relic."</p><p></p><p>"What? An alien relic?"</p><p></p><p>This statement shocked everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Decades ago, an alien relic appeared, causing a great war on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Qinyuan and the Ancient Witch Country went to war, with Canxing's tentacles reaching in to help the Ancient Witch.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after three years, the war ended with Qinyuan Country winning by a slight advantage. Qinyuan Country and the Ancient Witch Country signed a treaty to jointly explore the alien relic.</p><p></p><p>However, this exploration ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>Because the alien relic was empty, there was nothing there.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had been emptied out.</p><p></p><p>This greatly disappointed both Qinyuan and the Ancient Witch Country.</p><p></p><p>But experts from both countries judged: "The alien relic seems to have been transferred by someone who got there first."</p><p></p><p>Some experts also said this was an abandoned alien relic, and the real alien relic was still on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>The abandoned alien relic still had troops from various countries stationed there, as well as many experts.</p><p></p><p>They were all investigating where the relic had gone.</p><p></p><p>But now, the pure red masked man actually said he knew about the relic's whereabouts. How could those present not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the Sky Eye, capable of killing Purple Palace Grand Masters, was obtained from the alien relic.</p><p></p><p>If they could obtain a Sky Eye, wouldn't that mean... their sects would gain Purple Palace level combat power and foundation?</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators present all started breathing rapidly, their eyes excited.</p><p></p><p>"After this old one fortunately discovered this relic, I personally explored it, wanting to claim it for myself.</p><p></p><p>But this old one's strength was too low, and I couldn't even enter the main gate.</p><p></p><p>I've occupied the relic for over ten years without any way to enter.</p><p></p><p>That's why I've united with all fellow Daoists to explore it together."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Divine Infants present felt it was normal.</p><p></p><p>With such great benefits, everyone would naturally want to claim it for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Unable to enter alone, so he chose to make it public and explore together.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing is common in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"However, before exploring the relic, we need to agree on three rules.</p><p></p><p>Inside the relic, there can be no fighting or killing each other.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the relic, after a quarter of an hour... it's every man for himself, how about that?" the pure red masked elder continued.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," a burly man spoke up, clearly emanating the power of a late-stage Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>"How about we all make a heart demon oath, swearing to our respective Heavenly Daos?" a Divine Infant cultivator suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I have no objections."</p><p></p><p>None of the Divine Infant cultivators had any objections. Clearly, this wasn't their first time exploring a secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also nodded: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Swearing to the Heavenly Dao couldn't restrict him.</p><p></p><p>After all, when he first established his Heavenly Dao Foundation, he might have still been wary of that fat boy, the Heavenly Dao of the Canlan Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now... to be blunt, he could easily beat him up.</p><p></p><p>All twelve people present made heart demon oaths respectively.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, everyone was still wary of each other.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator looked at Qi Yuan</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Friend, we seem to have a fateful connection. Since we're entering the ruins together, why don't we look out for each other?" he said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>This fat cultivator was truly a wild dragon of the mountains, with a very nimble mind.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang beside them gritted her teeth and said quietly, "I wonder if this humble girl could have a chance to join the three of you?"</p><p></p><p>Entering the ruins alone was certainly not advisable.</p><p></p><p>She chose to trust Qi Yuan, this somewhat strange-looking cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" For Yang Shan's sake, Qi Yuan didn't refuse Xie Tang.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>Twelve cultivators descended into a deep mountain.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was lush with forests, various small insects flying about, venomous snakes appearing from time to time, and other poisonous creatures hiding all around.</p><p></p><p>Such a deep mountain would be difficult for ordinary people to survive in, but it posed no challenge for the Divine Infant stage cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>"After this old man discovered the entrance to the ruins, fearing others might find it, I set up a maze formation here. Now I will open the maze," said the elder in the pure red mask.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a hidden maze formation appeared. </p><p></p><p>As the red-masked elder performed his technique, the maze gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, many of the Divine Infant cultivators present secretly speculated about the red-masked elder's identity.</p><p></p><p>This maze was extremely intricate. Very few in the Three Realms could create such formations.</p><p></p><p>As the formation dissipated, a sinkhole came into view.</p><p></p><p>Straight bamboo grew around the edges of the sinkhole. It was bottomless and pitch black. Standing at the edge, one could faintly feel air currents blowing up, indicating there was oxygen below.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sinkhole, those present didn't hesitate and flew straight down.</p><p></p><p>The sinkhole was 500 meters deep, but for Divine Infant cultivators, it took only a single breath to descend.</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone arrived at the bottom of the sinkhole.</p><p></p><p>The red-masked elder led the way in front.</p><p></p><p>Moving forward in the sinkhole, the group discovered many caves.</p><p></p><p>The red-masked elder shrank his body and entered a small hole only the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators followed suit, shrinking their bodies to enter the hole.</p><p></p><p>It was cold inside, with temperatures below freezing. After about 15 minutes, the red-masked elder stopped.</p><p></p><p>The view suddenly opened up before them.</p><p></p><p>"To find such a difficult place, friend, your luck is truly good," a Divine Infant cultivator marveled.</p><p></p><p>"Just luck," said the red-masked elder. "This is the gate to the ruins. Unfortunately, I cannot enter. It will require all of you working together to break open the gate."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the maze formation on the gate disappeared.</p><p></p><p>What came into view was a strangely shaped gate that looked to be made of glass.</p><p></p><p>Pure and transparent, it was beautiful and magnificent, with quite a sci-fi feel.</p><p></p><p>On the glass gate were some peculiar symbols, looking odd and likely some kind of writing.</p><p></p><p>[Exploration Ship Gate, product of the Divine Han Race, requires special key to enter.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and this hidden information entered his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly stunned seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Because it was somewhat similar in style to the buildings in the ancestral lands of the Ancient Ones from the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan showed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling he was about to discover the deepest secrets of this game.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's all work together to open the gate!" the red-masked elder said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he hadn't opened the door himself indicated his strength was insufficient.</p><p></p><p>Now with more people here, they might be able to open it.</p><p></p><p>The others didn't hesitate either, quickly joining forces to prepare to use their divine abilities to break open the gate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice transmission entered the red-masked elder's ear: "Old Five, is the artifact left by the Patriarch ready? Don't make any mistakes!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, everything is prepared."</p><p></p><p>Voice transmissions continued to be exchanged. Among the twelve Divine Infant cultivators present, six had strange looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>These six Divine Infants were actually all participants in the Heaven-Overturning Plan.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Overturning Plan was to use a secret artifact left by the Patriarch to take away all the spiritual energy from the Three Realms and the Arching Stars, and relocate their sect into a large secret realm.</p><p></p><p>When they first discovered these ruins, they were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>However, even with thirty Divine Infant cultivators working together, they were unable to open this gate.</p><p></p><p>Later, the red-masked elder brought out a treasure left by the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>This treasure was said to be able to break through all defenses in the world.</p><p></p><p>But activating it required the fresh blood of at least four Divine Infant cultivators who had just been killed.</p><p></p><p>So they devised this plan.</p><p></p><p>Of the twelve Divine Infants present, half were their people, and half were unfortunate souls they had chosen.</p><p></p><p>As for that Purple Palace cultivator, they were not afraid of him either.</p><p></p><p>After all, their Patriarch was an ascended cultivator, and the artifacts he left behind were enough to deal with a Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The other Divine Infant cultivators probably wouldn't imagine that someone would bring a sect's guardian treasure away from the sect to the Arching Stars. This was very rare.</p><p></p><p>Now, having them try to break open the door was just a smokescreen.</p><p></p><p>After all, if twenty Divine Infants couldn't break it, adding one Purple Palace cultivator... still wouldn't be able to break it.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought this old man would have a chance to hunt a Purple Palace cultivator," one Divine Infant cultivator's expression was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>He also carried a sect treasure, and his target was that Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he also pretended to be exerting effort, as if trying to open the door with everyone else.</p><p></p><p>When everyone's strength reached its limit and they let their guard down, losing vigilance, then he would strike.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's all use our power!" </p><p></p><p>At the red-masked elder's words, everyone present took action.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, surging spiritual power impacted the gate, and several divine abilities also landed on the gate.</p><p></p><p>However, the gate didn't budge at all.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't hold back anymore, use all your strength!" the red-masked elder said.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Divine Infants, seeing this, knew they couldn't hide too much anymore.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, everyone else also joined in the effort.</p><p></p><p>A strange look flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "If Divine Infant power can't break it, what about Yang Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the power of a Yang Spirit erupted from Qi Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>However, his control over the Dao techniques was beyond subtle. Even as he acted, those present couldn't detect his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, the supposedly impenetrable gate shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The door opened, not bad!" the fat cultivator was overjoyed, his mood elated.</p><p></p><p>The red-masked elder's heart skipped a beat, somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when over twenty Divine Infants had worked together, this gate remained intact without even the tiniest crack.</p><p></p><p>Now... it was directly shattered? Wasn't that too fast? Should they still carry out the plan? He hesitated.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards that Purple Palace cultivator, a hint of wariness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Is this the power of a Purple Palace cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"What should we do, Old Five?"</p><p></p><p>"How did the door just open? Wasn't it supposed to be unbreakable?"</p><p></p><p>"It must have been that Purple Palace cultivator who opened it."</p><p></p><p>"Cancel the plan for now, this Purple Palace cultivator is too strong. Quickly send secret messages to call the other allies to ambush at the exit of the ruins," the red-masked elder quickly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood before the gate, no one wanting to be the first to enter.</p><p></p><p>"This gate was indeed quite solid. I used 30% of my strength to open it. Looks like there really are good things inside," Qi Yuan's eyes showed curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the red-masked elder was speechless and couldn't help but retort: "If it weren't for this Purple Palace great cultivator, we might not have been able to enter."</p><p></p><p>Even twenty Divine Infants couldn't open it.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator really loved to flatter himself.</p><p></p><p>Opened with 30% strength?</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators looked at Qi Yuan, mostly sharing this thought.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the red-masked elder, they didn't directly expose Qi Yuan's bluff.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace great cultivator smiled: "Everyone contributed. This achievement belongs to all of us, there's no need to argue over it."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao embraced Qi Yuan and transmitted: "Husband, should we kill them all?"</p><p></p><p>As a Great Venerable, the killing intent of Divine Infants was impossible to hide from her.</p><p></p><p>"No need. Wait until all their people arrive, then kill them," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>He was at the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>These people transmitting in front of him was no different from speaking out loud.</p><p></p><p>Even if these people had disguises, Qi Yuan could still see their true appearances at a glance.</p><p></p><p>For example, among the six cultivators wielding secret artifacts, one female cultivator's face was truly white, hmm, even whiter than Naizi's.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 486</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two second-tier Grand Ultimates were so powerful that even the Supremes would find it difficult to slay them, only able to severely injure them.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with Qi Yuan's relentless and devastating attacks, they were instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>This power was enough to move, astonish, and perplex the Celestial Supremes who were observing the battle.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme power, tyrannical and unparalleled destructive force, is this... also a supreme ultimate truth?"</p><p></p><p>"Even the great ultimate truths engraved in the Immortal Dao's will were instantly shattered, this power..."</p><p></p><p>Many Celestial Supremes exclaimed, shocked by Qi Yuan's previous actions.</p><p></p><p>This was the pinnacle of power, without any flamboyance, nor any ultimate truth contained within.</p><p></p><p>Just pure power! In the Taihuang Palace, the True Element Supreme's expression turned grim, his mind and spirit terrified.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Sun Supreme, with the Great Sun Supreme's position empowering him, was defeated! The Pennant Master and the Abyss Master were not even a match for the Ten-Sun Supreme... no, the Myriad-Sun Supreme?</p><p></p><p>"How could you have usurped the Supreme's position, this is impossible!"</p><p></p><p>What the True Element Supreme found the most unacceptable was not the death of the Pennant Master and the Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>But rather... the Great Sun's position had been seized! This meant that even if the Great Sun Supreme returned to the Sixth Heaven, his position would no longer exist! The True Element Supreme could not imagine what would happen.</p><p></p><p>"You are guilty."</p><p></p><p>Greeting the True Element Supreme was Qi Yuan's judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Heavenly Firmament and Earthly Wonders, you have no dignity of a Celestial Supreme, spewing profanities!"</p><p></p><p>"One sentence, seven to eight prohibited words!"</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation world's atmosphere is corrupted, and you bear responsibility!"</p><p></p><p>"Rectifying the cultivation world's atmosphere, starting with you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, and a vast fist surged towards the True Element Supreme.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, stars filled the sky, the brilliance dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The True Element Supreme's expression was terrified, letting out a miserable cry: "...Save me!"</p><p></p><p>But the first few words, as if under some mysterious restriction, he could not utter them, only managing to say the two words "Save me."</p><p></p><p>And naturally, no one answered him.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying fist landed on the True Element Supreme's body.</p><p></p><p>His entire immortal spiritual power erupted frantically, the ultimate truths activated, the space twisted and overlapped.</p><p></p><p>Under the effect of the ultimate truths, the distance between him and Qi Yuan seemed to be a hundred million miles away.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the ultimate truths, ordinary Celestial Supremes could not even approach the True Element Supreme's body.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, that fist was utterly unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-million-mile space shattered like glass, compressed and crumpled by the overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>The space broke, the unparalleled fist landing on the True Element Supreme's body.</p><p></p><p>That immense power, that agony, that annihilation, was unstoppable, unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the True Element Supreme's body and divine soul were shattered.</p><p></p><p>One fist out, the ultimate truths perished.</p><p></p><p>The dispersed remains of the True Element Supreme's body were swept away by Qi Yuan's sleeve, sent to the Underworld to be used as fertilizer.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the remaining Taihuang Palace cultivators, a trace of killing intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that this power... would not last too long.</p><p></p><p>His body, after all, was only a Purple Palace, even with the Little Bride and the Child Companion boosting him considerably.</p><p></p><p>Supporting the power of tens of thousands of Immortal Cores was still extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I'm still too kind."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had thousands of stars added to his body was, first, because he was handsome, and second, because he was benevolent.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could have used the simplest method, directly summoning star projections - to smash!</p><p></p><p>With one smash, the power would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>However, such an attack would be uncontrollable, easily harming the innocent.</p><p></p><p>The law-abiding and benevolent Qi Yuan naturally did not want the aftershocks of his battle to harm mortals.</p><p></p><p>So the stars were added to his body, and now he shone with a bloody color and scorching white light, towering like a celestial deity.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful fist once again pressed down with unparalleled might.</p><p></p><p>He showed no mercy towards the Celestial Supremes of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihuang Palace, the remaining Celestial Supremes were all terrified, sensing the threat of death.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Supreme looked at Qi Yuan's upright figure, a glimpse of a relieved smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Falling now or falling later, there was no difference.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a sudden violent tremor came from within the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>A vast and majestic aura seemed to descend from the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar echoed.</p><p></p><p>"The Sole Sovereign, the Eternal Unity!"</p><p>"Protect my Taihuang!"</p><p></p><p>In the Taihuang Palace, the remaining Grand Ultimate let out a great shout.</p><p>He was the Grand Ultimate second only to the Great Sun in the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>On his body, a token suddenly appeared.</p><p>The token was supreme, engraved with two characters, "Sole" and "Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Sole Sovereign Token!" a Grand Ultimate exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"So the Taihuang Palace has the support of the Sole Sovereign, becoming the host of the Rinyu Molting, no wonder!"</p><p></p><p>The Sole Sovereign Token radiated a terrifying aura, even more powerful than the destructive Dao Treasures.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sole Sovereign Token, Qi Yuan, could it be that you want to defy the Sole Sovereign, to resist the Immortal Dao's will?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Ultimate shouted, his voice echoing through the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Sole Sovereign Token was the symbol of the Sole Sovereign's authority and will, even the Supremes had to treat it with reverence.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Supremes of the Taihuang Palace seemed to have regained their confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace was the host of the Rinyu Molting, protected by the Sole Sovereign, how could Qi Yuan, no matter how powerful, contend with the Sole Sovereign? Could it be that he was rebelling against the heavens?</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan did not retreat, nor did he cower before the Sole Sovereign Token.</p><p></p><p>The pinnacle of power struck, colliding with the radiance of the Sole Sovereign Token!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The powerful blow shook the surrounding space to the point of shattering.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Ultimate holding the Sole Sovereign Token had blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, his figure unstable, as if he was about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you...!"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, never having imagined that Qi Yuan would dare to strike the Sole Sovereign Token.</p><p></p><p>"Those who obstruct me are my enemies," Qi Yuan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>He was also somewhat surprised.</p><p>This Sole Sovereign Token was quite formidable, having consumed a large portion of his attack.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you want to defy the Sole Sovereign, to oppose the Rinyu Molting?" the Grand Ultimate coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>Although protected by the Sole Sovereign Token, Qi Yuan's strike was too tyrannical, still injuring him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to use the Sole Sovereign to pressure me, and what does the Rinyu Molting have to do with me?" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>As a mere Purple Palace cultivator, what did the Rinyu Molting have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not fear the threat, and a powerful strike surged forth once again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Grand Ultimate in the Taihuang Palace was in an even more difficult position.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Sole Sovereign Token's protection, Qi Yuan's relentless attacks would eventually overwhelm him, and he would be crushed to death.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Supremes, Supremes, could it be that you will just sit and watch as this outsider overthrows the Taihuang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Ultimate shouted, but no one paid him any heed, ignoring him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Grand Ultimate was helpless and sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked deeply at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>"The Rinyu Molting host, please have the Sole Sovereign open the Seventh Heaven, to avoid disaster and calamity!"</p><p></p><p>With his shout, a vast and majestic aura seemed to descend from the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihuang Palace, the expressions of the Celestial Supremes and disciples turned grim and resistant.</p><p></p><p>Because the Grand Ultimate's use of the Sole Sovereign Token was to transport the Taihuang Palace to the Seventh Heaven to avoid disaster.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Heaven was only accessible to the Sole Sovereign and the special beings after the Rinyu Molting.</p><p></p><p>That Heaven was not suitable for cultivators to live in, lacking any immortal spiritual power or spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Once they entered the Seventh Heaven, they would be unable to cultivate, nor could they frequently use their Dao techniques, as there would be no way to replenish them.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Seventh Heaven was only a barren wilderness, even worse than the Lower Realms.</p><p></p><p>If they remained in the Seventh Heaven until the end of the Rinyu Molting, and Qi Yuan was not resolved, all their cultivators would perish, transformed into special beings.</p><p></p><p>This was a slow suicide.</p><p></p><p>But they could not stop it.</p><p></p><p>Because if they did not go to the Seventh Heaven, facing Qi Yuan, they had no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a chaotic, deathly aura descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The entire Taihuang Palace was enveloped by this aura.</p><p></p><p>"The Sole Sovereign has descended!"</p><p></p><p>"The Taihuang Palace is going to the Seventh Heaven... is this seeking death?"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Grand Ultimates, if they remain in the Seventh Heaven for a thousand ages, will inevitably perish!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked up, suddenly gazing at the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>In his sight, it was shrouded in darkness.</p><p></p><p>A chilling, gloomy, and deathly aura permeated and diffused.</p><p></p><p>The sky was as black as ink, deep and boundless, silent and still.</p><p></p><p>Yet Qi Yuan suddenly saw, in the pitch-black sky...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above, a multitude of strange, glaring eyes opened, emanating an eerie light.</p><p></p><p>These eyes silently stared at Qi Yuan, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>They watched motionlessly, like bats hanging upside down in a cave.</p><p></p><p>This gaze sent chills down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time Qi Yuan had felt this way.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the aura of the Seventh Heaven leaked out, completely enveloping the Taihuan Palace.</p><p></p><p>The entire Taihuan Palace, which was larger than a world, suddenly plunged into the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan abruptly saw that those indifferent eyes, after witnessing the Taihuan Palace entering the Seventh Heaven, seemed to flash with a trace of greed in their pupils.</p><p></p><p>These eyes... had consciousness?</p><p></p><p>This slightly surprised Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he had previously obtained, the spirits of the Unique Palace were the Sungods of the Sixth Heaven who had died in the Lingyao Molt, without any consciousness or emotions. Their sole instinct was to open the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>But now... Qi Yuan saw greed in their pupils.</p><p></p><p>This was different from the records.</p><p></p><p>However, what did this have to do with him? At this moment, he stood outside the Taihuan Palace, his expression complex: "Did I... destroy the Taihuan Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The world before him was barren, without a trace of the Taihuan Palace.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the Seventh Heaven and shouted loudly, "Harboring criminals is also a crime. Unique Palace, are you going to commit a crime as well?"</p><p></p><p>Sadly, the sky above remained silent, with no one responding to him.</p><p></p><p>As for those eyes, they also disappeared after the Seventh Heaven closed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that by running to another country, you can escape the law. I have the power of cross-border law enforcement!"</p><p></p><p>Whether there was a response or not, Qi Yuan still threatened them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was still no reply.</p><p></p><p>This left Qi Yuan slightly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that by hiding in the Seventh Heaven, you can talk behind my back. Even with a Heaven between us, I can still hear you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan strongly suspected that the people of the Taihuan Palace would definitely talk behind his back, especially now that he was in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he was indignant and quickly activated his superhuman hearing ability.</p><p></p><p>His ears, when listening carefully, could hear some special sounds. He might even have a chance of hearing others' thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He listened towards the direction where the Taihuan Palace had fled to the Seventh Heaven, listening intently.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his pupils became strange.</p><p></p><p>Sounds like a mouse gnawing on something, a cat gnawing on plastic, came through.</p><p></p><p>"Who's gnawing on a pork chop?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a miserable voice suddenly reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Help..."</p><p></p><p>This voice was hurried and quickly stopped, as if it had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clearly heard that the owner of this voice was the Taishentian Venerable, who had gone to the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that something terrifying had happened in the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes immediately turned to the Starry Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Starry Realm, the star belonging to the Taishentian Venerable was still shining.</p><p></p><p>This meant... he was still alive.</p><p></p><p>"Was I hearing things?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, the Shidi Venerable raised the divine throne, with the power of ten suns sweeping through the Taihuan Palace, seizing the position of the Great Sun Venerable, forcing the Taihuan Palace to retreat to the Seventh Heaven. This news caused a great uproar in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators were shocked or terrified.</p><p></p><p>After all, such an event... had never been seen before.</p><p></p><p>The Shidi Venerable soaring in the air was enough to shake the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>These tens of thousands of stars in the air... could that still be described as just shaking? At this moment, in the Violet Origin Heaven, Ziyuan Xiaolu swallowed hard: "Elder Brother Xuanyi, it's too big!"</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of stars fused into his body, and at that moment, Qi Yuan's figure had swelled to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>He stood outside the Taihuan Palace, and even the distant Violet Origin Heaven, countless worlds and countless miles away, could see his towering and majestic figure.</p><p></p><p>That size was indescribable, unbearable.</p><p></p><p>"I told you that Elder Brother Xuanyi is the top genius of the Black Abyss! He even killed the Abyss Lord with just three punches!" Ziyuan Xiaolu looked at An Xiu Lu and couldn't help but boast proudly.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to see how An Xiu Lu would refute this time.</p><p></p><p>This kind of combat power was comparable to the Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Hei Jian probably wouldn't have this kind of mighty power for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>An Xiu Lu took a deep breath: "You're right, for now, Elder Brother Xuanyi is the supreme one in the Black Abyss, but..."</p><p></p><p>"But what?" Ziyuan Xiaolu asked impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"But your chest is small!" An Xiu Lu said, walking away with her ample bosom.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Xiaolu's face immediately turned red, and she stomped her feet angrily.</p><p></p><p>She was so angry she could die! She couldn't win the argument, so she started attacking her physique, huh?</p><p></p><p>At this moment in the Violet Origin Heaven, many geniuses were shocked, and after the shock, they were delighted.</p><p></p><p>With a powerhouse like Xuanyi, what was there to fear in this Lingyao Molt? The Violet Origin Heaven would surely flourish!</p><p></p><p>Didn't they see that the Taihuan Palace had even shrunk back into the Seventh Heaven?</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ziyuan Ancestor looked at the void, a touch of emotion flashing in his heart: "You really went all out, directly killing the Abyss Lord."</p><p></p><p>The void rippled, and Qi Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Now, he no longer had the arrogance and killing intent outside the Taihuan Palace, but was dressed in an ordinary black robe, his aura appearing somewhat lazy, like a sunshine-loving introvert.</p><p></p><p>"I said I'd got your back, so of course I wouldn't go back on my word."</p><p></p><p>"What you did today truly amazed me. Perhaps... even the Venerables would be wary of you!" Ziyuan Ancestor sighed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Qi Yuan to be so strong.</p><p></p><p>"So many stars... I'm so envious!" He looked at the stars in the Starry Realm with a covetous gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I'm still too weak. If I encounter a Venerable... I still wouldn't have a chance." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was the truth.</p><p></p><p>The Venerables and the Great Dao Sovereigns seemed to be on a different level.</p><p></p><p>"Even a Venerable wouldn't have a chance against you. Who knows how many more stars you can summon?" Ziyuan Ancestor looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"As for that question... let them guess." Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan naturally didn't project all his stars.</p><p></p><p>He still had some hidden.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal." Ziyuan Ancestor heard this and felt greatly relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The stronger Qi Yuan became, the more at ease he felt.</p><p></p><p>"You must be careful of the Unique Palace. Although there are no cultivators in the Unique Palace, those spirits... are very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>They cannot descend to the lower realms, but the Lingyao Molt is still dominated by the Taihuan Palace. I don't know what schemes they might have against you!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor spoke of the Unique Palace with a wary gaze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze also became complex: "Old man, do you know much about the Unique Palace? For some reason, the entire Taihuan Palace has entered the Seventh Heaven. I have a feeling that their Sungods have all died."</p><p></p><p>"The stars in the Starry Realm are still shining, how could they have died?" Ziyuan Ancestor was puzzled. "If they haven't descended to the lower realms before the end of the Lingyao Molt, perhaps they really did all die.</p><p></p><p>For one person to force the Taihuan Palace to relocate, this is an unprecedented event."</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor thought of something: "If you want to know more about the Unique Palace, you can go see those Venerables. They may know more."</p><p></p><p>"See the Venerables?" Qi Yuan pondered, "I should indeed go see them."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also wanted to meet the Moon Goddess Sovereign and find out more about his master's situation.</p><p></p><p>Now, his game was almost loaded, and he didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, I need the blood of the Black Abyss Ancestor, the more the better." Qi Yuan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Although he had tens of thousands of stars hanging in the sky, Qi Yuan still didn't feel very secure.</p><p></p><p>He needed the Black Abyss Ancestor's blood to improve the levels of the "Ancestral Blood Technique", which could enhance his cultivation as a Myriad Dao Warrior.</p><p></p><p>The "Ancestral Blood Technique" was currently stuck at the thirteenth layer, only comparable to the Great Dao Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The room for progress of the "Ancestral Blood Technique" was still very large.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't just use a Stellar Elixir on whoever he encountered, right?</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Elixir required a suitable physique.</p><p></p><p>He also needed to improve his Myriad Dao Warrior cultivation to strengthen his physique.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he had a hundred million stars, with his current physique, he would definitely be weak.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll go see the Black Sword right away." Ziyuan Ancestor said seriously, then added, "Now that the Taihuan Palace has relocated to the Seventh Heaven, you must be careful... the Lingyao Molt... is very dangerous."</p><p></p><p>The Taihuan Palace could also use various unpredictable methods based on the Lingyao Molt.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with the Great Sun taken care of, I have no worries for now. My cultivation is still low, so what does the Lingyao Molt have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"It's so refreshing to play games without the Great Sun around!"</p><p></p><p>"You know, now that I've taken the Great Sun's position, does he still have the strength of a Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly had a thought.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor shook his head: "As for the Venerables, I don't know. If you want to know about this, you'll have to go see those Venerables."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and you need to be careful of the Dao Sovereign Assembly. The Dao Sovereign Assembly has two Venerables.</p><p></p><p>And... before the Dao Sovereign Assembly was formed, the Sixth Heaven... had no Venerables."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

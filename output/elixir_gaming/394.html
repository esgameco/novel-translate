        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Passing by the star belonging to Moon Lady Jinli, it paused briefly before the clear moon, but ultimately did not linger long.</p><p></p><p>The ten great sun golden pills made a circuit, as if saying to the one in the Tai Huang Palace, "See? We've formed an alliance with the Moon God Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Yang God Celestial Venerables of the Moon God Palace were also quite surprised. </p><p></p><p>They were unaware of this matter.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Moon God Sovereign in closed-door cultivation, they had no way of knowing this fact.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter what, this was ultimately a good thing for the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, Qi Yuan's gaze was calm: "Reflect across the myriad heavens, search for the Flowing Wind Realm."</p><p></p><p>He needed to find the Flowing Wind Realm quickly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with his home's door always open, what if thieves entered?</p><p></p><p>"Alright," the golden canary nodded eagerly.</p><p></p><p>On the star projection, Ning Tao's beautiful eyes also held a trace of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Although it's said that home is where the heart is, the Flowing Wind Realm held bits and pieces of memories unique to her and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only in the Flowing Wind Realm did he completely belong to her.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Upper Realm, Second Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Within a sacred land.</p><p></p><p>A streak of light flashed by, and a woman who looked somewhat dazed stopped in front of a cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, it's my turn to stand guard..."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" An urgent voice came from within the cave, "What, so soon? I haven't fully implemented my plan yet, how can it be time to change shifts already?"</p><p></p><p>A woman in emerald green robes appeared, her eyes filled with an anxious expression.</p><p></p><p>The dazed woman's eyes flashed with surprise: "Junior sister, aren't you usually uninterested in these matters, always urging me... to come relieve you of guard duty?"</p><p></p><p>In the Upper Realm, the domineering Tai Huang Palace had countless enemies.</p><p></p><p>When that one from Tai Huang Palace attained the realm of Great Ultimate Principle, he was extremely overbearing.</p><p></p><p>With one word, he cast down three thousand realms!</p><p></p><p>He cast three thousand worlds down to the Lower Realm, turning them into his own breeding grounds.</p><p></p><p>These three thousand worlds were naturally not Tai Huang Palace's own territory.</p><p></p><p>Rather, they were worlds without sacred lands in the lower three heavens.</p><p></p><p>Although not under the jurisdiction of sacred lands, those worlds were more or less connected to some powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>This move by Tai Huang Palace offended quite a few Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>These Yang God Celestial Venerables didn't have the courage to go to the Sixth Heaven to cause trouble for Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>But they secretly carried out sabotage against Tai Huang Palace's breeding grounds.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden was one of those who accepted sabotage missions.</p><p></p><p>She was a Mythical Realm expert, and had been responsible for the sabotage plans in the Azure Waves Realm for years.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the Azure Waves Realm had fallen from the Upper Realm and shared the same origin.</p><p></p><p>The perfection of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" could only use techniques from the Azure Waves Realm, as well as techniques brought from the Upper Realm by Shen Wushen, which may be related to this.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden raised her head, blinking as she looked at her senior sister: "Senior sister, why don't I continue standing guard?"</p><p></p><p>The dazed woman was somewhat puzzled, not quite understanding the Jade Maiden's change in attitude.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to, then you can stand guard.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, you must be careful. Now that the Ten Sun Celestial Venerables have appeared out of nowhere, those cultivators from Tai Huang Palace are on edge, biting like mad dogs. If they discover our little actions, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>The dazed woman's eyes were filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what background those Ten Sun Celestial Venerables have, and which heaven they reside in?"</p><p></p><p>This was probably also a question puzzling many cultivators in the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Heaven was so vast, with many Yang God experts.</p><p></p><p>It would not be easy for that Great Sun of Tai Huang Palace to find the Ten Sun Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Many Yang God Celestial Venerables and Mythical Realm experts were curious about the background of the Ten Sun Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," the Jade Maiden shook her head quickly, but excitement flashed in the depths of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, troubled times," the dazed woman sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what's wrong? What major events have happened recently?" the Jade Maiden asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>A complex look flashed in the dazed woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Since the Great Sun Bright Buddha entered nirvana, the Buddhist sacred lands in the Fifth Heaven had been in constant turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Several sacred lands all claimed to be orthodox, the true Buddhist sacred land.</p><p></p><p>"There are rumors of news about relics left behind by the Great Sun Bright Buddha after his nirvana. The entire Buddhist land is in an uproar," the dazed woman replied.</p><p></p><p>"Relics left by the Great Sun Bright Buddha?" The Jade Maiden also felt this was an extraordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>Whoever obtained these relics would become the orthodox Buddhist land, unifying the Buddhist sacred lands.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." The Jade Maiden glanced at the clouds high above the sacred land, her eyes filled with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>She thought of an exceptionally talented person.</p><p></p><p>Back then, that person was the number one genius of the Second Heaven, and had once traveled to the Fifth Heaven to tour the Buddhist lands, even debating Buddhist teachings with the Great Bright Buddha.</p><p></p><p>The Great Bright Buddha was convinced by him, and even wanted to take him as a disciple, but was gracefully refused.</p><p></p><p>That genius had said he was attached to the mortal world and had a dao partner, and was unwilling to enter the Buddhist lands.</p><p></p><p>He was also praised as the number one genius of the Second Heaven, certain to ascend to a divine throne and become a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>Even the current lord of the sacred land, the Celestial Venerable the Jade Maiden followed, was convinced by him when still in the Mythical Realm, and was willing to follow him.</p><p></p><p>But when the three thousand worlds fell, that genius's dao partner was in the Azure Waves Realm and also fell to the Lower Realm.</p><p></p><p>That genius gave up everything and voluntarily descended to the Lower Realm, just to find his dao partner in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying thought flashed through the Jade Maiden's mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the Ten Sun Celestial Venerables were that genius?</p><p></p><p>If so, everything would make sense!</p><p></p><p>"If not him, who else could forcibly seize the Great Sun position!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord licked the bird bone hanging around his neck, his gaze occasionally looking towards the depths of the palace.</p><p></p><p>After about a few dozen breaths of time passed, Qi Yuan appeared in a blood-red robe. The golden canary clung to Qi Yuan's arm like a chirping little bird, looking especially excited.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, I... may need your help with some matters</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm busy." Great Wisdom True Lord spoke, his expression rather embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what's the matter? We're brothers, no need to be so formal!" Qi Yuan said warmly.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord was like a lighthouse, providing much help to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you building the underworld? I was thinking, if your underworld is completed, could I place my golden elixir to reside within it?" Great Wisdom True Lord said hesitantly. </p><p></p><p>"Your... dao partner..." Qi Yuan's expression softened as he looked at Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord had cultivated the Two Elixir Method.</p><p></p><p>His dao partner had gone mad in cultivation and perished.</p><p></p><p>So, he used his dao partner's body to refine an inner elixir, and their hair to refine an outer elixir.</p><p></p><p>Now, the outer elixir had shattered into an infant spirit, while the inner elixir remained inside his body.</p><p></p><p>That golden elixir was condensed from his dao partner's body, so naturally he didn't want to shatter it.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I'll use my golden elixir to test whether your underworld is real or fake!" Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to trust me so much!" Qi Yuan increasingly felt that Great Wisdom True Lord was a rare talent.</p><p></p><p>He was constructing the underworld, providing the Strange Painter as the main commander, along with the Mountains and Seas Social Brush, and even PowerPoint.</p><p></p><p>But the Strange Painter never believed that such an underworld could truly construct reincarnation or resurrect the dead.</p><p></p><p>At most it would have some illusory effects.</p><p></p><p>Only Great Wisdom True Lord directly asked Qi Yuan to resurrect his wife.</p><p></p><p>What great trust this was! He even offered up his wife! Qi Yuan was very moved.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, give me your golden elixir. Even if I can't resurrect your dao partner, I'll absolutely keep her safe and sound!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Good brother, if you resurrect my dao partner and give me a dao partner, in the future, I'll give you a dao partner in return! If I have a daughter, I'll definitely have her become dao partners with you!" Great Wisdom True Lord said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't take advantage of me!" Qi Yuan flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, wouldn't Great Wisdom True Lord become his father-in-law?</p><p></p><p>The golden canary also glared fiercely at Great Wisdom True Lord: "He doesn't seem like a good person!"</p><p></p><p>Originally she didn't want to say this, but Ning Tao told her to say it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the secret realm, powerful figures gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Wine Master is dead, this Blood-Robed Sword Saint... is quite detestable!" A burly man spoke, killing intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had entered the Hidden World Organization on Wine Master's recommendation.</p><p></p><p>Within the organization, he was part of Wine Master's faction.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Blood-Robed Sword Saint overestimates himself, vainly attempting to challenge the Great Calamity!</p><p></p><p>Little does he know, even the Heavenly Dao of this world is but a plaything in the Great Calamity's hands.</p><p></p><p>The Great Calamity doesn't even need to act personally. With just a hint to the Heavenly Dao, it could make his every step difficult in the Azure Waves Realm, with everyone treating him as an enemy!"</p><p></p><p>For Venerable Realm powerhouses, they no longer held such reverence for the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, in some small worlds, Venerable Realm cultivators could capture the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>But if the Heavenly Dao of the Azure Waves Realm issued a decree, all cultivators must obey.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Blood-Robed Sword Saint would not only be opposing the Great Calamity, but even contending against the entire Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could he win like that.</p><p></p><p>"You all... have gone too far. No matter what, Blood-Robed Sword Saint has a fearless heart to resist the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Knowing it cannot be done yet still doing it, this kind of fearlessness should not be slandered!" An old man spoke, his voice desolate.</p><p></p><p>Many in the Hidden World Organization fell silent, clearly agreeing with the old man's words.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, weren't they also like Blood-Robed Sword Saint, full of vigor, believing themselves to be the protagonists of destiny who could resist the Great Calamity?</p><p></p><p>But later, realizing the Great Calamity's power, they became disillusioned and entered the Hidden World Organization to escape the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Neither resisting the Great Calamity, nor becoming its nourishment.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, what you say makes sense, but he killed Wine Master, and that's wrong! If we allow him to slaughter our vice leaders, where is our organization's face?"</p><p></p><p>"Right!"</p><p></p><p>"We must retaliate."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, seven or eight members agreed.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Hidden World Organization for so long, their mentality had long since changed.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Maiden is about to descend. With the Jade Maiden here, no matter how powerful this Blood-Robed Sword Saint is, he's dead either way!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, if we kill him, it's to prevent him from entering the realm of myth and becoming nourishment for the Great Calamity! Isn't this also a way of resisting the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>These seven members of the Hidden World Organization, clearly part of Wine Master's faction, reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a mystical ripple rose up on the statue enshrined in front.</p><p></p><p>All the Hidden World Organization members present had respectful looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Jade Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>These members were extremely reverent.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden was the true master of the Hidden World Organization.</p><p></p><p>Without her, they would not have become alternative myths, and would have appeared on the Myth Stele, becoming nourishment for the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Rise." The Jade Maiden spoke, raising her head to look at the ten suns in the sky, anticipation in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>As these members of the Hidden World Organization stood up and saw the Jade Maiden, their expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because the Jade Maiden they had seen before was only a projected image.</p><p></p><p>Now this... looked like a real body? The burly man who had proposed killing Blood-Robed Sword Saint was delighted and quickly said: "Jade Maiden, have you descended in your true form this time?</p><p></p><p>That's wonderful! Recently, a powerful figure called Blood-Robed Sword Saint has been acting arrogantly, killing Wine Master and not taking you, Jade Maiden, seriously! Please, Jade Maiden, take action and kill this scoundrel!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Jade Maiden, take action and kill this scoundrel!"</p><p></p><p>The several members of Wine Master's faction all spoke up, their voices excited.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden was stunned for a moment, then asked: "Is this Blood-Robed Sword Saint the strongest in this world, claiming to resist the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man quickly said: "Yes, but his resistance to the Great Calamity is nothing but a joke. Only by joining us can one avoid becoming nourishment! Please, Jade Maiden, take action and kill this person!"</p><p></p><p>A mocking look appeared in the Jade Maiden's eyes: "You want me to go kill him?"</p><p></p><p>That was the Ten Suns Celestial Lord, how could she dare!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

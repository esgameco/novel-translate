        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A blood-red light hung high in the sky, making the whole world appear especially gloomy and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable handed his form to Qi Yuan, with a rather complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to visualize more Divine Visualization Methods and distribute them to these ancient gods?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the form and nodded, "Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>"This may be somewhat problematic."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised, "What's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Originally there was no problem, but after you appeared... it became an issue. </p><p></p><p>Because... you're too good at visualization!" The Thunder God Venerable said helplessly, "The Visualization Realm actually relies on the Heavenly Pillar to exist. After the Heavenly Pillar broke, the world changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>Not only can Purple Mansions not advance to True Gods, but visualizing Divine Visualization Methods in the Visualization Realm is also restricted.</p><p></p><p>It's just that before, there were too few mythical visualizations, so no one paid attention to this restriction."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable's meaning was that Qi Yuan had visualized too much.</p><p></p><p>For example, originally the Visualization Realm could visualize 100 Divine Visualization Methods.</p><p></p><p>People from the Mortal Heart Realm could at most visualize 50, so no one would care about this restriction.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared and directly visualized 50, and even wanted to visualize more.</p><p></p><p>So, the restriction came into effect.</p><p></p><p>"The current Visualization Realm can probably only support five mythical-level Divine Visualization Methods," the Thunder God Venerable continued, "Try to leave some for the Mythical Plan... for them."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable knew about the Mythical Plan.</p><p></p><p>He neither supported nor opposed the Mythical Plan.</p><p></p><p>But now, those chosen ones of the Mythical Plan had only visualized 2 mythical-level Visualization Methods so far.</p><p></p><p>"There's such a restriction?" Qi Yuan was not anxious.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this restriction was like Purple Mansions being unable to break through to True Gods.</p><p></p><p>He could directly use the Lost Fluorescent Rod, taking the Venerables and people to travel through time and space back to the past.</p><p></p><p>The last time he went back to the past, Qi Yuan had a sudden idea to try visualizing.</p><p></p><p>He found he could enter the Visualization Realm.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that he could take all the villagers and ancient gods to the past, first to visualize, and then break through to True Gods.</p><p></p><p>In the past before the Heavenly Pillar broke, there should not be such restrictions.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes complex: "So... even if you've seen True Gods outside the Mortal Heart Realm, no matter how many or how strong those True Gods are, they cannot save the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>I don't need grand gifts, nor do I need powerful Divine Visualization Methods."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable's voice was somewhat wistful, filled with endless hesitation.</p><p></p><p>For him, Qi Yuan being born in the Mortal Heart Realm was a mistake.</p><p></p><p>Such an astonishingly brilliant talent, if placed in other worlds, might have stepped above True Gods.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could only be confined to the Mortal Heart Realm, without any hope.</p><p></p><p>"Old Thunder, you really underestimate me.</p><p></p><p>Although this game is full of restrictions, afraid players will clear it too easily.</p><p></p><p>But I can cheat, you think these little restrictions can stop me?</p><p></p><p>Just watch how I go into god mode and directly push through the Mortal Heart Realm!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The restrictions the Thunder God Venerable mentioned were nothing to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was that the Lost Fluorescent Rod only had two uses left.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't visualize whenever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>He needed to make a meticulous plan.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable's beard twitched: "I praise you a few words and you get cocky?</p><p></p><p>Push through the Mortal Heart Realm? Forget about the Above True Gods in the Heavenly Pillar, how will you deal with just those mythical-level Evil Gods? I just got news that the vanguard under the Evil God Army Commander of Qingheng Continent is already gathering.</p><p></p><p>These Evil Gods are converging on Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>The Evil God forces are stronger than imagined.</p><p></p><p>A full thirty-four Venerables, and over a thousand ordinary Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>This time, their target is not just us, they even want to sweep through all the ancient gods of the entire Qingheng Continent."</p><p></p><p>As the Thunder God Venerable said this, the worry on his face grew heavier.</p><p></p><p>Originally they had guessed there would be ten Venerables.</p><p></p><p>But it turned out to be a full thirty - the Evil God Army Commander was determined to completely sweep through Qingheng Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Sunset Slope, nice name." Qi Yuan's voice was quite delighted, his eyes shining, "Thirty-four Venerables, over a thousand Evil Gods, this is too good to be true."</p><p></p><p>It was truly a case of a pillow being sent when one was sleepy.</p><p></p><p>He had been wondering, with the Lost Fluorescent Rod only usable twice, he needed to gather more Evil God spirit power to go back to the past together.</p><p></p><p>As a result, so many Evil Gods came.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable looked at Qi Yuan: "Have you gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>So many Evil Gods were enough to sweep through all the new gods of Qingheng Continent.</p><p></p><p>Even if the ancient gods from the Southern Lands came to help, it would be too little too late.</p><p></p><p>Those Evil Gods wouldn't let them enter in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>"I think you should just go to bed!" The Thunder God Venerable continued. He didn't mention the Evil God invasion again.</p><p></p><p>He felt it was like playing the lute to a cow.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and asked: "Don't you usually sleep at night? Why aren't you sleeping this time?"</p><p></p><p>Since coming to Qingshui Village, the Thunder God Venerable had found Qi Yuan to be very strange.</p><p></p><p>He did strange things, and still needed to sleep at night.</p><p></p><p>Sleeping was fine, but he ended up sleeping hanging from trees, which was quite creepy.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you very curious why I have the confidence to be so reckless?</p><p></p><p>Even facing the Evil God allied army, I remain unmoved as a mountain." At this point, Qi Yuan spoke with a serious face.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable was silent for a moment, because it was rare to see Qi Yuan so serious: "I am somewhat curious."</p><p></p><p>"I have a secret to tell you, don't tell anyone else." Qi Yuan said secretly.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable's heart was unsettled.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable clearly looked like someone with many secrets.</p><p></p><p>And not just small secrets.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who could visualize eight mythical-level Divine Visualization Methods out of nowhere?</p><p></p><p>Now, this secret was going to be told to him?</p><p></p><p>He felt inexplicably nervous: "This old man swears, I will not tell anyone else."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan expectantly, very curious about Qi Yuan's secret.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I've formed a very powerful Golden Core." Qi Yuan's tone was very calm, but he was gloating inside.</p><p></p><p>It was finally time to show off his Star Golden Core again.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" The Thunder God Venerable was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>A powerful Golden Core? What nonsense! No matter how powerful, isn't it still just a tiny Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>He had been a True God for so many years, Golden Cores meant nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful, so what?</p><p></p><p>"My Golden Core is a star. Look up at the sky, see that? That's my Golden Core!" Qi Yuan pointed at the Star Golden Core in the sky, outwardly calm but inwardly showing off.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable couldn't hold back: "Are you mocking this old man?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Thunder, you're short-sighted." Qi Yuan sighed, "As they say, once people reach middle and old age, they can't accept new things."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had once read a passage saying that people all have nostalgia bonuses.</p><p></p><p>Things encountered in youth are all considered the best of the best in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But when they get older, they become especially resistant to new things.</p><p></p><p>"You call this a new thing? No matter how new, how can a Golden Core be a star?" The Thunder God Venerable almost cursed at Qi Yuan - was he toying with him like this?</p><p></p><p>"You don't believe me?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think anyone would believe this?"</p><p></p><p>"Fine, I'm planning to form another Golden Core. Open your eyes wide and watch carefully. In a moment, there will be another small sun in the sky."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sun's true fire continued to burn.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was devouring the second star. </p><p></p><p>It was estimated to succeed today.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan didn't sleep tonight, he was waiting to see his second golden core.</p><p></p><p>"You sure can boast. If I had half your ability to brag when I was young, how could I have worried about not finding a wife?" Thunder God looked at the star Qi Yuan was pointing to with disdain. "If your golden core is that sun, I'll eat all the shit in the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking,</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of light appeared in the night sky of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>This flash of light was not very strong, and only existed for an instant before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the spectacle in the Azure Waves Realm, it was much weaker.</p><p></p><p>This was because the Mortal Heart Realm was too far away.</p><p></p><p>And next to the small sun that Thunder God was staring at, a large sun suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God looked at the sun, completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Qi Yuan in bewilderment, his body trembling: "You kid... you were serious?"</p><p></p><p>"Awesome!" Qi Yuan was very happy, having finally formed another golden core. "See that? My second golden core, I didn't lie to you, did I?"</p><p></p><p>"..." Thunder God's mind was a bit muddled, and he finally squeezed out a sentence, "You ruthless kid, you'll achieve great things. </p><p></p><p>You formed a stellar golden core just to make me eat shit!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to cheat your way out of eating and drinking," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze dazed, his thoughts racing: "Please save the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>He almost knelt down and hugged Qi Yuan's leg.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll beat this game soon.</p><p></p><p>I've been racking my brains and have made a very detailed plan. This year, I will definitely beat this game!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mountain's face looked particularly bad: "Origin Celestial Lord is truly despicable, not only stirring up conflict, but also destroying the New God Army camp!"</p><p></p><p>"He's too bold. The New God Army is furious and has sent troops to sweep through the Azure Eternity Continent. Where should we go?" Venerable Wenyang said regretfully, with confusion about the future.</p><p></p><p>"This Origin Celestial Lord is simply a scourge, causing such a great war! I'm not worried about my own safety, I'm just worried about the billions of people in the Azure Eternity Continent.</p><p></p><p>They are so innocent, having done nothing, but as a result... they've brought on a cleansing by the New Gods, with countless lives lost!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining ancient gods mostly criticized Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As if Qi Yuan had committed unforgivable crimes.</p><p></p><p>Only some of the local ancient gods found it hard to watch.</p><p></p><p>But this was also normal.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the Ancient God Alliance, apart from the local ancient gods, the rest of the foreign ancient gods had all come to escape death.</p><p></p><p>When Flying Desolation City was in danger before, there were people from the Ancient God Alliance who went to persuade Ancient God Yuan, as well as Qi Yuan from Blue Water Village, to join the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Many foreign ancient gods joined for such reasons.</p><p></p><p>So it was normal for them to be spineless.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present argued endlessly, quarreling for over an hour without reaching a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the meeting broke up unhappily.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mountain walked together with Venerable Wenyang.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wenyang's eyes revealed a worried look: "Mountain, is that channel of yours reliable?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mountain patted his chest: "Fifty years ago, I was already in contact with Ancient God Feng Ting.</p><p></p><p>He has always been loyal to the New Gods. This time he sent me a message saying that as long as we bring people to Sunset Slope, we can join the ranks of the New Gods! However, since we're joining later, we need to work for the New Gods.</p><p></p><p>For this sweep of the Azure Eternity Continent, we need to do our part!"</p><p></p><p>"If he didn't let us do anything, I wouldn't feel at ease," Venerable Wenyang heard this and felt relieved. "I've already contacted dozens of like-minded individuals. Today we'll go to Sunset Slope together to welcome the New God army!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, for the continuation of the Mortal Heart Realm, we can only bear the name of traitors," Venerable Mountain spoke at this time, his voice quite desolate, as if he really had no choice.</p><p></p><p>"That scoundrel Origin Celestial Lord is truly despicable. He picked up some Yin Thunder Pearls from who knows where and became so arrogant, with no regard for others.</p><p></p><p>Forcing us to leave here and go be slaves for the New Gods, sigh." Venerable Wenyang lamented.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Ancient God Alliance where they had power and influence to go be dogs for the New Gods was ultimately somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"If we didn't know whether he still had Yin Thunder Pearls in his possession, I would definitely wipe them out before going to Sunset Slope and present their heads to the New God masters!" Venerable Mountain sighed.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, another star appeared in the sky last night, it's really strange."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps another True God has broken through to beyond True God."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the Mortal Heart Realm has been sealed off for so long."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>Located in the very center of the Azure Eternity Continent.</p><p></p><p>There was originally an Evil God Army camp stationed here.</p><p></p><p>In the past two days, Evil Gods have been coming here successively to gather.</p><p></p><p>Now, the small Sunset Slope has gathered over a thousand Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>The leader is named Three Flame Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Red armor completely covered his form, leaving only a pair of bright eyes exposed.</p><p></p><p>He stood on a high platform, with over thirty Great Venerables standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>In just two short days, countless Great Venerables and Venerables had come, and the Evil Gods had fully assembled.</p><p></p><p>At this time, over a thousand Venerables gathered together. Even without any words, anyone could feel the immense pressure and sense of impending storm.</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Feng Ting, wearing light armor, stepped forward at this time, his face bearing a look of joy: "Three Flame Great Venerable, Venerable Mountain of the Ancient God Alliance has brought ninety-seven ancient gods to pledge allegiance, awaiting Great Venerable's orders!"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Feng Ting's expression was solemn, but he was quite delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before the battle had even begun, nearly a hundred ancient gods had pledged loyalty. Such merit was too pleasing.</p><p></p><p>Three Flame Great Venerable's eyes also revealed a smile: "Not bad, well done."</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Feng Ting quickly said: "This is all due to your great reputation, Three Flame Great Venerable. These ancient gods simply don't dare to oppose you!"</p><p></p><p>Three Flame Great Venerable's laughter grew even more.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Venerable Mountain, Venerable Wenyang, and the other True Gods from the Ancient God Alliance lowered their heads, their expressions extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to be the vanguard, to clear the path for Three Flame Great Venerable!" Venerable Mountain pledged loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wenyang then said: "I've heard that Three Flame Great Venerable has a fire phoenix mount. I am most skilled at raising birds and am willing to be Three Flame Great Venerable's bird keeper!"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also vied to flatter, looking quite ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>This caused the New God Great Venerables present to burst into laughter, as if watching clowns.</p><p></p><p>When Venerable Mountain saw this, he didn't dare resent these New Gods mocking him, but his hatred for Qi Yuan increased manifold in his heart.</p><p></p><p>To him, all of this was caused by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the backbone of the Mortal Heart Realm was broken long ago in the Great Flood battle! Now, they're all just jumping clowns.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't cause trouble, we would have turned a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>Daring to attack the army camp, Origin Celestial Lord can be considered the person with the stiffest backbone in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>I admire such people the most. One of him is worth a hundred of you."</p><p></p><p>Three Flame Great Venerable looked at the ancient gods of the Ancient God Alliance, his words full of mockery.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, offending the Army Lord, only death can atone!"</p><p></p><p>Three Flame Great Venerable's eyes were full of sharp intent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, over a thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay on a tree, with Thunder God standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>There were also several ancient gods around, looking worried.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked lazily: "Are they all gathered?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

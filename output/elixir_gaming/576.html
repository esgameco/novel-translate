        <h1>Chapter 576</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that Biluo Shangshou would obtain a compatible heterodox fruit and step into the third layer of the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Originally, for a Yang God Realm cultivator like Biluo Shangshou who had reached the pinnacle of the second layer, it was comparable to a Realm Lord who had just entered the Rule Realm. If he could fully refine the heterodox fruit, his strength would undoubtedly increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>With such a Biluo Shangshou, he indeed had more qualifications to enter the Yihuan Assembly than Wanri Shangshou.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The Assembly Master hesitated, "but I have already discussed this matter with Wanri Shangshou. If I suddenly go back on my word, where would I put my face?"</p><p></p><p>At his level, his mentality could not be measured by ordinary standards.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes shamelessness is necessary, and sometimes face is more important than anything else.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, if you are afraid of losing face, you don't have to reveal it to Wanri Shangshou right away. Just tell him to go back and ponder it for a while.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when Biluo Shangshou completes the fusion of the heterodox fruit and steps into the third layer of the Yang God Realm, he can hold a Realm Lord Assembly and come to our Zhili Assembly to apply for the Yihuan Assembly. I'm sure Wanri Shangshou will back down and say no more," the Second Assembly Master said.</p><p></p><p>The Assembly Master hesitated: "Can this be done?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the quiet Qiyuan outside stretched and yawned.</p><p></p><p>"They've been saying that my house is missing a wall, and the Zhili Wall would be a good choice.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, the Zhili Wall is rather ordinary."</p><p></p><p>He looked through the layers of barriers, his gaze falling on the Zhili Wall.</p><p></p><p>The Zhili Wall, which had once seemed mysterious to him, now looked very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"This so-called Yihuan Assembly sounds impressive, but in reality, isn't it just a bright spiritual treasure, no different from the Jade Seal or the Heshi Jade on the Blue Star... If you get it, does that mean you have the throne, feudal superstition."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a faint, weak stream of light suddenly flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan squinted his eyes, curious.</p><p></p><p>The weak stream of light, like a green dragon, quickly and silently landed on his wrist, as if it wanted to turn into a jade bracelet and wrap around his wrist.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Qiyuan's powerful strength, the green dragon-like light was constrained.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>【The Yihuan Assembly, a Realm Lord treasure, was created by the disciples of the Immortal Realm Dao Masters.】</p><p></p><p>"The Yihuan Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that I truly have the Mandate of Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan also played along with the joke a bit.</p><p></p><p>This Yihuan Assembly was too enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him, it secretly crawled into his clothes, not at all reserved.</p><p></p><p>Was it trying to recognize him as its master?</p><p>"But I don't have a whip or candles, I don't know how to play that kind of thing..."</p><p></p><p>The Yihuan Assembly, as if it had a consciousness, transformed into a small green dragon, wagging like a little dog.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qiyuan finally said, "Ah, it must have had a bad time at the Zhili Assembly, so it's running to me for rescue.</p><p></p><p>This is not called taking, nor is it called stealing, it's called saving it from the sea of suffering."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan turned on the recording function to preserve evidence.</p><p></p><p>"Little thing, you'll follow me from now on."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan thought about it and didn't stop the Yihuan Assembly again.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lord treasure immediately transmitted a sense of jubilation, finally transforming into a green dragon bracelet and wrapping around Qiyuan's wrist.</p><p></p><p>He pulled his sleeve down a bit, feeling a little guilty.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, my skin is still too thin. Even doing a good deed makes me feel embarrassed. I really want to leave the Zhili Assembly as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I'm embarrassed, but I'm afraid the Yihuan Assembly won't do well staying in this place that gives it nightmares."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, the figure of the Zhili Assembly's Tortoise Elder appeared again.</p><p></p><p>His expression was a bit strange, and when he saw Qiyuan, he didn't dare to look him in the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Wanri Shangshou, how do you feel about what I said earlier?" the Assembly Master asked.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Qiyuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Yihuan Assembly being too enthusiastic, to be honest, he wasn't very interested in entering the Yihuan Assembly to improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>"There's still time, this era has 30 billion years left. Wanri Shangshou, why don't you go back and ponder it carefully?" The Assembly Master was very eager to get rid of him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Qiyuan was also eager to leave, his face breaking into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell."</p><p></p><p>"Farewell."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wanri Shangshou leave, the Assembly Master wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Light Sect, on the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the Yihuan Assembly on his arm with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Entering it has benefits, why not give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>After all, a free Yihuan Assembly shouldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had now reached the Yin God Realm.</p><p></p><p>His current strength had reached the Opening Heaven Realm, but it was very difficult to advance further.</p><p></p><p>After all, the next step would be the fourth or fifth layer of the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>So, after entering the Yin God Realm, Qiyuan's cultivation had stagnated, and he didn't know how to further improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>Of course, devouring the Eternal Star Pill Core doesn't count. That was the Pill Core Dao.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of his main body had not yet found a direction.</p><p></p><p>The laws of the universe? Or mastering heterodox treasures? Or strengthening his true spirit? He was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>If the Unique Palace suddenly went berserk, he wouldn't be a match for it now, and would definitely be devoured.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, if the Immortal Realm's Dao Master were to suddenly revive, facing a fifth-layer Yang God Realm Dao Master, he would be doomed.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a Dao Realm Master was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"First, I should set a small goal to improve my strength... At least to have the strength to contend with the fourth-layer Yang God Realm."</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, Qiyuan was able to contend with Hei Tian, partly because he was strong enough, and partly because he had the seven Enlightened Essences.</p><p></p><p>Those seven Enlightened Essences were the seven primal laws of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>In Qiyuan's hands, they could exert the power of half a fourth-layer Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>But even so, when facing Hei Tian, he still retreated step by step.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Master bestowing "Spring" upon him, his true spirit would have been lost and annihilated in the countless timelines of the battle against Hei Tian.</p><p></p><p>So now, although he seemed very strong, he was actually young and helpless.</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can find a way to improve my strength in the Yihuan Assembly."</p><p></p><p>"Or... if I can find news about the Divine Wood Universe, that would be good too."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Yihuan Assembly, he immediately split off a wisp of true spirit and entered it.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's consciousness went through a brief moment of confusion, then quickly became clear again.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the interior of the Yihuan Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>He looked up to see an unknown space, with a starry sky like a boundless sea.</p><p></p><p>He could not sense the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, the celestial dome seemed like a starry sea, with endless stars.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Cosmic Spiritual Sea, a place to temper the true spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's gaze turned to the vast expanse in front of him, resembling a sea, with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>In this Cosmic Spiritual Sea, countless waters were burning, and the laws of the universe were reborn or annihilated with the burning of the waters.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying auras emanated from it.</p><p></p><p>If one were at the first layer of the Yang God Realm, they would probably be burned to death just by entering the outer edges of the Cosmic Spiritual Sea.</p><p></p><p>Even at the second layer of the Yang God Realm, one could only stay on the periphery, unable to delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>"There are people in the Cosmic Spiritual Sea?" Qiyuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>With his powerful perception, he naturally sensed the various auras within the Cosmic Spiritual Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The aliens are quite open-minded... not wearing clothes in the Cosmic Spiritual Sea."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Of course, he did not perceive it carefully.</p><p></p><p>With his powerful strength, about one-third of the cosmic spiritual sea could be perceived by him.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to, all the naked existences and the ultra-clear blue light images could appear.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was an upright gentleman and did not have the habit of peeping.</p><p></p><p>However, he knew that the creatures in the cosmic spiritual sea were in a state of undress.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe my upbringing is better, you need to wear clothes in crowded places," Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he was an orphan, whether he had good upbringing is another matter.</p><p></p><p>But here were all aliens, and no one knew his background, so he could talk nonsense without any trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you the alien here?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a clear female voice came.</p><p></p><p>A tall woman in a black tight-fitting suit came over, her appearance was extremely beautiful, as if she had obtained the full love of the Creator.</p><p></p><p>Her figure was also very good, although not as well-endowed as her junior sister Jiang Lingsu, but it was still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Especially wearing the black tight-fitting suit, it perfectly highlighted her figure.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of beauty gave Qi Yuan a strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>As his eyes looked over, he immediately knew the depth of this woman.</p><p></p><p>She was a Realm Lord who had mastered the rule of beauty.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that she was so beautiful.</p><p></p><p>She gave people the concept of beauty.</p><p></p><p>Even if she looked strange, others would still think she was very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord glanced at Qi Yuan and said indifferently, "At our level, the body is just a vessel.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the cosmic spiritual sea, there are many benefits, with the spiritual sea burning and the rules constantly being extinguished at all times.</p><p></p><p>To temper the true spirit, you need to constantly resist these, where is the time to refine clothes and other external things.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, to refine the true spirit and perceive the rules, you need to get close to the cosmic spiritual sea, one more piece of clothing may reduce the chance of enlightenment a lot."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord explained to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Qi Yuan nodded, "But... I still have good upbringing."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord's words sounded good, but for him to undress in public... he still couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>"You should be a newcomer, you don't even know this rule, your strength should be average.</p><p></p><p>You look pretty good, so I'll give you a friendly reminder, don't go deep into the first hundred layers of the cosmic sea.</p><p></p><p>Also, stay away from those red lights and the ones emitting black light.</p><p></p><p>They have bad tempers, if your true spirit is not refined, you'll die here.</p><p></p><p>If you die here... in your original universe... you won't be able to revive." The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she directly undressed in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, her clothes were completely removed, without the slightest cover.</p><p></p><p>Her long legs, her upright breasts... and... filled with a sense of beauty, like the most beautiful thing in the world, making people unable to resist the urge to get close.</p><p></p><p>"You just stripped so casually?" Qi Yuan was also stunned, "You're not a celestial deity, you're a living bodhisattva!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exclaimed. The aliens were too unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord's expression did not change: "The physical body is just a shell... and in this cosmic spiritual sea, beings in human form like us are not many."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord's meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was cross-species, cross-race, whether to wear clothes or not didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>"You and I are both human-shaped." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"You look good, that's why I'll do this. If it were others... hmph." The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord said directly without any concealment, "Okay, I'm going to enter the cosmic spiritual sea."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord said, and then entered the cosmic spiritual sea completely naked.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the water was burning, and the rules were constantly being extinguished. Qi Yuan watched the Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord's delicate figure, seeing her frowning in pain, with a curious expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"She's right, not wearing clothes is very advantageous, but alas... I have good upbringing."</p><p></p><p>He wore a blood-red robe and directly entered the cosmic spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic spiritual sea, the Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord covered her chest with her hands, and when she saw Qi Yuan entering in clothes, she snorted disdainfully: "Foolish."</p><p></p><p>Entering with clothes on not only consumed more true spirit to maintain, but also made the distance from the Tao and the rules farther.</p><p></p><p>This was too much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>However, a trace of disappointment flashed in the depths of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although the physical body was just a stinking shell to her.</p><p></p><p>But if that handsome Realm Lord stripped naked in front of her, she would still appreciate it for a few glances.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan didn't undress, she didn't look anymore and focused on refining her true spirit.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan stepped into the cosmic spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he felt the endless burning water.</p><p></p><p>The rules were collapsing and being extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power constantly tore apart his true spirit and his clothes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he didn't maintain it, his clothes would have been burned to ashes the moment he entered.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's the cosmic spiritual sea, I feel my true spirit has improved a little."</p><p></p><p>"It's just... too little, and this power... too weak, even lighter than scratching an itch."</p><p></p><p>This outermost layer was probably only suitable for Realm Lords who had just entered the rule realm, and celestial deities at the second layer.</p><p></p><p>No one knew how many layers the cosmic spiritual sea had, and Qi Yuan didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>But the deeper you went, the better the effect.</p><p></p><p>The first hundred layers were only accessible to Realm Lords at the level of all things.</p><p></p><p>As for the first thousand layers, they were the territory of Realm Lords at the level of opening the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan passed by many figures and headed deeper.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first hundred layers?"</p><p></p><p>"It's still just scratching an itch, it seems that the alien woman's experience was too shallow."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>He was wearing clothes and stepped into the first hundred layers.</p><p></p><p>On the outskirts of the cosmic spiritual sea, the Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord's beautiful eyes flashed with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"He actually is at the level of all things, a Realm Lord at the level of all things has actually come to the cosmic spiritual sea for the first time, how interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Beauty Realm Lord's eyes flashed with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which faction he belongs to?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't look anymore.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan entered the first hundred layers, she could no longer pay attention to his movements.</p><p></p><p>And as Qi Yuan entered the first hundred layers, some other creatures in the cosmic spiritual sea also seemed to sense something, and glanced at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Another newcomer has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"This newcomer has some strength."</p><p></p><p>"He's actually wearing clothes, how stupid!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, who's interested in his skinny figure?" A creature that seemed to be a Boar Realm Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Beastly Rider, if you're not interested, I'm interested." A female Realm Lord's eyes flashed with a strange expression, an expression that could be called lustful.</p><p></p><p>"I bet he'll strip off his clothes before the 200th layer." This female Realm Lord said, drooling as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>She was currently standing at the 260th layer.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in her ear.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, I'm very chaste, my pure body won't be casually shown to others."</p><p></p><p>What was that saying again?</p><p></p><p>A man who is not chaste, a man who does not follow the male virtues, is not cherished by a "big woman", and doesn't even get a bride price.</p><p></p><p>And he, Qi Yuan, was a good man.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

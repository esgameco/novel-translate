        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Several black fish immediately swam towards the masked man, as if they thought he was the one who would feed them.</p><p></p><p>The masked man grabbed one of the fish with his hand - it was extremely slippery and sticky.</p><p></p><p>The fish lay quietly without struggling.</p><p></p><p>The masked man suddenly smiled: "I won't eat the fish after all."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a stream of water rose up, and the fish in his hand entered the flow of water.</p><p></p><p>The masked man looked at the black fish: "Go quickly and tell your mother, you are about to embark on a long journey."</p><p></p><p>He placed the black fish in a bamboo tube and attached it to his waist.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the corpses on the ground, a strange light flashed in his eyes: "Should I touch a corpse?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe was dressed in a black outfit, his expression extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Black Mountain Sect are living in the Chen Mansion?"</p><p></p><p>The enforcement disciple of the Golden Light Hall nodded, the anger in his eyes seeming to be about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe clenched the Yin Wood Beads, crushing them directly.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect has gone too far in bullying others!"</p><p></p><p>Just half a month ago, Chu Tianxiong had massacred the Chen Mansion. </p><p></p><p>That family was originally celebrating a joyous occasion, but dozens of them were cruelly killed overnight, including the new bride who had also passed away.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when Zheng Jianghe arrived at the Chen Mansion, he saw a scene like hell.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the father of the bride had rushed to the Chen Mansion, constantly kowtowing and kneeling before him.</p><p></p><p>The sight of the white-haired old man kneeling in front of him, Zheng Jianghe could never forget.</p><p></p><p>Especially later, when Chu Tianxiong left, that stubborn father, accompanied by his wife, knelt at the mountain gate of the Shenguang Sect, for more than ten days.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe remembered this vividly.</p><p></p><p>And now, Chu Tianxiong has chosen to live in the Chen Mansion, what is he thinking? "Let's go to the Chen Mansion!" Zheng Jianghe gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to call some people to keep an eye on the Chen Mansion, in case Chu Tianxiong committed evil acts again, but after thinking about it, he decided to go himself.</p><p></p><p>A group of people, taking advantage of the night, rushed towards the Chen Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were not very good, with a solemn look.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that they were really helpless against the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Last time it was like this, and this time it would be the same.</p><p></p><p>"The scent of blood!" Suddenly, Zheng Jianghe stopped in his tracks, sniffing hard, and then used a technique to expand his sense of smell, and the scent of blood became even more pungent.</p><p></p><p>And the source of the bloody scent was coming from the Chen Mansion ahead, where the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect were.</p><p></p><p>Worry flashed in Zheng Jianghe's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect have caused another massacre in Rongcheng? "Hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly increased their speed and rushed towards the Chen Mansion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gate creaked open, and a white-robed person wearing a strange mask walked out of the Chen Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe was startled, looking at the masked man with vigilance.</p><p></p><p>A disciple of the Black Mountain Sect? No, not that! The disciples of the Black Mountain Sect all have a faint bloody scent all over their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But this masked man did not.</p><p></p><p>How did he come out of the Chen Mansion? Where are the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect? "Senior..." Zheng Jianghe hesitated for a moment before speaking, "There are many disciples of the Black Mountain Sect in the Chen Mansion, Senior please be careful, the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect are usually fierce."</p><p></p><p>Although the other party might be familiar with the Black Mountain Sect, he still reminded him to avoid any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw Zheng Jianghe and naturally recognized him.</p><p></p><p>His voice was hoarse: "The people of the Black Mountain Sect are quite good, I wanted to eat fish, so I specially opened the gate and let me go in to catch fish."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples of the Shenguang Sect were also very surprised, somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"My wife is about to give birth, I have to go." Qi Yuan said and ran away in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Zheng Jianghe and the others in the night in confusion.</p><p></p><p>However, Zheng Jianghe soon turned his gaze back to the gate of the Chen Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got, the more pungent the bloody scent became.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sound of knocking on the door echoed, especially deep and silent in the quiet night.</p><p></p><p>But inside the Chen Mansion, it was silent, with no response at all.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe and the others looked at each other, and a terrifying thought arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He suppressed the fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Excited.</p><p></p><p>He and the others looked at each other, then lifted their feet and kicked hard.</p><p></p><p>The big door opened with a sound. The crowd looked over and all took a deep breath of cold air.</p><p></p><p>They saw that in the courtyard of the Chen mansion, there were more than a dozen corpses laid out.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe saw a head, and it was the head of Chu Tianxiong! "It's the Patriarch of the Chicken Sect, the Patriarch of the Chicken Sect!" a disciple of the Divine Light Sect shouted in trembling.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe looked over and saw that the previously mighty Patriarch of the Chicken Sect had been cut in half at the waist, his eyes wide open, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This was a Transcendent Immortal who had condensed a Golden Core!</p><p></p><p>And he died like this!</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe suddenly laughed loudly, saying "good" three times in a row! He thought of the strange person he had briefly encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that person who killed him! Although he had already guessed it, seeing it in person still shocked him greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, Zheng Jianghe quickly suppressed this emotion.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this matter was huge, with extremely serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect was not strong, with only a few Transcendent Immortals, but behind the Black Mountain Sect was the Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Someone, light a fire, burn this place down!" Zheng Jianghe directly ordered.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Divine Light Sect hurriedly sprang into action, preparing torches to set the Chen mansion ablaze.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe wanted to destroy the crime scene for the masked person.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect might not be too great.</p><p></p><p>But it's still better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the gates of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>The sunset had long since passed, and the moon was slowly rising.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Light Sect at night had a slight chill in the air.</p><p></p><p>An old man with white hair was kneeling outside the gates of the Divine Light Sect, his forehead covered in dense cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>In his declining years, he could lose his life at any moment.</p><p>Perhaps from a fall, or perhaps from just sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, go back." The old woman's hair was white and a bit messy, but from her attire, one could tell she used to be a very particular person.</p><p></p><p>"I'll kneel a bit longer, if any passing Immortal Cultivators see me, perhaps they will be moved and avenge my Qianqian!" </p><p></p><p>The old woman looked at the stubborn old man, her eyes misting over.</p><p></p><p>They, as ordinary people, lived in the world of Immortal Cultivation, where their lives were at the mercy of fate.</p><p></p><p>Born in the region of the Black Mountain Sect, their destiny was extremely tragic.</p><p>While under the rule of a great righteous sect like the Divine Light Sect, they would be much luckier.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the lofty Immortals, were they not still just insects?</p><p></p><p>Facing Chu Tianxiong, they were completely powerless to take revenge, and could only pin their hopes on the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, they were like people petitioning the authorities for justice.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, here no one was persuading them to go back.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear and melodious voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Today I caught a nice blue-green fish, I'm in a good mood, please have some fish soup."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared, holding two bowls of fish soup in his hands.</p><p>The fragrance was enticing and irresistible.</p><p></p><p>The old man saw this and his face lit up with excitement, about to kowtow: "Please, Immortal Cultivator, help my poor daughter!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his finger, a burst of spiritual power steadying the old man so he didn't kowtow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan placed the fish soup in front of the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Your matters, the sect already knows."</p><p></p><p>"Drink this soup and rest well."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned and left, having some insights: "The sage was right, if Heaven has feelings, even Heaven will age, the righteous path in the mortal world is indeed arduous.</p><p></p><p>Too much emotion leaves only regret that never ends.</p><p>Belated justice is not justice, where my heart rests is where I find peace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was just spouting nonsense again.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I hope those who hear these words of mine will not be misled by me."</p><p></p><p>With that, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As for the elderly couple, they continued to kowtow, finally with joy in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Cultivator had noticed them!</p><p></p><p>Their persistence had not been in vain.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in this world, there are more cases of persistence ending in futility.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

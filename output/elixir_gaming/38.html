        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>補痴素was dressed in a Taoist robe, holding an incense burner in his hand. The incense inside the burner was emitting a swirling fragrance.</p><p></p><p>"The three essentials of cultivating the Dao are: plain clothes, plain diet, and plain..."</p><p></p><p>Creak, the door was pushed open.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we have a customer."</p><p></p><p>The servant seemed quite familiar with補痴素, entering directly without knocking.</p><p></p><p>補痴素was not angered by this, being of a gentle temperament, and instead looked towards the visitor at the door, Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What business does the esteemed guest have?"</p><p></p><p>"I wish to publicly announce some information through your Lingtiange establishment!"</p><p></p><p>"Here is the price list, please take a look and choose which tier you would like."補痴素handed the price list to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the prices on the list, smacking his lips.</p><p>These prices were quite high. </p><p>The starting price was dozens of spirit stones.</p><p>If he hadn't made a fortune at the Heishan Sect, he wouldn't even be able to afford a single advertisement.</p><p></p><p>"I'll choose the 3,000 spirit stone tier." After some deliberation, Qi Yuan selected that tier.</p><p>This tier would be sufficient to meet his requirements.</p><p>Once many people knew the Heishan Sect had a Purple Bamboo Body, there would certainly be a frenzy to seize the corpse.</p><p>Of course, most people would not be able to recognize a Purple Bamboo Body.</p><p></p><p>"What message does the guest wish to announce?" Hearing the 3,000 spirit stones,補痴素merely gave Qi Yuan an extra glance, as if trying to guess his identity.</p><p></p><p>"The message I want to announce is... the Heishan Sect has a Purple Bamboo Body!" Qi Yuan said in a lowered voice.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Supplement's brow furrowed, his mind racing with countless thoughts. He looked at Qi Yuan and lightly smiled, "Does the guest have a grudge against the Heishan Sect? This is to make the disciples of the Heishan Sect restless, is it not?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded upon hearing this.</p><p>This person had hit the nail on the head. He wanted the Heishan Sect disciples to have no peace, even in death.</p><p>Firstly, even if there truly was a Purple Bamboo Body, it would not fall into the hands of the old demon of the Heishan Sect.</p><p>Secondly, when the old demon emerged, facing a Heishan Sect with nothing, how would he find the mastermind?</p><p>Qi Yuan was dragging everyone into this!</p><p></p><p>"If it were another establishment, they might not dare to take on this business, fearing offending the Heishan Sect. </p><p>But my Lingtiange is not afraid, I will take on this business!" Supplement said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan handed over the spirit stones, feeling a bit pained.</p><p>The spirit stones had not even warmed up before they were gone.</p><p>Fortunately, he had snatched quite a lot this time.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left Lingtiange and secretly boarded a spirit boat, returning to the Shenguang Sect overnight.</p><p>Upon returning to the Seven-Colored Peak, he immediately fell asleep.</p><p>After all, in his battle with the Heishan Sect, he had been under immense mental strain and expended a great deal of energy.</p><p></p><p>While Qi Yuan was asleep, two pieces of news swept through the cultivation world of the Great Merchant Kingdom like a whirlwind, shocking everyone.</p><p></p><p>The first piece of news: The Heishan Sect had a Purple Bamboo Body.</p><p>The second piece of news: The Heishan Sect had been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators who did not know the truth, based on the order in which the information arrived, immediately sensed an overwhelming sense of terror.</p><p>This meant a powerful expert had discovered the Purple Bamboo Body in the Heishan Sect and wiped out the entire sect, right?</p><p>Regarding the destruction of the Heishan Sect, some did not believe it, thinking it was a rumor, while others felt it was a cause for celebration. Some speculated on which mysterious expert had the audacity to annihilate the Heishan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, some quick-witted individuals donned disguises and stealthily made their way to the Heishan Sect under the cover of night.</p><p></p><p>On the Heishan Sect grounds, bodies were strewn everywhere, with blood continuously flowing.</p><p>A barefoot black-robed figure crept up to the Heishan Sect, looking at the corpses with a gaze full of surprise and excitement.</p><p>"It seems I was the first to arrive at the Heishan Sect, with my nimble mind and bold spirit!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout came from behind: "You, the big-browed and big-eyed Wudian monk, are you also coveting the Purple Bamboo Body? Do you want to find that corpse and refine it into your own Immortal Infant?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure was shocked, looking back at the three black-robed figures: "Who are you, and how did you discover me?"</p><p></p><p>"Wudian monk, who else but you would walk around barefoot every day?" a crisp female voice said mockingly, as she linked arms with another figure.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men, the two of them seemed to be companions. At this moment, an angry voice rang out: "I am the monk Wudian, who are you, impersonating me!"</p><p></p><p>Another black-robed barefoot man appeared.</p><p></p><p>The five black-robed men present looked at each other, not arguing over this matter.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect was wiped out, and then the news of the Purple Bamboo Constitution spread, the mastermind behind it... has great ambitions." The woman's voice was clear and her expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to wipe out the Black Mountain Sect, it would take at least the Demonic Infant Patriarch to take action. </p><p></p><p>But here, there is no aura of any Nascent Soul cultivator taking action, could it be... an Elixir Cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, not an ordinary Elixir Cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"The injury is from a knife, but it is actually a sword, could it be someone from the Floating Mountain?" said the black-robed man the woman was holding.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the barefoot big man hurriedly said, "Those who use swords are not just from the Floating Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Another barefoot big man was furious: "You old thing from the Floating Mountain, pretending to be me!"</p><p></p><p>The people were pondering who had destroyed the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the woman's voice said, "Whoever destroyed the Black Mountain Sect, should not be our main concern, everyone, do not forget the purpose of coming here."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they are just playing with us, there is no Purple Bamboo Constitution here at all!"</p><p></p><p>These five people's expressions became solemn, and their spiritual sense spread, scanning the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Bamboo Worms?" The woman grabbed a bug.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people's expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Where the Purple Bamboo Worms appear, there must be a Purple Bamboo Constitution that has been active for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It seems that there must be a Purple Bamboo Constitution here!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>The importance of the Purple Bamboo Constitution is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>That could be a special constitution that helps Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators step into the Purple Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>The people immediately scanned all the corpses, trying to find that Purple Bamboo Constitution.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the barefoot big man looked at a pile of mud: "The Elixir Cultivator Patriarch Yulianglang of the Black Mountain Sect is missing."</p><p></p><p>He stared at the mud, then immediately shifted his gaze away.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Purple Bamboo Constitution has already been taken by the one who destroyed the sect?</p><p></p><p>What is he doing by revealing this information, just to play with us?" The silent old man spoke up, his voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the second barefoot big man who had come seemed to have discovered something, and immediately grabbed the corpse of the Black Mountain Sect's Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Monk Wudian, how dare you!"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people saw this and immediately took action, grabbing the corpse of the Black Mountain Sect's Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the corpse of the Black Mountain Sect's Patriarch was torn into pieces by several Nascent Soul old monsters.</p><p></p><p>The poor Black Mountain Sect's Patriarch could not rest in peace even after death.</p><p></p><p>The barefoot big man was furious: "This is not the Purple Bamboo Constitution, what are you fighting me for?"</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed not the Purple Bamboo Constitution, but a Blue Bamboo Constitution, which is one level lower. By grinding its corpse into powder and cultivating a special medicinal herb, a Blue Infant Fruit can be produced, which can enhance the cultivation of Nascent Soul cultivators." The woman's knowledge was extensive, "Unexpectedly, the Patriarch of the Black Mountain Sect was actually the father, or perhaps the grandfather, of Yulianglang."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, someone discovered this early, otherwise the Black Chicken Demonic Old Monster would have entered the Purple Palace Realm within two hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the people were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>If this were to happen, the pattern of the Great Merchant Kingdom would definitely change greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, this shock was only temporary, as soon as they had snatched the corpse of the Black Wind Daoist, these Nascent Soul powerhouses started to move again.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Purple Bamboo Constitution, the Blue Bamboo Constitution, and who knows what other constitutions might appear.</p><p></p><p>These corpses... cannot be missed.</p><p></p><p>And so, a battle over the corpses broke out at the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for all this, Qi Yuan naturally did not know.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his divine lazy yawn, feeling refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I can play games in peace."</p><p></p><p>"Little Clothing Monsters, your internet mouthpiece is here!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

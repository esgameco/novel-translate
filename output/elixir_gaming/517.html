        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young girl held a vegetable knife, looking at the fish in the water with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a strange fish? It doesn't look much different from an ordinary fish."</p><p></p><p>"Do bad people have the word 'bad' written on their foreheads?"</p><p></p><p>"You make a good point, Grandpa Cai!"</p><p></p><p>The vegetable knife in her hand swung lightly, showcasing the qualities of speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that cutting vegetables has been a huge improvement for Jiang Yunxi's combat skills.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was born with a silver spoon, and had very little real combat experience.</p><p></p><p>Using a vegetable knife to cut vegetables has already been one of her few arduous trainings.</p><p></p><p>"You have slain a strange fish, gaining a slight increase in experience."</p><p></p><p>The mechanical and cold prompt came, and Jiang Yunxi blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Who is speaking? I can gain experience from killing fish, what kind of experience is this?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi kept chattering, like a firecracker that wouldn't stop.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, by killing the strange fish, I'm the one gaining experience." Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"You're gaining experience, what am I gaining?"</p><p></p><p>"You're gaining... experience in killing fish, so in the future when you cook, you'll be able to kill fish quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't just stand there, there are still many strange fish in the lake, hurry and kill them."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, just now if I hadn't turned my head, you would have overturned the boat!"</p><p></p><p>"Sorry!"</p><p></p><p>"Your knife skills are not bad, you've already cut the strange spirits into sashimi."</p><p></p><p>"What sashimi, this is just sliced dead fish, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Yeshan Lake, battles kept occurring, and Jiang Yunxi held a vegetable knife, continuously slaying the fish in the lake.</p><p></p><p>Her expression was focused, with a joyful look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>To her, every strange spirit must be killed.</p><p></p><p>Her amazing perseverance had no audience.</p><p></p><p>But this didn't matter, she would go back and write in her diary, recording this passionate and perilous battle.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Cloud Li and Cloud Hu on the boat were a bit dizzy, the two slightly seasick.</p><p></p><p>"The princess... does have some strength."</p><p></p><p>"Just taking out her anger on these ordinary fish is really..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, they are just fish, as long as she doesn't go too deep or encounter the Water Lord, everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>"It's getting dark soon, I guess we'll be heading back soon."</p><p></p><p>"The princess is afraid of the dark."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Yeshan Lake, a snake-like man slid into the water, entering an underwater palace.</p><p></p><p>If there was a Martial Cultivator here, they would definitely recognize this person as an Elder of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>After all, the art of combining humans and strange spirits is something the Thorny Blood has done the most.</p><p></p><p>The snake-like Elder entered the underground palace, walking deeper inside.</p><p></p><p>The environment changed, the original water disappeared, as if there was a water-repelling pearl.</p><p></p><p>The underwater palace was no different from the land above.</p><p></p><p>A faint bloody smell came, mixed with a rusty taste.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" The snake-like Elder twisted his body, his snake-like eyes cold.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Elder, the strange spirit blood has been refined almost completely, it's just... the little darlings we released earlier seem to have been killed by a young girl.</p><p></p><p>She was followed by two Earth-ranked Martial Cultivators, so we didn't dare to make a move." The gray-robed man said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The snake-like Elder's cold eyes flashed with a chilling coldness, "They've been discovered, no, if they were discovered, the current Tian Sect wouldn't have reacted this way, it must be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>You keep an eye on this matter, tomorrow release more fish, I want this entire water area to become a strange domain!"</p><p></p><p>The snake-like Elder's face was ferocious, his smile particularly chilling.</p><p></p><p>"Once the strange domain is formed, and with the help of the Water Lord, this Jining Prefecture will become my domain, even if Earth-ranked Martial Cultivators come, they won't be able to do anything to me!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Today was another diligent day, I've slain quite a few strange fish.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, I'm really so great, silently contributing to this world, not for fame, deeply hiding my achievements and name."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi wrote this passage in her diary.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the quiet vegetable knife spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you noticed that the strange fish have been increasing lately?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Yunxi tilted her head in thought, her expression becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, the strange fish seem to be increasing, I can't kill them all."</p><p></p><p>"There are too many fish, your hands alone can't keep up with how fast they're multiplying."</p><p></p><p>"Then what should I do?" Jiang Yunxi looked worried.</p><p></p><p>"You need to upgrade your equipment."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Killing fish is too slow, you need an electric fish, a lightning strike, and the fish will die in droves!"</p><p></p><p>Although using electric fishing is unethical on the Blue Star, this is the Qingshan Realm, and using electricity on strange fish is not illegal.</p><p></p><p>"How do I electrify them?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, you go buy some materials, help me evolve a bit, and I'll be able to increase my lightning attribute.</p><p></p><p>However, these materials are very precious, generally hard to come by." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He had a lot of money, but when it came to buying forging materials, many materials were out of stock.</p><p></p><p>This Jiang Yunxi looked like a "rich fool", so she probably had many channels.</p><p></p><p>"If you're short on money, go find the old man, he has a lot of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you list out the materials, I'll go buy them tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Jiang Yunxi didn't cut vegetables, she put the vegetable knife in her bag and hung it at her waist, then headed into the city.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, she stopped in front of an ancient-looking pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This pavilion was only fifteen meters high, and the most eye-catching thing was that it looked weathered, as if a gust of wind would blow it down.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I'm well-informed and know about this branch of the Tian Gong Hall, the precious materials in the Tian Gong Hall are even more than the Forging Association."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi thought to herself as she went to the Tian Gong Hall branch.</p><p></p><p>A young man blocked her path.</p><p></p><p>"Private area, no entry allowed."</p><p></p><p>Some Tian Gong Hall branches were forbidden for people to enter and did not conduct transactions.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a VIP of the Tian Gong Hall!" Jiang Yunxi took out a jade token.</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression immediately changed, revealing a flattering demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"Take me to your treasure trove, I want to buy some materials."</p><p></p><p>Many of the Tian Gong Hall's precious materials were not open to the public, but exceptions were made for VIPs like Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was in a good mood as the young man led her to the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure trove of the Tian Gong Hall is full of treasures, the precious items inside are even more than the Forging Association."</p><p></p><p>After entering the Tian Gong Hall, Jiang Yunxi looked at the various materials and said to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The young man next to her proudly smiled, but was somewhat suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Who was this VIP talking to?</p><p></p><p>"I need Sky Thunder Wood, Fang Xuan Stone, Tan Vermilion Sand..." Jiang Yunxi listed the materials Qi Yuan needed.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait, Your Highness, I'll have someone fetch them right away." The young man said, his heart somewhat shaken.</p><p></p><p>Because the materials Jiang Yunxi mentioned were already worth over 300,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious about the identity of this VIP, this was... too extravagant?</p><p></p><p>The young man left, and Jiang Yunxi sat in the armchair, swinging her legs, looking quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour passed, and the sound of footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>A petite woman pushed open the door and entered, and when she saw Jiang Yunxi, a flash of surprise appeared in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yunxi, so it's you!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ye Zhan, what are you doing here?" Jiang Yunxi's eyes shone with delight.</p><p></p><p>It was the VIP jade token that Ye Zhan had given her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also sensed the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was a familiar person, the one who had once invited him to join the Tian Gong Hall.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have much of a reaction, continuing to rest.</p><p></p><p>"I heard this branch had a VIP guest making a large purchase of precious materials, I didn't expect it to be you." Ye Zhan's eyes held a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was a princess, but she had no talent for forging.</p><p></p><p>"What are you buying these materials for?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Zhan was straightforward, and her relationship with Jiang Yunxi was quite good, so she asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, it's a secret." Jiang Yunxi wasn't stupid, she didn't reveal it.</p><p></p><p>"These materials add up to 300,000 taels, sister Yunxi... could it be you've been tricked by some scoundrel?" Ye Zhan's voice turned slightly cold, with some worry.</p><p></p><p>This sister was a rich fool, 300,000 taels was such a large sum, she must have "stolen" it to obtain.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid Jiang Yunxi had been tricked by some young forger into being scammed and robbed.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ye Zhan, don't worry, I'm not that stupid, this money isn't mine." Jiang Yunxi said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>You're not stupid? </p><p></p><p>Ye Zhan thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>But since it wasn't Jiang Yunxi's money, she felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was out on her own, she must have someone protecting her in the back, so she shouldn't have fallen into any dangerous situations.</p><p></p><p>"If you're so lacking in materials, you should consider participating in the upcoming Forging Competition, there should be some precious materials appearing there." Ye Zhan casually said, but there was a lingering cloud in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now in Yeshan Lake, powerful figures from all sides had gathered, especially forgers.</p><p></p><p>The famous Fire Roc Forger, as well as other Earth-ranked Forgers, had all gathered, all watching the Mighty Dragon Xuanuan.</p><p></p><p>But these people, no one had the confidence to repair the Mighty Dragon Xuanuan.</p><p></p><p>Even Earth-ranked Martial Cultivators couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>The rest could they? This Forging Competition, it was likely to end in failure, the Water Lord... would be hard to overcome.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I don't have the time." </p><p></p><p>The materials she just purchased were enough to upgrade the vegetable knife, so Jiang Yunxi wouldn't participate in the Forging Competition.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you the one who loves to join in the fun the most?" Ye Zhan was curious.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ye Zhan, I'll tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone." Jiang Yunxi spoke in a hushed tone, unable to contain her words.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi looked around cautiously, seeing no one around, she then spoke seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I've recently encountered an immortal elder!"</p><p></p><p>A scammer, more like? Ye Zhan thought.</p><p></p><p>"He said I have extraordinary talents and have the hope of saving the world!"</p><p></p><p>Sister Yunxi, you should look in the mirror, and you're going to save the world?</p><p></p><p>"During this period, I've been training crazily, I can cut 300 jin of cabbage and 70 jin of meat into mincemeat every day!"</p><p></p><p>Do you even hear what you're saying, who saves the world by cutting vegetables? "Not only that, these past few days I've also graduated, and I've been secretly killing strange spirits in Yeshan Lake every day, just yesterday I killed hundreds of strange spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Using "spirits" to describe strange spirits, are you treating them like fish?</p><p>And killing hundreds a day, what about the cabbage?</p><p>"Sister, you're really amazing, you'll definitely go down in history!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, there have been more and more strange spirits lately, I can't be lazy like before, I have to work hard to slay the strange spirits, and restore this world to peace!"  Jiang Yunxi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the manor, the elder dressed in elegant clothes had a curious look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yunxi spent 300,000 taels to buy a pile of precious materials?"</p><p></p><p>The elder was the Mountain King, the current Emperor of Ning's brother, and also Yunxi's father.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the report from his subordinate, he had a look of surprise on his face.</p><p></p><p>300,000 taels...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>30,000 taels was no small sum.</p><p></p><p>Although he loved Yunxi dearly, this time when she went out, she only had a few thousand taels of silver notes on her.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the silver given to the princess by that old man," the subordinate guessed.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to take out 300,000 taels at once, this is not an ordinary person." The Prince of Zhenshan's expression remained calm as he played with a sandalwood bead in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Go find out that old man's identity, treat him with respect, don't offend a superior person."</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhenshan was curious about Chen Kangbao's identity.</p><p></p><p>At first, when he heard that his daughter was following Chen Kangbao and learning to be a chef, he did not object.</p><p></p><p>It was good that his daughter learned to cook, so he could enjoy the food and even had his subordinates buy some of the buns his daughter made.</p><p></p><p>But now the development of the situation exceeded his expectations - that old man was actually able to take out 300,000 taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Could an ordinary person take out 300,000 taels of silver? "As you command."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Qingyi of the Tianxiong Sect spoke up: "Judging from his words, the princess Yunxi went to Tiangong Hall to purchase many precious materials for refining weapons. Could it be that this old man... is a powerful weapon refiner?"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhenshan nodded: "If he is a powerful weapon refiner, that would explain it."</p><p></p><p>The Weapon Refiner Conference was approaching, and more and more refiners were rushing to Yeshanlake.</p><p></p><p>That old man might be a powerful refiner, so he was able to take out 300,000 taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>"He is at least a mid-level refiner, or even at the peak of the mid-level, this old man I have never seen before, I don't know when I can visit and ask this great man to take a look at the Weilong Xuanyan!" As an elder of the Tianxiong Sect, Wang Qingyi was deeply concerned about the Weilong Xuanyan.</p><p></p><p>She was eager to have a refiner repair the Weilong Xuanyan, so that they would have a better chance against the Water Lord.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once the Water Lord's power grew, the safety of Jining Prefecture would depend entirely on the Water Lord's will.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi said solemnly, "There are rumors that a batch of... powerful imperial soldiers have come to the capital of Ninguo?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi looked closely at the Prince of Zhenshan.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhenshan's expression also became serious: "Not just one batch, but two, they seem to be hostile, coming from... the Luoshastate in the Central Plains."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the Prince of Zhenshan hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>"So they are from the legendary Central Plains!" Wang Qingyi's eyes were filled with endless longing, "It is said that there are not a few heaven-level imperial soldiers in the Central Plains, and there are even the legendary god-level imperial soldiers. If they are in the Central Plains, how would the Water Lord dare to stir up trouble?"</p><p></p><p>The Central Plains was the holy land in the hearts of all imperial soldiers.</p><p></p><p>That was a prosperous era of cultivation, and there were even passages leading to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Can they... lend a hand?" Wang Qingyi asked tentatively, "The Tianxiong Sect is willing to offer precious treasures!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Zhenshan bitterly smiled and said, "The precious treasures that we regard as treasures are worthless in their eyes. They came to... Ninguo, to do something big, and they are not willing to get involved in the small matters here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Qingyi felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the Water Lord, whom they regarded as their greatest enemy, was just a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"What are they coming to Ninguo for?" Wang Qingyi asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Luoshastate in the Central Plains, Ninguo was like a remote and impoverished place, and no big figures would be willing to come here.</p><p></p><p>"I heard... they are looking for a god."</p><p></p><p>"A god?" Wang Qingyi's eyes widened in shock.</p><p></p><p>A god! There was actually a divine being... appearing in the territory of Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>It's just that she had no news about it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Which venerable god?"</p><p></p><p>"The God of Judgment, also known as the God of Descent..."</p><p></p><p>"What, is it really this one, wasn't He already destroyed long ago?" Wang Qingyi was amazed.</p><p></p><p>The founder of the Tianxiong Sect had a mysterious relationship with that mysterious god-level weapon refiner, Shengnu.</p><p></p><p>That god-level weapon refiner had once forged a divine weapon called the God of Descent.</p><p></p><p>Except for Shengnu, no one in the world had seen the appearance of the divine weapon God of Descent.</p><p></p><p>However, since its appearance, it had been the strongest divine weapon in the Luoshastate.</p><p></p><p>Invincible.</p><p></p><p>Just by calling "God of Descent", it could slay all evil.</p><p></p><p>"The details are unknown to me, but... if we have news of the God of Descent, telling them might make them lend a hand." The Prince of Zhenshan said.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi's expression became serious: "I will go back and report to the Dao Master, and issue an order to investigate the news of the God of Descent, hoping... this venerable one appears in our Jiangzhou territory!"</p><p></p><p>Now, the Weilong Xuanyan could not be repaired, and the threat of the Water Lord was still looming.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only by asking those mysterious heaven-level imperial soldiers for help could they save Jining Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said indifferently, "When wandering the rivers and lakes, you have to be careful of those surnamed Ye, like your sister Ye Zhen. Does she have any cousins or nephews?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? I don't know, why do we have to be careful of those surnamed Ye?"</p><p></p><p>"Those surnamed Ye generally have protagonist fates, they are extraordinary by nature. I know many powerful figures surnamed Ye, like Ye Fan, Ye Chen, Ye Chen, Ye Liang Chen, and even... Ye Bi Daxiong?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Jiang Yunxi carefully wrote down the names.</p><p></p><p>This was the experience of the chef, it must be very useful.</p><p></p><p>"When facing such people with protagonist fates, either kill them directly or suck up to them." Qi Yuan continued, "Okay, take me and the materials to the old man, I'm going to evolve now."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Jiang Yunxi nodded quickly, but there was some hesitation in her eyes, "After the evolution, if I hold you, won't I get electrocuted?"</p><p></p><p>She was a little scared.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>At least this "host" knows to bring an umbrella when it rains, not too stupid.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yesterday it cleared up, and today it's drizzling again.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi, with the evolved chef's knife in hand, had an excited expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"With this chef's knife, I'm truly invincible!"</p><p></p><p>She was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, after wrapping the buns, she directly used the chef's knife to electrically cook all the buns.</p><p></p><p>This made her feel heroic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was sitting in a small boat, holding a fish.</p><p></p><p>"Fish, tell me, where are those evil spirit fish?"</p><p></p><p>The fish in her hand soon started to struggle and dove into the water, leading the way for Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi stood up, the fine rain falling on her shoulders, as if she didn't feel it at all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she pinched herself.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you pinch yourself?" Qi Yuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>This "host" was so strange.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this savior beautiful girl? It's just a fantasy before death, I'm afraid... I'm already dead." Jiang Yunxi had a dreamlike feeling, feeling that everything was too unreal.</p><p></p><p>After all, she could actually sweep away the evil spirit fish and save the world?</p><p></p><p>"You think too much, after saving the world, you can go write a memoir novel." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's heart suddenly skipped a beat: "...What about you?"</p><p></p><p>"Me? Of course I'll continue to live my game life, you and I are just passing travelers in each other's lives."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Jiang Yunxi felt a little sad.</p><p></p><p>She understood that she, like the protagonists in those memoir novels, was possessive, always wanting the good things to be her own.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the guiding fish in front had stopped.</p><p></p><p>A rare fierce or even murderous aura surged in Jiang Yunxi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, just some evil spirit fish, daring to be lawless!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Cloud Tiger and Cloud Lei, who were following behind, seemed very lazy.</p><p></p><p>There were special talismans on the boat, so Jiang Yunxi's strength could not detect their presence behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, going out to kill fish every day, in the future the princess will have the title of a fish-killing maniac, that would be interesting." Cloud Tiger laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Wait... don't you feel... the fish in front is a bit strange?" Cloud Lei narrowed his eyes and looked into the distance, "Get closer!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tiger also put away his casual manner, his expression becoming serious: "Now that you mention it, there does seem to be a problem. The fish in front... there are too many of them, a dark mass."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tiger looked carefully, and saw that in the water in front of the princess, the water was black as ink, as if hiding countless black fish.</p><p></p><p>Those fish were crowded together, in huge numbers, looking a bit eerie.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, these fish schools should be eating each other, but why are they gathered together like this?" Cloud Lei was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to smell the aura of evil spirits... wait, those fish can't really be evil spirits, can they?" Cloud Tiger was nervous, his heart surging with towering waves.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, miss is in danger, we have to go over there!" Cloud Tiger shouted anxiously.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, a scene that shocked Cloud Tiger and Cloud Lei occurred.</p><p></p><p>They saw the young lady Jiang Yunxi holding a chef's knife, her expression fierce, her voice very sweet and gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Just some evil spirits, daring to cause trouble, die for me, sister!"</p><p></p><p>The chef's knife suddenly slashed down.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, there was a crackling sound of electricity.</p><p></p><p>The entire water area, about a hundred meters in radius, was like thousands of thunders rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The entire water area turned into a purple ocean.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of evil fish, were electrified by this terrifying thunder.</p><p></p><p>The young lady wielding the chef's knife was like a goddess of thunder, and with one slash, countless evil fish fell.</p><p></p><p>The water within a hundred meters was boiling, just like boiling water in a pot.</p><p></p><p>As for the evil fish, they were just ingredients.</p><p></p><p>As for the fish that had led the way, it had already jumped into the small boat.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you've learned a new dish today, this is electric water-boiled fish!" Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>The sound of thunder also disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The water in the area was still boiling, gradually subsiding, and the electricity also dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was very excited and excited: "I'm actually so strong!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the distant boat, Cloud Tiger and Cloud Lei stared wide-eyed, watching the scene in front of them, unable to understand.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"What... what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... she really learned some skills?"</p><p></p><p>The two were shocked beyond belief, the scene in front of them exceeded their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were hundreds of meters away from Jiang Yunxi, they could still feel the terrifying electricity.</p><p></p><p>If they were in the vortex of electricity, they would surely die! But their princess, holding a chef's knife, unleashed thunder with a single slash, this was too scary!</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, their hearts surging with waves of shock, but when they looked back, they saw that the small boat and the young lady had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The water area in front was silent, and the electricity had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the countless corpses of evil fish, Cloud Tiger and Cloud Lei would even feel that what they had just witnessed was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tiger swallowed hard: "The princess is gone!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Lei was a bit anxious: "That chef's knife is definitely no ordinary thing, at least a heaven-level talisman!"</p><p></p><p>The young lady couldn't have learned such terrifying skills, that one slash of the knife must have been from the extraordinary knife.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, that chef's knife was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"We actually lost track of the young lady! This is bad!" Cloud Tiger was very hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Go look for her... this matter must be reported to the Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Both of them felt that the events here were huge, earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 209</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light shone on the snow-capped mountains, appearing especially bewitching.</p><p></p><p>The North Sea was azure blue, with the sky and water merging into one horizon, and emerald waves rippling.</p><p></p><p>In the endless forest, lakes connected into one expanse, with dragons sleeping within.</p><p></p><p>For one day, Qi Yuan followed the Foodless Holy Mother on a day trip to the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the sunlight, looking at the distant mountains covered in evening snow: "It seems I really came here as a tourist this time. My cultivation hasn't improved, but my state of mind... seems to have broadened quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>In the game, Qi Yuan never rested for a moment, always playing seriously. </p><p></p><p>Now, this was the first time he had relaxed and traveled like this.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, this is probably the first time in my life I've truly traveled in the strict sense of the word. Although it's just a quick tour, it's quite meaningful," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile appeared in the Foodless Holy Mother's beautiful eyes: "It's nice to take one last look at this landscape with you."</p><p></p><p>"You've already reached the pinnacle of Great Veneration. What kind of realm lies beyond True Divinity?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He had always been curious about Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he had never seen a Yang Spirit before.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother was the number one figure in the Mortal Heart Realm throughout history, and also the closest to becoming a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond True Divinity..." the Foodless Holy Mother fell silent, "I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>She had reached the pinnacle of the Yin Spirit realm, but she still couldn't fully grasp what lay beyond in the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt somewhat disappointed: "It seems we'll have to see the final boss to know how powerful these so-called Yang Spirits really are."</p><p></p><p>Just as Qi Yuan finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an earth-shattering sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's vision was filled with a blood-red curtain.</p><p></p><p>Endless crimson light flooded his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly looked up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>He saw that from the blood-red star that seemed to hang above the Mortal Heart Realm, a terrifying giant hand extended out.</p><p></p><p>That enormous hand appeared to be as large as a planet.</p><p></p><p>The hand gently pushed downwards.</p><p></p><p>The sky pillar, which was tens of thousands of miles high, collapsed like fragile building blocks.</p><p></p><p>"The sky pillar... has fallen!" Qi Yuan looked up, watching the collapsing pillar as if gazing at a setting sun.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined he would witness such a historic moment.</p><p></p><p>As the sky pillar fell, the Mortal Heart Realm shook, and blood-red rain filled the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the heavens were weeping!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" The Foodless Holy Mother took a deep look at where Qi Yuan was standing and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>He knew the Foodless Holy Mother was going to confront that Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>He would also witness the most brutal battle of the Great Deluge.</p><p></p><p>All the mythical beings would fall on this day.</p><p></p><p>Blood rain drifted down as Qi Yuan followed the Foodless Holy Mother to appear atop the broken sky pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Foodless Holy Mother, twenty breaths!"</p><p></p><p>"Hold on!"</p><p></p><p>Six mythical beings transmitted messages as they entered the sky pillar.</p><p></p><p>They were about to begin condensing the world seed to send out of the pillar.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan raised his head to look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He saw that where the terrifying giant hand had extended from earlier had now turned into a thick blood color.</p><p></p><p>A sea of blood churned, but there was no water in the sea - it was all crimson light.</p><p></p><p>The scorching blood-colored light seemed as if it could kill mortals just by looking at it directly.</p><p></p><p>A cold, emotionless voice rang out from high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Annihilation."</p><p></p><p>That terrifying blood-colored figure's face couldn't be seen clearly at all.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, it seemed the Foodless Holy Mother didn't exist at all, or was merely regarded as the most insignificant ant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked towards that terrifying shadowy figure.</p><p></p><p>[Blood Sun Great Sage's Devouring Body Projection, Yang Spirit. </p><p></p><p>This body can devour all things, with stars held in its mouth.]</p><p></p><p>It stood high in the sky, falling at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for twenty breaths - in just one breath it would plunge into the sky pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?!" At this moment, the Foodless Holy Mother looked up at the terrifying figure in the sky. Her blood-colored robe appeared even more bewitching and alluring under the crimson light.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Sun Great Sage's Devouring Body Projection..." Qi Yuan had no worries as he told the Foodless Holy Mother the information he saw.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring, is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother seemed to have learned some crucial information.</p><p></p><p>Her red robe fluttered wildly as she raised her head and shouted at the terrifying figure in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Chaos!"</p><p></p><p>"The One and Only in This World!"</p><p></p><p>Endless light flashed from her snow-white palms.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother was like a soldier rushing to her death without any reluctance as she charged towards that terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice also transmitted to the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Her upper jaw has been injured before."</p><p></p><p>"Divine power permeates her entire body, but is most concentrated in her head."</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a projection of a Yang Spirit's avatar, it could still affect Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt his whole body trembling, his divine apertures shaking, as if facing a natural predator.</p><p></p><p>If just the projection of a Yang Spirit's avatar was this terrifying, how overwhelmingly powerful must the true body be? Qi Yuan couldn't imagine.</p><p></p><p>He kept looking at all the blood light from that Yang Spirit avatar, at every facial feature he could see.</p><p></p><p>His eyes extracted useful information from the vast sea of useless data, providing it to the Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>This was a battle that was destined to be lost.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, two streams of blood light collided as the Foodless Holy Mother burned all her divine power to hold back that avatar for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A surprised voice rang out: "How do you know who I am? How do you know about the unhealable wound on my upper jaw?"</p><p></p><p>That terrifying figure pondered.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze swept across the earth, as if searching for someone.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere her gaze passed, mountains and land turned to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>For ten thousand miles around, only the lonely sky pillar remained.</p><p></p><p>However, since Qi Yuan was not in this realm, such a terrifying attack could not harm him.</p><p></p><p>"Look at what attributes her divine power has!" </p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother's voice rang out again from the sky.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying figure was surprised once more: "Who are you talking to?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly looked over.</p><p></p><p>[Devouring, Destruction, Assimilation, Puppetry...]</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly told the Foodless Holy Mother the information he saw.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the projection of a Yang Spirit's avatar, Qi Yuan was still too weak now.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how to respond either, and could only follow the Foodless Holy Mother's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another collision occurred in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw blood constantly flowing from the Foodless Holy Mother's body.</p><p></p><p>Even knowing quite a bit of information about the enemy, she was still completely on the defensive, taking hits.</p><p></p><p>Blood fell from the sky, as if it would corrode the earth.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blood figure's eyes swept across the world again in annoyance, as if trying to find Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, her actions were destined to be in vain.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother's beautiful face was covered in blood as her powerful divine domain shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored light pierced through like a dragon, directly tearing apart her divine domain.</p><p></p><p>The injured Foodless Holy Mother shouted again.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, her eyes..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly looked at the eyes of the Yang Spirit avatar's projection.</p><p></p><p>He immediately told the Foodless Holy Mother the information he saw.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Chaos!"</p><p></p><p>"The One and Only in This World!"</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother launched another attack.</p><p></p><p>Her attack couldn't harm that Yang Spirit Devouring Body Projection at all.</p><p></p><p>But it did slow down the speed of her descent.</p><p></p><p>"Little bug!" The terrifying figure was extremely irritated.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Foodless Holy Mother didn't anger her as much as the hidden Qi Yuan did.</p><p></p><p>She cared most about the unknown, about what she couldn't control.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?!"</p><p></p><p>She was furious.</p><p></p><p>But her fury couldn't be vented on Qi Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>It all fell upon the Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying attacks ravaged the Foodless Holy Mother's divine domain and her body.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother was completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Her body shattered, divine apertures broke, blood trickled from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>The twenty breaths of time felt extremely long, but finally passed.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother's face was covered in blood, but her beautiful face bore a smile.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to glance at Qi Yuan, her voice desolate yet at peace.</p><p></p><p>"I promised to protect the sky pillar, and I've done it."</p><p></p><p>"The destiny I've always wanted to know, I now understand."</p><p></p><p>"This life has no regrets."</p><p></p><p>She took one last look at Qi Yuan, her eyes full of complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan had seen countless people and countless gazes, he couldn't decipher the look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>What does the divine represent, and what emotions are contained within it?</p><p></p><p>"The rest of the journey... you'll have to walk alone."</p><p></p><p>With these words, the Foodless Holy Mother finally could no longer hold on. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, her body shattered with a thunderous crash.</p><p></p><p>Endless divine power, like twinkling stars, scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached out, trying to grasp one.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't catch it.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying shadow let out a roar.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was destined to never discover Qi Yuan, to discover this outsider Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She also didn't linger at all, crashing into the Pillar of Heaven with a boom.</p><p></p><p>The entire Mortal Heart Realm shook violently.</p><p></p><p>The silhouettes of six mythical beings appeared, then vanished in the span of three breaths, as if they had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Even beings as powerful as myths only got three breaths of screen time in the movie, not even a close-up.</p><p></p><p>It took a full hundred breaths before this place finally calmed down completely.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the devastated land, Qi Yuan murmured, "If I had known it would end in tragedy, I shouldn't have come to see."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Qi Yuan felt some regret, yet also felt no regret.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep look at the terrifying figure in the Pillar of Heaven, then looked at the glow on the lost glow stick.</p><p></p><p>"Time is almost up, I should... go back."</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother had long since perished. He had come to the Battle of the Great Flood merely to witness her fall.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Near the entrance of the Ancestral Grounds, the burly dark-skinned man was smugly humming a tune: "This trip to the Ancestral Grounds, I should have gained the most, right?"</p><p></p><p>This time, the burly man had several strokes of luck in a row, opening a total of three divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>Such gains were among the best since the Ancestral Grounds opened.</p><p></p><p>"Are they still inside? If they knew about my gains, they would surely be very jealous of me, right?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man thought to himself as he finally walked out of the Ancestral Grounds.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he exited, the burly man's divine apertures trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if he was being stared at by a terrifying celestial god.</p><p></p><p>An anxious and dissatisfied voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"How did such an idiot come out!"</p><p></p><p>"Why isn't it the Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the burly man felt greatly displeased, but seeing the three great venerables before him, his displeasure completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>"You boy, have you seen the Origin Venerable? How is he doing in there? Has he encountered any danger?" Lishan Venerable hurriedly asked the burly man.</p><p></p><p>The burly man was bewildered, but facing the great venerable, he still answered truthfully: "After I entered the Ancestral Grounds, I separated from the others. I don't know the specifics of what happened."</p><p></p><p>He honestly recounted what happened when he arrived at the entrance of the Ancestral Grounds and after entering.</p><p></p><p>He was curious in his heart - what exactly happened to the Origin Venerable to make three great venerables wait here to intercept him? He couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lishan Venerable said worriedly: "The Origin Venerable pointed out that those people were dangerous. There must be deeper meaning to it. Those people... running off as soon as they entered, there must be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man stood quietly, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, what problem could there be with someone as kind as Old Snake?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't dare say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked towards an old man not far away, his face showing delight: "Elder, this time in the Ancestral Grounds, I opened three divine apertures!"</p><p></p><p>The elder was a decrepit old man. Hearing the burly man's voice, he indeed showed a surprised expression: "Your gains this time were actually so great!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the burly man felt elated.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly the feeling he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Later, when those familiar faces came out from inside, he would ask like this again, and the praise and envy he received would increase crazily.</p><p></p><p>He waited quietly, both expectant and fearful and confused.</p><p></p><p>Because the looks those great venerables gave him were quite unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>Their faces seemed to say, why did you come out instead of the Origin Venerable? How are you inferior to the Origin Venerable? Time passed minute by minute, second by second. About an hour went by.</p><p></p><p>There was movement again from the Ancestral Grounds ahead.</p><p></p><p>Lishan Venerable and the other two great venerables perked up, looking towards the Ancestral Grounds.</p><p></p><p>"Hope it's the Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be him!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't let it be..." One great venerable glanced at the burly man from the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>The burly man was also full of anticipation. He didn't care who came out.</p><p></p><p>In any case, they were all targets for him to show off to.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thin mist covering the Ancestral Grounds lifted, and twenty-one people suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>These twenty-one people all had smiles on their faces, beaming with joy.</p><p></p><p>The burly man, who had been preparing to go forward and boast, was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because... he found that he couldn't discern the strength of any of those twenty-one people.</p><p></p><p>Even those villagers who were just ordinary people before, he couldn't tell.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient gods whose cultivation was lower than his, he also couldn't tell.</p><p></p><p>Now, he seemed to be facing a group of unfathomable experts.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"You finally came out!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the gazes of the three great venerables all fell on Qi Yuan, their eyes sincere and full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"And you are?" Qi Yuan looked at the three, surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I am White Dawn Venerable's master, and a good friend of Thunder God Venerable. He asked me to look after you," Lishan Venerable said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see. I didn't expect old Thunder God to be so thoughtful." Qi Yuan spoke. Not seeing him for a day, this Thunder God Venerable wouldn't have eaten all the pigs in the village, right?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lishan Venerable's gaze suddenly fell on Zhu Zhuangshi and the other villagers. His eyes widened: "You... used your God Observing Method on them?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan didn't hide it.</p><p></p><p>"You gave them... the latest visualization?" Lishan Venerable asked again, his voice trembling.</p><p></p><p>"I happened to bring eight villagers, and happened to visualize eight God Observing Methods, so I just gave it to them to use." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lishan Venerable felt immense grief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was a mythical level God Observing Method... and it was used so casually?</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked at Lishan Venerable, seeming to have had a huge power boost, he also felt a bit inflated: "What, is old Zhu not worthy of a God Observing Method?"</p><p></p><p>Now he had advanced to the second step of Treading the Heavens, and had also used a potion to awaken the seed of a divine domain.</p><p></p><p>His strength was increasing every moment.</p><p></p><p>He felt infinitely powerful.</p><p></p><p>To deal with the big black dog, where would he need a finger? A leg hair would do.</p><p></p><p>Even facing Lishan Venerable, he wasn't afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>Lishan Venerable looked at Zhu Zhuangshi, his thoughts racing: "If it's been used... then it's been used."</p><p></p><p>Besides regret, what else could be done?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lishan Venerable seemed to discover something. His pupils contracted sharply: "Divine domain embryonic form, what's going on, you... no, how did you all awaken divine domain embryonic forms!"</p><p></p><p>Lishan Venerable was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods before him seemed to have just awakened their divine domain embryonic forms. It wasn't stable yet, so they hadn't hidden it well.</p><p></p><p>So a trace of aura leaked out, allowing Lishan Venerable to detect it.</p><p></p><p>"They were underdeveloped, got some oral liquid, and grew robust." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Oral liquid?" Lishan Venerable was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Wang Song said: "The oral liquid the master spoke of is divine domain nectar. Hehe, following the master this time, we really struck it rich in the Ancestral Grounds."</p><p></p><p>Hearing about divine domain nectar, the burly man's eyes turned red.</p><p></p><p>He had condensed three divine apertures, and his gains were big, but compared to a divine domain embryonic form, that was nothing! How did all these people awaken divine domain embryonic forms!</p><p></p><p>It's not fair! He was jealous and resentful!</p><p></p><p>Lishan Venerable was also shocked, his face showing delight.</p><p></p><p>Didn't this mean that among the ancient gods, there were now many more with combat power comparable to great venerables?</p><p></p><p>There were even eight with mythical level God Observing Methods.</p><p></p><p>The future was promising.</p><p></p><p>"We need to take the teleportation array back. Goodbye everyone." Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to look at the surprise on these people's faces and spoke casually.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lishan Venerable finally remembered his purpose for coming and hurriedly said: "Origin Venerable, please wait!"</p><p></p><p>Can't let him go back!</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Caroilove for becoming a league leader!

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Although the Master has tasted the flavor of the Progenitor, the Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity has not yet been..." </p><p></p><p>"This new person... has quite a bold spirit."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity, the members of the Myriad Transformations Academy all had expressions of reverence and awe.</p><p></p><p>They were mostly Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>There were even not a few Primordial Realm Lords among them.</p><p></p><p>But even at the Primordial Realm, they were only one step away from the Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity, yet the gap was immense.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Primordial Realm Lords of the Myriad Transformations Academy were not few, but the probability of them breaking through to an even higher realm was only about one in a hundred.</p><p></p><p>"This new person has some strength."</p><p></p><p>"He has joined the 'Summon Spirit' and 'Time Machine' projects, this guy is also infatuated."</p><p></p><p>"To become the consort of the Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity, even I would be infatuated."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, beings at their level rarely have consorts of similar strength.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were, they would not be deeply entangled, just occasionally playing around.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, both 'Summon Spirit' and 'Time Machine' are among the top ten most difficult projects. In all these eras, there has been almost no progress."</p><p></p><p>"Joining these two research projects is not very wise, a waste of time."</p><p></p><p>"We have endless lifespans, what's the harm in wasting some time?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew, the canary swayed her slender legs, the water droplets slid across her delicate jade-like feet, her toes glistening, tender and exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on the voluptuous figure in the mist, faintly visible, she glanced down at herself, her pretty face blushing slightly: "Damn it, so tempting, even I want to take a bite, let alone Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>She was referring to the gap between herself and Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Ning Luo, in a lace black dress, snorted coldly, her stunningly beautiful face carrying an aloof and unapproachable aura, "Don't sell yourself short, your... husband likes you too, doesn't he?"</p><p></p><p>Her tone carried a hint of discontent.</p><p></p><p>The canary was also her, yet she lacked such self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>To her, she was the most suitable for her husband.</p><p></p><p>As for Jiang Lingsu... she was just a busty and brainless fool.</p><p></p><p>Jinli? On the surface a pure and elegant lady, cold and dignified, but in reality... more active and passionate than anyone, a stark contrast.</p><p></p><p>She was the true mistress.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of initiative and possessiveness, she was far stronger than the other two.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she had made a deal with the canary to give Qi Yuan a good show.</p><p></p><p>But when Qi Yuan returned, she was more active than anyone, starting to undress even before a word was said.</p><p></p><p>As if only when the two were tightly intertwined did Qi Yuan truly belong to her.</p><p></p><p>The canary's pretty face blushed slightly as she secretly cursed, "Shameless."</p><p></p><p>Ning Luo was unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu walked out of the mist, her face filled with puzzlement: "Sister Ning Luo, today is the Realm Lord Grand Ceremony of the Bixuo Realm Lord, should we... not call the Eldest Brother?"</p><p></p><p>A while ago, an invitation had fallen into the hands of Ziyan Tian, and eventually reached Ning Luo.</p><p></p><p>The Overlord of the Bixuo Realm had broken through the barrier that prevented the Sixth Heavenly Realm from entering the Third Layer of the Yang Deity, becoming the first Realm Lord in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>This news had shaken the Sixth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Countless major powers were moved.</p><p></p><p>Because in all these years of the Sixth Heavenly Realm, this was the first time a figure had reached the Third Layer of the Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses like the Taihuang Palace Master and the mysterious and ancient Tortoise Overlord had never been able to break through the barrier and advance into the Third Layer of the Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the Bixuo Overlord had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Overlords, as well as those at the Second Layer of the Yang Deity, were all curious about how the Bixuo Overlord had broken through the barrier.</p><p></p><p>This Realm Lord Grand Ceremony had attracted the attention of almost all the Yang Deities.</p><p></p><p>This kind of upheaval was far more shocking than the downfall of the Taihuang Palace, and had drawn much more attention.</p><p></p><p>The current Bixuo Realm Lord had quietly become the number one figure in the Sixth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>So, seeing the invitation from the Bixuo Overlord, Jiang Lingsu couldn't help but worry about the Eldest Brother.</p><p></p><p>If the Eldest Brother did not go, would he offend the Realm Lord, and bring trouble?</p><p></p><p>Ning Luo's expression remained cold: "The husband is in seclusion cultivating, there is no important matter, we cannot disturb him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu still felt a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the canary next to her said, "Sister Lingsu, don't be afraid, the husband is the strongest, invincible, no one can hurt him."</p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan, the canary had blind faith, with unwavering trust.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Qi Yuan was the strongest, a divine being descended from the heavens, she only needed to be a little follower, clinging to him.</p><p></p><p>Ning Luo stood there coldly, but in her heart, she couldn't help but give the canary a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>Why call her "sister"? At this moment, a profound aura approached.</p><p></p><p>The three women's eyes all filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Husband!"</p><p>"Qi Yuan!"</p><p>"Eldest Brother!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left their mouths, the three women seemed to feel a powerful pull, all being drawn into Qi Yuan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"How is the new cultivation method I learned?" Qi Yuan boasted.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had obtained the "Devour True Sutra" and had mastered it in a single day.</p><p></p><p>In these past days, he had finally cultivated the "Devour True Sutra" to the peak.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the peak, it became much more difficult to make progress, so Qi Yuan had come out.</p><p></p><p>"Very impressive." Ning Luo was the first to speak.</p><p></p><p>The canary felt this strange pulling force, feeling like she was about to merge with Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with anticipation: "Why don't you just eat me up?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lightly kicked the canary's jade-like foot: "Don't talk nonsense, I'm a law-abiding good citizen."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu and asked, "The Bixuo Overlord has become a Realm Lord, and is holding a Realm Lord Grand Ceremony?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Jiang Lingsu nodded, not expressing her own opinion.</p><p></p><p>Although she did want to help the Eldest Brother resolve any worries.</p><p></p><p>But when she first met the Eldest Brother, she could still act as a rich lady, sending cultivation methods and spirit stones to help the Eldest Brother.</p><p></p><p>Now, her strength was weak, her vision limited, if she spoke carelessly again, she might only cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"You, just say whatever, we're all family." Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew of his shijie's concerns.</p><p></p><p>This kind of worry, Qi Yuan felt was completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>After all, all beings are equal.</p><p></p><p>And every living being is a unique and irreplaceable individual.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some unexpected brilliant ideas could emerge.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Great Wisdom True Lord, although he had only just broken through to the Purple Palace, every time Qi Yuan exchanged with him, he felt he had gained immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>The sharp mind of the Great Wisdom True Lord was very useful.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's heart felt warm, pondering a bit.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, she stood from Qi Yuan's perspective.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that there are rumors about this Bixuo Realm Lord, he needs spirit veins as a gift.</p><p></p><p>One, our Shenguang Sect only has spirit veins, not immortal veins; two, the Eldest Brother and the Bixuo Realm Lord are not close... if we're not close, it's best not to send a gift." Jiang Lingsu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, don't send it, we don't have much good stuff ourselves!" the canary said a little stingily.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, I'm not close with this Bixuo Realm Lord, so I'll skip the gift."</p><p></p><p>Of course he was too lazy to send a gift.</p><p></p><p>Now that his "Devour True Sutra" had reached its peak, he should go to that universe and continue devouring the stars.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, when Jinli comes back, tell her that Qi Jian has returned." Qi Yuan said to Ning Luo.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Jinli was in the Yuesheng Palace, handling some family matters.</p><p></p><p>As for that fishing enthusiast Qi Jian, he had finally returned from fishing.</p><p></p><p>He should also go see his mother Jinli.</p><p></p><p>After cuddling with the three women for a while, they were all slightly disheveled...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure appeared in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>"They say that men become impotent after the age of thirty, but this is clearly just a rumor. </p><p></p><p>I'm over a hundred years old, old enough to receive a retirement pension, but I'm still as capable as a high school or college athlete."</p><p></p><p>"With the pride of those men on the Blue Star, if they couldn't perform five times a night after thirty, wouldn't they die of shame?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself, gazing at the dazzling stars ahead.</p><p></p><p>"These... will all become my Elixir Cores."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a sense of heroic spirit arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the "Devour Sutra" began to operate.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the original devouring rules on all the stellar Elixir Cores surged.</p><p></p><p>The stellar Elixir Cores that Qi Yuan had already imbued with the devouring rules were now, under the empowerment of the "Devour Sutra", devouring at an even faster rate.</p><p></p><p>"At least 50% faster... and it's still increasing."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan murmured, one star after another fell into the fruit basket like ripe fruits on a tree.</p><p></p><p>The number of stellar Elixir Cores within Qi Yuan's body kept increasing, and his strength was constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>"What is the endpoint of the Elixir Core Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it to devour all the stars in this universe?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he narrowed his eyes, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"This... seems a bit similar to the Black Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavenly Venerable... devoured everything, becoming the sole Black Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And his stellar Elixir Cores were devouring all other stellar Elixir Cores.</p><p></p><p>"Is this also the path of the Fourth Layer of the Yang Shen?"</p><p></p><p>"After devouring all the stellar Elixir Cores, will my stellar Elixir Core enter the final stage of the Fourth Layer of the Yang Shen, becoming a rare treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>If his stellar Elixir Core entered the Fourth Layer of the Yang Shen, his true spirit would not be extinguished. He would also possess the combat power of the Fourth Layer of the Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be my true Yang Shen path?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this is not enough. Facing the Dao Lord, I still cannot defeat him. </p><p></p><p>If I cannot even kill the Dao Lord, I don't deserve to be called a Yang Shen."</p><p></p><p>"So, I still need to reach the Fifth Layer of the Yang Shen myself?"</p><p></p><p>"The Elixir Core at the Fourth Layer, the true self at the Fifth Layer, synchronized?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Once he became the Dao Lord, the space he was in would enter a cycle.</p><p></p><p>For Jinli, Ningtao, Jinsi Que, Jiang Lisu, and countless other living beings, this might not necessarily be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally did not want to see those lovely people living in a repetitive and monotonous life.</p><p></p><p>"The Yang Shen path is too difficult, but the Elixir Core Dao, I can still explore further."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lord Assembly had concluded.</p><p></p><p>Biluo Realm Lord sat on the main seat, his expression restrained, but the endless pressure he emanated made him seem like the overlord of this world.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Wisdom Sect had a respectful expression on his face: "The gods all bow their heads, and our cultivation should be like this."</p><p></p><p>Recently, almost all the major figures in the immortal world had come to the Realm Lord Assembly.</p><p></p><p>When Biluo Realm Lord appeared, he released a trace of pressure that made the Yang Shen at the Second Layer tremble.</p><p></p><p>This level of combat power was truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Venerable of Ten Thousand Days, the Moon Goddess Yuanjun, and the Purple Origin Heavenly Venerable... none of them came," the Second Elder of the Wisdom Sect mentioned casually.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Dragon Turtle felt a tightness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he saw Biluo Venerable reveal a smile as light as the spring breeze: "The Realm Lord Assembly was held only for the immortal veins. As for whether others show up or not... it doesn't matter. What's most important in this world is strength."</p><p></p><p>In the past, facing the Venerable of Ten Thousand Days, he had been extremely wary of him, considering him a rival.</p><p></p><p>But after reaching the Third Layer of the Yang Shen, he felt the vastness of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>As for the Venerable of Ten Thousand Days, he no longer saw him as an opponent.</p><p></p><p>He was not even qualified.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Dragon Turtle let out a sigh of relief: "Now, we have gathered nine hundred thousand immortal veins. In a short time, we will be able to enter the Cosmic Void Realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Biluo Realm Lord's expression became joyful: "Much appreciated, my friend."</p><p></p><p>He was also very curious and looking forward to the Cosmic Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No need, it's all for the immortal world," the Venerable of the Dragon Turtle said, "Now, Biluo Realm Lord, it's time for you to know the precautions regarding the Cosmic Void Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Please enlighten me, my friend."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Cosmic Void Realm, the Venerable of the Dragon Turtle's eyes revealed a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Cosmic Void Realm was created or discovered by multiple Dao Lords. </p><p></p><p>So, there are many powerful Realm Lords in the Cosmic Void Realm!"</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the Cosmic Void Realm, he had stood there like a lackey.</p><p></p><p>Those Realm Lords would undress and enter the Cosmic Sea in front of him, and he didn't dare to be reckless, keeping his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only at the Second Layer of the Yang Shen, and although he had the strength of a Weak Rule Realm, he was still not a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>If he accidentally looked at a Realm Lord's undressed form, that Realm Lord might angrily extinguish his true spirit, and he wouldn't even have a place to cry.</p><p></p><p>"In the Cosmic Void Realm, Biluo Realm Lord must be very careful in your conduct. Do not look around casually.</p><p></p><p>Any of those old monsters there can easily deal with us."</p><p></p><p>Entering the Cosmic Void Realm had great opportunities, but also endless dangers.</p><p></p><p>Last time the Venerable of the Dragon Turtle entered, he almost died there.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a kind-hearted female Realm Lord had helped him escape from the hands of a terrifying Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Biluo Realm Lord's gaze also became solemn: "Indeed, I must be low-key."</p><p></p><p>After becoming a Realm Lord, he realized that his cultivation path... still had a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>Various cosmic rules, First-Grade rules, the Myriad Beings, the Opening of the Heavens, and so on, these were all existences that he found difficult to grasp and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Please prepare for three days, Biluo Realm Lord. Three days later, come with me to the Cosmic Void Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Biluo Realm Lord responded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the vast universe,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on a planet, his eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>"The living beings I created in the Opening of the Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"But why do they look so crude and simple?"</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Qi Yuan had left seeds in this universe and carried out the Opening of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Now, some simple living beings had finally appeared as a result.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, even simpler and cruder than amoebas, just like a bit of mosaic.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, it's still a success," Qi Yuan said, as countless time rules flowed in his hands and descended upon this planet.</p><p></p><p>He accelerated the time flow of this planet, allowing these creatures to rapidly multiply and evolve.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit strange, why did I open the Heavens in the first place?"</p><p></p><p>"To keep pets?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>The Opening of the Heavens realm allows one to create and originate life.</p><p></p><p>But what was the purpose of creating these living beings? Just to satisfy the urge to be a creator?</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, the more cattle and horses, the better."</p><p></p><p>"I'll also speed up the time flow of the other planets. In the future, when there are more people, I can take them back to the Blue Star and directly vote me as the Star Lord through their numbers."</p><p></p><p>"My ancestral grave will finally start to smoke."</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan's thoughts were deeper and more far-reaching, no longer just wanting to send these people to work in the electronics factory to earn money as before.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

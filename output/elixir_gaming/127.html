        <h1>Chapter 127</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the void above, Qi Yuan's mouth bore a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>But this smile, in the eyes of everyone present, was like the mockery of a devil.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, the music has just reached intermission, how come... everyone is already dead?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked helpless.</p><p></p><p>One thousand seven hundred supreme beings were not enough to kill.</p><p></p><p>The music had only played halfway, but they were all dead already.</p><p></p><p>Those present felt chilled to the bone.</p><p></p><p>Those were one thousand seven hundred supreme beings, not some random nobodies.</p><p></p><p>To die just like that... to die so inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clearly did not feel this sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>NPCs in the game, especially enemy NPCs, were dead and that was that.</p><p></p><p>The music continued, how could the killing stop?</p><p></p><p>His eyes involuntarily fell on the remaining thousand or so supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"How about... we add some more?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the surviving supreme beings' eyes bulged in terror, their hearts pounding in fear.</p><p></p><p>The tall, burly man who had spoken up for Qi Yuan earlier hurriedly said: "Blood Lord, we have always been loyal to you!"</p><p></p><p>The nearly hundred supreme beings who had stood up earlier, including Li Yunzhi, also quickly stood up: "We are willing to die for the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the thousand remaining supreme beings behind them were scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, how could they not understand what they should and should not do?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, those thousand supreme beings would be their fate.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to die for the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The voices rolled out, this time much louder and more forceful than when they had thanked the Blood Lord earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case... then I'll leave those three Great Supreme Beings to you. Don't beat them too badly, leave them with a breath of life," Qi Yuan said lazily, looking somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>His divine abilities were invincible against ordinary supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>But dealing with Great Supreme Beings was still a bit troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Better to let these thousand supreme beings attack and kill those three Great Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the suona continued, and the gongs and drums grew even louder.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand supreme beings turned in unison to look at those three Great Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>That imposing presence was enough to terrify.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you plot against the Blood Lord, your crimes deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>"Did you insignificant clowns think you could provoke the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the previously hesitant supreme beings transformed into the most loyal warriors, charging towards those three Great Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>Painful expressions appeared on the faces of the three Great Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>When the sudden change occurred, they had wanted to flee, but were locked in place by dozens of supreme being gazes, unable to leave.</p><p></p><p>Now, with over a thousand supreme beings attacking, how could they have any chance of survival?</p><p></p><p>The Yellow-Browed Great Supreme Being looked up to the sky and shouted, tearing his eyebrows: "Mi Kong, I never should have come with you!"</p><p></p><p>Countless origin divine abilities rained down.</p><p></p><p>The three Great Supreme Beings had no ability to fight back at all, and could only defend with all their might.</p><p></p><p>In just one round, in an instant, the three powerful Great Supreme Beings lost their fighting ability, their origin divine abilities exhausted, their bodies shattered.</p><p></p><p>If those thousand ordinary supreme beings hadn't held back, the three would have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sound of the suona still continued.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the broken sword and landed beside the three Great Supreme Beings: "You're too weak, you brought too few people, I didn't even reach level 200."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out the broken sword to finish off these three Great Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The Mi Kong Great Supreme Being looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes unresigned even in death: "You... you're not human!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to respond, killing off these three Great Supreme Beings one by one to the desolate sound of the suona.</p><p></p><p>Before the song ended, the slaughter was over.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt bored.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the city wall and looked at those playing music, saying softly: "If only you could be my musicians for life, that would be nice."</p><p></p><p>Taking a thousand supreme beings playing the suona to blow on Light Palace Mountain every day.</p><p></p><p>Light Palace... what a joke!</p><p></p><p>"Serving the Blood Lord is my honor!" the Yang Hun Supreme Being said fawningly.</p><p></p><p>They played music while constantly watching the slaughter below.</p><p></p><p>One thousand seven hundred supreme beings, killed off in the blink of an eye by the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying event this was! Yang Hun Supreme Being felt excited about his earlier choice.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had pledged allegiance to the Blood Lord early on, so he had the opportunity to become a member of the Blood Lord's most valued music troupe.</p><p></p><p>"However, your music still needs practice. Ideally when the suona sounds, people hundreds or thousands of miles away should be able to hear it.</p><p></p><p>That would befit my status."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, that would be too disruptive to the public, and some small animals are sleeping. I'm a very kind-hearted person, I absolutely can't do that sort of thing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was indifferent, but it sounded strange to everyone present.</p><p></p><p>This is called being kind-hearted... killing a thousand supreme beings just like that! They had never seen such a kind-hearted person before.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being fawned: "Having the Blood Lord in the Flowing Wind Realm is truly a blessing for the realm!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Yang Hun Supreme Being and said irritably: "Having you is truly my blessing too."</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme Being: "..."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, although the Blood Lord's words sounded like praise, he felt they somehow weren't.</p><p></p><p>The battle ended, the music troupe finished their song and came down from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on the city wall, his eyes showing both joy and helplessness: "Level 200 now."</p><p></p><p>This time, killing over a thousand supreme beings, plus three Great Supreme Beings, along with years of tightening screws in the Demon Spawn Factory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's level had finally reached 200.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, level 209 should be the peak of Great Supreme Being."</p><p></p><p>Levels 180 to 209 were all in the Great Supreme Being realm.</p><p></p><p>What came after that? Yin Spirit? Or something else?</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, after today's battle, I've exposed some of my strength.</p><p></p><p>These people in the Blood Palace probably won't rebel against me anymore."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't one to kill indiscriminately either.</p><p></p><p>Those who wanted to plot against him and kill him, he killed with ease.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, even if they were NPCs, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to have murderous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"I should quickly expand the Blood Palace's sphere of influence and recruit more supreme beings to help me find some demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>If I can't beat the White Emperor and the Sovereign, I can just call people to fight, right?"</p><p></p><p>If he had several hundred thousand supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't believe that no matter how powerful the White Emperor and Sovereign were, they could kill several hundred thousand supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the masses are powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, this didn't apply to him, but to others.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm a Great Supreme Being, why... can I still not inscribe origin divine abilities on my flesh and soul?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, Qi Yuan had only found it difficult to cultivate the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra and couldn't raise his realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was also encountering difficulties cultivating the Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Attraction.</p><p></p><p>He simply couldn't inscribe it, couldn't inscribe it at all!</p><p></p><p>"Is my talent really that poor?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very helpless.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Attraction had reached the Subtle level.</p><p></p><p>It was only one step away from the Inscription level.</p><p></p><p>Separated by a thin sheet of paper, but he simply couldn't inscribe it.</p><p></p><p>If he could inscribe it, Qi Yuan would probably become the heart demon of everyone in the world.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at him would cause heart demons to arise.</p><p></p><p>As for the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, Qi Yuan was still at the Time Exhaustion level.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate to the Subtle level, Qi Yuan guessed he might need to recall everything that had happened in his life, then forget it, then recall it again.</p><p></p><p>However, his memories after entering the Myriad Distinctions Gate were now somewhat blurry.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he needed a trigger.</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to enter the Myriad Distinctions Gate again to remember?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Myriad Distinctions Gate, he thought of the Goldfinch again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he still hadn't found that person from back then.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother." At this time, Chen Huan climbed up the city wall, his eyes also carrying a murderous look, "How should we deal with the remaining supreme beings?"</p><p></p><p>This time, when Mi Luo Supreme Being attacked, many supreme beings in the Blood Palace rebelled, which made Chen Huan furious.</p><p></p><p>The remaining supreme beings' initial indifference also angered Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Those who were willing to stand up earlier did quite well, raise their status in the Blood Palace by a notch."</p><p></p><p>There were positions within the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>But previously those supreme beings were extremely loose and didn't take these things seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>However, after this battle, these supreme beings had witnessed Qi Yuan's terrifying power, how could they still be like before?</p><p></p><p>These positions naturally represented power.</p><p></p><p>"As for the rest, just leave them as they are, I can't be bothered to manage or waste thought on them," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The art of managing subordinates?</p><p></p><p>The art of rulership? Many people regarded these as cardinal principles.</p><p></p><p>To Qi Yuan, what were those?</p><p></p><p>He was just a player who would leave when the game ended, why think so much?</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" Chen Huan understood Qi Yuan's personality and didn't try to persuade him, but clasped his hands in salute.</p><p></p><p>For those at the supreme being realm, reconstructing the body was nothing.</p><p></p><p>When he was ambushed by several supreme beings earlier, one of his arms was cut off, but it had long since regrown.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to go into seclusion for a while and won't see anyone.</p><p></p><p>I'll leave the expansion of the Blood Palace to you.</p><p></p><p>I'll appear once a year to give a lecture.</p><p></p><p>If you find the Goldfinch, just send her directly to the underground palace."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go to the underground palace to properly comprehend the origin and improve his origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>This comprehension couldn't be obtained by killing monsters like before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had to rely on his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>As for expanding No Return City, recruiting peak Mortal Realm Myths, and capturing demon spawn, he could leave that to Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan directly left No Return City and entered the underground palace outside the city.</p><p></p><p>While comprehending the origin, he still had to kill demon spawn and tighten screws, being exceptionally diligent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Liu Gaoda wore a blood-colored robe as he stood in the demon cave, looking very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of crappy demon cave is this, not a single demon spawn left?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Gaoda came from the Blood Palace. Ten years ago, when the Blood Palace rebelled, he stood up and gained the Blood Lord's favor.</p><p></p><p>Now he had become one of the bigwigs in the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, there's nothing here. Let's go check the next one," said a mid-stage Supreme, fawning over Liu Gaoda, an early-stage Supreme.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the Blood Palace had been constantly expanding. Many Supremes had joined its ranks. In the Northern Lands, the old demons were either dead or had joined the Blood Palace. </p><p></p><p>After all, the Blood Palace was truly terrifying. Though they lacked top-tier combat power, they made up for it with sheer numbers of Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Once, a great Supreme from the Northern Lands spoke rashly against the Blood Lord. That very night, three thousand red-robed Supremes rushed to the North. They first played a suona horn, then all three thousand attacked at once, beating that great Supreme to death! After that, even the powerful great Supremes learned to watch their words. They even strictly forbade their descendants from going out, fearing they might offend the legendary Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>The world was shocked. Who hadn't heard of the Blood Palace? Who didn't know of the Blood Lord? Legends of the Blood Lord spread everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace kept expanding, swallowing up the Northern Lands. Countless demon lairs fell into their hands. Every day, an endless stream of demon spawn was sent into the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>The once-terrifying demon spawn had become like trophies to those Supremes. The demon spawn they previously couldn't kill fast enough, now the Supremes could only lament that there weren't enough to go around!</p><p></p><p>Within the Blood Palace, there were many conflicts over demon lairs and demon spawn. Now Liu Gaoda, having accepted the surrender of Northern Supremes, was leading them here to find demon lairs.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the next demon lair isn't empty too?" Liu Gaoda said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"It definitely won't be. In the next lair, there's a great Supreme cultivating. That great Supreme is a confidant of the Venerable One!" said the mid-stage Supreme.</p><p></p><p>In the world today, there was no news of the Venerable One or the White Emperor. Only the great Supremes knew where they had gone. Without the Venerable One and White Emperor, this world belonged to the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable One's confidant... is it Demon Crocodile?" Liu Gaoda's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's another. He is... the highest commander of the North from the North-South Battle," replied the mid-stage Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Liu Gaoda's eyes lit up, feeling a wave of emotion. Once upon a time, the North-South Battle was considered the decisive battle that would destroy the South. Now, he had come to the depths of the North, to the territory of the North's highest commander.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Liu Gaoda waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>[The passage continues with more dialogue and descriptions of events involving various characters and factions.]</p>

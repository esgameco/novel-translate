        <h1>Chapter 548</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was only... emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"A blind woman?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan called out again, but alas, there was no trace of the blind woman to be seen where his vision reached.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly scanned his surroundings, his face filled with a puzzled expression. </p><p></p><p>The place where he now stood was strange and illusory, yet dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the path he remembered walking, the rest of the area had not coalesced into physical form.</p><p></p><p>It was as if broken, multicolored lines, or fireflies, or a jumble of numerical codes.</p><p></p><p>[Fragments of the void, a chaotic mess, unknowable, invisible, unfathomable.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed a thick aura of threat in the disorder and chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, he understood that if he were an ordinary person, he might not be able to see these fragments of the void.</p><p></p><p>His eyes could perceive hidden information, allowing him to see these things.</p><p></p><p>Without further delay, Qi Yuan followed the familiar path towards the blind woman's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the well-trodden path that had solidified, the surrounding environment was all fragments of the void.</p><p></p><p>Like indecipherable code, they could not be touched even if one reached out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan did not dare to carelessly reach out and touch them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at the blind woman's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's perception, there had previously been a wooden house and a courtyard there.</p><p></p><p>But now, all that remained was a babbling stream, as if the memories of the past were mere illusions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze grew serious.</p><p></p><p>He went to other places as well.</p><p></p><p>But aside from the few solidified paths he often walked, everything else was fragments of the void.</p><p></p><p>He stepped on the rocky path, but the sensation of landing and the sunlight were no longer present.</p><p></p><p>The only things clinging to the walls were... something like luminescent fireflies, the fragments of the void.</p><p></p><p>The fragments of the void seemed to be constantly consuming... this material world.</p><p></p><p>The entire Shenmu Abyss was empty, with no other living beings besides Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Not even ants, not even paramecia or bacteria.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that everything is fake?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Then what is real?"</p><p></p><p>This matter was shrouded in endless strangeness.</p><p></p><p>He stood alone in the Shenmu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman was gone, her house was gone, the swing was gone.</p><p></p><p>The fruits she had given Qi Yuan were also gone.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I don't defecate, otherwise I might be able to find the remnants of the fruits."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I've been talking to thin air this whole time, and even eating air?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the forging techniques are real, and my memories won't lie to me, so... I need to use my clever brain."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strange occurrences in this Shenmu Abyss were not limited to just one incident, like that night's romantic encounter and the faint floral fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still didn't know who had pushed him.</p><p></p><p>If it was all fake...</p><p></p><p>Well, it definitely wasn't fake, Qi Yuan's memories were very vivid.</p><p></p><p>"As for the blind woman... I can make a bold conjecture or two."</p><p></p><p>"One, is it possible that she truly existed, but in the end, she helped me complete the final flaw of the Divine Arrival, and she exhausted all her resources and disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>This speculation also had a certain probability.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman was real, but after giving Qi Yuan a spring twig, she exhausted all her resources and vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Two, everything is an illusion... the one-eyed forgemaster actually has a mental illness, and the blind woman is a figment of his imagination, not real."</p><p></p><p>This also had a high probability.</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, Qi Yuan had once seen a movie where the protagonist wanted to practice martial arts and encountered a martial arts deity, but later discovered that the deity did not actually exist and was just imagined by him.</p><p></p><p>"Three, only by being blind... can the conditions be triggered to see the blind woman, and now that my eyes are good, I can't see her?"</p><p></p><p>This world contains too many mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Just as two-dimensional beings cannot imagine three-dimensional beings, ordinary humans can only see what the naked eye can observe.</p><p></p><p>As for what the naked eye cannot see, they cannot even imagine it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Qi Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The world became dark again.</p><p></p><p>"Blind woman?"</p><p></p><p>He softly called out, but only heard the echo of his own voice, with no one responding.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"The blind woman once said that she had taught Sheng Nü the forging techniques... If I find Sheng Nü, won't I know whether the blind woman really existed?"</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü was not a blind person.</p><p></p><p>"So, I need to find Sheng Nü!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps everything will be resolved then."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>He no longer hesitated, and looking at the empty Shenmu Abyss, he said solemnly, "Blind woman, I remember the swing, and I also remember your eyes."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, his figure disappeared from the Shenmu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He went to the Shenmu Ravine through a tiny speck of light.</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Abyss, it was empty and silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew through, as if there was the sound of falling leaves, or the creaking sound of a swing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Ravine.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze strange: "I didn't expect your injuries to be so severe, yet you've recovered so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The last time he saw Qi Yuan, Qi Yuan was still unconscious and on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun thought that only the Domain Lord could truly heal him.</p><p></p><p>As for other methods, they might only treat the symptoms, not the root cause.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Qi Yuan had recovered easily.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're alive, I suppose I'll have to end this mission in failure." Xian Ling Yingjun shrugged, his face filled with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>His mission this time was to assist the Thorn Blood in transforming the Shenmu into a Devilish Realm.</p><p></p><p>And then turn the Qingshan Realm into a Devilish Domain.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan, a top-tier combat force, here, he definitely wouldn't be able to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>Might as well just abandon the mission and explore the Shenmu Ravine instead.</p><p></p><p>"What discoveries have you made in the Shenmu Ravine?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>The Shenmu Ravine was an extremely special place, not only containing a divine tree, but perhaps other treasures as well.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had also speculated that the divine tree might be related to the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the divine tree, the information he received indicated that it was indeed a special tree, comparable to the legendary Jianmu, but unrelated to the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun furrowed his brows: "As for major discoveries, there aren't any, but there is one strange matter. I found a tomb here."</p><p></p><p>"A tomb?" Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Come, I'll take you to see it." Xian Ling Yingjun led the way, and Qi Yuan followed.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, the two of them appeared as streaks of light in a secluded valley.</p><p></p><p>The valley was filled with withered fallen leaves, and the atmosphere felt heavy with the wind blowing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attention was immediately drawn to the tombstone in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"The tombstone is nameless, and when I looked at it with my Heavenly Eyes, the coffin inside was empty, I don't know whose tomb this is," Xian Ling Yingjun said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was strange.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the stone tablet was smooth and flat, with no inscriptions, only some rough and simple patterns.</p><p></p><p>This tombstone seemed to have weathered countless ages, and Qi Yuan even saw an "aged" aura on it.</p><p></p><p>"This tombstone..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was peculiar.</p><p></p><p>He had seen this tombstone before.</p><p></p><p>"Do you recognize it? Do you know whose tomb this is?" Xian Ling Yingjun asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan's role as the son-in-law was fulfilled, one of the things he had awakened to was a strange stone.</p><p></p><p>Most of that strange stone was used by the Goddess to patch the ground.</p><p></p><p>The remaining part was used to create a tombstone.</p><p></p><p>And that was the one in front of him.</p><p></p><p>So, the one buried here is... the Goddess? "If I tell you this tombstone is mine, would you believe me?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Hah, you might as well say you're the one buried here, and I might just believe you." Xian Ling Yingjun said, looking at Qi Yuan with a complex expression. "Since this mission has failed, I'll have to return to the Void Paradise as well. Qi Ge... take care."</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's talent was the strongest he had ever seen in his life.</p><p></p><p>Able to defeat Fengti, if placed in the Zhou Universe, many Domain Lords would likely compete to take him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was also the possibility of being "possessed".</p><p></p><p>But the pity was that he lived in a nascent universe, a world that couldn't even complete a single era.</p><p></p><p>His fate was destined to be tragic.</p><p></p><p>No matter how brilliant a prodigy he was, he could not change the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, NPC." Qi Yuan smiled, "Go back and read more books, if I have anything I don't understand in the future, I'll continue to ask you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Xian Ling Yingjun's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in front of the nameless tombstone for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I should go back to the Luosha Kingdom, deliver the new Divine Arrival, and then check on Sheng Nü's information to see where she is now!"</p><p></p><p>As for the last part, he still had to play a role.</p><p></p><p>The performance of the Divine Arrival was not yet complete, and the performance of the one-eyed forgemaster was already complete, but he had awakened to a new role to play.</p><p></p><p>Once the Divine Arrival was over, he estimated that he would have to go play that new role.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure flashed, and when he reappeared, he was by the hot springs.</p><p></p><p>In the hot springs, Shen Lingxuan was wearing a black dress, her whole body wet and dripping, her long legs casually sprawled out, very eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Setting aside her beauty, if it was said that the junior sister Jiang Lingsu...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching features are the voluptuous and tender breasts of the golden canary, while Ning Tao and Shen Lingxuan's most attractive assets are their slender and jade-like feet and long, round and flawless jade-like legs respectively.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuannan's gaze, they are very suitable to be coiled around his waist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she still had a veil on her face, making it difficult to see her features clearly.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing it with his own eyes and tasting it before, the feelings are different, pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we're going to the Luosha Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuannan embraced Shen Lingxuan's waist, and the water droplets on her body dissipated, her clothes also drying instantly, the long skirt falling down to completely cover her delicate and fair jade-like legs.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Yuannan knows what kind of charm is hidden beneath the restraints.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Shen Lingxuan replied.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly also flew over and landed on Shen Lingxuan's shoulder. She still looked a bit weak, and it seemed that the trauma caused by her previous forced entry into the Divine Wood Abyss was still lingering.</p><p></p><p>"However, before going to the Luosha Kingdom, I still need to go to a place to check if those White Moonlights have been diligently working hard. If they are not, I'll have to bury their ancestors in eighteen bags."</p><p></p><p>The so-called "burying their ancestors in eighteen bags" means to chop up their ancestors and put them into eighteen bags.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>There was no difference from the usual.</p><p></p><p>The fat face of the Fifth Princess Qingyan was ashen, and as a princess of the Luosha Kingdom, her appearance was quite ugly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she gritted her teeth, her face full of resentful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Qingyan, be calm, the Godly Arrival is nothing to be concerned about," the leader of the Thorny Blood spoke, with an indifferent expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that the Godly Arrival can kill gods, wiping out the six gods of the Luosha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This strength can be considered terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But the leader of the Thorny Blood had secretly stepped into the realm of the Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"When they emerge from the Divine Wood Abyss, I will personally take action to capture them," the Thorny Blood leader said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had stepped into the realm of the Great Venerable, he could be considered the strongest in the Azure Hills Realm for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could get all the Divine Wood Tokens and enter the Divine Wood Abyss to refine the Divine Wood into Ominous Spirits, his task would be completed, and the rewards would be extremely generous.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, the Godly Arrival has come out of the Divine Wood Abyss!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Heaven-level Divine Soldier came, his face full of awe.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Fifth Princess Qingyan's face was filled with killing intent: "Leader, please help me!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, since he has come out, then... he has no chance of survival!" the Thorny Blood leader said casually, with a calm and indifferent tone, "I'll go meet him now."</p><p></p><p>But just at that moment, a gentle voice suddenly sounded in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, have you been diligently cultivating in my absence? Have your cultivation bases improved?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, why are you all so weak? Doesn't even have ten God-Realm cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Can you find the reasons yourselves and reflect on it?"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a handsome and peerless young man had his arm around the waist of a graceful woman, his face full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>In the Thorny Blood Stronghold, everyone who heard Qi Yuannan's voice had a terrified expression on their face.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Princess Qingyan's expression was fearful, but seeing the leader beside her, she quickly said, "Leader, it's him, he is the Godly Arrival Qi Yuannan!"</p><p></p><p>The other God-Realm Divine Soldiers and Heaven-Level Divine Soldiers all eyed Qi Yuannan, finding his words too strange and bizarre. What did it have to do with them whether they cultivated diligently or not?</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood leader narrowed his eyes, his killing intent spreading: "Qi Yuannan, you have a lot of guts to dare to intrude into my Thorny Blood. Today, you won't be leaving alive!"</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood was not the Luosha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood had the backing of the Black Heavens!</p><p></p><p>"Since you all like to lie down and be lazy, I'll just let you keep lying down forever!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuannan turned his hand into a sword.</p><p></p><p>A sharp sword beam descended from the sky, falling into the Thorny Blood Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant light and blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>This sword beam entered as if there was no one there, slaughtering indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The Thorny Blood leader unleashed his divine domain, with a terrifying aura permeating the area.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, he deflated like a balloon and was pierced through by the sword beam.</p><p></p><p>He only looked heroic for two seconds before falling from the sky, dying on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" The rest of the Thorny Blood members had terrified expressions.</p><p></p><p>The leader couldn't even withstand a single attack. </p><p></p><p>How could he be so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, they frantically fled.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were far too inferior to Qi Yuannan, and that sword beam slew even the God-Realm Divine Soldiers as if they were nothing.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire Thorny Blood Stronghold was wiped out by Qi Yuannan.</p><p></p><p>"Let you lie down? This is the result of your actions!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuannan looked at the bloody corpses in the Thorny Blood Stronghold, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"The experience gained from this group of people is not even as much as what Feng Tiao's life gave me."</p><p></p><p>He no longer looked at the Thorny Blood Stronghold, but instead embraced Shen Lingxuan's waist: "Wife, let's go, we'll spend the night in the palace."</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared once again.</p><p></p><p>About a few hours later, several Divine Soldiers arrived at the Thorny Blood Stronghold, their faces filled with extreme terror.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Godly Arrival has arrived, I wonder what the future of the Luosha Kingdom will be like."</p><p></p><p>In the Luosha Kingdom's palace, Qi Yuannan placed the new Godly Arrival in the palace, his emotions complex.</p><p></p><p>With the Spring Blossom gifted by the Blind Maiden, the new Godly Arrival was full of infinite possibilities, constantly progressing towards perfection.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng lowered his head, full of awe and a bit of terror.</p><p></p><p>The Godly Arrival Qi Yuannan not only had God-Realm combat power, but could also refine divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat horrifying.</p><p></p><p>"With the Godly Arrival here, I'm sure... the future of the Luosha Kingdom will definitely be bright and eternal!" Liu Sheng said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>This time when he returned, he also had to instruct his clan to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so." Qi Yuannan said indifferently, "When can you organize the information about the Fairy Maiden for me?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng bowed his head: "Regarding the information about the Fairy Maiden, the palace and several other states all have records. Within three days, I will present all the scrolls and books that record the Fairy Maiden."</p><p></p><p>"Good." Qi Yuannan nodded, three days was not a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be sleeping in this palace for the next three days, don't disturb me unless it's important." Qi Yuannan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng bowed respectfully and left the hall, not daring to take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>In the magnificent hall, only Qi Yuannan and Shen Lingxuan remained.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuannan looked at Shen Lingxuan, his eyes filled with amusement: "I haven't really looked at your face yet."</p><p></p><p>His hand pulled, and the light veil on Shen Lingxuan's face fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A beautiful snow-white face entered Qi Yuannan's vision.</p><p></p><p>What a face, Qi Yuannan could not describe it, just by looking at it once, he felt as if he was seeing a seductress that could cause calamity.</p><p></p><p>Although her expression was cold and her appearance was elegant, Qi Yuannan saw the charm of all kinds of coquettish women blended into one.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an alluring atmosphere permeated the air, and a blush crept up on Shen Lingxuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Being watched by Qi Yuannan's invasive and appreciative gaze, Shen Lingxuan dared not move, her breathing slightly rapid, her ample bosom rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>"I've always had a dream, to spend the night in the palace, and today it has been realized."</p><p></p><p>His hand brushed over her ankles, the skirt was lifted, revealing her flawless and jade-like legs, like a priceless treasure that was hard to let go of.</p><p></p><p>Her thighs were exposed to the air, snow-white and tender, and Shen Lingxuan felt a chill in the night, the temperature contrasting sharply with the warmth of the palm. A blush crept up on her cold face: "Don't look..."</p><p></p><p>She felt a bit shy, her jade-like hands couldn't help but cover Qi Yuannan's eyes, but afraid that Qi Yuannan would be displeased with her, she clumsily used her lips to seal Qi Yuannan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>The three days passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuannan had also fulfilled his dream from his time on the Blue Star, spending the night in the palace.</p><p></p><p>With the new Godly Arrival, the Luosha Kingdom has undergone many changes.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say the biggest change, it would actually be the deaths.</p><p></p><p>The new rules have arrived, emphasizing no pursuit of the past.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for major incidents like killing without reason, they would still be investigated according to the original Godly Arrival's laws.</p><p></p><p>It is difficult for the world to be perfect, or one could say that win-win situations are rare, even Qi Yuannan cannot achieve it.</p><p></p><p>However, after the baptism of blood, the Luosha Kingdom is much better than the initial chaos and lack of rules.</p><p></p><p>At least, there is vitality, or one could say, a spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Qi, all the information and materials related to the Fairy Maiden are here." Liu Sheng respectfully handed over the storage artifact.</p><p></p><p>In these three days, he had traveled to several states to collect all the information about the Fairy Maiden.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuannan opened the storage artifact, his brows raising: "Why are there also a few divine artifacts? Also related to the Fairy Maiden?"</p><p></p><p>There were differences between divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary divine artifacts, of course, were not as strange and powerful in battle as the Godly Arrival.</p><p></p><p>"...Unrelated." Liu Sheng said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The most precious things in the Luosha Kingdom were these few divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>He thought of collecting these few God-Realm ones and offering them to Qi Yuannan.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's unrelated, then return them to their original owners." Qi Yuannan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He was quite picky.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want anything that wasn't related to the White Moonlights.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted something of the White Moonlights, it wasn't because he was greedy, but because he wanted to inherit the legacy of the White Moonlights, using these legacies to prove that they had once existed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 522</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After sending off Tusan and Zhan Wenyu, Qi Yuan took out the Divine Wood Token, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>"The aftereffects from the last time have finally been completely resolved, it's time to go out for a walk."</p><p></p><p>He had to go see Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>The final step in completing the role of the son-in-law was on Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>And, to achieve the state of Heaven and Man as One, he also needed more high-quality "white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, how many Sky-Rank Armament Masters and Divine-Rank Armament Masters, or Mysterious Spirits, do you Thorn Blood have?" Qi Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the bathing Ji Wuyun felt it was going to be another speechless day.</p><p></p><p>Where did these two sound like mortal enemies?</p><p></p><p>"Not many, very few in number," the Thorn Blood staff member replied. "Divine-Rank Armament Masters, only... five."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the Thorn Blood staff member far away revealed a smug expression.</p><p></p><p>That should be enough to subdue that kid, right? "Ah, you Thorn Blood are not up to par, only a handful of Divine-Rank Armament Masters.</p><p></p><p>You should make them reflect, see if their cultivation has improved after all these years, have they been cultivating diligently?"</p><p></p><p>"..." The Thorn Blood staff member's smile froze.</p><p></p><p>"You pass on a message for me, don't eat too much tonight, and don't sleep either, focus on cultivation, and quickly improve your cultivation!" Qi Yuan said very seriously.</p><p></p><p>These people were not diligent, their cultivation was weak, how could they become high-quality "white moonlight"?</p><p></p><p>He had already looked down on ordinary "white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>Now, only the Heaven and Man as One Sky-Rank "white moonlight" could stir his heart.</p><p></p><p>So, he now looked at Thorn Blood with some disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want me to formulate a cultivation plan for you? In this world, no one understands making plans better than me.</p><p></p><p>If you cultivate according to my plan, within three months, you will definitely have a few more Divine-Rank Armament Masters!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very sincere.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun spat out the bathwater in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member's eyes also revealed a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Caidao, I'm looking forward to your meeting with the Divine Wood Abyss, I want to see what you look like.</p><p></p><p>How is this Qingshan Realm worthy of producing such a divine and handsome person like you."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you still don't want to work hard." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>No wonder all the rulers seem to dislike the word "lying flat."</p><p></p><p>He was not a ruler yet, but he was already worried about Thorn Blood's people not working hard.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Caidao, if further effort cannot change the predetermined result, what's the use of working hard?" The Thorn Blood staff member seemed to have some feelings.</p><p></p><p>"How can that be? This means you haven't made a plan.</p><p></p><p>I've played many games, played for many years, and the things I want to do, I basically succeed in one after another." Qi Yuan said, secretly plagiarizing the words of a great official from the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>He thought in his heart that the reputation of plagiarism didn't seem too good.</p><p></p><p>Should he... still destroy the Blue Star, or buy the Blue Star?</p><p></p><p>That way, he could openly plagiarize.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Caidao, you are a little too self-confident, do you know if you can change... the fate of the Qingshan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Thousands of miles away, the Thorn Blood staff member's eyes revealed a smug expression.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and pushed open the window, and the fresh air rushed into the room.</p><p></p><p>Leaning on the windowsill, the lush scenery was reflected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the unicorn is hidden in the mountains and forests, the ordinary people unknown to the masses, if you get close, you can also discover their extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The "Qingshan Book," he had exchanged it in the Void Garden.</p><p></p><p>This book came from the Glorious Association.</p><p></p><p>He had used up many merits to exchange it.</p><p></p><p>This was also his reliance in completing this task.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The carriage was slowly moving on the official road, with fast horses galloping from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was driving the carriage, leisurely and carefree.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, it's only a hundred miles away from Tianxong, I estimate we'll arrive by nightfall."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Shen family's stronghold, Qi Yuan's target was very clear, heading straight for Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>The last step in playing the role of the son-in-law Qi Yuan was probably to ride Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>This step, he had to think carefully, and take it slowly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked ahead, and saw endless mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Boundless, as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of Tianxong was located in the midst of the mountains.</p><p></p><p>And these mountains just happened to border the Moshan Kingdom, next to the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the military spearhead of the Moshan Kingdom had advanced directly, and Ninguo was unable to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was the current Dao Master of Tianxong who unleashed the Patriarch's artifact to block the advance of the Moshan Kingdom's army.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Moshan Kingdom's army has been stationed, and the two countries have begun negotiations, with Ninguo eventually losing several prefectures.</p><p></p><p>And that Dao Master of Tianxong, also died half a year later due to serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>"The great mountains to the south... should be the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss, how coincidental, we're passing by this instance."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, glancing at Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao seemed to have some connection with the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p></p><p>When he killed Wind Iron, Qi Yuan had received this hint.</p><p></p><p>"How about we go take a look at the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss sometime, maybe there are many treasures there." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master Hengshan and the Divine-Rank Armament Master Wind Iron had explored the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss, seemingly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"It's up to the Young Master to decide!" Chen Kangbao responded, looking at the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss, he seemed even hungrier, and quickly ate a bun, his belly round and full, he still seemed a bit hungry.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, if you don't mind, may I ride with you for a while."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an old, hoarse voice came, and a burly old man appeared, bald head, short and stocky, looking quite bandit-like.</p><p></p><p>But his speech was refined.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan glanced at the old man.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, Slaughter the Four Seas, a peak Divine-Rank Armament Master.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas jumped off his horse and leapt into Qi Yuan's carriage.</p><p></p><p>His horse didn't leave, following the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, aren't you afraid I'm a bandit?" Slaughter the Four Seas chuckled heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Not afraid, I like to punish evil and promote good the most." Qi Yuan had always adhered to the lawful and good alignment.</p><p></p><p>He had never harmed innocent people, and if he did harm, it would only be his own "white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, looking at Slaughter the Four Seas, and asked, "What brings you here, just say it."</p><p></p><p>A peak Divine-Rank Armament Master, in Ninguo he would be ranked among the top thirty great masters, coming to see him, it was naturally not just a whim.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, your... fortune is not shallow, but now you are beset by calamity." Slaughter the Four Seas said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Are you a fortune-teller? I can also tell fortunes." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He had told fortunes for many people, and in the end, they were all very accurate.</p><p></p><p>He said who would have a bloody disaster, and they would.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas shook his head: "Old man is not joking with you, young man, please look."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a bronze mirror appeared in Qi Yuan's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>The bronze mirror was not smooth, with many small bumps and pits, and the handle was covered in copper rust, looking very ancient.</p><p></p><p>[Calamity-Subduing Bronze Mirror, a Sky-Rank Artifact, has several holes, can be improved to increase its power by 90%.]</p><p></p><p>"Young man, please look."</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas placed the Calamity-Subduing Bronze Mirror in front of Qi Yuan, and Qi Yuan's gaze couldn't help but look into the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas had a smug expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't this little brother be frightened? However, when Qi Yuan saw the scene in the mirror, his expression remained remarkably calm.</p><p></p><p>"There's actually a Mysterious Spirit following me, evading my eyes, I didn't even notice?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's tone was calm.</p><p></p><p>He looked into the mirror and saw in his own reflection, there was a colorful bug.</p><p></p><p>This bug was as big as a soccer ball, with patterned and colorful markings, looking rather creepy and not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>However, this bug seemed to be already lifeless.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this is a Spirit Body Insect, a special kind of Mysterious Spirit.</p><p></p><p>It has no physical body, it is a collection of the rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Invisible to the naked eye, undetectable, only a Sky-Rank Armament Master in the state of Heaven and Man as One can discover its existence." Slaughter the Four Seas said, "If old man didn't have this Calamity-Subduing Bronze Mirror, I wouldn't have even discovered this Spirit Body Insect."</p><p></p><p>The carriage driver Chen Kangbao turned his head, looking at the bug in the bronze mirror, his eyes revealing a fearful expression: "Young Master, this thing is still following us even though it's dead, it's so creepy!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was a bit scared.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas looked at Qi Yuan, his expression complex: "This Spirit Body Insect, it should have been used by a powerful expert to protect you completely.</p><p></p><p>It's just that, that powerful expert has perished, and this Spirit Body Insect has also fallen for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>The dead Spirit Body Insect, still following you... is not a good thing for you.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Body Insect belongs to the dark and mysterious, with an ominous aura, the corpse will inadvertently emanate a disastrous energy, if you stay with it for a long time, you will surely die."</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas raised his eyebrows, boasting proudly: "Kid, don't you quickly thank old man? If old man didn't point this out, you might have lost your life in a few years."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the information!" Qi Yuan solemnly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Although, this Spirit Body Insect really wouldn't threaten him at all, and in fact, after a while when he achieved the state of Heaven and Man as One, he would also be able to see the Spirit Body Insect.</p><p></p><p>But this Slaughter the Four Seas telling him this fact, letting him know in advance, this kindness he kept in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, in the future if you encounter any trouble, look for me Qi Yuan, I'll keep you safe." Qi Yuan was very generous, not at all stingy.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat... have no manners at all." Slaughter the Four Seas, though he said this, was not at all angry, it was very clear that his temperament was good.</p><p></p><p>"Old man is a mighty Divine-Rank Armament Master, do I still need you to keep me safe? In this Ninguo, there are few who are stronger than me." Slaughter the Four Seas said, "Come, sweeten your words a little, beg old man to help you resolve this Spirit Body Insect."</p><p></p><p>The corpse of this Spirit Body Insect was also something good for him to study.</p><p></p><p>"No need to bother you, I can resolve it myself." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, you're still young, even more boastful than when I was young!</p><p></p><p>This Spirit Body Insect when it was alive was comparable to a Sky-Rank Armament Master, even if old man wants to resolve it, it would be extremely difficult, you can't even detect it, and you still say you can resolve it?"</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas naturally thought Qi Yuan was bluffing.</p><p></p><p>He was still young, looking no more than twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a genius, he was at most a Divine-Rank Armament Master.</p><p></p><p>And protect his safety, what nonsense? "Old man, watch closely."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the Spirit Body Insect behind him, and suddenly opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Before Slaughter the Four Seas could react, that mouth suddenly closed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spherical Spirit Body Insect abruptly burrowed into Qi Yuan's belly.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter the Four Seas widened his eyes, looking at Qi Yuan as if he were a monster: "You... ate it?"</p><p></p><p>That was a Spirit Body Insect!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A special heavenly-level demonic spirit! He actually ate it?? This scene completely exceeded his imagination and understanding.</p><p></p><p>How could a person, or rather, how could they eat a demonic spirit? Next to him, Chen Kang swallowed his saliva: "Young master... Is it delicious and doesn't get stuck in your teeth? If it gets stuck, take it out and let me have a taste!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tu Sihai felt that these two people were not normal.</p><p></p><p>His legs were numb, quite severely.</p><p></p><p>"It's delicious, I want to eat more," Qi Yuan patted his stomach.</p><p></p><p>This spirit body talisman was like eating air, but it was supported by the principle of heaven and human unity.</p><p></p><p>He was unable to break through to level 120, and what he lacked was the unity of heaven and human.</p><p></p><p>Now he had supplemented a little, although the amount was small and unable to support his breakthrough to level 120, but for him, his combat power had increased considerably.</p><p></p><p>"Monster." Tu Sihai swallowed his saliva, his face full of bewilderment, "How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>He was a little afraid, the events before him exceeded his cognition.</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to eat it, so I ate it." Qi Yuan said casually, in a lazy posture.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai took a deep breath: "I don't know your name yet, I am Tu Sihai of the Huang Mountain Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai remembered this name, and at the same time his mind kept thinking, but he really couldn't think of any powerful Qi surname figures.</p><p></p><p>"The Huang Mountain Sect seems to be a sect in the Cloud Sea Country, old man, how did you come here?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>After all, Tu Sihai had helped him, and Qi Yuan still remembered the grace.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai looked at Qi Yuan with some apprehension and said thoughtfully, "There are rumors that a treasure has appeared in the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss, and many strong experts have rushed to the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"What treasure?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Again, the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this instance dungeon is really destined to be related to him.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, "The embryo of a divine artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Above the heavenly-level artifacts are divine artifacts. </p><p></p><p>In the surrounding dozens of small countries, there were basically no traces of divine artifacts, and even heavenly artifacts were rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>The embryo of a divine artifact is a semi-finished divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Once it appears, it naturally attracts many strong experts from the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Although the embryo of a divine artifact is not a divine artifact, in terms of value, even ten or twenty peak heavenly artifacts cannot compare to it.</p><p></p><p>"Just that?" Qi Yuan didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>He himself was the ultimate divine artifact, naturally he didn't care about this.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai was surprised, but still cupped his hands and asked, "Brother Qi, if you are interested, why don't you come with me?"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's ability to swallow the spirit body talisman, he had already put Qi Yuan on par with his peers.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I have to go see my wife, I'll go to this instance dungeon next time."</p><p></p><p>An embryo of a divine artifact, Qi Yuan didn't care about it.</p><p></p><p>The embryo of a divine artifact can't be eaten.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many thoughts flashed through Tu Sihai's mind.</p><p></p><p>He speculated that this Qi Yuan might be of average strength, but his methods were strange, and he didn't want to venture into the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Those going to the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss this time were at least earth-level spirit generals, and there were even earth-level peak experts, not to mention possibly even heavenly-level spirit generals.</p><p></p><p>So it was normal for Qi Yuan to avoid going because of his weak strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, the embryo of a divine artifact has a huge attraction to any spirit general.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, since the spirit body talisman has been resolved, I won't stay any longer, farewell, and we'll meet again if fate allows!" Tu Sihai spoke without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>And this master-servant pair was really strange, he didn't dare to stay too close, it was better to leave.</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter any trouble, come to the Tian Sect and look for me, I'll protect you once." Qi Yuan said generously.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Qi!" Tu Sihai seriously remembered the Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Sect was one of the top two sects in the Ning Country, and in terms of strength, he also had a bit of apprehension, but it was just apprehension.</p><p></p><p>The Huang Mountain Sect was much stronger than the Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai mounted his horse and rode away.</p><p></p><p>"Go, speed up and go to the Tian Sect." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the spirit body talisman, he had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>This should be left by the father of the son-in-law Qi Yuan to protect Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Guang Yao Hall's Fang Shisan and the Black Crow Elder of the Thorny Blood probably both feared the spirit body talisman, so they didn't directly attack Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit body talisman may not only be to protect me, but also... possibly to protect the Divine Wood Token!" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the father of this son-in-law Qi Yuan is also quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"So when I'm playing the role, I also need to consider him, so that it will be complete."</p><p></p><p>While pondering, he watched the scenery, and the carriage slowly passed through the mountains and arrived at the Tian Sect as the sun set.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Lingxuan's husband Qi Yuan requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>In the main hall at the foot of the Tian Sect, Qi Yuan softly called out.</p><p></p><p>Generally, without prior notice, visitors need to state their purpose in the main hall at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice fell, a beautiful young woman walked over, and when she saw Qi Yuan's appearance, a trace of amazement flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be Senior Brother Qi Yuan, I'll go notify the elders right away, please wait a moment, Senior Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was a son-in-law, he was still Shen Lingxuan's husband, and these ordinary disciples could not offend his existence.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Wang Qingyi, dressed in a Taoist robe, appeared, her eyes filled with a puzzled expression: "What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>The wooden hairpin was casually inserted in her hair, and the depth of her eyes carried a heavy fatigue.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen Lingxuan for many days, I want to see her, is she here?" Qi Yuan stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi frowned, and the worry in her eyes deepened: "Lingxuan is not in the sect now."</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao: "There have been a lot of disasters happening around the Tian Sect recently, you should hurry back to the Fengshan Prefecture, I will inform Lingxuan about your visit."</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi said, thinking of something: "You two going back is also not safe, I'll have a disciple of the Tian Sect escort you back."</p><p></p><p>"This... Senior Qingyi, where has Lingxuan gone?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and still called her Senior.</p><p></p><p>"This is not something you need to know." Wang Qingyi did not say.</p><p></p><p>She knew that Shen Lingxuan's husband was just an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>If she told him, it would not be good.</p><p></p><p>Now it's best to send him back to the Fengshan Prefecture, if he stays here, if that heavenly-level spirit general from the Luo Zhi Country knows about it, things might get very complicated.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, that heavenly-level spirit general came aggressively, using his might to suppress, saying he would give Shen Lingxuan a chance to serve the Fifth Majesty.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Sect naturally did not comply, and that heavenly-level spirit general did not hold back, directly attacking to suppress.</p><p></p><p>However, the Tian Sect was an old-line sect with a lot of heritage, and the Sect Master summoned the Patriarch's Sword to resist the enemy outside.</p><p></p><p>That heavenly-level spirit general was a little wary and did not attack again, but remained stationed outside the Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the people of the Tian Sect were in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of that old eunuch Mo Sanxu, given time, he could break through the Tian Sect's defenses.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Shen Lingxuan would still be in danger.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss had an anomaly, and many earth-level spirit generals and heavenly-level spirit generals rushed over, and the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss became a mess.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Lingxuan suddenly proposed to go to the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was safer to hide in the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss than to stay in the Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan had an artifact that could modify her appearance, which was the best disguise.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi objected, not wanting her disciple to take such a risk,</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was the Sect Master who agreed to Shen Lingxuan's proposal and secretly sent her out of the Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>These things, of course, she would not tell Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly-level spirit general Mo Sanxu?" Qi Yuan murmured in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What she didn't know was that everything she had just thought in her heart was heard by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan's ability to hear people's thoughts was not stable, and he couldn't hear everyone's thoughts, he just happened to hear Wang Qingyi's voice this time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Senior Qingyi, I'll go back right away, you don't need to send someone to escort me, since I can come, I can also go back directly." After getting the answer, Qi Yuan broke his habit and lied.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to argue with Wang Qingyi and create a mutual distrust scenario.</p><p></p><p>Just go back directly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi was stunned, and she didn't expect Qi Yuan to agree so decisively.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze towards Qi Yuan contained more disappointment.</p><p></p><p>She thought that this son-in-law was afraid and just running away.</p><p></p><p>It seems that her disciple had entrusted the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she was even more worried about her disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, you can go." Wang Qingyi's face turned cold and she didn't give Qi Yuan a good expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't mind it either.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, hurry up and drive the carriage, let's go back."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao quickly drove the carriage, and soon the carriage disappeared from Wang Qingyi's sight.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi sighed softly: "In the turbulent autumn, there is the Luo Zhong Water Lord in front, and the embryo of a divine artifact appearing in the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss behind Lingxuan... Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Sect was now in a precarious situation, at the center of an explosive situation, who knows when it would ignite.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the carriage traveled along the official road.</p><p></p><p>A smile emerged in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Unexpectedly, I'm so lucky, not only did I see my wife, but I might even encounter some white moonlight!"</p><p></p><p>In the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss, the embryo of a divine artifact has appeared, and many heavenly-level spirit generals may descend.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, this is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"I should have agreed to the old man's invitation, now I have to run a few hundred miles more."</p><p></p><p>"Old man, speed up!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the horses can't, they're tired." Chen Kangbao replied.</p><p></p><p>The horses in the carriage were panting, obviously tired.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll bless you, you come and pull the carriage." Qi Yuan was very smart.</p><p></p><p>This blessing was also a real blessing, not like the previous deception.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this..." Chen Kangbao was hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"You guy, you eat too much, if you don't exercise more to digest it, you probably won't live more than three years." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's physical condition was very complex, he had suffered a great injury before, and being able to live was already a miracle.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Chen Kangbao gritted his teeth, let go of the horses, and after receiving Qi Yuan's blessing, he started running while pulling the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, go faster!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I only have two legs, I can't run that fast!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao pulled the carriage, running swiftly, faster than the horses.</p><p></p><p>"Young master is kind, I'll give you four legs to run faster."</p><p></p><p>A smile flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and the unmanned aerial vehicle transformed into a roaring tiger.</p><p></p><p>The tiger pounced on Chen Kangbao, its front paws resting on Chen Kangbao's shoulders, and its hind legs pushing off the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah..." Chen Kangbao let out a miserable scream, and ran even faster!</p><p></p><p>"As expected, six legs are better than two legs." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>After reaching level 120, he can officially treat Chen Kangbao's illness.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it's not good for him to keep eating like this.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

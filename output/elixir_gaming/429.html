        <h1>Chapter 429</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time flows on.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short months, undercurrents surged in the Demon Abyss, bringing about many changes. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these hidden changes were known only to a small number of yin spirits in the Absolute Moon Abyss, and no one else.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, looking at Mu Lan who had come to make accusations, with a smile in his eyes: "The stars are still in the sky. Isn't it a bit ridiculous for you to say that Demon Eye Celestial Lord and Demon Hall Celestial Lord have problems?"</p><p></p><p>This Mu Lan was still persistent, having already gone to many areas to report on Demon Eye.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, what he didn't understand was that all those yang spirit Celestial Lords he was reporting on were now Qi Yuan's avatars.</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Abyss, Qi Yuan diligently and earnestly fished, which was also quite boring.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he would also find some amusement.</p><p></p><p>This Mu Lan was one such amusement. </p><p></p><p>He was very curious how long it would take Mu Lan to report to Demon Heng Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Mu Lan lowered his head, his expression particularly ugly: "Celestial Lord, it's better to believe it exists than to believe it doesn't. The yin spirits of the Absolute Moon Abyss have suffered heavy casualties now, we must be on guard!"</p><p></p><p>What this Celestial Lord said made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>If a yang spirit had problems and perished,</p><p></p><p>First, its star reflecting across the heavens would fall.</p><p></p><p>But Demon Eye Celestial Lord's was still fine.</p><p></p><p>The stars of the several yang spirits he suspected were still hanging well in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"How could a mere yin spirit like you understand the calculations of a Celestial Lord?" Qi Yuan said indifferently, looking quite profound and unfathomable, "Alright, this matter ends here!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his sleeve, and Mu Lan's body was suddenly thrown out of the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Lord, I have shed blood for the Demon Luo!"</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Lord, I have shed sweat for the Demon Luo!"</p><p></p><p>"My loyalty, my heart can be examined!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling, Mu Lan wept bitterly, looking quite desperate.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, he's an even better actor than me."</p><p></p><p>When facing yin spirits like Mu Lan, Qi Yuan was very careless in his acting, not even changing his appearance, all in his original form, wearing a crimson robe.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother to conceal his figure much.</p><p></p><p>This also led to Mu Lan seeing the same yang spirit appearance every time he went to a place.</p><p></p><p>The most interesting thing was that every time Mu Lan saw him, his heart would surge with shock, but on the surface, he still had to pretend he didn't notice he had changed into someone else.</p><p></p><p>And he still persisted in reporting.</p><p></p><p>It was so amusing.</p><p></p><p>"Randomly teasing a yin spirit is really interesting."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan mused idly.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Demon Abyss, only Demon Heng Celestial Lord remained.</p><p></p><p>The other yang spirits had all been successfully fished by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he could walk sideways in this Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Even if Mu Lan was bold enough to spread rumors, Qi Yuan wasn't afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Lan was inwardly terrified, but on the surface he was still weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>He was starting to doubt his demon life now.</p><p></p><p>Had his eyes grown dim with age? Why did all the yang spirit Celestial Lords... look the same?</p><p></p><p>And at this time, suddenly, a message entered Qi Yuan's communication jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"You rascal, how did you go to the Sixth Heaven? How did you get there?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this message with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>This message was sent by Sister Ox Horn.</p><p></p><p>This kind of communication jade slip could not transmit across heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even in some special places, it could not receive messages.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Demon Abyss was covered by the Demon Luo Well, so ordinary communication jade slips were almost useless, being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>However, after obtaining quite a few privileges, Qi Yuan had removed his own suppression.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed his communication jade slip to receive messages from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I got bored of the Fifth Heaven, so I went to the Sixth Heaven for a stroll," Qi Yuan thought for a moment before replying.</p><p></p><p>This Sister Ox Horn was a nice person, and had helped him with some small favors.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you? Tell me, I'll come pick you up now. There's an urgent matter, a great opportunity!" Sister Ox Horn's voice carried a hint of urgency.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hesitated for a moment: "I'm in the Demon Abyss now."</p><p></p><p>Anyway, this wasn't a secret.</p><p></p><p>"How did you go to the Demon Abyss? There's a war going on there, it's very dangerous!" Sister Ox Horn said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>She even guessed in her heart that Qi Yuan had been conscripted, or wanted to go to the Demon Abyss to gain merits.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivators from the Second Heaven lacked resources and would do anything.</p><p></p><p>"Don't recklessly join the battle for now. Report the name of the Purple Fate Clan to the yang spirit you're guarding. I'll come pick you up and take you away!" Sister Ox Horn said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Why pick me up?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Sister Ox Horn took a deep breath: "Your bloodline... comes from the same source as our Black Demon Abyss, and is very noble."</p><p></p><p>Judging by the ancestor's expression, if it weren't for the Great Principle not being able to move around at will, and being delayed by some matters, the ancestor would probably have gone directly to the Fifth Heaven to bring Blood Robe up at that time.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that Blood Robe's bloodline was definitely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, sorry, I just want to be a guest elder. I don't want to join a big power or become a subordinate deity," Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? The Black Demon Abyss is different from other holy lands. Without our bloodline, we wouldn't even accept you as a slave!</p><p></p><p>You don't need to become a subordinate deity!" Sister Ox Horn said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe's bloodline was definitely more noble than hers.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a Principle bloodline? Otherwise, the ancestor wouldn't have been like that, Sister Ox Horn guessed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's gaze became profound.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the Demon Luo clan, where should he go next.</p><p></p><p>Initially, his plan was to go to the Buddhist Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But the Buddhist Kingdom was in the Fifth Heaven, and he had offended the Tai Huang Palace. If he attracted the attention of that person from Tai Huang Palace, it wouldn't be very safe for him now.</p><p></p><p>Now, hearing that he could go to the Black Demon Abyss, he was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't take Jin Li to the "countryside".</p><p></p><p>"You know, my enemy is that person from Tai Huang Palace. Do you still dare to let me go?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the ancestor said it's fine!" Sister Ox Horn said domineeringly.</p><p></p><p>Even if this Blood Robe considered that person from Tai Huang Palace as an enemy, that person might not even know about him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered for a while, then said: "Can I make some somewhat excessive conditions?"</p><p></p><p>"Say it!" Seeing that he was tempted, Sister Ox Horn was quite happy.</p><p></p><p>"I used to live in a Western-style building. I must have my own detached Western-style building in the Black Demon Abyss!" Qi Yuan directly made an outrageous demand.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? No problem." Sister Ox Horn didn't know what a Western-style building was, but that didn't stop her from agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, just lure him over first.</p><p></p><p>"When I eat beef noodles, I must add... two eggs."</p><p></p><p>"A hundred eggs, dragon eggs!" Sister Ox Horn said loudly.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, there were dragon-like creatures.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't dragon eggs a bit too luxurious?" Qi Yuan hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>He looked at himself.</p><p></p><p>Eating a hundred dragon eggs at once, would his body management still be okay?</p><p></p><p>"When will you arrive?" Qi Yuan asked, "I still have some things to deal with. How about this, come again in a month. After you come, I'll go to the Black Demon Abyss with you."</p><p></p><p>A month's time was enough for him to bring the Well back.</p><p></p><p>Then, he would go to the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This way, before he left, he could spread some rumors that the Demon Luo clan had dreamed of the Demon Luo Lord, and all the yang spirits had gone to the Ninth Heaven!</p><p></p><p>This way, who would know what had happened?</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is more important than you coming to the Black Demon Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sister Niujiao said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The old ancestor was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"I'm planning to wipe out the Moluo clan. Give me one more month!"</p><p></p><p>"You're just boasting. Wipe out the Moluo in a month! If you don't want to say it, then don't. Forget it, I'll come in a month. Where shall we meet?"</p><p></p><p>Sister Niujiao naturally didn't believe him. </p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe was good in every way, except his mental state wasn't normal. A while ago he said the one from Taihuan Palace was his great enemy, and now he's saying he'll annihilate the Moluo clan in a month. He's really putting on airs.</p><p></p><p>That's the Moluo clan we're talking about, a powerful force with nearly forty Yang Shen and five Zhili. Looking at the entire Six Heavens, they would rank in the top thirty in terms of power.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why is it that in this world, no one believes you when you tell the truth?" Qi Yuan lamented, then sent the meeting location to Sister Niujiao.</p><p></p><p>By then, the people would be killed, and he'd run away directly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but recently I've been feeling uneasy, as if something is watching me."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the Moon God Palace wants to ambush me?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng sat in his cave dwelling, his eyes filled with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Ever since returning from Demon Lord Tong's place, he had felt something strange about the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't pinpoint exactly what was strange about it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he turned his gaze to the communication jade slip, which was the contact group.</p><p></p><p>There were many messages in it, which he read carefully.</p><p></p><p>"They actually discovered purple qi, what good luck."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning purple qi, he also felt somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>But with those five Yang Shen dividing it, it would be somewhat impolite for him to get involved.</p><p></p><p>There were many messages inside.</p><p></p><p>Those five Yang Shen had already divided the purple qi.</p><p></p><p>"Such good luck, not only purple qi, but other discoveries as well."</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng looked at the group messages, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Purple qi soaring to the sky, haha, this lord has discovered another great treasure!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go together!"</p><p></p><p>"Should we call Demon Lord Heng?"</p><p></p><p>"No need for now. What if the treasure's value is ordinary? Wouldn't that be disturbing Lord Heng unnecessarily?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>These five Demon Lords agreed to go explore the treasure together.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Demon Lord Heng sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed that the Demon Abyss seems a bit abnormal recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Those of you Yang Shen in other regions, have you been paying attention to whether things are normal?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he raised his head to look at the starry realm.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the stars were still there.</p><p></p><p>This meant that those Yang Shen Demon Lords hadn't encountered any major problems.</p><p></p><p>But having problems doesn't mean death, it could also mean betrayal.</p><p></p><p>Especially Demon Eye, who had been acting strangely since returning from the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>He had already reported this matter to Demon Lord Moluo.</p><p></p><p>However, Demon Lord Moluo only told him to keep an eye on it, without saying much else.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, Demon Lord Moluo was still preoccupied with the Buddhist Kingdom at this time, and didn't think Demon Lord Eye had any issues.</p><p></p><p>"I think everything is normal."</p><p></p><p>"All is normal."</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, I went to drink with Demon Lord Tai, and he showed no abnormalities."</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord Heng, could it be... something has happened?"</p><p></p><p>The other five Demon Lords in the group replied one after another, all feeling that things were normal.</p><p></p><p>Receiving these answers, Heng hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be my imagination?" Demon Lord Heng pondered.</p><p></p><p>"How's your treasure exploration going?" After some thought, he asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Still in progress, but we've encountered some difficulties. Small problems, should be resolved quickly."</p><p></p><p>One Yang Shen answered.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, if you can't resolve it, you can seek my help," Demon Lord Heng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He was ambitious, wanting to become the leader of the Moluo clan, so he often did things to bestow favors on other Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Demon Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The chat group fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng sat in his cave dwelling, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"Five Yang Shen all say there's no problem, could it be... the problem is with me?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng couldn't help but overthink.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... it's because the Root Demon Tribulation is approaching, so I'm having these distracting thoughts."</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng could only comfort himself this way.</p><p></p><p>For Yang Shen at the Zhili realm, to improve their strength, they needed to pass through the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>There were no lightning tribulations in the Nine Heavens, but there was the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Through repeated cleansing by the Root Demon Tribulation, magical power would continuously increase, and cultivation would progress.</p><p></p><p>But the Root Demon Tribulation was not easy to pass through.</p><p></p><p>During the tribulation, all kinds of desires and distracting thoughts would arise.</p><p></p><p>With the slightest carelessness, one could perish within it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many Yang Shen, after reaching Zhili, would suppress their cultivation if they weren't confident in passing the Root Demon Tribulation, not allowing themselves to go through it.</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng was different. He was ambitious, wanting to become the leader of the Moluo clan, so he didn't suppress the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>As the Root Demon Tribulation approached, it was most normal for him to have some desires and mental demons, causing him to overthink.</p><p></p><p>"It should be distracting thoughts. Now... with my Root Demon Tribulation approaching, who would dare to ambush me?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng was confident.</p><p></p><p>The Root Demon Tribulation was a tribulation for every Zhili realm Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Even Great Zhili were unwilling to... casually provoke a Zhili Yang Shen who wasn't suppressing their Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>What if they prematurely triggered the Root Demon Tribulation? This would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>It would place the Great Zhili within the Root Demon Tribulation as well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was merely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>This kind of trouble was like the difference between a human squashing an ant versus squashing a stink bug.</p><p></p><p>One stinks after being squashed.</p><p></p><p>What was troublesome for a Great Zhili realm Yang Shen was a matter of life and death for other Zhili realm Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>In this case, the two would go through the tribulation together.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, in the area Demon Lord Heng presided over, that Yang Shen from the Moon God Palace had always been in a state of resistance, not daring to attack.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid Demon Lord Heng would drag them into the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Demon Lord Heng felt greatly reassured.</p><p></p><p>It must be because the Root Demon Tribulation was approaching, so he was overthinking.</p><p></p><p>At this time, who would dare to ambush him? Wouldn't that be seeking death?</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, Demon Lord Heng's eyes suddenly moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>He saw that in the distant east, a surge of vast energy swept out, as if the heavens and earth were shattering, and the primordial qi of all things was leaking.</p><p></p><p>"This is... purple qi, so much purple qi?"</p><p></p><p>With authority over the Moluo Well, Demon Lord Heng immediately sensed that there was purple qi leaking from the nearby Hong Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Hong Moon Abyss was precisely where one of their chat group members, also the Yang Shen who discovered the treasure and suggested exploring it together, was stationed.</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng's expression changed several times: "Is this them exploring the treasure, discovering a miraculous land? This purple qi... is quite abundant."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Demon Lord Heng felt some greed.</p><p></p><p>After all, with so much purple qi, even he was tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, does the recent disturbance in Hong Moon Abyss have anything to do with you?" Demon Lord Heng asked.</p><p></p><p>He still had some face to maintain, so he asked before going.</p><p></p><p>However, after about ten breaths, no one replied to him.</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng was slightly stunned, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... there are other treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord Heng couldn't sit still anymore. His enormous form turned into a stream of light, flying towards where the purple qi was leaking.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

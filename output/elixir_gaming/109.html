        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Guardian! Guardian!"</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the city wall, the cultivator ran forward excitedly. </p><p></p><p>Dong Long gazed out at the vast desert. The news from afar barely caused a ripple in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering how to deal with Wu Tong using Galan City's military forces.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong had nearly a hundred Nation Protectors under his command.</p><p></p><p>Such terrifying strength would be difficult for Galan City to counter.</p><p></p><p>If only the Guardian of Wugui City had killed some Nation Protectors before leaving, that would have been helpful.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths, seemingly noticing the cultivator sent from Wugui City had climbed the city wall, he slowly asked: "Did the Guardian of Wugui City kill any Nation Protectors?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator who originally wanted to report had to swallow the words he had prepared. He excitedly said: "Yes, he did!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Long was not surprised. </p><p></p><p>Given the Guardian of Wugui City's strength, killing a few Nation Protectors was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>"He killed..." Dong Long was about to ask how many were killed, but thinking that would make him seem too utilitarian, he instead asked, "Did the Guardian of Wugui City escape from Wugui City?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the cultivator blinked.</p><p></p><p>He felt the Guardian was being too fussy today, always asking strange questions. Why couldn't he just let him report properly? But the other was his superior, so he couldn't be rude.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't escape!" the cultivator answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>How could the Guardian of Wugui City have escaped? He was still sitting comfortably inside the city walls!</p><p></p><p>"What?" Hearing this, Dong Long was shocked, tears about to fall from his eyes. "The Guardian of Wugui City... actually fought to the death without fleeing?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the soldiers present all felt a sense of tragic heroism. Some let out long cries to the heavens, some clenched their fists.</p><p></p><p>"Wugui City has fallen, but the Guardian of Wugui City will live on in our hearts!"</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong Wu Tong is, he'll have to step over my corpse!"</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Hearing all this, the messenger cultivator really wanted to slap Dong Long, but he didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>However, he still mustered up the courage and said loudly: "Everyone, please listen to me. The Guardian of Wugui City is not dead!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, everyone present was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of over a dozen Nation Protectors fell on this cultivator, making him feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The Guardian of Wugui City isn't dead. Did he surrender?"</p><p></p><p>"How despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at these bigwigs, the cultivator felt extremely speechless: "Um... could you all not speak and let me talk?"</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>Silence. </p><p></p><p>A moment of silence fell over the scene.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dong Long said calmly: "Everyone calm down and let him speak."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the cultivator let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"Not only is the Guardian of Wugui City not dead, he single-handedly fought against Wu Tong's demonic army of over ten thousand! With just one man and one sword, he annihilated Wu Tong's demonic army. Wu Tong was killed in battle. No, none of the demonic army or demon controllers who came are still alive!" The cultivator held his breath and blurted it all out in one go.</p><p></p><p>After saying it, he felt very satisfied. After feeling satisfied, he then felt a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone present fell completely silent. They could hardly believe their ears.</p><p></p><p>Dong Long looked at the cultivator, his gaze piercing: "Is everything you said true?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Guardian, this lowly one's words contain no falsehood. If I dare to deceive, I am your father!" The cultivator had been stifled earlier, so now he spoke boldly.</p><p></p><p>He even accidentally said something wrong at the end.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, no one in Galan City paid attention to his last sentence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's faces showed expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian of Wugui City single-handedly wiped out Wu Tong's army? Wu Tong was killed in battle?</p><p></p><p>This was simply like a myth! Even a Terrestrial Deity would only face death when surrounded by Wu Tong's army.</p><p></p><p>But not only did the Guardian of Wugui City not die, he killed all the enemies!</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable, unthinkable, like a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Wu Tong is dead!" Dong Long couldn't help but laugh loudly. "To think the Guardian of Wugui City was so terrifyingly strong!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Long laughed heartily, dancing about. He pushed so hard that half the bricks on the city wall fell down, and he himself tumbled down from the wall.</p><p></p><p>A Nation Protector, laughing with joy, crashed into the city wall and fell straight down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other Nation Protectors present all burst out laughing too.</p><p></p><p>Only the messenger cultivator looked a bit worried, but seeing everyone laughing, he also started laughing along.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Wugui City, Qi Yuan sat atop the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"A strike with the power of a Supreme Being..."</p><p></p><p>A thoughtful look flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is a Supreme Being targeting me... or something else?"</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze over Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>The empty Wugui City had only Yuan Qi sweeping fallen leaves, with no one else around.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, I'm still a bit weak against a Supreme Being." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although the opponent had used a strike with Supreme power this time, Qi Yuan had fought many fallen Supreme Beings in the Absolute Realm. He had mastered some techniques to evade their power, enough to kill the opponent.</p><p></p><p>But this wasn't omnipotent.</p><p></p><p>Against a true, undamaged Supreme Being, his attacks would not be able to harm them.</p><p></p><p>"Unless I have my own Supreme divine ability."</p><p></p><p>That would require reaching level 120.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he was only level 94.</p><p></p><p>He was still very far from level 120.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tong is dead. The Yu Province region will be vacant for some time. I should take this opportunity to sweep through and clear out the demons in Yu Province."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he could already protect himself. Even if he encountered a large-scale demonic army attack, he would not be afraid.</p><p></p><p>It was also time for him to consider clearing out the demons around Wugui City to increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Quickly reach level 120, then go for the third enlightenment of the Source.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know how many years had passed for the canary between the second and third Source enlightenments.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't know if he would be able to see the canary again, to see Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>"If she's still around, where would she be?" Qi Yuan raised his head to look at the vast desert.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seven years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Tremendous changes occurred in the Yu Province region.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian of Wugui City, like an elusive deity, frequently struck into the midst of demonic armies.</p><p></p><p>Every few days, thousands or tens of thousands of demon soldiers would fall to the Guardian of Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the other cities of Yu Province would occasionally claim to have seen a terrifying blood-colored giant figure slaughtering demonic armies in the desert.</p><p></p><p>Even from afar, it inspired awe.</p><p></p><p>That Guardian of Wugui City was like an undying demon god, tireless and invulnerable, forcibly killing off all the demons in Yu Province.</p><p></p><p>Galan City had not seen a demon attack for a year.</p><p></p><p>The last time demons attacked the city, before the Galan City defenders could even warm up, a sword flew in from the sky and slaughtered those demons.</p><p></p><p>Now, outside Wugui City, the terrifying blood-red figure had grown to twelve zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the yellow sand, his whole body emanating a thick murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>If people from the Palace of Light saw Qi Yuan now, they would definitely mistake him for a demon cultivator and kill him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan pulled out his broken sword and stuck it into the yellow sand.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at Yuan Qi and slowly said: "I will be leaving Wugui City, for a few months at shortest, a hundred years at longest."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had made all preparations and was about to log off to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Qi's heart tightened. He said through gritted teeth: "I will help the lord watch over Wugui City!"</p><p></p><p>The closer he got to Qi Yuan, the greater his fear grew.</p><p></p><p>Especially after Qi Yuan slaughtered demons, he felt like he was facing not a cultivator, but a demon.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, Yuan Qi had watched Qi Yuan grow stronger step by step.</p><p></p><p>He guessed in his heart that Qi Yuan must be cultivating some secret technique to increase his strength, becoming like this in order to kill demons.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian had sacrificed too much for Wugui City. How could he fear when others feared him?</p><p></p><p>All these years, he had been in Wugui City and had seen what Qi Yuan faced.</p><p></p><p>One man guarding a city - very dashing? But also very, very tiring.</p><p></p><p>"This sword can kill demons. If too many demons attack, I will sense it.</p><p>If NPCs from other cities come, don't let them approach, to avoid accidental injury." Qi Yuan gave another instruction.</p><p></p><p>Now that the surrounding demons had been cleared out, Wugui City would not face a demonic army attack for some time.</p><p></p><p>It was time for him to log off.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was still mental consumption in the game.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" Yuan Qi was like a loyal servant.</p><p></p><p>This once spirited young general had now entered middle age, with the traces of time etched on his face.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He hugged Little Jia, found a secluded spot, dug a hole, and buried himself with Little Jia as he had done in the past.</p><p></p><p>"How unlucky!"</p><p></p><p>"So many bones, must be from Wu Tong's men?"</p><p></p><p>"No good, in the future I must grind the bones to dust after killing. Otherwise digging holes and hitting their bones would be too awkward!"</p><p></p><p>"Karmic ties!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At Shenguang Sect, Qi Yuan woke up from the game.</p><p></p><p>One day in the real world, ten years in the game.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was dominating in the game, but only two days had passed in reality.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment mid-stage already?" Qi Yuan was pleased when he sensed his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, leveling up in the game is much faster. If I cultivated step by step in the real world, it would take at least a few years."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt smug.</p><p></p><p>"Now I should be able to instantly kill those at Divine Infant mid-stage, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt quite satisfied as he sensed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>However... when he thought of the Hundred Nations Blood War planned by the Palace of Light, he still felt the pressure weighing heavily on him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn Palace of Light, with just one incomplete Yin Spirit artifact that can unleash a Yin Spirit attack. </p><p></p><p>I'm still... way too far from reaching Yin Spirit level, aren't I?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's combat power could now instantly kill those at Divine Infant mid-stage, and he wasn't afraid of late-stage Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>But he was still far behind when facing Purple Palace stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Yin Spirit stage above that.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you're awake?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, Jiang Lingsu's ethereal voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, what is it, Junior Sister?" Qi Yuan cast a cleansing spell on himself and walked out of his wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu came over from her own hut, her fair jade-like face showing a trace of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a long emerald green dress embroidered with orchids, perhaps because she walked too quickly, her snow-white, round breasts bounced a few times. Even though she deliberately wore a dress one size larger, it still couldn't conceal her graceful figure.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw his junior sister, an inappropriate image flashed through Qi Yuan's mind, influenced by the scenes he had imagined in the game under the effect of the Source of Sin.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jiang Lingsu's thighs, covered by the long dress, not even able to see her delicate ankles.</p><p></p><p>He had never even seen his junior sister's thighs, so the images that appeared in his mind in the game must all be fake.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what's wrong?" Seeming to notice something unusual about Qi Yuan, Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing. Junior Sister, you came to find me in such a hurry, did something big happen?" Qi Yuan asked, pushing away the strange images in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It could be considered a big deal, or maybe not.</p><p></p><p>Two days ago, people from the Palace of Light came and caused a scene at East Leisure's coronation ceremony.</p><p></p><p>That Divine Infant cultivator declared that within seven days, Great Shang must hand over you and Kong Fulu.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Great Shang will be classified as part of the demonic faction in the Hundred Nations Blood War!</p><p></p><p>Once classified as part of the demonic faction, they will face attacks from other nations led by the Palace of Light. Even if cities are massacred and the country destroyed, no one will condemn it!" Jiang Lingsu said, anger evident in her words.</p><p></p><p>"Great Shang didn't hand me over, did they?" Qi Yuan grasped the key point.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu gave Qi Yuan a coquettish glance: "Senior Brother, what are you thinking? Great Shang belongs to our Divine Light Sect, how could they possibly hand you over?"</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light may or may not know this information, but they simply don't care.</p><p></p><p>After all, this stems from the arrogance of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief, but he was still very worried: "So you're saying, the Palace of Light has already written down my name in their little book?"</p><p></p><p>They had explicitly demanded Great Shang to hand him over.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jiang Lingsu licked her lips, "Senior Brother, are you scared? If you're scared, why not go up the mountain and beg Master? I think, with our Master's strength, he might be able to smooth things over with the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu still wanted to know if Ruan Yixi was the person she was looking for.</p><p></p><p>Or if it was someone else.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the Seven-Colored Peak, where palaces and pavilions were hidden in the mist, indistinct.</p><p></p><p>"I also think deeply about Master, but I can't go up the mountain!" Qi Yuan said helplessly, but thinking of the Palace of Light, he gritted his teeth, "This Palace of Light is really hateful. I've been so magnanimous that I haven't even written them down in my little book yet, but they've gone ahead and written me down first.</p><p></p><p>No, I must write them down in my little book too, to look at day and night and remember this humiliation!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan really took out a notebook from his storage bag and wrote down "Palace of Light" in it.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was already used to this: "Writing it down is useless, it's not like you can curse them to death.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, Senior Brother, let me tell you another piece of insider information. Great Shang has our Divine Light Sect behind them, so of course they're unwilling to hand over you and Senior Brother Kong Fulu, but Great Shang has other sects besides the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Their thoughts are different from ours.</p><p></p><p>I heard... these past two days, some cultivators from the Demonic Desire Sect went to connect with that Divine Infant cultivator from the Palace of Light. You need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Demonic Desire Sect with their honest faces want to betray?" Qi Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that the Sect Leader was a spy from the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he felt it wasn't safe to stay on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>What if someone sold him out? He wouldn't entrust his safety to others' mercy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very worried, when suddenly a flash of inspiration hit him, feeling like he had grown a brain: "Junior Sister, what if I killed that envoy from the Palace of Light? Then Great Shang wouldn't hand me over, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be reckless, that envoy from the Palace of Light is a Divine Infant early-stage cultivator who has mastered divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>It's not something a small Foundation Establishment cultivator like you can handle." Jiang Lingsu emphasized the words "Foundation Establishment".</p><p></p><p>"Never mind that, just tell me if what I said makes sense?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu thought for a moment and felt it did make sense.</p><p></p><p>If the envoy from the Palace of Light was killed, who would still care about handing over Qi Yuan and Kong Fulu?</p><p></p><p>But who would do such a thing for no reason?</p><p></p><p>This train of thought was too abnormal.</p><p></p><p>It was like... like... Jiang Lingsu felt her mind couldn't keep up, unable to describe it.</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense, but it would thoroughly offend the Palace of Light," Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, as long as it makes sense." Qi Yuan muttered, bidding farewell to his junior sister, he returned to his wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>His expression was serious, looking as if he bore a deep grudge.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light had put too much pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>He was deliberating countermeasures, formulating a perfect plan.</p><p></p><p>After about a quarter of an hour, a grand plan finally took shape.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>He entered the Divine Flower Society's communication group and uploaded his plan.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, in order to deal with the threat from the Palace of Light, I've formulated a grand plan. You're all big shots, please take a look and see if there's anything to improve, or if you can provide a little support."</p><p></p><p>Soon, people in the group started speaking.</p><p></p><p>The first to speak was still the most active Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Origin Venerable, already thinking about destroying the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>Let me take a look at this plan."</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord opened what Qi Yuan had uploaded.</p><p></p><p>A few large characters entered his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"100-Day Plan to Destroy the Palace of Light"</p><p></p><p>Simple and straightforward.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord was a bit dumbfounded when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>But he still opened it.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the text inside, he completely lost it.</p><p></p><p>Day 1: Ambush and kill the Divine Infant early-stage envoy from the Palace of Light! Difficulty: One star.</p><p></p><p>Day 2 to Day 4: Improve cultivation method from Foundation Establishment mid-stage to late-stage. Difficulty: Two stars.</p><p></p><p>Day 5 to Day 7: Cultivate from Foundation Establishment mid-stage to late-stage. Difficulty: One star.</p><p></p><p>Day 8 to Day 20: Form at least a celestial-grade Golden Core. Difficulty: Three stars.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... Origin Venerable, your plan is quite unique." Rogue Immortal Lord couldn't find appropriate words to describe it.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Is breaking through as easy as drinking water? Crossing a realm in just a few days?</p><p></p><p>Even if the Heavenly Dao was your father, it wouldn't be possible!</p><p></p><p>And forming at least a celestial-grade Golden Core, that's too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"I've been brewing this plan for a long time, and I've even refined the details by adding completion difficulties. It can be said to be flawless," Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Rogue Immortal Lord didn't want to speak.</p><p></p><p>This is called flawless?</p><p></p><p>Just adding completion difficulties? He wanted to say, this is called wishful thinking!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ice Mountain Domineering Woman also popped up in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, let me take a look at Origin Venerable's plan too!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ice Mountain Domineering Woman appear, Rogue Immortal Lord felt a bit gleeful. He didn't feel comfortable criticizing Origin Venerable, but Ice Mountain Domineering Woman would surely scoff at this plan after seeing it.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths, Ice Mountain Domineering Woman appeared again in the communication group: "This 100-day plan is written simply and directly, with clear goals, grand and magnificent. I think it's good! What I admire most is that Origin Venerable even thoughtfully added what to do in each time period and the completion difficulty. It's really detailed!"</p><p></p><p>"That's what I'm most proud of." Qi Yuan was very pleased that the part he put the most effort into was praised.</p><p></p><p>His shining point was still discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone have any plans to support me? After I destroy the Palace of Light, I will surely express my great thanks!</p><p></p><p>Especially cultivation methods, I want to improve my cultivation method to Foundation Establishment late-stage, or even Golden Core!" Qi Yuan started crowdfunding in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, I'm willing to support... one spirit stone," Rogue Immortal Lord said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"This old lady has many cultivation methods. I just killed a few brats and got five mystic-grade cultivation methods, there's even one high-grade mystic one. I'll transmit them to you," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said domineeringly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ice Mountain Domineering Woman's words, Qi Yuan almost burst into tears.</p><p></p><p>There are still many good people in this world!</p><p></p><p>Thanks to ←God Without Tears for the thousand-point reward, and thanks to the big shot for the several rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 251</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, Qi Yuan lay lazily on a lounge chair, sunbathing.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Shenguang Sect, Qi Yuan rushed non-stop towards Phoenix Sky Realm. </p><p></p><p>The time for meeting the Four Emperors of Divine Flowers in person was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in Phoenix Sky Realm, Qi Yuan boarded this flying ship heading to Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the flying ship was filled with a mixed crowd.</p><p></p><p>There were thousands of cultivators, with even the weakest being at Foundation Establishment level.</p><p></p><p>However, Divine Infant or Purple Palace cultivators were rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>A beautiful middle-aged woman sat next to Qi Yuan, wearing a green robe, her gaze flowing, exuding charm: "Fellow Daoist, you're not from Phoenix Sky Realm?"</p><p></p><p>This beautiful woman had boarded the flying ship together with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>On the ship, there was a small trading fair.</p><p></p><p>After participating, Qi Yuan bought many cultivation techniques, and thus became acquainted with this beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>This beautiful woman was named Li Ruoxian. She possessed many cultivation techniques, and Qi Yuan bought seven Profound-level techniques from her.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm not," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't mind poverty, but he loved wealth.</p><p></p><p>Especially wealthy women who could be his ideal love.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist has an extraordinary aura. Where are you from? Could it be the Eastern Lands?" Li Ruoxian was very talkative. "The Eastern Lands are somewhat inferior to Phoenix Sky Realm, but they also produce many talents. Recently, that famous Blood-Robed Sword Immortal has gained great renown even in our Phoenix Sky Realm. The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal killed indiscriminately, especially slaying those arrogant cultivators at the Divine Flower Meeting, which was truly satisfying and has inspired many young people in Phoenix Sky Realm to emulate."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, Li Ruoxian's eyes held a respectful look, but there was also some helplessness mixed in with the respect.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt proud inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed his efforts to clean up the cultivation world's atmosphere had some effect.</p><p></p><p>"I also greatly admire the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal. If every cultivator in the cultivation world was like him, how could there be such moral decay and degeneration?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He had over 4,000 Divine Infants inside his body, like a small society, but these Divine Infants never fought each other.</p><p></p><p>Because his moral character was noble.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Ruoxian was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said: "Fellow Daoist speaks reasonably."</p><p></p><p>She changed the subject and said: "Fellow Daoist is going to Qinghong City, are you meeting friends?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, a few friends."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the flying ship stopped, making a temporary landing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood up, his eyes filled with a smile: "I have a friend coming aboard, I'll go greet them."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Li Ruoxian's gaze was strange.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan thought of something and said to Li Ruoxian: "Could I trouble Fellow Daoist to save my seat? Don't let anyone else take it."</p><p></p><p>He would be leaving for a while, and it would be very unpleasant if someone took the chair he had warmed up.</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian was both amused and exasperated: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>She watched as Qi Yuan left.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a clear voice sounded by Li Ruoxian's ear: "What do you think of this Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian looked at the young girl who had approached and smiled helplessly: "Silly girl, what are you thinking?"</p><p></p><p>"This Fellow Daoist is really handsome, has an extraordinary aura, is generous when buying techniques - he clearly looks wealthy. Most importantly, he also likes the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal that I like most. This marriage... I support it with both hands!"</p><p></p><p>"You..." Li Ruoxian was both amused and exasperated. "We just met by chance and don't know each other well. You're being too fanciful."</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, Grandpa has been gone for so long, you've been alone for so many years. You should consider your own future," the young girl beside her advised, seeming very satisfied with Qi Yuan. "Grandma, see how sensible I am? When you were talking with Qi Yuan, I deliberately didn't appear."</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian thought of something, her expression rather calm: "Don't speak of such things again. We came to Qinghong City to retrieve Yang Lang's belongings from the Dao-Seeking Palace."</p><p></p><p>Yang Lang was Li Ruoxian's Dao companion, the girl's grandfather. </p><p></p><p>Her grandfather had died early, leaving many belongings in the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the girl didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Just then, two figures approached from not far away.</p><p></p><p>The newcomers were none other than Qi Yuan and the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"This is Li Ruoxian, whom I met on the flying ship," Qi Yuan introduced Li Ruoxian to the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>He then said: "This is Gao Xiaoyu, my good brother."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaoyu was the Rogue Immortal Lord's real name.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan call him by his real name, he felt rather strange.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Ruoxian revealed a bright smile: "Greetings, fellow Daoists."</p><p></p><p>However, she glanced at the Rogue Immortal Lord an extra time, a surprised look flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because earlier, she couldn't discern Qi Yuan's strength, and since Qi Yuan was so generous, she naturally assumed he was at the Purple Palace realm like herself.</p><p></p><p>But it turned out Qi Yuan's good brother seemed to be only at the Yuan Dan realm.</p><p></p><p>How could she not be surprised?</p><p></p><p>The young girl beside her was also stunned. As someone at the peak of Yuan Dan realm herself, she could also see the Rogue Immortal Lord's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist." Facing Li Ruoxian and the young girl, the Rogue Immortal Lord was neither servile nor overbearing.</p><p></p><p>After all, although his strength wasn't great, he was still one of the Four Emperors of Divine Flowers.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few polite words, Qi Yuan began chatting with the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian's gaze towards Qi Yuan and the Rogue Immortal Lord didn't change, but her granddaughter's attitude towards Qi Yuan became much cooler.</p><p></p><p>"We're about to meet Great Sun Flame Emperor and Ice Mountain Domineering Lady sister. I'm a bit excited," the Rogue Immortal Lord was naturally excited.</p><p></p><p>He already understood that he was the only fake braggart in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>"Me too. After all... it's a face-to-face meeting..." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he thought of meeting in person, he thought of Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Probably, God of Godlessness had already sent out the letter.</p><p></p><p>According to God of Godlessness, it would take three years for the letter to be delivered to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>Converted to the lower realm's time, that was about ten years.</p><p></p><p>By that time, he didn't know if he would have completely resolved the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to go to the Dao-Seeking Palace this time?" The Rogue Immortal Lord thought of something and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, although I've obtained many techniques recently, it's still not enough. The Dao-Seeking Palace... I need to make a trip there."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hadn't yet decided how to progress from Divine Infant to Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>This required a huge number of techniques.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Golden Core Great Dao continuously consumed techniques, so Qi Yuan needed to collect more.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Fellow Daoist is also going to the Dao-Seeking Palace?" At this point, Li Ruoxian couldn't help but interject.</p><p></p><p>The young girl beside her then said: "The Dao-Seeking Palace isn't so easy to enter."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao-Seeking Palace in Phoenix Sky Realm has gathered peak Purple Palace cultivators from all three realms. Without Yin Spirits appearing, the Dao-Seeking Palace is the number one power in the three realms. Even ordinary Purple Palace cultivators can't enter the Dao-Seeking Palace easily, let alone Yuan Dan..." As she spoke, the girl deliberately glanced at the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian frowned and glared at the girl.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan laughed heartily: "Gao Xiaoyu, did you see that? Your Golden Core strength was mocked."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued: "I'm different. I'm already a Divine Infant True Lord, and the number one Divine Infant of the Great Shang Nation. The Dao-Seeking Palace will surely give me face."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at Li Ruoxian: "Right?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl wanted to say something, but was glared at by her grandmother and didn't speak further.</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian smiled: "A Divine Infant prodigy does qualify to enter the Dao-Seeking Palace."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Friend, if you want to go to the Seeking Dao Palace, why don't you come with me? I'm planning to go there as well."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, really?" Qi Yuan's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Sun Flame Emperor was the host of the Phoenix Sky Realm, according to him, his grandfather Wind Lord had a very tense relationship with the Seeking Dao Palace, even some conflicts. </p><p></p><p>He was going to the Seeking Dao Palace to purchase cultivation techniques, not to destroy it, so he naturally couldn't just barge in. It would be best to have someone introduce him.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have to trouble you then, friend." Qi Yuan didn't expect such a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It's no trouble at all," Li Ruoxian said casually.</p><p></p><p>"You're my messaging jade slip now, add me as a friend. If you encounter any difficulties in the future, just contact me directly and I'll help you solve them." Qi Yuan didn't like to take advantage of others. </p><p></p><p>He always acted freely and casually in his affairs.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he did whatever came to mind.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Li Ruoxian didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young girl who had been glared at earlier felt somewhat guilty, seeming to realize her previous words were a bit impolite.</p><p></p><p>She took the initiative to speak, easing the tension: "You're both from the Eastern Lands, have you seen the Blood-Robed Sword God? Is he really as godlike as the legends say?"</p><p></p><p>After all, she admired the Blood-Robed Sword God and often emulated him, crossing thousands of miles to beat people up based on messaging jade slips.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Li Ruoxian had reacted strangely when the Blood-Robed Sword God was mentioned earlier.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord glanced at Qi Yuan without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, on the other hand, said proudly: "You have good taste. I've seen the Blood-Robed Sword God. His aura and looks are on par with mine."</p><p></p><p>The young girl was stunned for a moment, her eyes widening: "You're that confident?"</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, Qi Yuan was definitely a rare handsome man.</p><p></p><p>That's why she had tried to match him up with her grandmother as Dao partners.</p><p></p><p>But upon learning Qi Yuan was only at the Divine Infant realm, she had abandoned that idea.</p><p></p><p>With that cultivation level, he wasn't enough to be her grandmother's Dao partner, but as her grandmother's male pet... he might be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"One should be confident in life. What's wrong with being an ordinary confident man? Moreover, I'm a handsome confident man!" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord beside him quickly added: "I can testify that Qi Yuan is as handsome as the Blood-Robed Sword God, as if they were born from the same mother."</p><p></p><p>"You're in trouble now, I've already recorded what you just said!" The young girl smiled mischievously, "If you don't bribe me with some spirit stones, I'll announce this at the Divine Flower Meeting."</p><p></p><p>"You're also part of the Divine Flower Meeting?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Along the way, everyone chatted, seeming harmonious with no major unpleasantness occurring.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly. After about a day and a half, the flying ship landed on an open space.</p><p></p><p>In the distance ahead, many cultivators were standing, seemingly waiting for people.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, the Rogue Immortal Lord, Li Ruoxian and the others disembarked from the flying ship together.</p><p></p><p>The young girl's eyes were filled with smiles: "Next time you see the Blood-Robed Sword God, you must get an image stone of him."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stroked his chin: "Is the Blood-Robed Sword God so popular in the Phoenix Sky Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, many of my sisters like him. If you can get me an image stone of the Blood-Robed Sword God, I'm sure I could sell it for a lot of money," the young girl said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>In the current Phoenix Sky Realm, the Blood-Robed Sword God's reputation was very high.</p><p></p><p>This was related to the Blood-Robed Sword God's way of doing things, and also to a recent interesting event in the Phoenix Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, hearing you say that makes me tempted. I'm even thinking of recording myself and selling it," Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>This wouldn't be a bad way to make money.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan sold his skills, not his body. He couldn't do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what some crazy cultivators, male or female, might do with his image.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were quite a few small games circulating in this world.</p><p></p><p>For example, that Sword Dao Immortal game that Dong Xian had given him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you're thinking of impersonating the Blood-Robed Sword God. Forget it, if he finds out, you're finished," the young girl said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Remembering something, she couldn't help but say: "By the way, when you enter the Seeking Dao Palace, don't mention the Blood-Robed Sword God at all."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Why is that?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"What did the Blood-Robed Sword God do to the Seeking Dao Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you heard about the most famous amusing incident in the Phoenix Sky Realm recently?"</p><p></p><p>"What amusing incident?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl quickly transmitted a message to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"A while ago, the Great Venerable Wu Jun went to Cloud Mountain to ask the Great Venerable Jasmine to become his Dao partner. </p><p></p><p>But who knew, the Great Venerable Jasmine had said she already had someone in her heart, and it was the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Wu Jun flew into a rage and left Cloud Mountain in pain.</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Wu Jun is the behind-the-scenes controller of the Seeking Dao Palace in the Phoenix Sky Realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This Great Venerable Jasmine... who was she?</p><p></p><p>She had inexplicably brought him an enemy.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Venerable Jasmine is the number one beauty in the Phoenix Sky Realm. If even she has her heart set on the Blood-Robed Sword God, it shows how extraordinary he must be," the young girl continued.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but think to himself.</p><p></p><p>Was he already that handsome?</p><p></p><p>She fell in love with him without even seeing him?</p><p></p><p>Of course, there might be other hidden circumstances.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know the truth of the matter, so he didn't speculate further.</p><p></p><p>The group walked and talked.</p><p></p><p>Li Ruoxian said, "The person coming to pick me up is here. I'll see you next time, friend."</p><p></p><p>They saw a scruffy old man in Daoist robes walking towards them, his face still showing signs of drowsiness, as if he had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, next time you'll take me to the Seeking Dao Palace," Qi Yuan said, also bidding farewell to Li Ruoxian.</p><p></p><p>Because he seemed to have already spotted the Great Sun Flame Emperor and the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Flower Emperors had finally gathered here.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the young girl followed Li Ruoxian, walking behind the scruffy Daoist.</p><p></p><p>She seemed very afraid of the scruffy Daoist and didn't dare to breathe loudly.</p><p></p><p>The group sat in a rabbit carriage.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the scruffy Daoist lifted the carriage curtain, a thoughtful expression on his face: "Interesting, the person you were just traveling with is with the Wind Lord's grandson."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Ruoxian also looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes showed a surprised expression: "The Wind Lord's grandson?"</p><p></p><p>There was also considerable conflict between the Wind Lord and the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, she had originally thought Qi Yuan was just an ordinary Divine Infant realm cultivator, perhaps with some Purple Palace realm elders in his family, but nothing worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was actually with the Wind Lord's grandson. It seemed his identity wasn't so simple.</p><p></p><p>The young girl beside her was also surprised to hear this.</p><p></p><p>She also felt relieved in her heart that she hadn't actually mocked the Rogue Immortal Lord for being at the Yuan Dan realm.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had a Yin God realm powerhouse behind him, wouldn't that mean... he might be worthy of her grandmother after all?</p><p></p><p>"Next time you bring him to the Seeking Dao Palace, try to avoid Yuan Chen being on duty," the scruffy Daoist casually mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Because he had heard Qi Yuan say earlier that he wanted Li Ruoxian to bring him into the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for letting me know, friend," Li Ruoxian said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing you should know. You can only take sixty percent of Yang Cui's belongings," the scruffy Daoist added, remembering something.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Ruoxian didn't seem surprised: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

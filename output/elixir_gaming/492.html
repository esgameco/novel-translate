        <h1>Chapter 492</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If no one filed a report, their yamen (local government office) would not get involved. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would have to handle the case themselves and pay for it.</p><p></p><p>Being a yamen runner was just a menial task. </p><p></p><p>They naturally had no desire to get involved.</p><p></p><p>In this chaotic world, countless "weeds" of lives perished every day. </p><p></p><p>How could the yamen keep up?</p><p></p><p>Unless the deceased was of high status, or unless the "weeds" died in large numbers at once.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe's gaze fell on the servant, a hint of the aura of the Imperial Army Commander passing through.</p><p></p><p>The servant was already hunched over, and now he was kneeling on the ground in fear: "These past few days... a few days ago, Qi Yuan from the Qi family was sent to the asylum..."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan?" Lin Qinghe furrowed his brow, "Shen family's son-in-law?"</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, the news of Qi Yuan marrying into the Shen family had caused quite a stir in Ninghe County.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe had met Qi Yuan a few times. </p><p></p><p>His father was a skilled craftsman who had ultimately perished. </p><p></p><p>However, the remnants of his family's influence remained, allowing Qi Yuan to find a job at the yamen.</p><p></p><p>But this fellow was lazy and couldn't endure hardship, so he quit after just half a month. </p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had finally squandered his family's wealth, and it was only because he married into the Shen family that Lin Qinghe felt he might not end up as a corpse on the street.</p><p></p><p>"Him?" Lin Qinghe's eyes showed disdain.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even suspect Qi Yuan had anything to do with this matter. </p><p></p><p>Not only could this Qi Yuan not defeat the demonic beast black-and-white dog, he couldn't even beat the asylum director Zhou Mo.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen that Qi Yuan kid, he's useless, unless... the Shen family intervened. </p><p></p><p>If the Shen family acted, he should have been long gone by now.</p><p></p><p>Or unless the Shen family spent a huge price to have a Cinnabar Elixir Refiner concoct a powerful elixir to boost his foundation," the runner Zhou Hu said beside him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe nodded, he had always found this subordinate Zhou Hu quite useful.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something and softly said, "Zhou Hu, in a few days I'll be transferred to the prefecture, do you want to come with me?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding runners looked at Zhou Hu with envious eyes upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>Their captain Lin Qinghe was different from their humble origins - he came from a powerful clan family. </p><p></p><p>Coming to Ninghe County was just gilding for him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu was taken aback, for some reason he had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, I'll think about it later."</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the people from the yamen exited the asylum.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu caught up to Lin Qinghe, his face filled with worry: "Captain, take me with you to the prefecture, I won't forget this. </p><p></p><p>But usually a captain's term is at least three years, why are you leaving so suddenly? Could it be... something went wrong at Red Cloud Village?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe had been in Ninghe County for two and a half years, and by rights he should have been able to be promoted to the prefecture in half a year. </p><p></p><p>But now, with half a year left, he was leaving directly. </p><p></p><p>This was suspicious.</p><p></p><p>And recently, there had been a series of disappearances in Red Cloud Village, which Lin Qinghe had been handling.</p><p></p><p>That's why Zhou Hu suspected it might be related to this.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, it's related to Red Cloud Village," Lin Qinghe did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>For a powerful clan family, even if they spoke recklessly and the commoners heard it, so what? In this world, the powerful families didn't need to conceal much.</p><p></p><p>"The disappearances in Red Cloud Village these days, after investigation, are caused by a malicious spirit. </p><p></p><p>This malicious spirit is... Yellow-ranked, and not just any ordinary Yellow-ranked one!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Lin Qinghe's expression was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>In this world, malicious spirits were classified into levels of Ordinary, Yellow, Mysterious, Earth, Heaven, and Divine based on their power and danger.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary-ranked were the weakest, some could only suck the yang energy of men and might only injure a dozen or so lives.</p><p></p><p>But Yellow-ranked were different, a Yellow-ranked malicious spirit could wreak havoc on a region, causing hundreds of villagers to die.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary county yamen would find it very difficult to deal with a Yellow-ranked malicious spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Yellow-ranked, actually Yellow-ranked!" Zhou Hu's face tightened, "Quickly notify the people of Red Cloud Village, they must all evacuate!"</p><p></p><p>"They can't evacuate," Lin Qinghe shook his head, his expression resigned, "The malicious spirit of Red Cloud Village is very special, it comes from an ancient well, and this well is connected to the underground river of Red Cloud Village, almost all the villagers have drunk the water from this well, they... are all doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the people of Red Cloud Village are working day and night to produce the Red Cloud Porcelain, and the last batch to be delivered to the Moshan Kingdom is about to be fired, now they can't leave!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cloud Porcelain was the most famous product of Red Cloud Village. </p><p></p><p>This porcelain was beautiful, crystal clear, and highly sought after by officials and nobles.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, when the Moshan Kingdom and Ning Kingdom went to war, Ning Kingdom was defeated and had to cede several prefectures, as well as provide some tribute items.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cloud Porcelain was among these tribute items.</p><p></p><p>The last batch of tribute would be fully fired in half a month, then transported to the capital.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what, the people of Red Cloud Village could only die.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu's brow was tightly furrowed, his expression full of anguish.</p><p></p><p>He understood that Lin Qinghe's family clan knew of this news, so they were transferring him away.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Red Cloud Village was destroyed under his watch, his performance review would not be excellent, affecting his future career.</p><p></p><p>"Can't we summon a Yellow-ranked Imperial Army Commander to come?" Zhou Hu knew this, but was still furious.</p><p></p><p>Red Cloud Village had a total of seven hundred households, over a thousand people!</p><p></p><p>"The malicious spirit of Red Cloud Village is very special, a Yellow-ranked Imperial Army Commander won't work, we need a Mysterious-ranked one! The Mysterious-ranked Imperial Army Commanders are all entangled at Mount Eyu Lake, where would they have time to deal with these kiln workers?" Lin Qinghe said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Although he also felt pity for these kiln workers, he was powerless.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious-ranked Imperial Army Commanders were already very rare in the Ning Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>As for Earth-ranked and Heaven-ranked, they were even more scarce.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Ning Kingdom didn't even have any Heaven-ranked Imperial Army Commanders.</p><p></p><p>The Earth-ranked Imperial Army Commanders were already the peak combat force of the Ning Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>"Captain, I can't go with you to the prefecture!" Zhou Hu gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Qinghe sighed: "If you abandon Red Cloud Village and come with me to the prefecture, perhaps I wouldn't value you so highly."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So this is the malicious spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't look that strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this little boss created by a game, how could it compare to my own cultivated robust physique?"</p><p></p><p>In the dark night, Qi Yuan looked at the tentacled malicious spirit in front of him and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, quick... old servant can't hold on any longer!"</p><p></p><p>"Bless me a bit more!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's kissing me, putting its tentacles in my mouth, wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang gritted his teeth tightly, his pale face flushed red, his frail body like iron tongs, fiercely restraining the malicious spirit.</p><p></p><p>"I've blessed you, don't be impatient, I'll kill it soon."</p><p></p><p>Although in recent days, Qi Yuan had been trying hard to kill mosquitoes, even pretending to be a cat killing a mouse.</p><p></p><p>But his experience points increase was still very weak.</p><p></p><p>His combat power was quite average.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this malicious spirit at night, Qi Yuan imitated what he did last time, blessing Chen Kang so that Chen Kang could hug the malicious spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the malicious spirit, his eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>[Seven-Clawed Ink Malicious Spirit, an Ordinary-ranked malicious spirit, if placed in the Immortal Realm, it would be comparable to a high-level Qi Condensation Realm cultivator.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very curious.</p><p></p><p>This Seven-Clawed Ink Malicious Spirit looked fierce, but its combat power seemed quite average.</p><p></p><p>If using terms like "exploding the street, exploding the star", this Seven-Clawed Ink Malicious Spirit might not even be as strong as a low-level Qi Condensation Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... because the worlds are different, the rules are different?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Just like a person living in a cotton-constructed world, and a person living in a steel-constructed world,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Of course, the people living in the cotton world seem to have greater destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are more doubts in this, and the temporary Qiyuan still cannot understand.</p><p></p><p>The information obtained is too little, and too closed.</p><p></p><p>Now he is in the information cocoon of the game.</p><p></p><p>"I am the cleaver!"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan struck, slashing the tentacle of the seven-clawed ink monster.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the tentacle broke, and black water flowed out continuously.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this water is sweet and delicious, good to drink." Chen Kangbao's face showed delight, "A demonic spirit of the Fanjie level is sweet and delicious!"</p><p></p><p>"Hold on tightly, it's still struggling, don't hurt me."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan said, striking again and again, like cutting vegetables.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, it is difficult for him to be a match for this seven-clawed ink monster, but with Chen Kangbao hugging it, it is different, just like a fish on the chopping board.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qiyuan had a thoughtful look.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, how to play the role of a cleaver, Chen Kangbao, it turns out you are my chopping board!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao held the demonic spirit, and Qiyuan kept slashing, isn't this playing the role of a cleaver? After grasping this, Qiyuan suddenly found that the progress bar of him playing the role of a cleaver had become 30%.</p><p></p><p>A prompt sound came.</p><p></p><p>[The progress of playing the role of a cleaver has reached 30%, your body has obtained the attribute of a cleaver, unlocking the sharp attribute.</p><p></p><p>Your body has become even sharper.]</p><p></p><p>"Ah? I've unlocked the attribute of a cleaver, have I become a cleaver?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan clearly felt that his body had become sharper.</p><p></p><p>But he was very worried.</p><p></p><p>This is the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The cleaver is obviously... not stainless steel.</p><p></p><p>Should he add some carbon tomorrow, first turn into steel, and then turn into stainless steel, otherwise, if he bathes too much, won't it rust?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, is it done?" At this time, Chen Kangbao said anxiously, "I'm almost full!"</p><p></p><p>He had drunk a lot of the blood of the seven-clawed ink monster.</p><p></p><p>"Wait until you hear the cold and heartless mechanical system voice, then you can let go."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan said, and his sharp-attribute hand suddenly slashed the body of the seven-clawed ink monster.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the seven-clawed ink monster was torn to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"You have slain the seven-clawed ink monster, and your experience value has increased significantly."</p><p></p><p>The cold and heartless mechanical voice came.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Because his character level has risen to 15.</p><p></p><p>In one go, he leveled up 6 levels, which is much faster than killing the black and white dog beast. It's worth knowing that after level 9, he killed many mosquitoes, but still couldn't level up, as if he had encountered a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has finally reached level 15.</p><p></p><p>After level 15, he clearly felt that he was somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>If it can be said that before level 9, he was still an ordinary person, but now, he can be considered a superhuman.</p><p></p><p>And with the death of the seven-clawed ink monster, Qiyuan found that its corpse seemed to disappear into a wisp of black smoke.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>The nearby Chen Kangbao was a little disappointed, he was still hungry and didn't get to eat the seven-clawed ink monster.</p><p></p><p>Although demonic spirits cannot be eaten, he is the servant of the celestial, so eating some demonic spirits should not be too much, right?</p><p></p><p>"I feel that we should kill some demonic spirits, after all, killing demonic spirits can increase our strength faster!" Qiyuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Killing mosquitoes, the progress is too slow.</p><p></p><p>And the brothers and sisters in the asylum, their words are good to hear, and they are very interesting, and they have not offended Qiyuan, so Qiyuan naturally will not kill them casually.</p><p></p><p>Killing demonic spirits is the best choice.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic spirits?" Chen Kangbao frowned, as if thinking about something.</p><p></p><p>At this time, suddenly, Qiyuan also frowned: "Be quiet."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao immediately stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan had a thoughtful look.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have heard someone calling me?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, in the depths of his mind, he seemed to have heard someone calling him.</p><p></p><p>But the sound insulation here is too good, he couldn't hear it clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the silent voice?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not it!" Qiyuan shook his head vigorously.</p><p></p><p>The silent voice has no sound.</p><p></p><p>What he just heard still had a voice, it's just that it seemed to be far away, so he couldn't hear it clearly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu was dressed in the attire of a constable, with a large knife hanging at his waist.</p><p></p><p>It seems that due to the rain last night, the red soil on the ground was muddy, staining the soles of his feet.</p><p></p><p>He stepped on the blue stone slabs, his eyes carrying a hint of hidden worry.</p><p></p><p>Before the official kiln is fired, the news of the emergence of a yellow-level demonic spirit in the Red Cloud Stronghold cannot be leaked out.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he will not be able to bear the consequences, and it will also implicate Lin Qinghe.</p><p></p><p>Now he is self-blaming and conflicted.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Zhou, this is it, Li Laoye last night... suddenly vomited water, and then... died." The young Li Xiaoduan, whose clothes were patched all over, had a dark face, and although he was young, he often went down the kiln.</p><p></p><p>The person who died mysteriously in the Red Cloud Stronghold yesterday was Li Xiaoduan's neighbor.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu entered Li Laoye's simple red soil mud-built house, and about an hour later, he came out.</p><p></p><p>His expression was very grim.</p><p></p><p>Because in these days, more and more people have died in the Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, come in and have a drink of water." Li Xiaoduan called out from outside.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu looked at Li Xiaoduan's thin figure, thought about it, and entered Li Xiaoduan's house.</p><p></p><p>He also has a son about the same age.</p><p></p><p>Entering Li Xiaoduan's house, the simple house was completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>Even the bedroom didn't have one, only a half-wall as a partition, tightly against a bed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaoduan handed over the water: "Uncle, drink water!"</p><p></p><p>"Drawn from the ancient well?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Don't drink too much of this water, it doesn't feel clean." Zhou Hu didn't drink the water.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Which one of the people in this Red Cloud Stronghold hasn't drunk the water?</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Zhou, people in the stronghold have been dying frequently these days, what's going on?" Li Xiaoduan asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm here." Zhou Hu paused and said.</p><p></p><p>"With Uncle here, there's definitely no problem!" Li Xiaoduan's face showed a naive smile.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Hu's gaze was attracted by a strange "idol" on the offering table in the house.</p><p></p><p>"What is this, do you still believe in gods?" Zhou Hu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, a traveling merchant passed by, and he said that in the Central Plains, many people believe in this god, and the stronghold has been restless lately, so I gritted my teeth and bought this idol, praying day and night, hoping that He can protect me and my sister.</p><p></p><p>This god is called Shenlin! The merchant said that He is the most powerful... divine artifact in the Central Plains!"</p><p></p><p>Demonic spirits are divided into levels of Fanjie, Huang, Xuan, Di, Tian, and Shen.</p><p></p><p>The artifacts controlled by the Yubingshi also have the same name.</p><p></p><p>Powerful artifacts, although they have no consciousness, have unfathomable power.</p><p></p><p>Many people choose to worship divine artifacts to seek protection.</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of it." Zhou Hu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he still had something unsaid in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This idol, if it has the power of a divine artifact, Li Xiaoduan can't afford it either.</p><p></p><p>So... Li Xiaoduan was probably cheated by that traveling merchant.</p><p></p><p>After all, that kind of idol, even he can't afford it, let alone Li Xiaoduan.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cold voice came from outside the house.</p><p></p><p>"Shenlin is the national treasure of the White Cang Kingdom, but unfortunately... a hundred years ago, in a great chaos, this divine artifact was shattered and turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Your idol is real... but the god is dead, so what use is the idol?"</p><p></p><p>A tall, cold-faced Taoist priestess walked in, and when she mentioned Shenlin, her eyes were filled with endless melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"Child, sell this idol to me for 500 taels of silver, will you sell it?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

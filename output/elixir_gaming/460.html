        <h1>Chapter 460</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Daxue held the gift box in her hands, with an eager expression.</p><p></p><p>"Which Celestial Lord should we visit first?"</p><p></p><p>In the Black Magic Abyss, dozens of Yang Spirit Celestial Lords had also come to guard the Demon Gate.</p><p></p><p>Finding the mole would not be a simple task.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go with Black Sword," Qi Yuan pondered for a moment before deciding. "Among the Yang Spirit Celestial Lords at the Demon Gate, he has the highest status. If he receives us warmly, how could the other Celestial Lords refuse to see us?"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. We're also bringing such precious eggs as gifts, those Yang Spirit Celestial Lords won't refuse to see us," Zi Yuan Daxue added.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given their status, especially Blood Robe's, these Yang Spirit Celestial Lords would not refuse to see them without special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see Black Sword!" Zi Yuan Daxue said casually.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu followed behind the two of them silently, like a little follower.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was very curious about what special methods Senior Brother Blood Robe had to find the mole.</p><p></p><p>The mole was deeply hidden, even the ancestors couldn't uncover them. How would Senior Brother Blood Robe find them? She pondered this question, unable to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, Black Sword, dressed in white robes, held the ice egg in his hand, with a strange look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This egg... I'll accept it. But you didn't come to see me just to offer eggs, did you?" Black Sword sat on the throne, his voice lingering.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the supreme principles, he seemed to be shrouded in a layer of mist, making him hard to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at him gave one the feeling of gazing at the vastness of the stars.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu lowered her head, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Even Zi Yuan Daxue reined in her casual demeanor, appearing very low-key.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Yuan remained unchanged from before.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this. Last time, the two of us encountered an assassination attempt. I want to meet all the Yang Spirits to see who the mole is," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's gaze remained unchanged: "This matter runs deep. Rest assured, I will give you justice."</p><p></p><p>The current Black Sword, having comprehended the supreme principles, was incomparable to his former self.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he suppressed his aura, these young geniuses of the same generation would only feel his power when they saw him.</p><p></p><p>Now, even when suppressed, that vast aura made people unable to look at him directly, as if facing a deity seated in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's meaning was clear - he would investigate this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan's voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sword... are you the mole?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Black Sword and asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even Zi Yuan Daxue blinked, looking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't expected Qi Yuan to ask like this.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Qi Yuan's question also slightly surprised Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>However, he still calmly answered: "No."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan continued to ask: "The last time I was in danger, were you involved?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"This time, if I go out, will you leak my whereabouts?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to harm me?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>One dared to ask, the other dared to answer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Black Sword and slowly said: "Thank you for informing me."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze deep: "The Black Magic Abyss is originally one entity. Ancestor Zi Yuan and the Abyss Master have a misunderstanding. I wish to resolve it. Please pass these words to Ancestor Zi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Even though Black Sword was suppressing his own aura, his words made Zi Yuan Xiaolu and Zi Yuan Daxue feel fear.</p><p></p><p>This was the terror of a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Even when being gentle, even when restraining one's aura.</p><p></p><p>But standing there, he still made people feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan left with Zi Yuan Daxue and Xiaolu.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they left, Zi Yuan Daxue let out a sigh of relief: "Comprehending the supreme principles is indeed remarkable. Before, when meeting Senior Brother Black Sword, I didn't have this feeling of fear and trepidation. Now, seeing him... I can't help but feel afraid."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu also agreed: "This feeling of palpitation is like when I first stepped into cultivation and saw the stars."</p><p></p><p>"Was it that scary? I didn't feel anything," Qi Yuan didn't have this feeling. "It seems you fundamentally don't want to believe that all people are equal."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly understood the core issue.</p><p></p><p>"It's because you're too extraordinary!" Zi Yuan Daxue couldn't help but say, thinking of Qi Yuan's actions just now.</p><p></p><p>Who would look for a mole by directly asking in front of them?</p><p></p><p>And what was the point of asking Black Sword? Everyone knew that Black Sword would be the future leader of the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Why would His Majesty rebel?</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is about defying the heavens, so it's normal to have some extraordinary individuals," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"You're very extraordinary, but you haven't comprehended the supreme principles. You're indeed a bit inferior to Black Sword," Zi Yuan Daxue said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became dejected: "Black Sword has comprehended an average of one supreme principle, while I've comprehended... well, approximately zero. I'm indeed not as good as Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>He had over 4000 divine embryos inside him.</p><p></p><p>He had only comprehended two principles in total, which averaged out to a very pitiful number.</p><p></p><p>This was even including the No Food Holy Mother who had gone to other universes.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the data would be even more pitiful.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to recognize the gap between you and Black Sword means there's still hope for you!" As Zi Yuan Daxue spoke, she felt a bit hungry, so she ate the mushroom in her mouth raw, eating and chatting at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, if I comprehend 4751 more supreme principles, my average would be greater than one, and I'd surpass Black Sword," Qi Yuan pondered seriously. "But without the Wall of Principles, comprehending 4751 supreme principles is too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu stood silently to the side, not daring to speak at all.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Daxue smiled: "With so many supreme principles, won't you give me one?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought seriously.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the well at home had returned.</p><p></p><p>The wall at home was still missing.</p><p></p><p>But he had no grudges with the Principle Discussion Association, so forcibly taking one seemed inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't have an awesome grandfather who could directly demand one.</p><p></p><p>So, he had to rely on wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"You know, the Principle Discussion Association and I are both in the Sixth Heaven. Does this count as living together?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Now that my relationship with the Principle Discussion Association has broken down and we're living separately, can I have half of the Wall of Principles?"</p><p></p><p>"You think too much!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Gate.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord narrowed his eyes, feeling curious.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is Blood Robe's intention with this?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had received news that Blood Robe was visiting Yang Spirit Celestial Lords everywhere with Ice Sword's egg, inquiring about the mole.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Wind Decay Celestial Lord thought it better to avoid trouble and not see them.</p><p></p><p>But Black Sword had seen them, and other Yang Spirits had answered Blood Robe's questions.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't see them, wouldn't it make him look suspicious?</p><p></p><p>"Could this be a way to sound out the situation?" Wind Decay Celestial Lord pondered.</p><p></p><p>He naturally didn't believe that Blood Robe could uncover his involvement just by asking a few questions.</p><p></p><p>There might be some scheme of Ancestor Zi Yuan behind this, so he needed to be careful.</p><p></p><p>"Paying respects to Wind Decay Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the great hall, Qi Yuan's clear voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord sat on the main seat, his expression amiable: "The three of you have come, please be seated."</p><p></p><p>"This is Ice Sword's egg, a gift for Wind Decay Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly handed the gift box to Wind Decay Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord was about to say some polite words when he heard Qi Yuan say:</p><p></p><p>"Let's skip the small talk and get straight to the point!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever thought about harming me?" Qi Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord's expression was kind: "In the Black Magic Abyss, one of the people I admire most is the Purple Origin ancestor. You are his most valued bloodline, so how could I think of harming you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked. </p><p></p><p>His nose grew a little longer.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that the other party was... a mole? He suddenly became interested.</p><p></p><p>After questioning more than a dozen Yang Spirit Celestial Lords, he had finally found the mole.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this task required a lot of skill.</p><p></p><p>Even with Qi Yuan's clever mind, it took him this long to find the mole.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Decay Celestial Lord, don't hide it anymore. You're lying to me, you clearly want to harm me!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The mole had revealed himself, and it was Wind Decay Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord's expression didn't change.</p><p></p><p>However, Purple Origin Daxue and Purple Origin Xiaolu were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, you must be joking. How could I harm you?" Wind Decay Celestial Lord said with a smile, though a trace of suspicion arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Last time when I was in danger, were you involved?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"No," Wind Decay Celestial Lord continued to deny.</p><p></p><p>His nose grew even longer.</p><p></p><p>"Does your ancestor want to be a mole?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord came from the Yin Soul Heaven. The strength of Yin Soul Heaven ranked in the top three in the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"No, how can you say such things so casually?" Wind Decay Celestial Lord waved his sleeve, seeming somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Purple Origin Xiaolu blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it was already quite abstract for Blood Robe to directly ask other Yang Spirit Celestial Lords if they were moles.</p><p></p><p>Here, when Wind Decay Celestial Lord answered no, he immediately asserted that the other party was.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, your acting is too good," Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord was smiling on the outside, but not smiling on the inside. He even wanted to crush Qi Yuan to death.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I'm planning to ambush... Hui Zeng Celestial Lord. I've only told you about this. You won't leak this information, will you?" Qi Yuan stared at Wind Decay Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord's expression changed several times: "Blood Robe, I've been tolerant because you're junior. What do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't change the subject. I will go to assassinate Hui Zeng of Ghost Reign Heaven in a month. You won't leak this news, will you?" Qi Yuan looked at Wind Decay Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"I won't." Wind Decay Celestial Lord's face turned ugly. "Please leave."</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he didn't want to talk to Qi Yuan anymore.</p><p></p><p>"I know you're in a hurry, but don't be hasty," Qi Yuan said with a smile. "In a month, I'll ambush Hui Zeng Celestial Lord. If any problems arise, I'll have to trouble you."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan left with Purple Origin Xiaolu and Purple Origin Daxue.</p><p></p><p>In the spacious hall, only Wind Decay Celestial Lord remained.</p><p></p><p>"How did he discover me?"</p><p></p><p>"Was he bluffing, or something else?"</p><p></p><p>"In a month, he'll assassinate Hui Zeng... I..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Purple Origin ancestor is watching me now?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord's thoughts were in chaos, and he didn't dare to make any moves.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit confused, feeling that today's events were particularly unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>If Purple Origin ancestor had discovered he was a mole, why would he let Blood Robe tell him? Shouldn't they pretend not to know and secretly plot against him? If Blood Robe was bluffing, why didn't he bluff others?</p><p></p><p>No matter how he thought about it, this matter seemed unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even dare to take out his communication jade slip to contact his superiors.</p><p></p><p>He felt that things were too strange, too illogical.</p><p></p><p>Who does things this way? He sat on the cloud, not daring to make any rash moves.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, as the three of them left, Purple Origin Xiaolu anxiously asked,</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with this Wind Decay Celestial Lord? Senior Brother Blood Robe, how did you know?"</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Daxue also looked at Qi Yuan, full of curiosity and oddity.</p><p></p><p>"My clever organ told me," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Could he really have a problem?" Purple Origin Xiaolu hesitated. "Senior Brother Blood Robe, if you discovered he had a problem, why did you tell him?"</p><p></p><p>"I wanted to tell him, so I told him," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>His supreme principles were absolute adaptation and doing whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>To make these two supreme principles more stable and deeply engraved, Qi Yuan's actions needed to align with the essence of the supreme principles.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could master them faster.</p><p></p><p>So, he wanted to tell, and he told.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Purple Origin Xiaolu was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't told him, they could have observed secretly and made plans.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had told him, the situation would have many uncertainties.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stroked Purple Origin Xiaolu's delicate ox horn and smiled: "We're cultivating immortality, it's tiring to always be scheming and plotting.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the most important thing is strength.</p><p></p><p>Strong power is what gives you the right to survive.</p><p></p><p>Schemes and plots are nothing but fleeting clouds."</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan cared least about was schemes and plots.</p><p></p><p>The biggest scheme would be... Ghost Reign Heaven and Black Magic Abyss joining forces, along with all the great principles, to secretly hunt and kill Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But since Qi Yuan dared to come to the Black Magic Abyss and enter this situation, he had already prepared for the worst in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was long prepared to face all the great principles as enemies.</p><p></p><p>So, he really didn't care about any schemes or plots.</p><p></p><p>Immortal cultivation is difficult, but it's also simple.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the essence through the phenomenon, it's just three steps: first, kill the enemy; second, plunder resources; third, feast.</p><p></p><p>"In a month, Senior Brother Blood Robe, you're going to hunt and kill Hui Zeng Celestial Lord?" Purple Origin Xiaolu asked again.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Qi Yuan shook his head, his expression becoming serious.</p><p></p><p>"The most impressive thing about a truly great plan is that even the planner doesn't know what will happen next. Hunting and killing Yang Spirits... it depends on fate."</p><p></p><p>"..." Purple Origin Xiaolu was speechless.</p><p></p><p>This great plan was too great.</p><p></p><p>It would be better not to make a plan at all! After all, no one knows what to do next.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see if there are any more moles among the other Yang Spirits," Qi Yuan said seriously, carrying the ice egg.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu looked at Qi Yuan and said weakly: "Senior Brother Blood Robe, don't act rashly against Yang Spirits... we need to find some Celestial Lords to help."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, she felt that Senior Brother Blood Robe might really dare to hunt and kill Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have confidence," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother... don't put too much pressure on yourself. Cultivation... also needs to be relaxed at times," Purple Origin Xiaolu looked at Qi Yuan with concern.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Senior Brother Blood Robe might be feeling anxious after seeing the black sword comprehend the supreme principle, putting too much pressure on himself.</p><p></p><p>This also led to his actions seeming somewhat incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." Qi Yuan paused slightly, "What you say makes some sense. I've been too busy lately. Sigh... it seems I need to play a game to relax."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the world of immortal cultivation, he had been constantly busy.</p><p></p><p>There were always various crises and threats hanging over his head.</p><p></p><p>Black Mountain Sect, Light Palace, Great Calamity, Supreme Radiance Palace...</p><p></p><p>Only in games could he find a moment of peace.</p><p></p><p>Especially on Arch Star, spending the honeymoon with Golden Canary, Ning Tao, and Little Jia was one of the few times Qi Yuan gave himself a vacation.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the time, his nerves were always tense, unable to stop.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we have a delicious mushroom hotpot together, and invite Ice Sword too.</p><p></p><p>We've given away so many of his eggs to others, we should thank him properly," Purple Origin Daxue said from the side.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the marketplace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was walking around with purpose.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had a wife at home, he couldn't leave it bare and without any furnishings.</p><p></p><p>For several days, Qi Yuan had been coming to the marketplace to make purchases.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the clothing shop, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Should I take the opportunity to buy my junior sister a bra?"</p><p></p><p>He remembered that last time, although he had spoken very tactfully, it had displeased his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>He understood that this was because he was a giant in terms of eloquence, but a dwarf in terms of action.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he took action, it would warm his junior sister's heart for the entire day.</p><p></p><p>However, he hesitated again: "I'm also not that close with my junior sister."</p><p></p><p>He felt it was best to let this matter go.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and left the marketplace.</p><p></p><p>In the marketplace, a flash of malice passed through Luo Jing's bright eyes.</p><p></p><p>He immediately followed after him.</p><p></p><p>He followed the figure of Qi Yuan in front of him, looking for a suitable place to make his move.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Qi Yuan disappear into a secluded mountain forest, he felt a bit gleeful.</p><p></p><p>This was the place to strike! As long as he could capture Qi Yuan and interrogate him about what happened in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, he could then report back to his master,破狼.</p><p></p><p>He quickly followed and landed.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, he was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the person?" He was shocked to find that the Qi Yuan who had landed in the secluded forest had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>He felt a chill in his heart, sensing that he had fallen into an ambush.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts became highly alert.</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, he felt a coolness at his neck, as if a blade had just grazed it.</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes and saw a hand reach into his dantian, grasping his golden core.</p><p>And his head was lifted up by a hand.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as soon as Luo Jing landed, his head and body were severed by a single stroke.</p><p>His head was grabbed by Qi Yuan, and his golden core was also clenched in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"You are... a person from the Hall of Light?" Qi Yuan brought the severed head close to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Before killing this man, Qi Yuan took a glance and learned the general identity of the other party, who also harbored evil intentions towards him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luo Jing's heart was in turmoil: "You... who are you?"</p><p></p><p>A Qi Yuan in the initial stage of Foundation Establishment had easily subdued him, a mid-stage Yuandan cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This was too exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>Even the top 100 geniuses of the Eastern Land would be unable to do this. </p><p>Even if they could, they wouldn't be able to do it so casually, like an instant kill.</p><p></p><p>The one he was facing now was not just in the Foundation Establishment stage, but a Nascent Soul old monster, right?</p><p></p><p>"I'm just the useless Qi Yuan that you've been so eager to capture." Qi Yuan looked at Luo Jing.</p><p></p><p>He felt fortunate that he had hidden his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator from the Hall of Light had come to capture him, he might not have been their match at the moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, he had already tested that his incomplete Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment could kill early-stage Nascent Soul, and when facing mid-stage Nascent Soul, he should be able to fight on par, and even kill them.</p><p></p><p>To contend with late-stage Nascent Soul, he probably needed to advance to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, which would take a few more years.</p><p></p><p>So the current Qi Yuan was impatient to enter the game and quickly grind levels to increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Now he had many hidden enemies.</p><p></p><p>The always mysterious Black Chicken old monster; the master of破狼, the Furious True Lord; the people behind the old emperor.</p><p></p><p>Although these enemies might not know that Qi Yuan was their enemy.</p><p>But Qi Yuan knew.</p><p></p><p>He had been restless day and night.</p><p></p><p>He had to quickly improve his strength to guard against potential dangers.</p><p></p><p>"You definitely can't be Qi Yuan, how could a Foundation Establishment cultivator have such strength?" Luo Jing was utterly disbelieving, and then pleaded, "Let me go, senior, I'm willing to be your servant!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan coldly said, "I don't need servants."</p><p></p><p>He was about to use force to crush Luo Jing's golden core.</p><p></p><p>Luo Jing hurriedly pleaded, "Spare me, senior, I'm very useful, I know a lot. The Hall of Light is plotting to incite a war across a hundred nations, not just for the Great Wilderness, but to refine a treasure to ascend to the level of an Yin Deity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart trembled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"I also know many secret techniques..." Luo Jing frantically tried to demonstrate his value.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan no longer listened to Luo Jing's nonsense and crushed his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Luo Jing's aura dissipated at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"So poor? Only one Mysterious-grade technique?"</p><p></p><p>After searching Luo Jing's body, Qi Yuan left the mark of the Divine Flower Sect on him.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Sect and the Hall of Light are mortal enemies.</p><p></p><p>If a cultivator of the Divine Flower Sect killed Luo Jing, wouldn't that be a normal occurrence?</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking and wealthy cultivator of the Divine Flower Sect who killed Luo Jing has nothing to do with a village-level Foundation Establishment like him, right? However, after killing Luo Jing, Qi Yuan still felt a bit uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He quickly entered the discussion forum.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, do you know about the Hall of Light's plot to incite a war across a hundred nations?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the details." Rogue Immortal Saint was online at all times, "I only know that the Hall of Light has been making moves against the hundred nations recently."</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Flame Emperor also said, "It's not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Icy Beauty Goddess said, "The land of the hundred nations is a peculiar place.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Continent's thirteen provinces, there is no other place with so many cultivation nations.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of Light has a damaged treasure called the Imperial Extreme Shocking Dragon Crown.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of Light covets the hundred nations, precisely to ignite a war across the hundred nations, using the collisions between nations to nurture the blood energy and nourish the Imperial Extreme Shocking Dragon Crown, even to the point of elevating it to the level of an Yin Deity Treasure!"</p><p></p><p>This statement shocked the other three Emperors, including Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of Light has such a big scheme!</p><p></p><p>Such a ruthless heart!</p><p></p><p>To ignite a war across the hundred nations, causing the deaths of countless lives, just to forge an Yin Deity-level treasure?</p><p></p><p>At first, Qi Yuan thought the Hall of Light's ambitions were only for the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, it's the hundred nations.</p><p></p><p>And the purpose is to refine an Yin Deity-level treasure.</p><p></p><p>This represents the Hall of Light's great determination.</p><p></p><p>After failing in their plot against the Great Wilderness Nation, they certainly won't give up so easily.</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of Light claims to uphold the righteous path, yet they do such a thing that defies heaven and earth!" Rogue Immortal Saint spoke with indignation.</p><p></p><p>"The land of the hundred nations does not belong to the Eastern Continent, so even if the Hall of Light does this, at most it will just be discussed by some people," Great Sun Flame Emperor also sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Divine Flower Sect's power in the Emerald Cloud Continent is too small, otherwise they would definitely stop the Hall of Light," the Icy Beauty Goddess said.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Sect's power is very strong, even surpassing the Hall of Light.</p><p></p><p>However, this power is also extremely scattered, and the headquarters is not even in the Eastern Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Sect's power in the Emerald Cloud Continent is no match for the Hall of Light.</p><p></p><p>And there are even people from the Hall of Light who have secretly joined the Divine Flower Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The land of the hundred nations doesn't even have a Purple Palace, there's no way they can stop the Hall of Light.</p><p></p><p>And the upper echelons of the hundred nations, facing such a situation, probably just turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's the lower-level cultivators and soldiers who will die.</p><p></p><p>They can even receive some rewards from the Hall of Light, and are eager for more lower-level cultivators to die." The Icy Beauty Goddess said.</p><p></p><p>The ones who die are the lower-level cultivators, while the beneficiaries are the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>The Icy Beauty Goddess herself is in the Eastern Continent, not in the Emerald Cloud Continent.</p><p></p><p>She is also powerless to do anything about the Hall of Light's schemes.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Flame Emperor thought of something and then said, "Origin Immortal, you are a cultivator from the land of the hundred nations, right?</p><p></p><p>How about you come to the Emerald Cloud Continent and stay for a few decades, and I'll take you to tour the famous mountains and ancient sites?"</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Flame Emperor wanted to try to lure Origin Immortal out of the vortex of the war across the hundred nations.</p><p></p><p>The war across the hundred nations is not something a young genius can change.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Great Sun Flame Emperor, but I won't go to the Emerald Cloud Continent." Qi Yuan refused, then thought of something and asked the Icy Beauty Goddess, "If I have the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment and a Immortal-grade golden core, can I stop the Hall of Light?"</p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, Qi Yuan can kill Yuandan and fight Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>If he also has an Immortal-grade golden core, he should be able to contend with the Purple Palace, right?</p><p>Can he stop the Hall of Light?</p><p></p><p>"No, it's far from enough.</p><p>The Purple Palace has already seen through the essence of spiritual power.</p><p>A golden core, no matter how strong, how much spiritual power it has, cannot be the opponent of a Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p>Moreover, the Hall of Light has more than one Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p>What's more terrifying is the Imperial Extreme Shocking Dragon Crown, which was originally a treasure of an Yin Deity.</p><p>That Yin Deity was slain, and the treasure was shattered.</p><p>To stop the Hall of Light, you also need to face the Imperial Extreme Shocking Dragon Crown.</p><p>Several Purple Palace cultivators working together can even activate the Imperial Extreme Shocking Dragon Crown and summon a wisp of Yin Deity projection.</p><p>That is the projection of an Yin Deity, and just a wisp of it can completely dissolve an entire nation in this world.</p><p>This kind of mighty power cannot be resisted by ordinary people.</p><p>Unless an Yin Deity intervenes, the situation of the war across the hundred nations cannot be changed.</p><p>But this time, the Hall of Light has initiated the war across the hundred nations with the tacit consent of some powerful figures.</p><p>So even if you are not a participant, an Yin Deity may not be able to interfere with the war across the hundred nations.</p><p>This involves a hidden secret that even I cannot know the specific reasons for." The Icy Beauty Goddess spoke with a hint of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Though not an Yin Shen, even the Purple Palace could be considered a mortal.</p><p></p><p>Although this move by the Hall of Radiance went against the Heavenly Harmony, it had obtained the tacit approval of some true great figures.</p><p></p><p>And the Hundred Nations could only become sacrificial pawns.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt heavy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even he, who was in the Abyss, had slain three thousand demonic beasts from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>Even in the end, he had managed to kill the main body of the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>He still could not annihilate the Great Shang Nation with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Yin Shen was far beyond him.</p><p></p><p>"How long before the Hundred Nations' bloody battle will fully commence?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Roughly two to three years, and the Hall of Radiance will have the Hundred Nations within its grasp.</p><p></p><p>By then, the Hundred Nations will be divided into two warring factions.</p><p></p><p>The bloody battle will last around three hundred years, and the Primordial Shocking Dragon Crown will have absorbed enough blood qi and national power to be restored as a true Yin Shen-grade treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Two to three years, huh?" Qi Yuan felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>In the Hundred Nations' bloody battle, the Hall of Radiance will surely send many high-level cultivators to the Hundred Nations.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had slain Zhu Lianhua, Broke Wolf, and today's Luo Jing.</p><p></p><p>This had thoroughly offended the Hall of Radiance.</p><p></p><p>The two could be considered sworn enemies.</p><p></p><p>Facing the threat of the Hall of Radiance, Qi Yuan had to quickly improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the Hall of Radiance were to suddenly act rashly and summon a wisp of Yin Shen aura to erase the Great Shang Nation,</p><p></p><p>Even a peerless genius like Qi Yuan would be unable to cope.</p><p></p><p>"In two to three years, with ordinary cultivation, I won't be able to reach the Elixir Realm.</p><p></p><p>If I have the help of a game, I have the confidence to refine a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>But even a Xian-grade Golden Core might not be enough to defeat the Hall of Radiance!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>He was already capable of challenging those above his level, which was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He could slay Deity Embryos at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Even the top 100 geniuses of the Eastern Lands could not do this.</p><p></p><p>But even with an Elixir, according to his plan, he could only contend with the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>To fight Deity Embryos, he might need to reach the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Golden Core do I need to be able to contend with the Yin Shen?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride, I won't accompany you to watch the stars tonight. I need to study the cultivation techniques!"</p><p></p><p>During this period, Qi Yuan cultivated diligently every day, occasionally lying on the wooden board at night to watch the stars with Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>Now, feeling the pressure from the Hall of Radiance, Qi Yuan felt he needed to work even harder.</p><p></p><p>He also needed to carefully study those ordinary low-grade techniques, integrating them into his own knowledge system.</p><p></p><p>This way, his eyes would be able to see more, and the "Qi Yuan Sutra" would be rapidly perfected.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Little Bride obediently sat down beside him.</p><p></p><p>At night, Qi Yuan carefully studied the cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's version of fireflies blinked their eyes in the lampshade, and the light in the wooden house was somewhat dim.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride sat beside him, her sleeve propping up her collar, constantly watching Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine sense was scanning the techniques, quickly observing and researching them.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the night, Qi Yuan finally digested the Mysterious-grade technique that he had obtained from Luo Jing.</p><p></p><p>The "Qi Yuan Sutra" had advanced a small step forward.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over, and Little Bride's sleeve was drooping on the table, as if she had fallen asleep, like a sleeping beauty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked outside, and the sky was almost dawning.</p><p></p><p>He had deployed a sound-isolating technique in the house.</p><p></p><p>Then, he threw the small wooden fish into the mouth of the wooden cat puppet.</p><p></p><p>In the early morning on the Seven-Colored Peak, it was a little cool.</p><p></p><p>He gently covered Little Bride's body with his robe.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Little Bride, his gaze indistinct: "You've been following me... You must have suffered a lot."</p><p></p><p>Now that he could see Little Bride, he knew that her identity was definitely not that simple.</p><p></p><p>He quickly pushed aside this emotion.</p><p></p><p>Now was not the time to be sentimental, improving his strength was the most important thing, and perfecting his cultivation techniques was also very important.</p><p></p><p>"The most precious technique I have now is the Great Sun's 'White Day Fantasy Technique', but unfortunately, it is completely different from my cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>I cannot integrate it into the 'Qi Yuan Sutra' right now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he could integrate it, he felt his techniques could directly cultivate to the Elixir Realm, or even higher.</p><p></p><p>"It's still because my knowledge is too limited, I can't find the commonalities between the Cyan Wave Realm and the Wangyue Continent, and can't convert the cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about this.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, at a higher realm, he would be able to achieve the Great Harmony of all Dharmas.</p><p></p><p>"However, the concept of the 'White Day Fantasy Technique' can be borrowed a bit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began to recall and analyze the 'White Day Fantasy Technique' again.</p><p></p><p>"The latter half of the 'White Day Fantasy Technique', which requires devouring the stars to achieve self-realization, is truly unrealistic."</p><p></p><p>The stars in the sky were not true stars.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes saw that the stars in the Heavens were merely projections of the Immortal Gods.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Great Sun encountered external enemies, it's estimated that his strength had grown too powerful, coveting... the projection of a certain Immortal God's stars, and was thus suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, what happened afterwards is unknown."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the White Day Fantasy Technique.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"The 'White Day Fantasy Technique' is useless in this realm, but what about on the Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, there is no such thing as trash in the world, and what is trash in one place may be a treasure in another.</p><p></p><p>The 'White Day Fantasy Technique', which requires devouring the Immortal Gods' star projections, is essentially opposing the Gods.</p><p></p><p>This is impossible.</p><p></p><p>But what if this technique was brought to the Blue Star?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes had seen that the stars on the Blue Star were not the projections of the Gods, but true, existing stars.</p><p></p><p>Stars without masters.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring the countless stars, this is to wage war against the Gods, and without surpassing Immortal God-level strength, it is not feasible.</p><p></p><p>But what if, by chance, I seize the stars within the Blue Star? Wouldn't it mean that as long as my mouth is big enough, I can truly devour them?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became more and more excited.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that this plan was viable.</p><p></p><p>"But how should I leave... this world and go to a universe similar to the Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Continent and the Cyan Wave Realm that Qi Yuan had been to, according to the star projections in the sky, were clearly in the same "universe".</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to devour the planets, he would have to go to a second universe.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Star, I miss you."</p><p></p><p>"Sun, Pluto, Big Dipper, I miss you." Qi Yuan's appetite increased, and he felt a little hungry.</p><p></p><p>"I'm thinking too much, I should first focus on how to reach the Elixir Realm and refine a powerful Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for all this was to enter the second game world and quickly improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out the last Soul Splitting Pill and slowly put it in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had been constantly consuming Soul Splitting Pills, slowly digesting the medicinal power within.</p><p></p><p>As the last Soul Splitting Pill entered his mouth, Qi Yuan began to digest the medicinal power.</p><p></p><p>His divine soul was also constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Qi Yuan woke up. He found that a piece of clothing had been draped over him, and there were some sweets on the table.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride was lying on the table, seemingly asleep.</p><p></p><p>He looked outside, and the sky had already turned pitch black.</p><p></p><p>The stars were densely packed, reflecting the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Moonlight seeped in through the cracks in the wooden house, falling on Little Bride's body.</p><p></p><p>"My divine soul strength has finally reached the middle stage of Foundation Establishment."</p><p></p><p>The middle stage of the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>He could try to enter the second game.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out the game jade slip and began to enter the game.</p><p></p><p>His divine soul once again saw the distinct game icon.</p><p></p><p>As usual, his divine soul seemed to be wandering aimlessly, approaching the game icon unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the timing was right, Qi Yuan suddenly increased the output of his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Let me in!"</p><p></p><p>He was very close to the game icon, suddenly rushing in, wanting to sneak in while the game icon was not paying attention.</p><p></p><p>This time, his divine soul had grown considerably, and the sudden attack was also more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The game icon's resistance was indeed not as strong as before.</p><p></p><p>But it still reacted violently.</p><p></p><p>At the point where his divine soul was just within reach, it was met with a fierce counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was disappointed, realizing that.</p><p></p><p>At least he needed the late stage of Foundation Establishment divine soul before he could sneak into that game while the game icon was not paying attention.</p><p></p><p>But reaching the late stage of Foundation Establishment divine soul, where would that be easy to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Even if he obtained as many Soul Splitting Pills, he would not be able to reach the late stage of Foundation Establishment divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The advancement of the divine soul became increasingly difficult the further one went.</p><p></p><p>"Failed again?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan heard a familiar voice in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"My dear husband, your little concubine has already undressed, won't you come and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was immediately furious.</p><p></p><p>Lewd game! Damn game! It just rejected him, and now it was using an NPC's voice to tempt him! Was it mocking him for being incapable?</p><p></p><p>"I'll come, I'll come!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan angrily retaliated against the game icon's obstruction.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Heavenly Heart Palace, with her clothes half-undone, exposing a smooth, fragrant shoulder, Ning Lao's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>"My dear husband, let's see where you can run to this time?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

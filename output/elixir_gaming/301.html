        <h1>Chapter 301</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She was heartbroken that the Foundation Establishment spirit object had been thrown into the garbage heap.</p><p></p><p>She hated herself for being just a cat, powerless to do anything. </p><p></p><p>She also hated the cold and heartless man, an ignorant bumpkin who couldn't recognize treasure.</p><p></p><p>He must have practiced martial arts to the point of becoming stupid.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the doorbell rang.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu looked towards the door, feeling weak and dispirited.</p><p></p><p>With the Foundation Establishment spirit object gone, the spiritual energy in the room had become much thinner and more subtle.</p><p></p><p>However, with Xie Xinsu's former Yuan Dan realm strength and experience, she could still sense that the magical treasure she had detected earlier was still here.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked out of the room and opened the door. Looking at the young man outside, he yawned and asked, "Who are you looking for?"</p><p></p><p>"May I come in and sit for a while?" The man outside was naturally Luo Ping.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had come alone. </p><p></p><p>All his subordinates had been left at Yang Shan's home.</p><p></p><p>"Sure," Qi Yuan casually replied as he looked at this unfamiliar man.</p><p></p><p>His response also slightly surprised Luo Ping.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, encountering a strange man knocking and asking to come in, he would have questioned the intentions no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought the other person might be mentally ill, and everything seemed reasonable and normal again.</p><p></p><p>Luo Ping entered the room, his gaze sweeping across the entire place before sitting down on the sofa.</p><p></p><p>He introduced himself, saying: "My name is Luo Ping. Two months ago, I was still just an... ordinary civil servant.</p><p></p><p>You know, I never had a mother-in-law since I was young, so I went to see a high-ranking official. That's right, a very high-ranking one.</p><p></p><p>Then, that official's wife became my mother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Life... is truly unpredictable. It gives you hope, then makes you arrogant. Actually... I've been living very cautiously, afraid that everything would turn to nothing."</p><p></p><p>When at his father-in-law's house, Luo Ping always appeared full of confidence, as if everything was under his control.</p><p></p><p>But only he knew that this feeling of dancing on the edge of a knife was nerve-wracking and torturous.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his previous life, although not extremely wealthy or noble, he had lived peacefully and happily, without worries.</p><p></p><p>In this life, however, he could be called "Brother Treading on Thin Ice".</p><p></p><p>"And then?" Qi Yuan glanced at Luo Ping.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Xie Xinsu looked at Luo Ping with eyes that seemed to say "so pretentious".</p><p></p><p>"You and I... can be considered the same type of person, or perhaps half the same type.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan... aren't you curious about how you died a year from now... but then returned to the present?" </p><p></p><p>Luo Ping felt like he was back in control of everything.</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan could speak, Xie Xinsu's cat neck tightened.</p><p></p><p>Return... to the present? Wait... is this person also a Restarter? Is the cold and heartless ignorant bumpkin of an owner also one?</p><p></p><p>If he is, how could he throw away a Foundation Establishment spirit object as trash?</p><p></p><p>"I come from the future. Most people call us Restarters.</p><p></p><p>And you... can also be considered one of us.</p><p></p><p>But... you didn't live until ten years later, you died just one year from now.</p><p></p><p>So you don't know what happened to this world in the next ten years.</p><p></p><p>That's a pity, and it also means you're not really a qualified Restarter." Luo Ping said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and saw a reflection of himself. In some ways, he actually envied Qi Yuan a bit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Luo Ping: "So you're a Restarter?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Xinsu also seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was actually a Restarter too.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, he died after just one year.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he chose the path of martial arts instead of the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly felt that Qi Yuan was even more pitiful than her.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to follow me?" At this point, Luo Ping spoke up, probing.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan, as an incomplete Restarter, wasn't qualified to cooperate with him, he was willing to give Qi Yuan a chance.</p><p></p><p>"Follow you to work?" Qi Yuan laughed and shook his head, "Working is impossible in this life. My current leisurely lifestyle, playing games every day, occasionally practicing martial arts, is incredibly enjoyable!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan refused very quickly.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly work for someone else?</p><p></p><p>Besides, just a Restarter?</p><p></p><p>No matter how impressive that title is, isn't it just an NPC in the game?</p><p></p><p>The purpose of NPCs existing is to make Qi Yuan's gameplay more fun.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's answer, Luo Ping didn't know whether to feel disappointed or satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Your lifestyle is indeed enviable," Luo Ping nodded. "Since that's the case, I won't bother you anymore. Other Restarters won't come to disturb you either."</p><p></p><p>After chatting casually with Qi Yuan in the room for a while, Luo Ping felt quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>His current life was certainly exciting, but Qi Yuan's kind... was also enviable.</p><p></p><p>However, after becoming a Restarter, even if he wanted to be leisurely... he couldn't be.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't progress, if he didn't become stronger, he might be crushed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have this kind of pressure. From a certain perspective, that could also be considered lucky.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Luo Ping looked at Qi Yuan with a smile in his eyes: "I wish you victory in the martial arts tournament!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Luo Ping resolutely left Qi Yuan's room, as if saying goodbye to his past self.</p><p></p><p>After Luo Ping left, Qi Yuan sat on the sofa, petting the cat with a relaxed expression: "Having a certificate of mental illness is still good. Pretending to be mentally ill... is much more fun."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xie Xinsu directly rolled her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to tell Qi Yuan that he wasn't pretending to be mentally ill, he really was mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>In the days that followed, everything proceeded as usual.</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero-One forced Xie Xinsu to make videos every day, which left Xie Xinsu with no energy to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Xie Xinsu thought every day about turning the tables and becoming the master.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was too weak and was bullied mercilessly by Robot Zero-One, with no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>As for that magical treasure, she had no clues about it either.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't even entered Qi Yuan's room, let alone search for the treasure.</p><p></p><p>A cat's life was gloomy; only through cultivation was there hope of breaking free from this painful existence.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu had already decided that once she succeeded in her cultivation, she would definitely turn the tables and dominate Zero-One.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan's martial arts skills were also improving rapidly.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the twelfth level of the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist".</p><p></p><p>After the twelfth level, the progress of martial arts cultivation clearly slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that this was approaching what Yang Shan called the limit of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Simply continuing to practice the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist" had no use anymore.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the residential complex, Yang Shan looked at Qi Yuan, whose aura was becoming increasingly powerful, and couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"You are definitely the most talented martial artist I've ever seen.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months, you've reached a level that took me over a decade!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts limit, this is truly the martial arts limit."</p><p></p><p>He still remembered when he first met Qi Yuan, who had just entered the door of martial arts and wasn't even considered a martial artist yet.</p><p></p><p>But after just a few months, he had suddenly reached the martial arts limit, standing on equal footing with him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "This is nothing. It's just that your martial artists' path to the martial arts limit... is too short."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>For him, the path from martial artist to the martial arts limit was indeed too short.</p><p></p><p>He had barely practiced a few times before the martial artist's cultivation path was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Too short?" Yang Shan shook his head helplessly, "Generally speaking, for people with ordinary talent, it might take thirty years to reach the martial arts limit, and even then it would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But after thirty years, when your vitality is depleted, how will you maintain it?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was speaking the truth. People like him who reached the limit of martial arts before forty were rare and exceptional.</p><p></p><p>If a person with ordinary talent practiced diligently, they might have a chance to reach the martial arts limit. </p><p></p><p>But by that time, they would likely be over sixty years old.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, fists fear the young and strong. What use is a martial artist in their sixties?</p><p></p><p>"So you..." Yang Shan's expression was enigmatic, "may actually have a chance to break through the martial artist's limit!"</p><p></p><p>Since the founding of the Qin Yuan nation, the youngest to reach the martial arts limit was thirty years old.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was frighteningly young.</p><p></p><p>Of course, having hope of breaking through the martial artist's limit was just hope after all.</p><p></p><p>That previous person was also hailed as the most likely to break through the martial artist's limit. But in the end... he still failed.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, there was even a billionaire who spent huge sums researching how to break through the martial artist's limit.</p><p></p><p>The final research conclusion was that the human body is not capable of breaking through the martial artist's limit.</p><p></p><p>This meant that breaking through the martial artist's limit simply does not exist.</p><p></p><p>"If you keep developing for another year or two, you might really be able to win the championship at the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>For the competition in your city, don't even think about it, first place would be easy.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyue City, those few at the martial arts limit are old now, they won't participate in this kind of competition." Yang Shan kindly reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not worried about the martial arts tournament. I came to you to freeload - do you have any research on breaking through the martial artist's limit?" Qi Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>Regarding breaking through the martial arts limit, he had his own ideas, but also wanted to combine them with others' thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord had given him many good ideas.</p><p></p><p>On the path of martial arts, Yang Shan had also provided him considerable help.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts limit..." At the mention of this, Yang Shan fell silent. After a long while, he said, "In the martial arts world, there has always been a saying that to break through the martial artist's limit, one needs to forge martial willpower.</p><p></p><p>Use powerful martial willpower to drive the advancement of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist's advancement lies in improving the physical body.</p><p></p><p>But relying on martial arts alone, the improvement of the physical body is limited, so it's reversed - using martial willpower to improve the physical body in turn.</p><p></p><p>So we old fogies, after reaching the martial arts limit, have been constantly forging our martial willpower.</p><p></p><p>Martial willpower is a very metaphysical thing.</p><p></p><p>Be careful, I'm going to infuse martial willpower into my gaze and look at you.</p><p></p><p>This kind of gaze is enough to startle the timid, making them lose their composure!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning martial willpower, Yang Shan regained his confidence in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His martial talent may not match Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>But his martial willpower was certainly not inferior.</p><p></p><p>He was a soldier who had been on the battlefield and killed people! The martial willpower he had forged was definitely not something a young inexperienced fellow like Qi Yuan could compare to.</p><p></p><p>One look would probably be enough to frighten the other into losing composure.</p><p></p><p>As Yang Shan spoke, he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>All the essence, energy and spirit in his body condensed at this moment, focusing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The area around his temples was slightly bulging.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's gaze was filled with killing intent at this moment, extremely bright, seemingly dazzling.</p><p></p><p>It looked particularly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Such a gaze would be enough to frighten an opponent into losing focus during a martial arts match.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely effective against young people like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at?" Suddenly, Qi Yuan looked at Yang Shan with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Yuan's reaction was too calm.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't shaken by his gaze at all.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit bewildered: "How come you're fine?"</p><p></p><p>"Just this gaze... what could happen?</p><p></p><p>It seems your martial willpower isn't very strong." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he had seen too many big shots, he had even seen Yang Shen before.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's martial willpower was child's play.</p><p></p><p>"However, you did give me some ideas."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's mention of martial willpower gave Qi Yuan some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Qi Yuan had also been researching martial arts, studying the bloodlines of mutant sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that to break through limits, just enhancing bloodlines wasn't enough for martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Bloodlines weren't everything for a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yang Shan mention martial willpower, he thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>Especially his innate martial technique.</p><p></p><p>The Explosive Bird-Killing Fist.</p><p></p><p>To break through the martial arts limit, not only did he need to enhance his bloodline, he also needed to improve his innate martial technique.</p><p></p><p>The improvement of innate martial techniques... was it related to willpower?</p><p></p><p>"How exactly did you resist my martial willpower?" Yang Shan ignored Qi Yuan's words, immersed in how Qi Yuan had almost completely disregarded his powerful martial willpower.</p><p></p><p>"Did I need to resist?" Qi Yuan laughed, then said, "Actually it's very simple, just kill more people. Kill tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already seen that Yang Shan's so-called martial willpower was just killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Killing intent was something Qi Yuan never lacked.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had killed so much in the game that when cultivating the Glorious Sword of the Light Palace, while others emitted white light, he directly emitted red light.</p><p></p><p>"So... fundamentally, it's because you've killed too few people." Qi Yuan said with a smile, patting Yang Shan's shoulder with the air of an experienced person.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was stunned, then said defiantly: "Kid, what are you bragging about? If you don't want to tell me, fine! Killing people, I've killed too few?</p><p></p><p>You know those Guiren people who are very active online now?</p><p></p><p>I've killed more than ten of them, hehe... even a priest!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Yang Shan proudly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>This was his greatest merit, worth boasting about constantly.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was familiar with Qi Yuan, he also showed off a bit.</p><p></p><p>Currently in Gongxing, Yuelang Country and Wugui Country were at war.</p><p></p><p>Wugui Country had the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>And people from Qin Yuan Country online had never cursed people from Wugui Country or Guwu Country.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that online sentiment was inflamed, everyone wished they could get their hands on Guiren people and execute them!</p><p></p><p>If Yang Shan revealed online that he had killed Guiren people, needless to say, within a few days he would become a major internet celebrity.</p><p></p><p>"Less than a hundred... that's a bit few." Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you've been playing too much on the internet, less than a hundred is still few?</p><p></p><p>Killing a hundred enemies, do you know what that concept means?</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, if a soldier killed a hundred enemies, they would easily be granted a noble title!" Yang Shan felt Qi Yuan had watched too many videos.</p><p></p><p>Someone who had never killed anyone actually said he had killed too few?</p><p></p><p>You should know, those serial killer cases that shocked the whole country only involved killing a dozen or twenty people.</p><p></p><p>Even that was enough to be called a serial killer.</p><p></p><p>And he, Yang Shan, had killed too few?</p><p></p><p>"It's you who lacks experience and hasn't seen those who have killed many. I..." Qi Yuan was about to say he had killed many.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that murder was illegal, he changed his words.</p><p></p><p>"I know someone who has killed no less than ten thousand."</p><p></p><p>"Haha... you have a friend, right? Why not say it was you!" Yang Shan laughed heartily, not taking Qi Yuan's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>He felt Qi Yuan was just joking with him.</p><p></p><p>"Someone like you who hasn't even killed one Guiren person isn't qualified to talk to me!" Yang Shan joked back.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

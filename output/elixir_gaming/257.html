        <h1>Chapter 257</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Share?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>This term, he had actually taught it to the Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Great Sun Flame Emperor brought it up, it seemed he came prepared.</p><p></p><p>"Your proposal is interesting... but how do we get people to share?" Qi Yuan pointed out the key issue.</p><p></p><p>As a resource sharing platform, he could openly freeload off others' resources. </p><p></p><p>But they needed to find a reason for others to share.</p><p></p><p>"Many sects probably won't be willing to hand over their core techniques," the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman added.</p><p></p><p>For sects with long histories, their techniques were their foundation.</p><p></p><p>How could they easily reveal ancestral techniques to others?</p><p></p><p>If techniques were leaked and known by enemies who found weaknesses in them,</p><p></p><p>It could potentially lead to the sect's destruction.</p><p></p><p>So the secret techniques of major sects all had strict rules against external leaks.</p><p></p><p>As for the techniques Qi Yuan gave to Jiang Lingsu at Seven-Colored Peak, those weren't Shenguang Sect's secret techniques, so there were no such concerns.</p><p></p><p>"It's very difficult to attract a sect to hand over their techniques," the Rogue Immortal Lord also offered advice, "Unless there's an enormous benefit, you can only use force to compel them."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's strength, he could indeed use force to compel some sects to hand over techniques.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't possibly force every sect in the entire Azure Wave Realm, could he?</p><p></p><p>That would be exhausting to the point of death.</p><p></p><p>Extremely inefficient and a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>"So we need a reason, a reason that can convince those sects to hand over their techniques.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable, don't you have many techniques?</p><p></p><p>You could upload the techniques you've obtained, and establish a point system based on how precious the techniques are.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who wants to view the techniques you've uploaded would first need to upload new techniques to earn points, which they can then exchange.</p><p></p><p>If you have celestial-level techniques, or can attract many sects to upload some non-secret techniques, that would also give you a vast number of techniques." The Great Sun Flame Emperor laid out his entire plan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded: "This approach could indeed obtain quite a few techniques, but... my appetite is too big."</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Qi Yuan's appetite was too big.</p><p></p><p>Rather, the Golden Core chapter of the Qi Yuan Scripture was purely a bottomless pit.</p><p></p><p>After all, a star may be powerful in the Azure Wave Realm, but on the scale of the universe, stars are even smaller than a drop in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>To swallow the entire universe, the Golden Core chapter of the Qi Yuan Scripture had a long way to go and much work to do.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the more techniques the better.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I can't go to the upper realms now, otherwise..." Qi Yuan said with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The techniques he obtained from Shen Wushen had been extremely profitable for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was also looking forward to what techniques Shen Wushen would bring back from the upper realms this time.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he got a divine technique from Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>That divine technique could not be passed on to others.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he uploaded that divine technique, it would certainly cause a sensation in the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were no divine techniques in the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>The strongest techniques were only celestial techniques.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the sharing organization he and the Great Sun Flame Emperor created would definitely be able to rake in a fortune using the divine technique as bait.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen, step it up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Just sharing alone is not enough to obtain a large number of techniques, we need to think of a mission statement," said the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman.</p><p></p><p>"I know, we need to shout a resounding slogan.</p><p></p><p>Make the Azure Wave Realm great again, what do you think?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan was once again freeloading off someone else's ideas.</p><p></p><p>"That's a bit too vague," the Rogue Immortal Lord said with an awkward smile.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Azure Wave Realm was great or not had nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed." Qi Yuan said disappointedly, thinking seriously.</p><p></p><p>"With the great calamity approaching, all hidden Venerables and major powers are concerned with their own safety. No one will care whether the Azure Wave Realm is great or not," the Great Sun Flame Emperor said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up as he rubbed his teacup: "I've got it, I've thought of a great slogan!"</p><p></p><p>"What slogan?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor, Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman and Rogue Immortal Lord all looked at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said with a serious expression: "Techniques... are poisonous!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The three people present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman: "What techniques are poisonous?"</p><p></p><p>"All the techniques in the Azure Wave Realm... are poisonous.</p><p></p><p>The techniques you cultivate, even your Dao techniques, are all poisonous.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating them, you will be confined to the Azure Wave Realm, becoming fodder."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan told the Four Mythical Emperors the information he had seen with his own eyes. At this moment he did not conceal anything.</p><p></p><p>Because his strength was already sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Unless directly facing the great calamity, he could almost walk sideways through the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The three people present were extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had heard about this.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because of the existence of the great calamity that the techniques are poisonous.</p><p></p><p>Countless years ago, there was an unparalleled genius who challenged the great calamity and ultimately perished.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the reason for his demise, I have two guesses. First, the great calamity called for reinforcements, summoning too many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Second, the techniques he cultivated were problematic, inherently countered.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was peerless, he could only die tragically at the hands of the great calamity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shared the information told to him by the master of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, along with his own reasonable deductions.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the poisonous techniques of the Azure Wave Realm means one's spirit cannot roam the void, travel through the myriad realms, nor ascend to the upper realms. In the Azure Wave Realm, one can only become fodder."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words struck their hearts like a thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman was also stunned, unable to accept this reality for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable... is everything you said true?" the Rogue Immortal Lord asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's all true. I have no reason to deceive you.</p><p></p><p>My techniques are self-created, so there are no problems cultivating them, and I won't become fodder.</p><p></p><p>However, I've tried it, and other people may not be as talented as me. The techniques they create themselves are actually also poisonous." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, this old lady might become a big chunk of fodder for others after cultivating to the spirit realm? If so, it's better not to cultivate at all!" the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman said angrily, now accepting the reality.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, you don't need to be so angry. Even if you didn't know the techniques were poisonous, wouldn't the great calamity still exist?" Qi Yuan advised.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Four Mythical Emperors all revealed helpless smiles.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said made sense.</p><p></p><p>Even if they knew the techniques were poisonous, what could they do? They still couldn't deal with the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>When the great calamity begins, the Azure Wave Realm will be devastated.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, do you think it's too late for me to change my cultivation technique now?" the Rogue Immortal Lord asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>He was the only Golden Core cultivator here, with the weakest strength, so changing his cultivation technique might still be possible.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman and Great Sun Flame Emperor also looked at Qi Yuan, eager to hear his answer on this as well.</p><p></p><p>If push came to shove, they would have to change their cultivation techniques too.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He shook his head: "There's absolutely no need. You don't have to fight the Great Calamity, so why change your cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>Given the energy level of the Canglang Realm, it was possible for Yang Spirits to be born there.</p><p></p><p>The poisonous nature of cultivation methods was likely for two reasons: first, to better absorb resources, and second, to prevent the emergence of unparalleled geniuses who could disrupt the balance of the Canglang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could bluntly say that with the Rogue Immortal Lord's talent, he didn't even qualify to become a resource.</p><p></p><p>"Before long, I alone will be able to easily destroy the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Calamity is dead, the problem with cultivation methods will no longer be an issue," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>When he had just reached the Yuan Dan stage, Qi Yuan was still quite afraid of the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had confidence when facing the Great Calamity, but... he wasn't completely certain yet.</p><p></p><p>After all, if someone powerful from above intervened... if a powerful Yang Spirit appeared, the divine infant in his body hadn't fully awakened, and he might not be a match.</p><p></p><p>"So, just act as if nothing has happened, cultivate slowly, and just wait until I'm strong enough to deal with the Great Calamity!" Qi Yuan said with great enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord felt a strong sense of security and excitedly said, "I'm good at being a bystander, that's what I do best!"</p><p></p><p>"When the Origin Venerable Lord destroys the Great Calamity, I'll play the suona for you!" the Great Sun Flame Emperor also said.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Domineering Lady also looked up admiringly: "So powerful, so cool!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think if I release the information about poisonous cultivation methods, and then put some non-poisonous methods up there... wouldn't that have an explosive effect and attract various sects to share their methods up there?" Qi Yuan said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Among the non-poisonous methods, the first was the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wouldn't easily share this method.</p><p></p><p>But the methods brought by Shen Wushen were almost all non-poisonous.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Sun Flame Emperor nodded: "I would be tempted by such methods too.</p><p></p><p>I might not recultivate myself, but for my descendants... so once such methods appear, they will definitely be in high demand."</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, even if I couldn't cultivate such methods, I'd still want to get my hands on them," said the Ice Mountain Domineering Lady.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was greatly pleased to hear this.</p><p></p><p>"We have a slogan, a plan, and a market. Not bad, not bad. All that's left is implementation," Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found a way to harvest cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"We still need a name!" the Rogue Immortal Lord said excitedly, "We need to give our organization a name!"</p><p></p><p>"How about... Coexistence Association?" Qi Yuan suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Not cool enough!" Ice Mountain Domineering Lady was the first to reject it.</p><p></p><p>"How about Original God Association?" the Rogue Immortal Lord eagerly proposed.</p><p></p><p>"I think that's good!" the Great Sun Flame Emperor expressed approval.</p><p></p><p>"No..." Qi Yuan quickly rejected.</p><p></p><p>If the force he built was called the Original God Association, wouldn't that mean he had become a true Original God fan?</p><p></p><p>"This name is quite good," Ice Mountain Domineering Lady blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't know why Origin was against it.</p><p></p><p>But as long as it wasn't a big deal or a serious matter, she should agree with things he objected to.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was rare to see Qi Yuan like this.</p><p></p><p>"The Rogue Immortal Lord rarely has a smart moment, let's go with his wish," Ice Mountain Domineering Lady continued to apply pressure.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor said cheerfully, "The word 'Original' represents your name, Origin Venerable Lord, and 'God' represents your strength and status.</p><p></p><p>If Original God Association doesn't work, how about God Original Association?"</p><p></p><p>God Original?</p><p></p><p>Monkey God!</p><p></p><p>"No, let's call it Original God Sharing Association!" Qi Yuan said, too lazy to argue further, adding two words as his last act of stubbornness.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just an organization's name, any would do.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord immediately showed a look of joy, feeling quite accomplished.</p><p></p><p>"If one day, the Original God Association becomes the number one organization in the Canglang Realm, wouldn't I be able to tell my future descendants that I named this force!" Qi Yuan gave the Rogue Immortal Lord a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>The group discussed in the Wangxian Tower for half an hour.</p><p></p><p>They finally settled on the development path for the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor's grandfather, Lord Feng, would be responsible for managing it.</p><p></p><p>After all, without reaching the Yin Spirit level, managing such a force could lead to many problems.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor and the Rogue Immortal Lord would also work for the Original God Sharing Association, while the usually lazy Ice Mountain Domineering Lady would be an honorary member, responsible for recruiting various forces near her hometown.</p><p></p><p>The development of the Original God Sharing Association needed to follow two paths.</p><p></p><p>The first path was to use the Divine Flower Association's forum to spread the slogan of the Original God Sharing Association, telling cultivators worldwide that cultivation methods were poisonous, and that they should unite to deal with the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>The second path was to use the Seeking Dao Palace to spread the reputation of the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Even the best wine needs advertising.</p><p></p><p>No matter how competitive the Original God Sharing Association was, what use was it if no one knew about it?</p><p></p><p>"After I post the message, I'll go visit your grandfather," Qi Yuan said to the Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>With the embryonic form of the Original God Sharing Association in place, Qi Yuan prepared to announce on the Divine Flower Association that cultivation methods were poisonous.</p><p></p><p>Then he would visit the Great Sun Flame Emperor's grandfather, Lord Feng, to ask for his help in managing the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan switched to a different account, changing to Blood Robe Sword God's account.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a while, then began to edit the post.</p><p></p><p>[Shocking discovery that will shake the Canglang Realm, the cultivation methods we practice actually have traps!]</p><p></p><p>"I, Blood Robe Sword God, leader of the Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the risk of my life, I will reveal to everyone an earth-shattering matter that concerns the safety of all cultivators in the Canglang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Actually... cultivation methods are poisonous! The methods we have been cultivating are poisonous, and after our strength increases, we will gradually become resources for certain beings.</p><p></p><p>The conspiracy behind this is unimaginable...</p><p></p><p>To solve this problem, I have joined with like-minded friends to create the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>In the Original God Sharing Association, there are non-poisonous cultivation methods..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no pressure writing such a draft.</p><p></p><p>First, a shocking headline to create a horrifying atmosphere and raise the issue, then how to solve the problem, giving specific measures.</p><p></p><p>The specific measure was to establish the Original God Sharing Association, attracting countless people to input their cultivation methods in exchange for non-poisonous ones.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he mentioned the approximate founding time of the Original God Sharing Association and invited everyone to support it.</p><p></p><p>At the very end, Qi Yuan also wrote:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't panic. I, Blood Robe Sword God, dare to take the lead for humanity and swear to defend the Canglang Realm to the death!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this post was published, it stirred up a storm.</p><p></p><p>"Is this real?"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation methods are poisonous? Why haven't I felt anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Become resources? This is too terrifying. If it's all true, isn't our Canglang Realm just someone else's pig farm?"</p><p></p><p>"This must be nonsense, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense... oh, it's Senior Blood Robe Sword God, he's right, cultivation methods are poisonous!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blood Robe Sword God is a Yin Spirit Venerable, if he says so, could it be true!"</p><p></p><p>"How can cultivation methods possibly be poisonous!"</p><p></p><p>Hundreds and thousands of Divine Flower Association members who saw this post were shocked.</p><p></p><p>They expressed doubt about the authenticity of this post.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else saying this, they definitely wouldn't believe it, but this was Blood Robe Sword God saying it. Blood Robe Sword God was a Yin Spirit, why would he need to deceive them like this? What was this for?</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

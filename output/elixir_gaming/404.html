        <h1>Chapter 404</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable was moved, but the words in the Venerable's stomach could not be spoken at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword God invited them to gather, but it wasn't to unite them to fight against the Great Calamity together?</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword God's confident and domineering words lingered in their ears, unable to dissipate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Many Great Venerables felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was their hesitation and self-preservation that had disappointed Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>So, was this why Blood Robe Sword God abandoned everyone and decided to fight the Great Calamity alone?</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God..." Yellow Ox Great Venerable gritted his teeth and said, "My strength is meager, but I am willing to go with you and face the Great Calamity together!"</p><p></p><p>He felt he had lived most of his life, long enough, and it was time to confront the nightmarish Great Calamity, to die in extreme brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Yellow Ox Great Venerable: "You're too far away, you can't reach the Central Heavenly Realm in three days, so don't come with me."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he swept his gaze over everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"You only need to return to your respective realms and announce to the world that 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity' has begun. Don't worry about any anomalies. As for the rest, leave it to me," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer the novice cultivator who had to sneak around at night to destroy the Black Mountain Sect; nor was he the small Core Formation cultivator who had to use various aliases to post and provoke conflicts when destroying the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>He was now ranked among the Purple Mansion great cultivators, able to claim a mountain as his own and establish his own sect in the Azure Waves Realm!</p><p></p><p>This time, he directly declared war, telling the Great Calamity that he, Qi Yuan, was coming to eliminate it.</p><p></p><p>However, he would personally go to destroy the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>It was that simple, that casual!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God has such great confidence, his aura is so strong, he looks like an extraordinary and imposing person at first glance. Being so powerful, he will surely have a different fate than others who resist the Great Calamity," Mixed Poverty Great Venerable said with a grin at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He had only sent an avatar, his true body not revealed, so he was used to acting more freely.</p><p></p><p>His voice, if changed to a female voice, and if he cooperated by turning into a woman, with stars in his eyes, clenching his little fists, and shouting "Big brother is amazing," that flavor would be absolutely perfect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Mixed Poverty Great Venerable: "Why do you speak in such a sarcastic tone? Could it be... you have an affinity with my Yin-Yang Forbidden Realm, destined to be a pile of dog shit in the Yin-Yang Forbidden Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The smile in Mixed Poverty Great Venerable's eyes froze: "People say Blood Robe Sword God is crazy and has killed countless, but it turns out he can understand human speech. I just wonder, after you perish in the Great Calamity, how sad and painful will your parents, relatives, and friends be."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, please, can't villains just cut off their own heads directly? Why do you have to talk so much? Are you paid by the line?" </p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, without any hesitation, a blood-colored giant hand reached out to grab Mixed Poverty Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Mixed Poverty Great Venerable's expression remained unchanged, calm and composed: "Are you already agitated? You don't have the demeanor of a strong person at all."</p><p></p><p>Mixed Poverty Great Venerable waved his sleeve, seemingly unafraid of Qi Yuan's attack.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was merely an avatar projection, not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>As long as he extinguished his consciousness, he could return to his main body.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Waves Realm was so vast, he could hide in a corner, and even if Blood Robe Sword God turned the heavens upside down, he wouldn't be able to find him.</p><p></p><p>However, when that blood-red hand grasped his entire being, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>A strong warning surged forth, he felt like an infant, seemingly held in the palm of a mighty deity.</p><p></p><p>Everything about him seemed to be within the grasp of this blood-robed man before him.</p><p></p><p>"In the Azure Waves Realm, as long as I lay eyes on any evildoer, they cannot escape my grasp. Do you know what the gold content of a Purple Mansion great cultivator means? Die for me!"</p><p></p><p>Within the blood-colored giant hand, blood energy boiled and churned.</p><p></p><p>With a crisp cracking sound, Mixed Poverty Great Venerable's body began to break apart piece by piece.</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Because his consciousness sensed that it wasn't just this avatar breaking apart, but also his main body! His main body was tens of thousands of miles away, in an unfathomable place.</p><p></p><p>There, arrays were laid out, such that even if a mythical being came, they wouldn't be able to penetrate the arrays in a short time.</p><p></p><p>But now... how was this possible!</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blood-robed man with a shocked face, his eyes revealing a pleading expression, along with intense confusion.</p><p></p><p>"How... how did you do this?"</p><p></p><p>As his body shattered, his consciousness also began to crack, blood and soul turning into fragments at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, his expression cold: "Did you think I was just talking when I said I could hit people through the internet?"</p><p></p><p>After destroying the Palace of Light, Qi Yuan had indeed hit people through the internet.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was merely walking the same path as before.</p><p></p><p>What use was distance?</p><p></p><p>Back then, there was even a disciple of the Supreme Radiance Palace who talked tough in the Upper Realm, wasn't he still destroyed by a sun shadow Qi Yuan threw down? As for Mixed Poverty Great Venerable, there was no need for a sun shadow, he was directly crushed.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's current strength as a Purple Mansion great cultivator, to put it bluntly, besides the Great Calamity, who in this Azure Waves Realm could stop him?</p><p></p><p>Mixed Poverty Great Venerable perished, turning into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>This was annihilation at the level of the soul, even if a Great Venerable could be reborn from a drop of blood, he could no longer reappear in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The other Great Venerables who saw this scene also revealed surprised expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yellow Ox Great Venerable trembled and said: "Mixed Poverty Great Venerable... is dead?"</p><p></p><p>This death wasn't just the death of an avatar, but the extinction of the main body as well.</p><p></p><p>The other Great Venerables all sensed this point, while the Yin Spirit Venerables didn't notice, thinking only Mixed Poverty Great Venerable's avatar had died.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clapped his hands, killing Mixed Poverty Great Venerable was just like squashing an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I'll trouble you with the promotion," Qi Yuan's tone became casual and relaxed again.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirit Venerables present all breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"We will vigorously promote 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity'."</p><p></p><p>"Within one day, half the people in the Azure Waves Realm should know of this plan!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blood Robe Sword God, please be careful, the Great Calamity... is not so easy to deal with. Otherwise... the Azure Waves Realm wouldn't still be like a pigsty after so many years!" an old man sighed, his eyes filled with intense longing.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators like them, ascending to the Upper Realm was almost a lifelong desire.</p><p></p><p>In the Lower Realm, they were restricted, unable to obtain sufficient celestial essence to nourish their divine bodies, like living in a sewer.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, no more nonsense, I've already personally written the promotional copy, you just need to copy and paste it to send out. You promote the plan, I'll implement it, bye! Oh right, rectifying the cultivation atmosphere of the Azure Waves Realm is everyone's responsibility, starting with me!"</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure also disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Left in the room were Great Venerables and Venerables with bewildered, confused, and complex emotions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Can Blood Robe Sword God really do it?"</p><p></p><p>"That's the Great Calamity... the Great Calamity that even Yang Spirits couldn't destroy!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Central Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a tavern, surprise appeared in a young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"There are still hundreds of years before the Great Calamity begins, yet the Azure Waves Realm has declared war on the Great Calamity in advance. How dare they, why don't they accumulate more strength first!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What? War has been declared? Why would war be declared?" The female cultivator beside him also looked surprised.</p><p></p><p>The two of them came from the Star Departure Realm. Like the Azure Waves Realm, the Star Departure Realm was one of the Three Thousand Realms that had fallen from the Great Radiance Palace to the lower realms.</p><p></p><p>The Star Departure Realm was more powerful compared to the Azure Waves Realm. </p><p></p><p>In the past, three Yang Spirit experts had emerged together to fight against the Great Calamity, but unfortunately... they were ultimately defeated disastrously.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators of the Star Departure Realm have always made it their mission to resist the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators even left their own world to go to other enclosed worlds, to contact powerful experts and resist the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>But the results have been minimal.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Great Venerable White Fish? But that's not his style either!" Wang Lingshan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable White Fish was openly the number one expert in the Azure Waves Realm. Resisting the Great Calamity should have been his proposal.</p><p></p><p>"It's not him, it's the Blood Robe Sword Saint, a powerful expert who has emerged in the last two years.</p><p></p><p>Strange, there are very few records of him, and I always feel... this resistance against the Great Calamity seems a bit farcical, as if... it's a joke.</p><p></p><p>How can one resist the Great Calamity like this?" Wang Lingtong spoke, with a hint of helplessness in his tone.</p><p></p><p>He handed a few jade slips to Wang Lingshan.</p><p></p><p>These jade slips were similar to those of organizations like the Divine Flower Society, and one of them happened to be from the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>Many messages would be announced on them.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingshan's divine sense probed into them, and her expression also became strange.</p><p></p><p>[One day equals a hundred years, solving the Great Calamity is at hand!]</p><p></p><p>[Qi Yuan eliminates the Great Calamity, Azure Waves gains new life!]</p><p></p><p>[Rather go to the underworld than not eliminate the Great Calamity!]</p><p></p><p>[Great Calamity eliminated, customs rectified, Azure Waves' spiritual energy soars!]</p><p></p><p>[Qi Yuan is strong, Great Calamity surrenders, hit the wall for Qi Yuan!]</p><p></p><p>Looking at these declarations, Wang Lingshan was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... real or fake!"</p><p></p><p>"This is too ridiculous, it's like a farce.</p><p></p><p>Won't doing this provoke the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, if he can eliminate the Great Calamity, our Star Departure Realm must provide some help.</p><p></p><p>Even if he ultimately fails, taking a bite out of the Great Calamity is still good!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in various regions of the Azure Waves Realm, whether in immortal cultivation worlds or mortal worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now, the hottest topic was "Qi Yuan eliminates the Great Calamity".</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Flower Society, countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What, we're starting to eliminate the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"Are the cultivation methods really poisonous? I don't feel anything."</p><p></p><p>"Last night I was discussing matters in my third aunt's cousin's boudoir, she said the cultivation methods are only poisonous to those Yin Spirit bigwigs, it has nothing to do with us!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, how could we small fry catch the eye of the Great Calamity? Now forcing us to resist the Great Calamity, if it angers the Great Calamity, how will we deal with being implicated?"</p><p></p><p>"You have no heart. If the cultivation methods are poisonous, our lives are in others' hands, is that good? If our descendants are born, they will also become fodder. Do you want such things to happen?"</p><p></p><p>"If you put it that way, doesn't that mean... even if this Qi Yuan defeats the Great Calamity, we might still die?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is this person called Qi Yuan? It's similar to the name of that number one Purple Mansion expert from Divine Light Sect last time. It can't be the same person, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It's normal to have the same name, how could one person be both a Purple Mansion and at least a Great Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Various places were abuzz with discussions about Qi Yuan eliminating the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Even the isolated Divine Light Sect learned of this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, no one associated this Qi Yuan who was eliminating the Great Calamity with the Qi Yuan from Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Even though True Lord Withered Wood knew Qi Yuan was extraordinary, and Kang Fulu understood Qi Yuan was much stronger than imagined.</p><p></p><p>But in their eyes, eliminating the Great Calamity was almost equivalent to opposing the Heavenly Dao, which was something Qi Yuan could not achieve.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Original God Sharing Society, Jiang Lingsu held the Divine Flower Society's jade slip with an angry face: "Damn it, these people are really disgusting. It's fine if they don't support, but they even slander!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the voices online, he couldn't be bothered to manage them.</p><p></p><p>Believe that after the Great Calamity is destroyed, with his existence, the atmosphere in the Azure Waves Realm will get better and better.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, just report those who post nonsense to Little Fox Girl," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm still angry!" Jiang Lingsu said furiously.</p><p></p><p>She had already switched several alternate accounts to speak up for Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she alone couldn't out-curse so many people.</p><p></p><p>"These people should go to hell!" Jiang Lingsu said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu's angry and cute appearance and smiled: "Perhaps... they will all go to hell?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu's heart suddenly tightened, feeling a bit painful. She quickly said: "Pei pei pei, don't say such discouraging things. The Great Calamity must be destroyed, and you, Senior Brother, will be safe and sound!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, hell is my home. Even if we go to hell, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you had that weird painter draw the underworld last time." Jiang Lingsu tilted her head, thinking of something and saying.</p><p></p><p>"There's also that piece of land in the underworld where you invested in me, remember?" Qi Yuan's gaze was relaxed.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning in Divine Light Sect, Qi Yuan's cultivation methods and spirit stones, apart from coming from Moonlight, came from his busty little junior sister.</p><p></p><p>A blush spread across Jiang Lingsu's pretty face. She thought of something and tugged at Qi Yuan's clothes, her gaze sincere: "Senior Brother, this time... you must must be careful. If... there's even the slightest chance you can't defeat the Great Calamity, just run away!"</p><p></p><p>She knew Senior Brother was formidable.</p><p></p><p>But in the past, she had also glimpsed a corner of the Great Calamity through her family's supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>That kind of power was invincible.</p><p></p><p>She simply couldn't imagine how Senior Brother could defeat it. After all, just over two years ago, she was still nervously tailing enemies with Senior Brother, and in the end Senior Brother had to use a kitchen knife to ambush and kill a Foundation Establishment enemy.</p><p></p><p>Now, openly declaring war on the Great Calamity, she felt a sense of being in a different world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she recalled the dense killing intent that used to be on Senior Brother's body, and a hint of tenderness flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>How hard Senior Brother must have worked, how much suffering he must have endured, to reach this point today.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she knew nothing about any of that.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, as long as the plan is successfully formulated, I will definitely make it happen! I could destroy the Palace of Light, what's a mere Great Calamity!" Qi Yuan said passionately.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu: "...Senior Brother, you'd better not say anything more. I'm worried about your mental state."</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light was strong, but compared to the Great Calamity, it was as fragile as an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, I believe in you!" Jiang Lingsu clenched her fists, her expression excited, "I support you both mentally and physically!"</p><p></p><p>But as soon as she said it, her face turned red again.</p><p></p><p>How to support physically?</p><p></p><p>However, seeing that Senior Brother didn't seem to notice the flaw in her words, she breathed a sigh of relief, with a hint of small disappointment in it.</p><p></p><p>She decided to register a few more alternate accounts to curse those who dared to speak ill of Senior Brother until they doubted their existence!

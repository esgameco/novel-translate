        <h1>Chapter 412</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Floating Sky City, the Demon Lord's Sacred Tower was like the countryside versus the city.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy was also much more abundant.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people living in the Demon Lord's Sacred Tower could increase their lifespan by nearly double.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Qi Yuan used celestial spiritual energy to cleanse his body, making his skin increasingly snow-white and crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of whiteness was different from Ning Tao's cold white skin - it was more like pure and unblemished.</p><p></p><p>This made Jiang Lingsu stare enviously beside him: "I want to become a Yin Spirit too!"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan with both admiration and a sense of shame. </p><p></p><p>After all, her skin was indeed not as good as Qi Yuan's now.</p><p></p><p>"Now that you're here, focus on cultivating well," Qi Yuan said, patting Jiang Lingsu's hair.</p><p></p><p>The group of three also arrived at one of the floors of the Demon Lord's Sacred Tower, called the Domain Gathering Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This floor was the most prosperous in the Demon Lord's Sacred Tower, and also had the most visiting cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many holy lands from other heavenly realms, or from the Fifth Heavenly Realm, had outposts on this floor.</p><p></p><p>The area where the Demon Lord clan resided produced Milo Light, which was very valuable and could be used to expand divine domains. For Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable, it also had considerable uses, seemingly related to illuminating the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, those major powers all established outposts in the Demon Lord clan's territory and arranged people to collect Milo Light.</p><p></p><p>Now, walking in the Domain Gathering Heaven, streams of light flashed by from time to time, emanating powerful auras.</p><p></p><p>In the giant city, Qi Yuan and his two companions traversed through, their expressions calm.</p><p></p><p>This giant city was the central city of the Domain Gathering Heaven, with outposts of major holy lands from various heavenly realms within.</p><p></p><p>"Futu Mountain is so low-class, they don't even have an outpost here," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Futu Mountain is only a holy land of the Second Heavenly Realm, so it's... normal that they don't have an outpost," God of No God laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Futu Mountain only had one Yang Spirit, and only at the Heavenly Rank, so how could they extend their reach to the Demon Lord clan?</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to choose a stronger power to join this time," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Wandering aimlessly in the Demon Lord's Sacred Tower was ultimately not good, as it was easy to attract attention.</p><p></p><p>Especially since he would be doing some big things later, which would definitely draw the notice of some Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Casually joining a power as an honorary disciple not only allowed him to freeload on lodging and food, but perhaps his efforts and talent would catch the eye of some great principle sugar mommy, which would be fantastic.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, having a power would be good for settling his junior sister and God of No God.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood on a tower, gazing at a wall in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The wall was covered with many "recruitment advertisements", with many cultivators viewing them below.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyun Mountain is recruiting three Yin Spirit honorary disciples, Great Venerable preferred, salary negotiable. </p><p>Also recruiting several Purple Palace warriors, one celestial jade per decade of service."</p><p></p><p>"Jade Immortal Gate recruiting Purple Palace attendants..."</p><p></p><p>"Tai Huang Palace recruiting attendants, cultivation requirement: Mythical realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Black Magic Abyss..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes fell on Tai Huang Palace's "recruitment ad", but then he thought it was better to stay away from that one for now.</p><p></p><p>"In this Demon Lord's Sacred Tower, there are outposts for four holy lands from the Sixth Heavenly Realm.</p><p>The rest are mostly holy lands from the Fifth Heavenly Realm.</p><p>As for the Fourth Heavenly Realm and below, there are even fewer," God of No God was still trying to prove his relevance.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had been looked down upon by Qi Yuan earlier for not seeming like a native of the immortal realm, so now he had to show his familiarity.</p><p></p><p>He did know about those famous major powers of the Sixth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of the Black Magic Abyss?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>God of No God's expression became solemn, then he said: "Each top holy land in the Sixth Heavenly Realm has its own unique aspects.</p><p>The unique aspect of the Black Magic Abyss is that they have many Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables at the Great Principle realm.</p><p>As for exactly how many, this junior doesn't know.</p><p>Because of this, the factions within the Black Magic Abyss are complex and intertwined, with many factions even hostile to each other.</p><p>But even so, the Black Magic Abyss is definitely among the top ten major powers in the Sixth Heavenly Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So many ideal women?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, but then he calmed down again.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even met them yet, so it wasn't good to think of them as ideal women. That would make his ideal women seem cheap.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cultured-looking cultivator approached from the side, his eyes seemingly carrying a hint of arrogance: "Fellow Daoist, you must be from a lower heavenly realm. Wanting to become an honorary disciple of the Black Magic Abyss is not so simple."</p><p></p><p>This cultivator was named Ji Buping, originally from the Fifth Heavenly Realm. He had a sense of superiority towards cultivators from lower realms.</p><p></p><p>So when he spoke to Qi Yuan, he deliberately emphasized the words "lower heavenly realm".</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist has good eyesight. I'm from the Second Heavenly Realm and accidentally entered a secret realm, ending up here without even enough celestial jade to get home. I have no choice but to find some work to earn travel expenses to return home," Qi Yuan replied. "May I ask what's not simple about becoming an honorary disciple of the Black Magic Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>This was the persona he had established for himself - an elder from Futu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Magic Abyss is an extremely exclusive holy land that values bloodline above all," Ji Buping said, flipping his hair to casually reveal a black mark by his ear. "See this? My bloodline would be good enough to be an... steward even in the Sixth Heavenly Realm's Black Magic Abyss. Too bad I don't have a Sky-Reaching Jade, so I can't reach the Sixth Heavenly Realm."</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping greatly yearned for the Sixth Heavenly Realm's Black Magic Abyss and wanted to go there.</p><p></p><p>In his view, with his bloodline level, he would definitely live the good life if he went to the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a Sky-Reaching Jade either," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Ji Buping continue proudly: "The Black Magic Abyss bloodline is one of the most precious bloodlines in the Sixth Heavenly Realm.</p><p>Their bloodlines are further divided into grades one through nine, with grade one being the highest and grade nine the lowest.</p><p>I humbly possess a grade four bloodline, just short of being a high-grade bloodline. Too bad my mother's bloodline was a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping said with a sigh, looking at Qi Yuan: "You don't have the Black Magic Abyss bloodline, so you can't become an honorary disciple of the Black Magic Abyss."</p><p></p><p>Though he sighed, there was still a hint of superiority in his tone.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, a playful voice suddenly rang out: "Who says he can't join the Black Magic Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>A woman in a purple robe appeared, with a graceful figure. But what attracted the most attention were the two horns on her head, resembling the Ox Demon King's bull horns, looking indestructible.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes flashing with sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping saw the newcomer with a shocked expression. He couldn't see through her identity or strength and was extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>"Handsome fellow Daoist, care to exchange contact jade slips?" the purple-robed woman spoke, her voice quite flirtatious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Was he being asked for his "WeChat"?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, being handsome was troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"I rarely give out my contact information on first meetings," Qi Yuan said very reservedly and traditionally conservative.</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me, I'll help you become an honorary disciple of the Black Magic Abyss!" The purple-robed woman's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's nose didn't grow longer, indicating the purple-robed woman was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Horn Sister, here's my contact info. You can save me as... Blood Robe!" Qi Yuan changed his tune very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping saw this and his expression changed repeatedly. He somewhat disbelieved the purple-robed woman's words.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Magic Abyss valued bloodline above all. Even for an outpost recruiting honorary disciples to collect Milo Light, bloodline was required.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman's eyebrows</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Mao Wei jumped: "I like that title, it's catchy."</p><p></p><p>She was referring to being called Sister Ox Horn.</p><p></p><p>"This is my token. Take it to Black Magic Abyss and you can directly become an honorary guest," the woman in purple robes said straightforwardly, taking out a jade tablet.</p><p></p><p>When Ji Buping saw that jade tablet, his expression changed slightly and his body involuntarily hunched over.</p><p></p><p>Because that jade tablet was actually black.</p><p></p><p>Black represented preciousness in Black Magic Abyss. Only core members would have black jade tablets.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sister Ox Horn," Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>No wonder people say beauty alone is a disaster, but combined with other things, it becomes lethal.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman's gaze shifted to Jiang Lingsu, looking her up and down repeatedly: "Is this your concubine?"</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was a bit like a villain in a TV show hitting on the female lead, then looking at the male lead with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had originally been hugging Qi Yuan, but felt uncomfortable under this scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>Especially hearing the content of the purple-robed woman's words, she felt both angry and somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... no, she's not."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. Other than having big breasts, she doesn't have any other merits."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman spoke very simply and directly, and quite rudely.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's face instantly turned completely red.</p><p></p><p>However, she knew this was the upper realm, and she couldn't recklessly lose her temper and bring trouble to her senior brother.</p><p></p><p>I'll endure it!</p><p></p><p>Endure!</p><p></p><p>"Lingsu is a very good person," Qi Yuan said gently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, most of Jiang Lingsu's anger dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Are you interested in becoming my concubine?" the purple-robed woman looked at Qi Yuan and said shockingly.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, sorry, I'm not into that," Qi Yuan flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman looked at Qi Yuan with an amused smile: "Man, you'll know my power and charm later!"</p><p></p><p>She spoke like a female version of an overbearing CEO.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, she winked flirtatiously at Qi Yuan, then disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>"Young Mistress, was there anything special about that human cultivator just now?" </p><p></p><p>A voice transmission fell into the purple-robed woman's ear, filled with obvious curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"He has our Black Magic Abyss bloodline, and... the concentration is no less than mine." A curious look flashed in the purple-robed woman's eyes as she stretched out her hand, revealing a mark on her fair arm. "The Devil Sky Mark is flickering. He'd make a good concubine!"</p><p></p><p>"His bloodline is so noble!" The purple-robed woman's guardian was incredibly shocked. "How could Black Magic Abyss let such a bloodline leak out? Which branch is he from?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian was extremely astonished.</p><p></p><p>In the upper realm, Black Magic Abyss was fanatical and obsessive about bloodlines, almost to the point of madness.</p><p></p><p>When some babies were born, if they were detected to have an extremely precious bloodline, their family would directly rise in social class.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if these babies were ordinary mortals, they would be treated like gods in Black Magic Abyss. Once they advanced to the Yin Spirit realm, they would be treated at the level of Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the core bloodlines of Black Magic Abyss almost never leaked out.</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in the purple-robed woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because the Devil Sky Mark had not determined which bloodline that handsome male cultivator came from.</p><p></p><p>"Which branch he's from doesn't matter. What's important is that I discovered him, so... he belongs to my branch. Tell me, how should I win him over so he's willing to be my concubine?"</p><p></p><p>"This... With Young Mistress's charm and power, winning that man over should be no problem. However, should this servant investigate his identity and background thoroughly?" the guardian spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No need." The purple-robed woman shook her head. "It's a pity, I have to go find the Morning Star Emerald Blood Beast, otherwise I'd take him back to the Sixth Heaven right now."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman had come from the Sixth Heaven to the Moluo clan in search of the Morning Star Emerald Blood Beast.</p><p></p><p>This special exotic beast would be of great help in improving her bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan held the pitch-black jade tablet, his eyes filled with a smile: "Black Magic Abyss really is easy to enter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this from not far away, Ji Buping felt extremely jealous, but didn't dare show it, after all he would offend an important figure from Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He had always admired and revered Black Magic Abyss. Even the rats that ran out of there were a cut above him.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, fellow Daoist!" Ji Buping sourly congratulated him, then disappeared without lingering.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Jiang Lingsu was now clenching her little fists, feeling extremely depressed. She sighed and said: "Senior Brother, you were right, I was being narcissistic. There are no second-generation rich kids in this immortal realm who would take a fancy to me and cause you trouble. Instead, it's you, Senior Brother, who was taken a fancy to by a second-generation rich kid, coming to cause me trouble. Is this what it feels like to be looked down upon and despised?"</p><p></p><p>It was Jiang Lingsu's first time experiencing this kind of treatment, and she was starting to doubt herself.</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? You're not the protagonist in a TV drama. This kind of thing is a low probability event," Qi Yuan shrugged. "Come on, let's go to Black Magic Abyss's base. It's time to freeload some food and drink."</p><p></p><p>"No, this time I have to cultivate properly and strive to reach the Yin Spirit realm!" Jiang Lingsu gritted her teeth, then immediately looked dejected again. "Sigh, my talent is too poor. Yin Spirit is so difficult."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With the purple-robed woman's jade tablet, Qi Yuan's entry into the Black Magic Abyss base and becoming an honorary guest went smoothly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the background check on Qi Yuan wasn't done seriously, which saved Qi Yuan from having to use the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra to muddle through.</p><p></p><p>At the base, Qi Yuan also ran into Ji Buping.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping was quite embarrassed, and still somewhat jealous in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because he had a fourth-grade bloodline and became a Mysterious level honorary guest.</p><p></p><p>While Qi Yuan, because of the token, was an Earth level honorary guest, one rank higher than him in status.</p><p></p><p>This made him a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't care about any of this at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked at Jiang Lingsu and suddenly had an idea: "What do you think about me putting on a tattoo sticker to pretend to have a high-grade bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan noticed that these Black Magic Abyss cultivators always had some kind of mark on their bodies, symbolizing their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Black Magic Abyss cultivators went out, the Moluo clan cultivators from this Moluo Sacred Tower treated them like gods.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Black Magic Abyss cultivators enjoyed superior "foreign lord" treatment among the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was half a "foreign lord". If he wore a tattoo sticker, wouldn't he be able to act arrogant?</p><p></p><p>Due to the Tai Huang Palace mark, Jiang Lingsu couldn't be separated too far from Qi Yuan, so the two of them lived in the same cave dwelling, sleeping in different rooms.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of mark? Where would you put it?" Jiang Lingsu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"How about a crescent moon? On the forehead?" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I think that works."</p><p></p><p>"No, my face is too white. I can't imitate Bao Zheng," Qi Yuan shook his head, but then thought of something and a curious expression appeared on his face. "But I might not need to pretend. I seem to have a bloodline similar to Black Magic Abyss in my body. Where did it come from?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit curious.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when that purple-robed woman struck up a conversation, Qi Yuan knew she wasn't so shallow as to just be interested in his face.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could people in the upper realm be so stupid? So he had openly eavesdropped on her conversation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

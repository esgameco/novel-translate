        <h1>Chapter 369</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Immediately, several titled Martial Lords came forward.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly an honor for the Eastern Alliance to have you join us," said the leader, an elderly man with flowing white hair and several antlers growing from his head, giving him a rather immortal-like appearance.</p><p></p><p>Before the Ancient Martial Lord brought Qi Yuan back, he had already informed the others about Qi Yuan's situation.</p><p></p><p>This Eastern Alliance stronghold had three titled Martial Lords and over a hundred regular Martial Lords. </p><p></p><p>The lower-ranked Martial Lords stood in the back, with the Great Martial Lords in front and ordinary Martial Lords at the very back, not even qualified to greet Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These ordinary Martial Lords looked at Qi Yuan with awe and admiration in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask your name? I am Black Deer," said the old man.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the old man and said coolly, "Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"So it's Martial Lord Qi Yuan!" Black Deer Martial Lord said politely.</p><p></p><p>At this time, among the group of Martial Lords, one transmitted a message:</p><p></p><p>"Stacked Cat, this esteemed one has the same name as the person you're looking for. Could it be him? Hehe, want to go ask?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, the one I'm looking for is just a small Martial King, how could he possibly be a titled Martial Lord? Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just joking, don't be angry. But what if the Qi Yuan you're looking for really is this esteemed one? What would you do?"</p><p></p><p>"What else could I do? I'd directly strip away that part of the bloodline."</p><p></p><p>The two conversed secretly.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord looked at Qi Yuan: "I heard that Mr. Qi Yuan has been searching for information about Spirit Realm Martial Lords. The Eastern Alliance's library contains all the books in the world, with records of many secrets. Would Mr. Qi like to take a look? Perhaps there are records about Spirit Realm Martial Lords that you need?"</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord continued to show goodwill.</p><p></p><p>"No need to look, there's nothing in there," Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Alliance's library had already been thoroughly searched by Old Thunder God Lei and the others. It contained all sorts of secrets, just not about Spirit Realm Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord was briefly stunned, then smiled and said, "Mr. Qi seems quite familiar with our Eastern Alliance library."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I have people who have already searched the entire library. Didn't find anything," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord couldn't help but look at Fat Egg Martial Lord with a meaningful gaze. </p><p></p><p>Fat Egg Martial Lord was confused by this look.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't care about these small gestures and said, "Can I ask about the Eastern Lord's Wall in advance?"</p><p></p><p>"I apologize, it's not that we're unwilling, but we truly cannot. Only after the Ancestral Blood War ends can one see the Eastern Lord's Wall," Black Deer Martial Lord said with an apologetic expression.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked somewhat disappointed. "By the way, what kind of person is the Eastern Lord? Have you met him?"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Eastern Lord, many of the Martial Lords present showed expressions of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when black crows filled the sky and the world was on the brink of destruction, the Eastern Lord stepped forward. He single-handedly fought against the calamity, turning the tide in a desperate situation and seeking a glimmer of hope for us all. The Eastern Lord is a true gentleman, one of the few sages in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord's eyes were full of admiration. This kind of admiration couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Eastern Lord has a lover?" Qi Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering whether the man and woman in the mural were the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Lord not only has great righteousness and love, but is also a passionate lover. The Eastern Lord is not originally from this world. His lover was born in this world, which is why he came here. When the calamity struck, his lover perished. He could have left this world, avoiding entanglement and karma. But to protect his lover's world, he still chose to stay here and single-handedly resist the calamity. If it weren't for the Eastern Lord, we would have long since perished and disappeared into the river of history," Black Deer Martial Lord said, his voice rather desolate.</p><p></p><p>The female titled Martial Lord beside him said, "If it were me, I don't think I could do that. I would probably just take the body and leave, staying far away from the vortex."</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord nodded: "Over these years, the Eastern Lord has not only resisted the calamity alone but also created the Mountains and Seas Scroll with the Pen of Mountains, Rivers, and Society. This was all to revive his soulmate. As long as his soulmate is revived, the two of them together can resist the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How to revive? I'm very interested," Qi Yuan said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>He currently wanted to cultivate to the Purple Palace Realm. He had the purple qi, but still lacked the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>Regarding how to revive someone, he had no clue at all.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit of the Eastern Lord's soulmate is scattered throughout the Mountains and Seas Scroll. The Mountains and Seas Scroll is the key to reviving the Eastern Lord's soulmate, and also the key to reshaping the world. We repeatedly re-enact past history, gradually awakening the memories of the Eastern Lord's soulmate, or rather, reconstructing past memories. But the Eastern Lord's soulmate is too powerful, and the beings within the Mountains and Seas Scroll cannot bear it. So, the spirit of the Eastern Lord's soulmate has also been divided into many parts. Each part awakens past memories and re-enacts the original path. Finally, before the Dawn's Call begins, the Mountains and Seas Scroll will collide with the Land of Endings. All the spirits will merge into one, and the Eastern Lord's soulmate will be revived. The history restarted within the Mountains and Seas Scroll will also replace the history of the Land of Endings. The history of this world will change. Those who died in the past will also be revived."</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord said a lot.</p><p></p><p>This was quite complex.</p><p></p><p>According to him, the Eastern Lord's plan had two parts: one was to revive his soulmate, and the other was to let those who perished in the past be revived in the Mountains and Seas Scroll, re-enact their lives, and finally truly revive.</p><p></p><p>The merged history of the Mountains and Seas Scroll would replace this world's predetermined doomed historical trajectory.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so it's like making the fake real, similar to cloning? Implanting memories?" Qi Yuan summarized.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was like cloning a group of people, then having them act out a TV show. Once they had their original memories, they would consider themselves to be the people they were portraying.</p><p></p><p>"But in that case... wouldn't the beings in the Land of Endings perish?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"When the Dawn's Call sounds, this world will truly fall silent, and they cannot avoid it," Black Deer Martial Lord said.</p><p></p><p>The female Martial Lord said, "If one could meet a man like the Eastern Lord, life would have no regrets."</p><p></p><p>A male Martial Lord sighed, "Guarding a world, planning for ten thousand years, all to revive a lover. This relationship is truly unforgettable."</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords had similar thoughts.</p><p></p><p>They questioned whether they could do what the Eastern Lord had done if it were them.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's very touching. They should be buried one at the North Pole and one at the South Pole," Qi Yuan casually quipped.</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean?" Black Deer Martial Lord asked, confused.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing," Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi Yuan, come, the Eastern Alliance has prepared a welcoming feast for you!" Black Deer Martial Lord emerged from his previous reminiscence and returned to the matter at hand.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Qi Yuan didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes, his gaze showing rare confusion.</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult, too difficult. Establishing the Netherworld is too hard, even harder than advanced mathematics."</p><p></p><p>After hearing about how the Eastern Lord used the Mountains and Seas Scroll to revive his soulmate, Qi Yuan had been thinking about whether he could learn from it to create the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he simulated it, the result was always... fake. What he created, in anime terms, would be nothing more than two similar flowers.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm still too..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Weakened, not to mention turning the false into reality, I can't even achieve true resurrection. Does this mean I can only create a low-budget version of the underworld?" Qi Yuan felt somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>He was already a Divine Infant True Lord living in a bungalow. How embarrassing would it be to create a cheap version of the underworld? His junior sister Jiang Lingsu would probably look down on him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll have to extort this game."</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Flowing Wind Realm or Mortal Heart Realm, Qi Yuan often extorted the Heavenly Dao and reaped considerable rewards.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, then became disappointed again. </p><p></p><p>"This damn world has no Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Without a Heavenly Dao, how could he extort anything?</p><p></p><p>As for taking its place? Forget it, he wasn't interested in that.</p><p></p><p>"But I can discuss it with my daughter sometime. She visualized Houtu, so she should know a lot about the underworld," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord!" Just then, a voice called out.</p><p></p><p>A headless, burly figure appeared, standing beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he was trying hard to suppress it, Qi Yuan could still sense that powerful, surging fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>If left unchecked, allowing that fighting spirit to surge forth, all the living beings in the Origin Land would likely explode and die.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that each of Qi Yuan's current Divine Infants had the ability to swallow up the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>However, in front of Qi Yuan, they remained respectful, just like back in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sovereign Lingzhong, you've come. How did your discussion go?" Qi Yuan looked at the headless ancient god.</p><p></p><p>[The passage continues with more dialogue and descriptions of various divine beings and their abilities.]</p>

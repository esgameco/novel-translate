        <h1>Chapter 253</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qinghong City, where flying ships dock.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Flower Emperors, strictly speaking, gathered together for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor wore a golden robe, looking extraordinarily handsome with a scholarly air. He looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Celestial Lord is indeed as stunningly handsome as the legends say."</p><p></p><p>"The Rogue Immortal Lord looks a bit shabby, with much room for improvement," the Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady chimed in from the side.</p><p></p><p>She was a tall woman with a pretty face, but her eyes gave off an extremely rugged impression.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Divine Flower Emperors have finally gathered here. Today is a day worth commemorating, and an important day for the Azure Waves Realm!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Lord, do you have some plan again?" Seeing Qi Yuan speak like this, the Rogue Immortal Lord beside him excitedly asked.</p><p></p><p>He thought Qi Yuan had some idea, like establishing some power base. </p><p></p><p>If so, by following along, he might be able to profit greatly.</p><p></p><p>"...No," Qi Yuan pondered for a moment, then shook his head and replied, "I just felt that this scene and atmosphere was suitable for saying such words."</p><p></p><p>As for the content of the words and the meaning expressed, was it important?</p><p></p><p>Just like in the Mortal Heart Realm, before every banquet, Qi Yuan would deliver a long speech of sentiments.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Great Sun Flame Emperor on the scene felt it was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady spoke up at this time: "If you want to do business, this old lady can invest 3 million spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>Hehe, these spirit stones were all earned from the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Qi Yuan had formulated a plan to overthrow the Palace of Light in 100 days.</p><p></p><p>He notified the Four Divine Flower Emperors and invited them to borrow high-interest loans from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Palace of Light was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, those high-interest loans didn't need to be repaid.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was extremely envious: "I'm so jealous. Unfortunately, those pure moonlight from the Palace of Light were really... too fragile. With one of my Solar Golden Core attacks, they all turned to nothingness, leaving behind no spirit stones or techniques for me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the other three of the Four Divine Flower Emperors all fell silent briefly.</p><p></p><p>The three couldn't help but raise their heads to look at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw that in the sky, there were two more dazzling round suns surrounding the sun in the center.</p><p></p><p>The scorching sun hung high, shining down.</p><p></p><p>Even separated by an unknown distance, one could still feel the terrifying nature of that sun.</p><p></p><p>Such terrifying celestial bodies... seemed to be Qi Yuan's Golden Cores.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, when they first had this guess, they were shocked themselves, thinking it was absurd.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could there be someone in the world who could condense the sun into a Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Lord, there's been another sun in the sky recently. Is that also your Golden Core?" the Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady asked from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my third Golden Core is also in the process of condensing. It should be successful before long," Qi Yuan said, his face full of vigor, "As long as I'm given time, all the stars in this vast sky will become my Golden Cores, illuminating in all directions!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>Given enough time, his Solar Golden Cores would devour more suns and other stars.</p><p></p><p>Countless Golden Core projections would appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps later on, Qi Yuan would even devour black holes and other celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>That would be even more interesting.</p><p></p><p>"I don't ask for the sun. If only I had a star of my own," the Rogue Immortal Lord couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady laughed: "That's simple. Just cling tightly to the Origin Celestial Lord's thigh. Then one day, when you cultivate to the Seven Steps to Heaven, the Origin Celestial Lord might reward you with a star to illuminate the universe."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor also laughed, with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Because what the Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady said was true.</p><p></p><p>With the Origin Celestial Lord's terrifying talent, becoming a legendary Yang Spirit was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Origin Celestial Lord could overcome the great calamity, then... anything was possible.</p><p></p><p>They just needed to cling tightly to Qi Yuan's thigh, and they might truly have a chance to illuminate the universe.</p><p></p><p>Was clinging to someone's thigh shameful? Not at all.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Celestial Lord had clearly stated many times in the group chat that he always wanted to cling to a rich lady's thigh.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, in the future we won't be the Four Divine Flower Emperors, but... the Four Emperors of the Azure Waves Realm!" the Rogue Immortal Lord said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators walking nearby seemed to have overheard their conversation, and all revealed puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>"These four all look quite good, but... they're so crazy."</p><p></p><p>"They dare to dream of illuminating the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others paid no attention to these people's reactions.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor gave those people a faint glance.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, hearing such a conversation, he would probably have felt the same as these people in his heart, not believing it at all, and even secretly mocking them harshly.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed.</p><p></p><p>He thought back to when he first saw Qi Yuan's post, was amazed, invited him into the group chat, and chatted casually together.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that such an ordinary thing would become the greatest opportunity of his life.</p><p></p><p>"I've reserved a private room on the top floor of the Immortal Viewing Tower to welcome you three. Come, let's eat and chat," </p><p></p><p>the Great Sun Flame Emperor spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Everyone got into a cloud rabbit carriage together and slowly headed towards the Immortal Viewing Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Viewing Tower was the most famous restaurant in Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>This tower gathered all kinds of spirit foods, delicacies, immortal dew, and jade liquor.</p><p></p><p>The cost of eating once in the Immortal Viewing Tower started at a thousand spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Many second-generation immortals would choose to meet guests and gather at the Immortal Viewing Tower.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Immortal-Viewing Tower had nine floors in total, representing the nine levels of heaven.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Solar Flame Emperor and Origin Celestial Venerable and others had just alighted from the cloud rabbit carriage, an ordinary-looking waiter with a face full of smiles approached.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guests, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Following the waiter, the four entered the first floor of the Immortal-Viewing Tower. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the scene before their eyes transformed. Everywhere was glazed tiles and jade tiles, light gauze and thin silk. A faint fragrance permeated the air, quite pleasant to smell.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the wealth gap in the Azure Waves Realm is too large. We don't have restaurants like the Immortal-Viewing Tower in our Great Shang," Qi Yuan couldn't help but lament.</p><p></p><p>Big places are indeed big places.</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman laughed: "How about I invest some money and build an Immortal-Viewing Tower in your Great Shang, and give it to you?"</p><p></p><p>The waiter in front heard this and inwardly sneered, but didn't show it, still smiling and welcoming.</p><p></p><p>"No need, building an Immortal-Viewing Tower is too boring. Why not build a Dao-Seeking Palace instead?" Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>He was eager to get his hands on the techniques and secret manuals of the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the waiter in front finally couldn't help but laugh: "Esteemed guests... you really do speak amusingly."</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't know about the Dao-Seeking Palace?</p><p></p><p>It could be said that a big reason why Qinghong City was so prosperous was because the Dao-Seeking Palace of the Three Realms was established here.</p><p></p><p>To think of building a Dao-Seeking Palace, they really dared to imagine.</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman frowned, pondering seriously: "Building a Dao-Seeking Palace is indeed feasible, but I'm afraid this old lady's spirit stones are not enough."</p><p></p><p>Even if what Origin Celestial Venerable said was nonsense, it had deep meaning for the Four Divine Flower Emperors.</p><p></p><p>After all, would such a big shot speak nonsense?</p><p></p><p>The waiter stopped talking, unable to keep up with these four people's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the other three entered a private room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "What do you think the Dao-Seeking Palace is worth? How about I buy it out?"</p><p></p><p>The Dao-Seeking Palace gathered almost all the Purple Mansion Perfected cultivators of the Three Realms, and many Purple Mansion cultivators had joined as ordinary members.</p><p></p><p>These Purple Mansion cultivators gathered together in order to break through to the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there were many techniques in the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>"This... should be an astronomical figure." Rogue Immortal Venerable swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, following big shots was amazing. They casually talked about building an Immortal-Viewing Tower or buying out the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>As a small newcomer, he couldn't participate in such high-end topics at all.</p><p></p><p>"Can't afford it," said Ice Mountain Domineering Woman. "Even if we had enough spirit stones, they wouldn't sell."</p><p></p><p>How could such an organization package itself up and sell to someone?</p><p></p><p>The Great Solar Flame Emperor pondered for a moment, then said: "The Celestial Venerable is in great need of techniques. The Dao-Seeking Palace is a good source. There's another path the Celestial Venerable can consider."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What path?" asked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Venerable should know that the Dao-Seeking Palace here is controlled by Martial Monarch Great Venerable behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>However, before this, the one who controlled the local Dao-Seeking Palace was a Mythical being.</p><p></p><p>That Mythical being... perished in the Great Calamity."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Great Calamity, a trace of pain flashed through the Great Solar Flame Emperor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman also narrowed her eyes, clearly extremely wary of the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>That was a Mythical being, yet perished just like that in the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Before this Mythical being perished, many secret treasures were left behind. Nearly half of the Dao-Seeking Palace's resources and techniques remain in these secret treasures.</p><p></p><p>These secret treasures, even Martial Monarch Great Venerable hasn't grasped them. They are all in the hands of that Mythical being's daughter, Jasmine Great Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the Great Solar Flame Emperor gave Qi Yuan a special look.</p><p></p><p>"Some time ago, Martial Monarch Great Venerable wanted to invite Jasmine Great Venerable to become his Dao companion, but Jasmine Great Venerable refused, saying her heart already belonged to the Blood-Robed Sword God."</p><p></p><p>Blood-Robed Sword God was Qi Yuan's alternate identity.</p><p></p><p>The Great Solar Flame Emperor wasn't sure if Jasmine Great Venerable was actually acquainted with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stroked his chin, muttering: "My looks are so good, could it be this Jasmine Great Venerable is my crazy fan?"</p><p></p><p>According to what the Great Solar Flame Emperor said, this Jasmine Great Venerable was definitely a rich woman.</p><p></p><p>Half of the Dao-Seeking Palace's resources were in her hands, along with many techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I have a plan, let me run it by you all," Qi Yuan said to the three.</p><p></p><p>The other three became interested.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's plans were always very interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the three, saying seriously: "What do you think about marriage fraud? I pretend to marry Jasmine Great Venerable, have her give me the Mythical secret treasures as a betrothal gift, then immediately divorce her.</p><p></p><p>According to the law, flash divorces don't support returning betrothal gifts, and I could even get half her assets.</p><p></p><p>This way, wouldn't I easily get my hands on the Mythical secret treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt this plan was simply flawless.</p><p></p><p>And the law was on his side.</p><p></p><p>Although it was Blue Star law, who said Blue Star law couldn't be used in the cultivation world?</p><p></p><p>"Ah... this..." Rogue Immortal Venerable was speechless. "You can make money this way?"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Venerable, doing this would thoroughly offend Jasmine Great Venerable," the Great Solar Flame Emperor said seriously. He was afraid Qi Yuan would really do this.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal are really talented!" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman covered her mouth and laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then finally shook his head: "Forget it, let's abandon this plan. Otherwise, at such a young age I'd already be divorced once. Wouldn't that invite mockery?"</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he was cultivating immortality now. To marry for profit, what kind of immortality was that?</p><p></p><p>It was too meaningless.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

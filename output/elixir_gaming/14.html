        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Jinli's eyes, a trace of gentleness flashed: "He is my good friend."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"His identity... I'm not very clear about it either."</p><p></p><p>The few Jingun soldiers present were all somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>After all, who is this extraordinary person? ...</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that I could be so diligent."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the good virtue of diligence of our countrymen is still engraved in my genes."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched his body and felt very happy.</p><p></p><p>Today, the puppet cat didn't meow, and he had already gotten up.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, without playing games, going to bed early and getting up early, I can enjoy this beautiful morning."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Lingsu's voice came: "Elder Brother, we have all finished our morning cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and felt a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu continued, "But compared to the past few days, Elder Brother, you have made progress.</p><p></p><p>If you can follow what you just said and not play those corrupting games in the future, the future is promising."</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible not to play games." Qi Yuan flatly rejected.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, didn't you say you would take care of me in the future?" Jiang Lingsu smiled, "If you don't cultivate well, how can you take care of me?</p><p></p><p>Don't let me have to come and take care of you in the future if you get into trouble."</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad for you to take care of me." Qi Yuan said, "The sentence I like to say the most is 'If you are rich and noble, don't forget me'."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu gave Qi Yuan a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan thought of something, took out the cultivation technique jade slip: "Sister, your jade slip, I'm returning it to you, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu took the jade slip, with a smile at the corners of her mouth: "Elder Brother, have you created your own cultivation technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course." Qi Yuan said confidently, "It's just not perfect yet, I can only cultivate it to the Qi Refinement Realm, I need to improve it to the Foundation Establishment Realm."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu heard this, paused for a moment, and then laughed even more happily: "In just two days, Elder Brother has created his own cultivation technique, truly a heaven-born genius!"</p><p></p><p>She said this insincerely.</p><p></p><p>Because this is an impossible thing.</p><p></p><p>Unless, rather than saying he created the cultivation technique, it would be more accurate to say he modified someone else's cultivation technique and claimed it as his own.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is also very impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to modify the cultivation technique I created?" Qi Yuan said seriously, "The cultivation techniques you all cultivate have too many problems."</p><p></p><p>But it may become the resource of a certain existence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally would not cultivate such a cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your kindness, Elder Brother, but I don't need to." Jiang Lingsu refused.</p><p></p><p>The Fa Decision she cultivated was a Heaven-level Fa Decision, and there was no way she would modify it.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, from your attire, it seems you are preparing to go down the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"En." Qi Yuan nodded, "I'm going to create a Foundation Establishment cultivation technique, but unfortunately I don't understand much about Foundation Establishment, especially the grade of Foundation Establishment, so I'm going to listen to a big lecture about Foundation Establishment down the mountain."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu heard this and was even more convinced that what the Elder Brother had said before was all just a joke.</p><p></p><p>To create a cultivation technique without understanding much about Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Would such a cultivation technique really be able to be cultivated?</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Jiang Lingsu kindly reminded, "Elder Brother, a cultivation technique is the foundation of a cultivator, you must never casually modify it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was sitting in the cultivation hall of the big lecture.</p><p></p><p>He came early and found a good seat.</p><p></p><p>Later, many disciples came in one after another, and when they saw Qi Yuan, they all had puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>They whispered in low voices, "He's wearing a purple robe, he's a true disciple, why is he coming to attend this big lecture?"</p><p></p><p>"This is not an ordinary purple robe, look at the nine golden lines on his collar, he's not an ordinary true disciple, but a peak sect leader disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The people here looked at Qi Yuan with awe and puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>After all, this kind of big lecture is usually only attended by outer sect disciples and servant disciples, inner sect disciples are relatively few, let alone true disciples.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Light Sect, disciples are divided into true disciples and formal disciples, as well as servant disciples.</p><p></p><p>Servant disciples have the lowest status, they can cultivate but have to do servant duties.</p><p></p><p>Formal disciples are further divided into inner sect disciples and outer sect disciples, both of whom have formally entered a peak.</p><p></p><p>And once an inner sect disciple takes a elder as their master, they will become a true disciple.</p><p></p><p>There are also differences among true disciples, this difference mainly reflects the strength of the master.</p><p></p><p>And like the peak sect leader disciple, that is the true disciple among true disciples, even ordinary elders don't dare to offend them. Such a peak sect leader disciple, with the peak master's guidance, also has extraordinary talents.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How could he have come to this big class.</p><p></p><p>"He is Qi Yuan, the chief disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually him, as expected of the chief disciple, he's really handsome!"</p><p></p><p>These servant disciples and formal disciples, after learning of Qi Yuan's identity, had different expressions - some were envious, some were in awe, and some were jealous.</p><p></p><p>"Why did he come here?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the rumors, he angered the Peak Master of the Seven-Colored Peak, making the Peak Master shut himself in the Seven-Colored Palace and not come out. Oh, I only told you this news, don't spread it out."</p><p></p><p>"To offend the Peak Master, he's really bold!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard the other true disciples all call Qi Yuan 'a rebellious disciple who betrays his teacher and destroys his ancestor'!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed endlessly, and there were also quite a few female disciples with good looks who secretly admired Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, given Qi Yuan's behavior of betraying his teacher, they didn't dare to be too obvious, for fear of inviting trouble.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in his seat, sighing, "Indeed, handsome men are the focus wherever they go."</p><p></p><p>About half an incense stick's worth of time passed, and the teaching steward who was supposed to give the lecture finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>He was an old man whose body was half sunken into the ground.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Qi Yuan, he was slightly taken aback, but then a look of smugness flashed across his mind.</p><p></p><p>He felt that it was because his lectures were so good that even this chief disciple had come to listen to his class.</p><p></p><p>He decided that this time he would exert two hundred percent of his strength in the lecture, to make it grand and impressive, definitely to shock Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was what is commonly known as "empty grandeur".</p><p></p><p>"I am called Xu Renshan, and today it will be I who will teach you all the key points about foundation establishment."</p><p></p><p>After Xu Renshan said this, the disciples below all became serious.</p><p></p><p>Although their cultivation was still far from foundation establishment, getting advance knowledge about foundation establishment was very important to them.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Qi Refining stage, there is the Foundation Establishment stage. Becoming a Foundation Establishment cultivator means you can become a steward of our Divine Light Sect and enjoy the offerings."</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan said, with a nostalgic look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had also almost failed to establish his foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment also has different levels.</p><p></p><p>You all should know that Foundation Establishment requires a Foundation Establishment Treasure, which is the foundation for establishing one's foundation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan spoke eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a disciple responded, "I know, Foundation Establishment Treasures are divided into upper, middle, and lower grades, with the upper grade being the best and the lower grade being the worst."</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan nodded in satisfaction, "The higher the grade of the Foundation Establishment Treasure, the better the effect of the Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>You know about the grades of Foundation Establishment Treasures, but I'm afraid not many of you know that Foundation Establishment itself also has grades."</p><p></p><p>At these words, many people in the audience focused their attention even more.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed something they didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan glanced at Qi Yuan's position and saw that Qi Yuan was also listening attentively. He felt very proud.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment is divided into Mortal-Grade Foundation Establishment, Spirit-Grade Foundation Establishment, Vein-Grade Foundation Establishment, and Immortal-Grade Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Generally, lower-grade Foundation Establishment Treasures can only achieve Mortal-Grade Foundation Establishment, like myself, wasting my life without any hope of reaching the Elixir Dao, how regrettable.</p><p></p><p>Middle-grade Foundation Establishment Treasures can achieve Spirit-Grade Foundation Establishment, and there's also a chance of achieving Vein-Grade Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>As for upper-grade Foundation Establishment Treasures, they correspond to Vein-Grade Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that above the upper-grade Foundation Establishment Treasures, there are even higher-level Foundation Establishment Treasures that can achieve Immortal-Grade Foundation Establishment!</p><p></p><p>Immortal-Grade Foundation Establishment represents the hope of becoming a true Immortal."</p><p></p><p>The people in the audience were all breathing heavily, who wouldn't want to become a true Immortal? "Of course, within each level of Foundation Establishment, there are also further subdivisions."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned and suddenly asked, "May I ask, teacher, is Immortal-Grade Foundation Establishment the best?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the chief disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak ask him a question, Xu Renshan's beard almost stood on end.</p><p></p><p>"No, above Immortal-Grade Foundation Establishment, there is the rumored Heavenly-Dao Foundation Establishment, that is the strongest Foundation Establishment."</p><p></p><p>"Then may I ask, teacher, what is Heavenly-Dao Foundation Establishment?" Qi Yuan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Renshan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He was just a small Foundation Establishment cultivator, how would he know anything about Heavenly-Dao Foundation Establishment?</p><p></p><p>However, he still forced himself to say, "The so-called Heavenly-Dao Foundation Establishment is profound and unfathomable, I can only make a few guesses, you can just listen, don't take it as the truth."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Xu Renshan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He started to make things up.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already said that this was just his guess, it couldn't be taken as the truth.</p><p></p><p>And this kind of thing, the disciples here would never use in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>He made up nonsense, and no one would expose him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately focused all his attention.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to know what Heavenly-Dao Foundation Establishment was.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

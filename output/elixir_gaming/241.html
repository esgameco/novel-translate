        <h1>Chapter 241</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[The Blue Water Village copy has been cleared. Rewards obtained.]</p><p></p><p>[Reward 1: Primordial Seed.]</p><p></p><p>[Reward 2: Primordial True Spirit.]</p><p></p><p>Information about these two rewards flooded into Qi Yuan's mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Seed, as the name suggests, is a seed. </p><p></p><p>But this seed is extremely special. It can take root and sprout in any world, set by its owner, then descend and replace.</p><p></p><p>"This Primordial Seed... is a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>After entering the Yin Spirit realm, Qi Yuan knew that in the past, when he played games, it was his primordial spirit that entered the game world.</p><p></p><p>However, his primordial spirit was somewhat special, a one-time use type, and almost the same as an ordinary body, with flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it was direct descent.</p><p></p><p>With the Primordial Seed, Qi Yuan could now first set the Primordial Seed to grow, and then wait for himself to descend and replace the Primordial Seed.</p><p></p><p>"Not very useful, at most it just allows entering the game early and knowing some plot in advance."</p><p></p><p>"No, it does have some use... the feedback from the Primordial Seed's power increase is greater than the game!"</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>If he had obtained the Primordial Seed earlier.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, he would probably already be at the Yin Spirit realm by now.</p><p></p><p>Unlike now, where he had killed two Yang Spirits, returned to the Cang Lan Realm, and only just broken through to the Divine Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attention turned to the second reward.</p><p></p><p>Primordial True Spirit.</p><p></p><p>All primordial living beings come from the Primordial True Spirit.</p><p></p><p>With a Primordial True Spirit, Qi Yuan could even cultivate... a new Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a primordial world is coveted even by Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan cultivated it carefully, he would go very far on the path of Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan just smiled: "How can a primordial world compare to a Heavenly Court?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remembered the fallen Thunder God, his adopted daughter Qi Qi, and... all the people of Blue Water Village.</p><p></p><p>He had no hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial True Spirit before him was like a peeled egg, crystal clear, emanating an endless vast aura.</p><p></p><p>It seemed capable of brewing countless living beings.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's divine power turned into swords and blades at this moment, with ten thousand blades falling.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial True Spirit before him suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Form... my Divine Infant."</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the Primordial True Spirit instantly split into 4,752 parts.</p><p></p><p>4,750 villagers, plus one for the Holy Mother of No Food, and one for the Heavenly Treasure Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The split Primordial True Spirit entered Qi Yuan's divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's control, these Primordial True Spirits seemed to turn into Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>In the divine realm, the originally assimilated divine power... now returned to the Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>Countless memory fragments also completely flooded into the Divine Infants at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's time... to leave." Qi Yuan's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>With the task completed, he didn't have much time left in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Less than half a day remained.</p><p></p><p>In the last half day, he remembered once touring this realm with the Holy Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>This time, he wanted to take one last good look at the Mortal Heart Realm alone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly opened his eyes in the brick house.</p><p></p><p>It felt like the blink of an eye, yet countless memories flooded into Qi Yuan's mind like fragments.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the stars in the sky and sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"As expected... not even a quarter hour has passed in the Cang Lan Realm."</p><p></p><p>This time he entered the game and came out again.</p><p></p><p>The time in the Cang Lan Realm was still frozen at the moment he entered.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, countless memories overflowed.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan Scripture operated, seemingly sealing all the memories temporarily, turning them into a movie.</p><p></p><p>The heavy expression on Qi Yuan's face disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He looked inward at his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were 4,752 Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>Each Divine Infant emitted a terrifying aura, as if a primordial god was sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Once awakened, it would likely shake the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Especially... these Divine Infants represented ancient gods, and not ordinary ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Thunder God had obtained the South Pole Longevity Emperor's method of observing gods. Once he entered the great realm, given time, he could become a Yang Spirit!</p><p></p><p>So, the Divine Infants in Qi Yuan's body all had the potential to become Yang Spirits!</p><p></p><p>Once awakened, there would be four thousand great lords, and possibly... Yang Spirits!</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, I accidentally formed so many Divine Infants. Am I now a famous Divine Infant True Monarch?"</p><p></p><p>In the Great Shang Nation, a Divine Infant True Monarch was already a top figure.</p><p></p><p>The sect leader of the Divine Light Sect, True Monarch Withered Wood, was also a Divine Infant True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's great enemy, the Old Black Chicken Demon, was also a Divine Infant True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>After much hardship, Qi Yuan had finally rightfully become a Divine Infant True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Shang Nation, he could now establish his own sect!</p><p></p><p>"A brick house no longer suits my status. This time, I should live in... a bungalow!"</p><p></p><p>With increased power, the level should also increase, so the living place naturally couldn't be so shabby anymore.</p><p></p><p>If there was a TV, it would have to be a plasma one.</p><p></p><p>"This promotion is not bad, not bad at all." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>His power had increased greatly. If these Divine Infants were summoned, they would be much more useful in the Cang Lan Realm than Fixed Star Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in the Cang Lan Realm, unless he encountered a great calamity, he could now walk sideways.</p><p></p><p>Encounter a great lord?</p><p></p><p>Just summon a Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity they're sleeping so deeply, who knows when they'll fully awaken."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The villagers inside his body were all sleeping soundly and wouldn't wake up anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what my golden finger has updated this time."</p><p></p><p>Every time he broke through a major realm, Qi Yuan would gain a golden finger.</p><p></p><p>Like his eyes being able to see hidden information, or his ears being able to hear some whispers and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This time breaking through to Divine Infant True Monarch, his golden finger would also update.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... this time it's actually..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit speechless.</p><p></p><p>This time, what awakened was his nose.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when mentioning the nose, what comes to mind most is a dog's nose.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's nose this time was...</p><p></p><p>"Lie detection? Growing longer and shorter, have I become Pinocchio?"</p><p></p><p>The ability Qi Yuan awakened this time was that when hearing a sentence, his nose could judge whether it was true or false by growing longer or shorter. Of course, this lengthening and shortening was still under Qi Yuan's control, so even if he detected, no one would notice the changes in his nose.</p><p></p><p>"This overlaps somewhat with my eyes being able to see hidden information."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>But the overlap wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>For example, using the same object, Qi Yuan could only get one piece of hidden information per day by looking.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes the hidden information obtained was also related to truth and falsehood.</p><p></p><p>Now, regarding truth and falsehood</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>On the road, he walked more precisely.</p><p></p><p>"Can I say my own words?" Qi Yuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is the most handsome in the Cang Lan realm!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his nose didn't change at all.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I can't even exploit this loophole!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry. This ability was too lousy.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said as he walked out of his brick house.</p><p></p><p>But this time when walking, Qi Yuan didn't swagger. Instead, he imitated Ku Mu Zhen Jun's way of walking.</p><p></p><p>Changing into a different outfit, walking in the Shenguang Sect, others might mistake him for an elder.</p><p></p><p>"Should I pretend to be an elder doing inspections?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, but Qi Yuan quickly dismissed it. </p><p></p><p>He was already a Shenying Zhen Jun, which would make him a peak lord even in the Shenguang Sect. There was no need to pretend to be a leader doing inspections.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of his brick house and looked towards a distant building.</p><p></p><p>He coughed once, cleared his throat and said: "Junior sister."</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed before a graceful figure emerged from the house.</p><p></p><p>Her hair behind her ears was tied into circular buns, with a braid falling on each shoulder down to her waist. Under her bangs were a pair of lively eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu wore a pink robe with gold embroidered edges and a round collar on her upper body, with a white camisole underneath. The loose robe could not conceal the magnificent peaks beneath the camisole.</p><p></p><p>She frowned as she looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "Senior brother, with your hands behind your back like that, you look so old-fashioned... I thought you were some elder!"</p><p></p><p>"Am I not qualified to be an elder?" Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Having broken through in cultivation, he was now the youngest Shenying cultivator in the Shenguang Sect. No, the youngest Shenying cultivator in all of Da Shang. Of course he had to show off a little.</p><p></p><p>"You are, you are..." Suddenly, Jiang Lingsu looked up at the sky. "I just blinked, and there's another sun in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>She looked astonished.</p><p></p><p>Because now, there was indeed another sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>There were clearly three suns hanging in the sky of the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>The scene of three suns in the sky was particularly frightening.</p><p></p><p>"Next time you come out of seclusion, there might be other suns around that sun!" Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He was now studying military strategy, planning to surround the sun in the sky with Stellar Golden Core suns, using the method of the countryside surrounding the cities.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's too scary!" Jiang Lingsu shook her head, not paying much attention to such matters.</p><p></p><p>After all, for such major events, her concern wouldn't make a difference.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, why did you call me out?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>"I have good news and bad news for you. Which do you want to hear?" Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's body had never been well. Every so often, her body would become as cold as frost.</p><p></p><p>Even with Qi Yuan's enthusiasm, he could only briefly drive away the frost by holding his junior sister's hand.</p><p></p><p>Unless he wore the same pants as his junior sister every day, he couldn't eliminate this suffering.</p><p></p><p>This time, when entering the Mortal Heart realm, Qi Yuan had always kept his junior sister's physical problems in mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, his junior sister was a rich lady who had helped Qi Yuan a lot.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was wealthy and powerful, although he didn't care about his junior sister's small money anymore, he wouldn't be an ungrateful scoundrel like Chen Shimei.</p><p></p><p>"The good news," Jiang Lingsu asked directly.</p><p></p><p>She knew that when chatting with her senior brother, it was best not to use logic, but to say whatever came to mind.</p><p></p><p>"The good news is, junior sister, your condition requires a Purple Palace cultivator with a water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root to cure, right? I've found such a cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, Qi Yuan's plan was to capture a Purple Palace cultivator to treat his junior sister's illness after becoming a Daluo Golden Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, there were countless Purple Palace cultivators in the Mortal Heart realm. He encountered many cultivators with water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Roots, and he found a beautiful and obedient one to take as his subject.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, intense joy welled up in Jiang Lingsu's eyes: "You found one?"</p><p></p><p>Didn't that mean her condition could be cured? Would she no longer have to endure this bone-deep pain?</p><p></p><p>She was overjoyed, and her body couldn't help but move closer to Qi Yuan, her hand grasping his arm.</p><p></p><p>"Where is she?"</p><p></p><p>"There's still some bad news," Qi Yuan said calmly. "The water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root cultivator I found isn't at the Purple Palace realm."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Hearing this, a trace of disappointment flashed in Jiang Lingsu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Without being at the Purple Palace realm, without innate divine abilities, her problem couldn't be cured at the root.</p><p></p><p>And to cultivate an ordinary water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root cultivator to the Purple Palace realm... it was unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>Even the Jiang family couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your kind intentions, senior brother. It's alright," Jiang Lingsu smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>It was enough that her senior brother kept her in mind.</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter if he couldn't actually help.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't finished telling the bad news yet," Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu dispelled the excitement in her heart and smiled like a flower: "What other bad news is there?"</p><p></p><p>"That cultivator isn't at the Purple Palace realm, she's at the Yin Spirit realm."</p><p></p><p>In fact, she wasn't just an ordinary Yin Spirit, but a Great Venerable, a mythical figure among Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned, her breathing becoming rapid: "Senior brother... you found a Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>That was a Yin Spirit! If a Purple Palace cultivator with a water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root could do it, a Yin Spirit could certainly do it even better!</p><p></p><p>Senior brother's twists and turns! However, Jiang Lingsu felt a bit uneasy. Even their Jiang family couldn't invite a Yin Spirit to help.</p><p></p><p>"The bad news isn't finished yet," Qi Yuan didn't keep her in suspense this time and said in one breath, "This Yin Spirit is dead."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu blinked.</p><p></p><p>"She became my divine infant."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu blinked again.</p><p></p><p>This sounded so strange. "So, my divine infant can cure you!" Qi Yuan said smugly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was a bit dazed. After a long while, she said: "Senior brother, we haven't seen each other for just the time it takes to burn an incense stick, and you're already playing tricks on me like this?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her delicate fist punched Qi Yuan without mercy, and her fingers pinched his arm hard.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was only at Foundation Establishment, she couldn't hurt Qi Yuan who was at the Yuan Dan stage, so she used as much force as she wanted.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had directly reached the Divine Infant stage. Who would believe that?</p><p></p><p>"Your senior brother never lies, and even if I do lie, it's a well-intentioned lie," Qi Yuan said casually. "Hurry back to your room, I'll come treat your illness."</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, are you serious?" Jiang Lingsu couldn't help but ask in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Although her senior brother wasn't reliable, once he got serious, it was usually true.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not from the Blue Star if I'm lying to you!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu hesitated for a moment: "Wait, let me organize my thoughts. I'm a bit confused right now."</p><p></p><p>She was indeed confused.</p><p></p><p>Because what her senior brother said was too unreliable.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, she gritted her teeth and said fiercely: "Senior brother, I'll trust you this once. If you're deceiving me, you'll be in big trouble!"</p><p></p><p>[The rest appears to be author's notes thanking supporters, which I've omitted from the translation.]</p>

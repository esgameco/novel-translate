        <h1>Chapter 262</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of the Yin Gods present became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity was like a sharp sword hanging over the head of every Yin God.</p><p></p><p>When that sword fell, no Yin God believed they could escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Dazun's expression tightened as he looked at Qi Yuan: "Please elaborate, senior!"</p><p></p><p>If it had been the Blood-Robed Sword God saying these things in the past, he would have dismissed them with contempt. </p><p></p><p>But the power Qi Yuan had displayed was undoubtedly mythical.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed to be no ordinary myth, already standing at the pinnacle of the Cang Lan Realm, qualified to discuss the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the cultivation methods we practice are poisonous..." Qi Yuan began, informing the Yin Gods present about the toxicity of the cultivation methods, as well as the original purpose for establishing the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the Yin Gods present looked at each other with varied expressions, but none responded.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Dazun had witnessed the Blood-Robed Sword God's power before, so he believed Qi Yuan's words to some extent. His expression changed slightly: "I can't believe such a thing exists."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have any opinions to share?" Qi Yuan looked towards the six Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is of great importance. This old one needs to go back and verify it," one Yin God elder replied. "After verification, I will certainly give you an answer, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he did not believe Qi Yuan's words, nor was he willing to hand over his cultivation methods to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Going back to verify was just an excuse. If they said they were verifying, would verifying for 10,000 years count as verification? The other Yin Gods mostly gave similar responses.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards Jasmine Dazun with an expectant expression, and immediately said: "You love me so much, why don't you take out your mythical treasures to support my startup? When my business succeeds, I definitely won't treat you poorly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was painting a grand picture for Jasmine Dazun.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun smiled tactfully: "This matter is of great importance. I alone cannot make the decision. Let me go back and ask for others' opinions before giving you an answer."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite disappointed: "It seems you don't love me enough after all."</p><p></p><p>This Jasmine Dazun kept saying she loved him, but in the end wouldn't part with a single penny.</p><p></p><p>Hah, cunning and stingy woman! At this moment, the Seven Injuries Elder narrowed his eyes and said softly: "This old one is quite interested in this Original God Sharing Association, and is willing to donate some cultivation methods."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "You have good taste, my friend. Follow me and you definitely won't lose out!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder said with a smile: "In a few days, I will send someone to deliver the cultivation methods to the Seeking Dao Palace."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Qi Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>The Original God Sharing Association finally had a customer.</p><p></p><p>"After some time, I will produce jade slips for our Original God Sharing Association, which will contain some cultivation methods I've uploaded.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods you give me will be converted into points, which can be exchanged for some useful cultivation methods on there." Qi Yuan enthusiastically introduced to his customer.</p><p></p><p>The task of making the jade slips would naturally be assigned to the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>Wind Lord's personal wealth certainly couldn't compare to the Seeking Dao Palace's.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine, that's fine," the Seven Injuries Elder said amiably, but in reality, he didn't seem to care much about the cultivation methods Qi Yuan said would be in the jade slips.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Injuries Elder, if you have any good friends, please help spread the word about this. I'll give you points for it," Qi Yuan was still very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>The beginning is always the hardest.</p><p></p><p>But, you know, even pyramid schemes on Earth without any actual products can grow so big. His Original God Sharing Association had the name of Original God behind it. If it couldn't flourish in the Cang Lan Realm, it would mean... the Original God was incompetent.</p><p></p><p>Next, Qi Yuan also explained the points system to the Seven Injuries Elder.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods given to Qi Yuan were divided into two types. One type could be made public, placed in the Sharing Association's jade slips for people to exchange, and these methods would earn more points. The other type could only be viewed by Qi Yuan himself, and would earn even more points.</p><p></p><p>Everyone chatted happily, in a harmonious atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the Seven Injuries Elder, Jasmine Dazun and the other Yin Gods left the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder, dressed in hemp clothing and with a hunched figure, slowly transformed into a stream of light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jasmine Dazun's figure appeared, and the Seven Injuries Elder stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Injuries Elder, did you believe the Blood-Robed Sword God's words?" Jasmine Dazun asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The idea that cultivation methods were poisonous was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Jasmine Dazun was also skeptical at first.</p><p></p><p>But when she recalled what that person had said about the Dark Sun, doubts arose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be true? But even if it was true, Jasmine Dazun didn't dare to get involved in this muddy water.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sun had already made its move, Qi Yuan was doomed to die.</p><p></p><p>Joining the Original God Sharing Association now might also invite retaliation from the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even knowing all this, she wouldn't warn the other Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>She'd be happy if more of them died.</p><p></p><p>"Whether I believe it or not, what difference does it make?" the Seven Injuries Elder said nonchalantly. "This old one doesn't have many years left to live anyway. I might not be able to survive the next great calamity, so giving away cultivation methods is no big deal."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to be so carefree, it's admirable," Jasmine Dazun couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder seemed to think of something and blurted out: "Since you admire me so much, why don't you give me your mythical treasures? With those mythical treasures, this old one might even be able to survive the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect to hear this kind of phrasing again.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell," Jasmine Dazun was displeased in her heart. She snorted coldly and chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder smiled, his expression profound, and his figure disappeared in that moment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days later.</p><p></p><p>In the Seeking Dao Palace, Qi Yuan opened his eyes and looked at the jade slip Wu Jun Dazun had brought him.</p><p></p><p>The jade slip recorded the progress of the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>"Our Original God Sharing Association finally has its own home!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan was very excited.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, the Seeking Dao Palace had been working at full speed to produce the jade slips Qi Yuan wanted.</p><p></p><p>"This is the master jade slip. All the cultivation methods entered will be stored here," Wu Jun Dazun said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The master jade slip was a precious Yin God artifact, personally refined by Wu Jun Dazun.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad. With this, I finally don't have to worry about being muted," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Recalling being muted in the Divine Flower Association, Qi Yuan felt his teeth itch with hatred.</p><p></p><p>He made a mental note of the Divine Flower Association's president.</p><p></p><p>"The rest of the jade slips have been sent to all the Yin Gods in the Phoenix Sky Domain, one for each Yin God.</p><p></p><p>Any medium-sized or larger sects and forces that want a jade slip can be sent one," Wu Jun Dazun reported truthfully.</p><p></p><p>He had resigned himself to his fate now.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't defeat Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, he might as well peacefully let Qi Yuan usurp his position.</p><p></p><p>Being a follower of a mythical being wasn't shameful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and looked at Wu Jun Dazun: "You've done well. Hmm... how are the preparations for the Original God launch ceremony going?"</p><p></p><p>With the establishment of the Original God Sharing Association, they naturally needed to invite people to attend.</p><p></p><p>Now, the main venue for the Original God Sharing Association was set up in the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Notifications were sent out three days ago. All the Yin Gods in the Phoenix Sky Domain will attend the celebration in two days, and even some Yin Gods from the Demon Domain will participate.</p><p></p><p>Among them, some medium-sized sects are very eager to join the Original God Sharing Association as ordinary members!" Wu Jun Dazun said.</p><p></p><p>This was also normal.</p><p></p><p>Because those ordinary sects didn't have many profound techniques.</p><p></p><p>Except for their most secret techniques, they could upload a bunch of cultivation methods to the Original God Sharing Association and then exchange them for cultivation methods on the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation methods Qi Yuan put on the jade slips included heavenly-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Yin Gods, where could ordinary Purple Palace cultivators obtain a heavenly-grade technique? So, many medium-sized sects had set their sights on the Original God Sharing Association, hoping to obtain heavenly-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for ordinary Yin God Lords, they didn't have much demand, except for a few who were interested. The rest just had an attitude of watching the show.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I've gained the support of the common people," Qi Yuan pondered. "Unfortunately, 99.8% of the wealth is controlled by 0.2% of the people. Those Yin Gods are the real fat sheep."</p><p></p><p>At this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Great Lord Wu Jun trembled in fear, feeling like Qi Yuan's eyes were about to devour someone.</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult to get the Yin Gods to hand over their techniques," Great Lord Wu Jun glanced at Qi Yuan, hinting, "Unless you give them the Mythical Secret Treasure."</p><p></p><p>Great Lord Jasmine possessed the Mythical Secret Treasure, which aroused countless covetous desires.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, on the other hand, had mythical-level combat power. That was a living, breathing myth, far more precious than the Mythical Secret Treasure.</p><p></p><p>"The Mythical Secret Treasure is with Great Lord Jasmine. Are you saying I should sacrifice my chastity?" Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his hint didn't work, Great Lord Wu Jun had nothing more to say.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze became determined again: "There is true feeling in the human world. My personal charm was able to move the Purple Mansion of the Dao Seeking Palace. It will surely be able to move other forces as well. They will definitely become members of our Original God Sharing Association and hand over their techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always felt that he belonged to the lawful good alignment. What he did, if placed on the Blue Star, would be called a saint... no, he was male, so he should be called a holy man.</p><p></p><p>Great Lord Wu Jun was speechless.</p><p></p><p>You didn't move the Purple Mansion of the Dao Seeking Palace, you scared them so much they didn't dare to move!</p><p></p><p>"Has the news of the Original God Sharing Association been passed to other domains of the Dao Seeking Palace?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>His coming to the Dao Seeking Palace, besides obtaining techniques and borrowing their power, had another major purpose - to use the Dao Seeking Palace to spread the tentacles of the Original God Sharing Association to other domains.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Seeking Palace was spread across twenty domains in the Azure Waves Realm, with its power present in over half the domains of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>Great Lord Wu Jun's expression was complex: "I have already reported this matter to headquarters. The people at headquarters said that someone will come to announce the results at the time of the celebration."</p><p></p><p>"The day after tomorrow?" Qi Yuan murmured, "I hope everything goes smoothly for the Original God Sharing Association."</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, the day of the Original God Sharing Association's celebration began.</p><p></p><p>Wind Lord, as the manager of the Original God Sharing Association, was all smiles at this time, exchanging pleasantries with all the guests.</p><p></p><p>Even when encountering Great Lord Jasmine, he wore a smile on his face and did not treat her coldly despite the conflict between them.</p><p></p><p>The celebration was joyous, with a full fifteen Yin Gods in attendance.</p><p></p><p>Most of these Yin Gods were from the Phoenix Sky Domain, with one or two from the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Seven Injuries Old Man sat to one side, like a lazy old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Injuries Old Man, this Blood Robe Sword God is indeed extraordinary. There are actually several top-grade heavenly level techniques in the jade slip," a young Yin God spoke up.</p><p></p><p>This Yin God was named Long Can, of noble birth, whose father was also a Great Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Top-grade heavenly level?" Seven Injuries Old Man was surprised upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The technique he cultivated was mid-grade heavenly level.</p><p></p><p>He had only seen top-grade heavenly level techniques, but never obtained one.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the Blood Robe Sword God had top-grade heavenly level techniques and was sharing them, he was indeed surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord Jasmine, you didn't give the Mythical Secret Treasure to the Blood Robe Sword God, did you?" Seven Injuries Old Man joked.</p><p></p><p>Great Lord Jasmine smiled: "The Mythical Secret Treasure is the foundation of my existence, how could I give it away? Perhaps the Blood Robe Sword God also has a Mythical Secret Treasure, otherwise how could he have Great Lord Wu Jun under his complete control?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Seven Injuries Old Man said no more, and sent his divine sense into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a complex expression: "If only I had encountered these techniques when I was young. What a pity, these techniques are of no use to this old man now."</p><p></p><p>The techniques were good, but completely unusable.</p><p></p><p>Top-grade heavenly level techniques were already the limit of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>The path of a Yin God Lord was already set and could not be easily changed.</p><p></p><p>So even though Qi Yuan brought out the name of the Original God Sharing Association, not many Yin Gods cared.</p><p></p><p>At most, they would exchange some techniques to give to their subordinate forces.</p><p></p><p>But at the level of Yin Gods, they were concerned about the great calamity. Who cared about subordinates? Perhaps only the legendary divine techniques could move these Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>But... there were no divine techniques in the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques only existed in legends.</p><p></p><p>That the Blood Robe Sword God could produce top-grade heavenly level techniques had already surprised him.</p><p></p><p>He scanned the techniques, only sighing a few words.</p><p></p><p>Unlike these Yin Gods, those sect leaders of medium-sized forces who received the jade slips had their eyes light up when they saw the techniques inside.</p><p></p><p>Below the Yin God realm, changing cultivation techniques was very normal.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Seeking Palace, the atmosphere was harmonious.</p><p></p><p>Even those Purple Mansion cultivators squeezed out smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Hosting an opening ceremony for others on their own territory, and having to act as servants, they felt bitter inside but had no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stepped out with a smile on his face: "I didn't expect so many people to come this time. It seems everyone is very optimistic about the prospects of our Original God Sharing Association."</p><p></p><p>With so many people, if they all gave him their techniques, plus the techniques Shen Wushen brought from the upper realm, Qi Yuan felt that he could complete the deduction of the Divine Infant section of his "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Of course, for the Golden Core chapter, the more the better.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Elder Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"The Original God Sharing Association gathering techniques together is a blessing for the Azure Waves Realm!"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods also offered appropriate flattery.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was harmonious and very cordial.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging pleasantries for dozens of sentences, Qi Yuan finally got to the main point.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone should be very clear about the purpose of establishing the Original God Sharing Association. It is to deal with the great calamity. Therefore, I need endless techniques, and I also need everyone to offer some techniques! The techniques of our Original God Sharing Association are also available for exchange!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously, with a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>"This old man wishes to offer a hundred jade-level techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Three mystic-level techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"Seven mystic-level!"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods chimed in one after another.</p><p></p><p>However, the highest level of techniques they offered was only mystic-level. Not one person offered a heavenly-level technique.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Seven Injuries Old Man's gaze flickered: "This old man wishes to offer eight heavenly-level techniques, and various other techniques."</p><p></p><p>Eight heavenly-level techniques had already emptied him out.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Seven Injuries Old Man's words, the Yin Gods present changed their expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, they still didn't change their offers, obviously not optimistic about the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Great Lord Jasmine smiled gently: "The Phoenix Palace is lacking in techniques and has no techniques to offer. I specially created a jade-level technique to offer to the Original God Sharing Association."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned and looked at Great Lord Jasmine a few more times.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Qi Yuan was reminded of those people on the Blue Star who denounced their boyfriends or girlfriends online for giving cheap handmade gifts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also wanted to denounce Great Lord Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>Huh, stingy woman! The other Yin God Lords wanted to laugh but didn't dare to.</p><p></p><p>What was Great Lord Jasmine's intention with this move? Qi Yuan resisted looking at Great Lord Jasmine. He had high EQ and good emotional management, never losing his temper rashly on important occasions.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Yin God emissary who had come from other domains of the Dao Seeking Palace, his face showing an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what he looked forward to most was that the Yin Gods from other domains of the Dao Seeking Palace would understand his good intentions and unite together to fight against the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that Yin God Lord stood up, revealing a trace of regret on his face: "Blood Robe Sword God, the Four Generals of the Lei family from Dark Sun are on their way here. The ceremony should... end."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

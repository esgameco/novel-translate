        <h1>Chapter 523</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young master, but I have... four legs!" </p><p></p><p>The tiger was perched on Chen Kangbao's shoulders, and he was terrified, running at an increased speed, as if he had an additional rocket booster.</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gestured with his hand, and the roaring tiger instantly changed its posture, its front paws no longer resting on Chen Kangbao's shoulders, but its fangs biting onto his waistband.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the carriage became a six-legged one.</p><p></p><p>The carriage galloped into the distance, heading towards the Ten Thousand Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, it attracted many curious glances, and some light laughter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the night, the inn in the mountains was brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>The elm railings were old and rotten, coated with a thick layer of lacquer, covering up the bloodstains of the past.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, one could still see knife marks on many of the railings.</p><p></p><p>The inn was located in a remote area, a notorious "black inn" that rarely saw visitors.</p><p></p><p>But now, business was booming, with many people rushing in from Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>The originally arrogant black inn owner, seeing so many elite soldiers, hunched over and came to do legitimate business for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, the divine artifact embryo has appeared, does anyone have any useful information to share?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, an old man with a goatee spoke up, his face gaunt, his eyes shining with spirit, a gourd hanging at his waist.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Alcohol Sect Master has spoken, you all should not hide anything, share the information you have obtained, so that we can explore the ruins together. Otherwise, if more Sky-level elite soldiers come, we won't even be able to have a bowl of soup."  An old kind man said.</p><p></p><p>He was an elder of the Ancient Thundergate, and the divine artifact he cultivated was the Thousand Silk Golden Feather Robe, specializing in unparalleled defense.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this ruin is truly bizarre, not only is it difficult to enter, even if one gets in, there are all kinds of strange things happening that make one's hair stand on end."</p><p></p><p>"There are many strange spirits inside, and it's somewhat similar to the Spirit Cultivation Ground of the Thorny Blood."</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, Master Wu Genzu stormed in, as a peak Earth-level elite soldier, he originally thought there was nothing in the ruin that could harm him, so he charged in recklessly, but who knew, a clay puppet suddenly appeared and stabbed him to death with a spear."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this clay puppet, the eyes of those present all showed a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>Those who could be called Sect Masters were all peak Earth-level elite soldiers, and if they followed Qi Yuan's cultivation plan and didn't slack off, they had the hope of reaching the Sky-level.</p><p></p><p>But to be killed by a clay puppet with a single spear thrust, who among those present was not afraid?</p><p></p><p>"This ruin is truly perilous, even Earth-level elite soldiers may not be able to protect themselves, I'm afraid only Sky-level elite soldiers can sweep through it." An old man said, his voice quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>As peak Earth-level elite soldiers, they were all regional overlords, their prestige shaking the land.</p><p></p><p>But in the ruins ahead, they couldn't even protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time in my life that I've encountered such a perilous ruin."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, in general dangerous places, there is at most a powerful strange spirit guarding, at most a few hundred of its kind.</p><p></p><p>But this ruin is different, the strange spirits discovered so far are in the hundreds of species, truly bizarre!"</p><p></p><p>The elite soldiers present had seen many storms, what kind of scene had they not seen.</p><p></p><p>But the current scene, however, was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>The elite soldiers present fell into deep thought, some frowning, some closing their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I have some thoughts about this ruin." The hoarse voice of the old woman from Hushan spoke, and the gaze of everyone present turned to her.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all know that the 'Origin Essentials' once recorded that on that day, the dark night descended, and the strange fell upon the land."</p><p></p><p>The fewer the words, the greater the matter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elite soldiers present all changed their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be, this is a forbidden strange land?"</p><p></p><p>"There are actually forbidden strange lands in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Many Earth-level elite soldiers had the urge to retreat.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Mountain Realm, there used to be no strange spirits.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, the dark night descended, and the strange fell upon the land, many regions turning into forbidden strange lands.</p><p></p><p>At first, no one took it seriously, thinking it was just a small accident.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, in the forbidden strange lands, terrifying creatures, strange spirits, were born! The disaster spread, and countless strange spirits endlessly crawled out of the forbidden strange lands, ruthlessly slaughtering the common people.</p><p></p><p>The human world became a hell.</p><p></p><p>In just ten years, the population of the Blue Mountain Realm shrank by more than two-thirds.</p><p></p><p>The casualties, how many billions?</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Outer Alliance came to help, and managed to suppress the strange spirits.</p><p></p><p>The ten forbidden strange lands were all suppressed and annihilated, and the strange spirit tide disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, the strange spirits had taken root in the Blue Mountain Realm, and new ones would be born every now and then.</p><p></p><p>And some small or broken forbidden strange lands still remained.</p><p></p><p>"If this is a forbidden strange land... only the legendary Divine-level elite soldiers can sweep it clean!"</p><p></p><p>The Earth-level elite soldiers present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this ruin is just a broken forbidden strange land, otherwise we would have died long ago!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if it was a complete forbidden strange land, Ninguo and Moshan Kingdom would have been destroyed long ago!"</p><p></p><p>"If this is a forbidden strange land... the benefits inside must be tempting!"</p><p></p><p>"Many divine weapon materials come from forbidden strange lands!"</p><p></p><p>Many elite soldiers had calculations in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't get the divine artifact embryo, but if they could snatch other precious things, it would still be a big profit.</p><p></p><p>"Since this is a forbidden strange land, the danger must be greater than imagined. Old me suggests that we all team up to explore it.</p><p></p><p>That way, even if we encounter Sky-level elite soldiers, we won't be completely defenseless."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's team up."</p><p></p><p>The Earth-level elite soldiers present were quick-witted, eagerly forming teams.</p><p></p><p>Tusi Haiwas also in the inn, teaming up with a few old acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the five of us are not bad in strength, but we lack a top-tier Sect Master." A charming young woman said, full of charm.</p><p></p><p>"Those top-tier Sect Masters are just a few, and they're not familiar with us, how would they team up with us?" The one-eyed old man said in a sinister tone.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we don't encounter Sky-level elite soldiers, with our strength, as long as we're careful, we'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>The remaining two were a pair of twin brothers, both just stepping into the peak of Earth-level elite soldiers, but with a unity of mind, their combined strength was also very powerful.</p><p></p><p>"With the Black Sha brothers, we're not weak either, we should be fine." Tusi Hai pondered, though he was still a bit disappointed that the top-tier Sect Masters they knew didn't come this time.</p><p></p><p>The others were unfamiliar, and they didn't dare to cooperate with them, and those top-tier Sect Masters might not even be willing to cooperate with them.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred Earth-level elite soldiers gathered together, each forming their own team.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sound like hoofbeats came from the distance.</p><p></p><p>An old man was dragging a horse and running wildly, drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, a tiger was biting onto his waistband.</p><p></p><p>This scene was very ridiculous and strange, causing many elite soldiers to glance over.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the carriage curtain was lifted, revealing a handsome face that made the women exclaim.</p><p></p><p>The young gentleman waved his hand, and the tiger in front of him instantly transformed into a small bird that fell into his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The Earth-level elite soldiers present were all somewhat surprised at this sight.</p><p></p><p>"What a handsome young man!"</p><p></p><p>"This is... an illusion technique, quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Tusi Hai saw the newcomer and had a look of surprise on his face: "Qi... Brother Qi."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know him?" The charming young woman licked her lips, "Such a young and vibrant body."</p><p></p><p>"He... is not ordinary." Tusi Hai recalled how Qi Yuan had swallowed the Spirit Insect Talisman, and still felt a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, Brother Qi, wasn't interested, so why did he come again? At this moment, the carriage stopped, and the young man stepped out.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze over the elite soldiers present, his voice clear and loud: "Who is Mo Sanxu, quickly get out and die, daring to bully my wife, I, the distinguished son-in-law, how can you bully me?"</p><p></p><p>Although a son-in-law may be bullied, that is by his own family. </p><p></p><p>But an outsider bullying him?</p><p></p><p>Sorry, I'm going to get crooked-mouthed.</p><p></p><p>The powerful voice fell among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>There were too many people, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to look for Mo Sanxu one by one.</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Lingxuan, he didn't need to scan to find her.</p><p></p><p>The Earth-level elite soldiers on the scene had expressions that changed slightly, some with the look of enjoying the show, some frowning, feeling that Qi Yuan was too arrogant and bold.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Mo Shanxu is here!" A loud shout came, and a burly man wielding a purple-gold hammer strode out, wearing an open shirt that revealed his round belly, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"This young man has a lot of guts, daring to provoke Mo Shanxu, Mo Shanxu is an old-school Sect Master, only slightly weaker than the top-tier Sect Masters."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept a glance at this burly man and shook his head: "You are Mo Shanxu, I'm looking for Mo Sanxu, not the same person, Mo Sanxu is a eunuch."</p><p></p><p>"You call me a eunuch!" The burly man glared, his anger burning, "Little brat, take my hammer!"</p><p></p><p>A sound of air piercing came, the shadow of the huge hammer flashing, Mo Shanxu soared into the air, the hammer strike mighty.</p><p></p><p>One hammer strike, with a force of thousands of tons, enough to split mountains and rocks! The ordinary Earth-level elite soldiers would be injured if hit by this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan's expression did not change.</p><p></p><p>"Your hammer is not good enough."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his delicate white palm and lightly tapped the hammer.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Indescribable huge force traveled through the hammer, directly striking Mo Shanxu's arm.</p><p></p><p>Numbness, pain accompanied by the huge force, Mo Shanxu's huge body suddenly fell, flying back seven meters.</p><p></p><p>This scene made all the elite soldiers present moved.</p><p></p><p>"He actually used his palm to block Mo Shanxu's hammer strike? Is his hand made of iron?"</p><p></p><p>"Defeating Mo Shanxu with a single move, he doesn't have Heaven-Earth Unification, how can he be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Tusi Hai also took a deep breath, his expression flickering: "Brother Qi is actually this strong!"</p><p></p><p>Although he had seen Qi Yuan swallow the Spirit Insect Talisman, he was not very optimistic about Qi Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>Too young, at most just breaking through to the Earth-level.</p><p></p><p>But just now, this move was stronger than the top-tier Sect Masters present.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't lack Heaven-Earth Unification, he might have been mistaken for a Sky-level elite soldier.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan took a step forward, looking at the fallen Mo Shanxu on the ground, his voice calm: "Can we talk properly now?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Shanxu wiped the fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, the previous ferocity disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"It's a misunderstanding, with my strength, I'm not worthy of being your enemy, young master."</p><p></p><p>The usually hot-tempered Mo Shanxu had become very easy to talk to.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you had some backbone, and would say, 'It was me who did it, so what are you going to do about it?'" Qi Yuan casually commented.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes when someone was falsely accused, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to prove his innocence, he would just kill the other party and say, "It was me who did it, so what are you going to do about it?"</p><p></p><p>But of course, the situation here was different, it was just a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just let this matter go."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to reason with Mo Shan Kong. He swept his gaze across the crowd. 'Whoever has news of the old eunuch Mo San Kong, please tell me, and I shall reward you greatly.'"</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Lingxuan? Shen Lingxuan had come here to avoid disaster, so she would certainly be hiding her identity and would not be easy to find.</p><p></p><p>Asking these people probably wouldn't yield any results.</p><p></p><p>The people present looked at each other, no one having seen the old eunuch Mo San Kong.</p><p></p><p>As for Mo Shan Kong, he looked embarrassed, realizing that he was not the one being sought.</p><p></p><p>After about five breaths of silence, a weak voice spoke up: "Could the senior be referring to an old man with a goose-like voice, without any facial hair?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Dao mustered his courage to speak. He had just broken through to the Earth Realm and came here to seize opportunities. However, his strength was weak, and so far no one had formed a team with him. If he rashly went in, he would likely die a miserable death.</p><p></p><p>But he also couldn't leave, as he had a hidden ailment, and if he didn't come here to take a chance, he would die before long.</p><p></p><p>So, he ultimately steeled his nerves and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"That's probably him," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In the nearby countries, there was no tradition of eunuchs cultivating, so this goose-voiced person should be the Mo San Kong that Qi Yuan was looking for.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He now wanted to find the unwashed moonlight and kill him.</p><p></p><p>Killing Mo San Kong would not only grant him a massive amount of experience points, but it would also allow him to seize the man's Heaven-Man Unification.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dao immediately recalled the figure, his eyes filled with deep dread.</p><p></p><p>Although that person was concealing his aura, the casual aura he exuded was still enough to make one's heart tremble - at least a top-tier Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have a hidden ailment that forced him to get involved, he wouldn't have meddled in the dispute between such powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>One wrong move and he would be crushed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that person entered through the 17th black door in the northeast direction of the ruins," Wang Dao answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Qi Yuan, having confirmed that Wang Dao was not lying, prepared to go and find Mo San Kong.</p><p></p><p>"I want... for the senior to take me with you when you explore the ruins... if it's convenient for the senior, you could also protect me," Wang Dao said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to die anyway, he might as well take a chance.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" A complex expression flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes. "Alright, no problem."</p><p></p><p>He then turned his gaze to the distant Tu Sihai.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Tu, how about teaming up with me? I happen to owe you a favor, so I can repay it this time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan extended the invitation. He didn't like the feeling of owing favors to others.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai's eyes lit up, and he was about to agree.</p><p></p><p>Their team was indeed lacking a top-tier Sect Master, and this Qi Yuan seemed much stronger than even that level.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man next to him then said, "Old Tu, that Mo San Kong might not be easy to deal with. If you get involved..."</p><p></p><p>It was clear that his thoughts were complex, and he was considering many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that Qi Yuan's invitation might be to use their strength to deal with Mo San Kong.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, the blind old man truly trusted very few people.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, a mere Mo San Kong, as long as I find him, I can suppress him with a flick of my hand," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The charming young woman smiled sweetly, "Sir, your joining us is most welcome."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the Black Demon Brothers nodded in unison.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai bowed to Qi Yuan, his expression complex. "I appreciate you looking after me, brother Qi."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, as long as you're with me, you won't be in any danger in this ruin."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was full of self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>He then suddenly looked at all the Earth Realm Armored Soldiers present.</p><p></p><p>"Can you all do me a favor?"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and dozens of silver notes flew out. Each note had ten thousand taels written on it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Armored Soldiers present all took a deep breath. This man was truly wealthy!</p><p></p><p>Even top-tier Sect Masters wouldn't have this much silver on them. Yet this young man casually brought it out, indicating he had even more wealth.</p><p></p><p>Even the charming young woman's gaze towards Qi Yuan was shimmering with admiration. Many women even started sending him coy glances.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he had a request, he would have accused them of sexual harassment!</p><p></p><p>"Please, sir, tell us what you need," the others, having witnessed Qi Yuan's strength, were naturally very respectful.</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter anyone, male or female, in the ruins, tell them: 'Shen Lingxuan, your husband has come to find you, do not be afraid.'" Qi Yuan displayed his wealth. "As long as you help me with this one task, this ten thousand taels of silver is yours."</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand taels of silver was a considerable income for an Earth Realm Armored Soldier. Now, all they had to do was deliver a message, and each person would get ten thousand taels of silver. It was too good to be true!</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan was truly... a fool with money.</p><p></p><p>Many of the Armored Soldiers present were astonished.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai, remembering Qi Yuan's previous actions, was not surprised, as the Qi brothers were always peculiar in their ways.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Many of the Armored Soldiers present agreed, taking the silver notes.</p><p></p><p>Only three Earth Realm Armored Soldiers did not participate, as they apparently preferred to avoid trouble when there was easy money to be had.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've taken the money, you must do as I ask. Otherwise..." Qi Yuan's expression remained calm, but suddenly his hand moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A figure fell from the sky, crashing to the ground. It was a frail old man, his face filled with disbelief. A wound appeared on his forehead, running from top to bottom, and his aura rapidly faded until he died.</p><p></p><p>"Stealing is against the law, and you've committed a triple offense by trying to steal from me. Not only did you want to steal my things, but you also tried to ambush me in secret. Die."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Realm Armored Soldiers present all had looks of trepidation. They knew that Qi Yuan was demonstrating his strength and intimidating them.</p><p></p><p>The effect was indeed good.</p><p></p><p>"That was the Idle Cloud Immortal... and he was killed with a single move!"</p><p></p><p>"He was a top-tier Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"His speed was extremely fast, and he was the best at concealing his presence. We didn't even notice him!"</p><p></p><p>"Such strength... even Heaven Realm Armored Soldiers might not be his match without using Heaven-Man Unification!"</p><p></p><p>"How did he cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>The people present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>As for Tu Sihai, a gleam of excitement appeared in his eyes. This Qi brother was too strong. This trip to the ruins seemed to have no problems.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dao's face showed a look of delight. The stronger Qi Yuan was, the more protection he would have.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find that old eunuch Mo San Kong," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The five-person team did not hesitate and followed him directly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Dao also hurriedly followed behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tu Sihai couldn't help but ask curiously, "Brother Qi, the Shen Lingxuan you're looking for, could it be the Mysterious Yin Body from the Heaven Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"She's actually here? Brother Qi, this way... you might be putting her in danger. After all, she is the Mysterious Yin Body. If she's discovered, the consequences..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, she is, after all, my nominal wife. Surely she has some skills?" Qi Yuan had met Shen Lingxuan twice before.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's strength was much greater than she had revealed.</p><p></p><p>Probably even that Mo San Kong would have difficulty subduing her.</p><p></p><p>She had entered the ruins, perhaps with her own plans, or perhaps to avoid exposing her true strength and drawing the attention of the Heaven Realm experts from the Demon Realm who might try to kill her.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, even if you have them deliver the message, and Shen Lady hears it, she doesn't know where you are, does she?" the charming young woman voiced her doubt.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan was looking for his wife, she stopped being flirtatious and started acting innocent.</p><p></p><p>"Explaining this is too complicated," Qi Yuan said casually. "Simply put... I have technology."</p><p></p><p>Were the silver notes really just silver notes?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could perform all kinds of illusions and had the technology of a starship.</p><p></p><p>Tampering with the silver notes was child's play for him.</p><p></p><p>As long as they saw Shen Lingxuan, Qi Yuan would quickly know about it and her location.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's disguise might be able to fool these Earth Realm Armored Soldiers, but it couldn't fool Qi Yuan's technology.</p><p></p><p>The technology on the starship seemed to be related to the ancient clan's ruins.</p><p></p><p>That ancient clan's ruins were of great importance, not even the Yang Deities were anything special.</p><p></p><p>In terms of heritage, Qi Yuan estimated it was much stronger than the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Yin Deity Venerable was just a malnourished infant.</p><p></p><p>"Technology... what is that?" The people present were somewhat confused, unfamiliar with this term.</p><p></p><p>"Technology... is also a path of the Great Dao," Qi Yuan replied, expressing his insights.</p><p></p><p>The stronger his strength, the more insights he gained.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao's Immortal Techniques, the Myriad Dao Martial God's Martial Dao, and technology... they were all paths of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the end of any of these paths would likely be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a small, sealed room within the ruins, Shen Lingxuan, dressed in a black gown, emanated a cold, icy aura.</p><p></p><p>Her delicate face was furrowed with fine brows as she carefully flipped through a diary in front of her, which had been taken from a wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"They came to find me again today... I really want to refuse, but the compensation they offer is something I cannot refuse. For the sake of my poor child's safe delivery, I must defeat them!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, Liuwei learned a new dish, and it was very delicious."</p><p></p><p>"I encountered a blind Artifact Grandmaster, he has the highest Artifact Dao talent I've ever seen. I was ordered to invite him to join us, but he refused."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this is right or wrong, but I have no other choice... Once the Chaotic Star Realm is destroyed, the Blue Mountain Realm... will also be shrouded in darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Can I succeed? Can I?!"</p><p></p><p>"The fragments of the Luminous Treasure... can they really be forged?"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Enlightenment, will the Divines... truly protect us?"</p><p></p><p>"It has begun, there is no turning back. Either I die... or the Luminous Treasure manifests, or... I die, and the Divines will not bestow their Enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>The diary contained much information.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan read it carefully, her expression neither sad nor joyful.</p><p></p><p>After some time, she closed the diary and let out a deep sigh. "So, it seems Qi Shi has joined them, and is cultivating the fragments of the Luminous Treasure. Is it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at the ruins before her, sighing softly.</p><p></p><p>"Failure..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's dark."</p><p></p><p>"There should be a lot of mosquitoes by the lake. I don't know if Jinli is still waiting for me."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, where is the specific location of July Lake!"</p><p></p><p>Although the map is fully marked, it is not actually detailed enough, unable to be as precise as the Blue Star, which can pinpoint the exact building, and even some small mountains cannot be accurately located.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan has arrived in the vicinity, but the specific location of July Lake is still unknown.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several voices are heard.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "There are people, I can go ask them?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, by the lakeside, the moonlight is falling.</p><p></p><p>The air is filled with the smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>Two groups of powerful figures are holding weapons, swords drawn and bows taut.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the way your Moon Emperor clan welcomes guests? We have come all the way from Black Cloud City to see your sacrificial rites, and you won't even let us in?" The speaker is a one-eyed burly man, wearing an eye patch, looking particularly fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Wicked guests have come, of course we have reasons not to see you!" Another side, a green-haired man, says.</p><p></p><p>"It seems your Moon Emperor clan hasn't realized the consequences of offending us!" The one-eyed burly man brandishes a large knife, looking ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Emperor clan fears no threats." The green-haired man speaks up.</p><p></p><p>The two sides are at a standoff, arguing endlessly, seemingly ready to fight at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice comes: "Gentlemen, please stop. May I ask, do you know where July Lake, or rather, July Town, is?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appears beside these people, wearing a mask, his voice sincere.</p><p></p><p>After he finishes speaking, the two warring parties in the scene all look at him strangely.</p><p></p><p>"The place we are in now is the shore of July Lake," the one-eyed burly man speaks up, his voice rough.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan is stunned for a moment: "This is July Lake?"</p><p></p><p>Behind the two groups is a "lake" the size of a pond.</p><p></p><p>Isn't the lake supposed to be much bigger? This is too small, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>Where is Jinli? He looks around, but doesn't see Jinli anywhere. Could it be that he came to the wrong place?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for telling me." Qi Yuan feels a bit disappointed and thanks the one-eyed burly man.</p><p></p><p>Where is Jinli? Where is July Town?</p><p></p><p>He is about to leave and circle around the ancient Qigichun tree.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, the one-eyed burly man calls out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, don't leave yet, come and judge for us, who is right and who is wrong!" The one-eyed burly man's eyes reveal a ferocious smile.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly wants to find some entertainment.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I'm in a hurry, I still need to go to July Town to see an old friend." Qi Yuan's mood is low.</p><p></p><p>"I know where July Town is, you just need to judge who is right and who is wrong, and I'll tell you." The one-eyed burly man says.</p><p></p><p>"You're right!" Qi Yuan doesn't hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed burly man, hearing this, shakes his head: "This is no fun then."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, hearing this, can only forcibly calm himself down and wait here, acting as a qualified judge.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man sees this and says to Qi Yuan, "Sir, it's better for you to leave quickly, the people of the Hundred Cities Alliance are hunting down some scattered cultivators. If you stay here, you may get implicated."</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed burly man reveals a mocking smile: "How the people of the Moon Emperor clan love to smear others' reputations. Do you have any evidence that I am hunting this friend?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the evil reputation of the Hundred Cities Alliance need to be mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>"In our Hundred Cities Alliance, there is filial piety and the elderly are taken care of, where is the evil reputation? It is you Moon Emperor clan who do not even have basic manners.</p><p></p><p>We came to see your sacrificial rites, but were turned away at the door? Could it be that you want to imitate the Great Luo Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stands aside, completely confused.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know who is right and who is wrong.</p><p></p><p>It seems that both sides have a point.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Moon Emperor clan will never submit. If your Hundred Cities Alliance dares to come, I will kill one for every one that comes, a hundred people, I will kill a hundred!" The green-haired man says angrily.</p><p></p><p>Oh my!</p><p></p><p>Kill a hundred people?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knows who is right and who is wrong.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the one-eyed burly man then laughs coldly: "The three thousand members of the royal family of the Great Luo Kingdom were all slaughtered by us!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hears this and is completely shocked, there is an even more fierce one here.</p><p></p><p>He is in a hurry, afraid that something else will happen: "I know, they are right, you are wrong!"</p><p></p><p>He points to the people of the Hundred Cities Alliance, saying they are wrong.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finishes speaking, and then adds: "Now can you tell me where July Town is?"</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed burly man, hearing this, is stunned for a moment, then bursts out laughing: "Say again that we are wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The seven warriors behind him also look at Qi Yuan with a mocking and murderous gaze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asks: "Where is July Town?"</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed burly man laughs loudly: "I've never even heard of a place called July Town! There is no such thing as a July Town here!"</p><p></p><p>The people behind him are all laughing.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man sees this and reminds again: "Sir, you'd better leave quickly, the Hundred Cities Alliance are not good people."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignores this, standing quietly in place, his eyes staring intently at the one-eyed burly man: "Are you sure you're lying to me?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to be sure, it's just that, so what?</p><p></p><p>Ungrateful thing.</p><p></p><p>A scattered cultivator dares to show his face, this is courting death." The one-eyed burly man says contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan draws his sword, his expression becoming extremely gloomy for the first time: "I really hate it when someone lies to me, especially on such an important matter!"</p><p></p><p>If he was told the wrong address, Qi Yuan might be even later in seeing Jinli.</p><p></p><p>His time is already limited.</p><p></p><p>How can he not be angry! He holds the precious sword, and under the astonished gaze of the crowd, he strikes with thunderous force.</p><p></p><p>"For deceiving me, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>His speed is extremely fast, none of the people present had time to react, not even seeing a residual image, a neat cut appears on their necks.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan's sword tip rests on the one-eyed burly man's neck, the necks of the eight people behind him simultaneously spurt blood, spectacularly, then the sound of their bodies falling to the ground is heard.</p><p></p><p>"You really don't know where July Town is?" Qi Yuan presses the sword tip forward, pushing the one-eyed burly man's Adam's apple inward, fresh blood flowing.</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed burly man doesn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>A sword thrusts through the throat, Qi Yuan's aura is murderous.</p><p></p><p>His clothes, for some reason, also change color at this moment, as if dyed red by the blood.</p><p></p><p>Killing eight people with one sword, Qi Yuan is like killing insects.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man sees this, a flash of shock and deep wariness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you looking for someone?" He asks tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I want to go to the Moon Emperor Kingdom, July Town, a friend of mine said she's waiting for me there." Qi Yuan's tone is somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>This is in stark contrast to his just now swift killing of eight people.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't find the Moon Emperor Kingdom, nor can I find July Town, even though it's supposed to be right by the ancient Qigichun tree, right under the ancient Qigichun tree."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan holds the precious sword, his gaze cold and stern, wishing he could split the ancient Qigichun tree in half.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man, hearing this, has a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>"All the countries and cities around the ancient Qigichun tree seem to only have our Moon Emperor clan that matches what the sir said.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if your friend misspoke, or there was some other misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, it is actually July Lake, by July Lake, that our Moon Emperor clan has a branch, similar to a small town.</p><p></p><p>Sir, why don't you stay with us in the Moon Emperor clan, and let us know the information of the one you are looking for, we will help you find her."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, hearing this, coldly sweeps his gaze over these people: "You won't trick me, will you?"</p><p></p><p>He raises his hand, wiping the blood on the sword blade.</p><p></p><p>The blood from the one-eyed burly man's neck is still stained on the sword.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man, hearing this, inexplicably shivers.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we won't deceive the sir, but of course we in the Moon Emperor clan can't guarantee that we will definitely help the sir find that old friend!" The green-haired man says.</p><p></p><p>The reason he does this is that he sees Qi Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Hundred Cities Alliance besieging them, the Moon Emperor clan is struggling to hold on. Having one more ally would be one more ally.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan, hearing this, doesn't have a better solution.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he can get more useful information here in the Moon Emperor clan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the green-haired man says: "Now that our Moon Emperor clan is under attack from the Hundred Cities Alliance, the sir being here may implicate you."</p><p></p><p>"No matter." Qi Yuan says.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't care about any of this, as long as he can see Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask the sir to provide the information and appearance of the one you are looking for." The green-haired man's attitude is extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>"Her name is Jinli, she is the Southern Dry Empress, as for her appearance... I don't know, but she should be very beautiful, she is not old, when the snow falls on the ancient Qigichun tree, that should be when she turns twenty-nine and comes of age."</p><p></p><p>Note: In the World of the Waning Moon, women come of age at eighteen.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man silently records this information.</p><p></p><p>He says, "Is that lady waiting for the sir in July Town?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan says.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask the sir's name?" The green-haired man looks at Qi Yuan, "We..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You can spread this news around. If she knows that you are looking for her, perhaps she will come here as well."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The green-haired man remembered this information. "Why don't you come with us back to the Moon Emperor Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the Seven-Month Lake, then at the ancient Guchi Camphor Tree: "No, I'll wait here. If there's no news in half a month, I'll leave."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then slowly walked towards the lakeside. He found a green stone and sat down there, staring blankly at the emerald lake. The green-haired man and the Moon Emperor Clan members exchanged a glance, then silently disposed of the bodies of the Hundred Cities Alliance warriors on the ground. They quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat alone by the lake, embracing his sword, the moonlight falling on his shoulders as he gazed at the water, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"One sword killed nine warriors, including one Imperial-level expert and eight King-level ones. He must be a supreme Imperial Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The young lady in a green outfit was Cold Moon, the disciple of the sacrificial priestess of the Seven-Month branch of the Moon Emperor Clan.</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial priestess had gone to meet an old friend, and Cold Moon was now in charge here.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the pavilion, she looked towards the Seven-Month Lake and saw the man sitting quietly by the lakeside.</p><p></p><p>"Send people to find the person he's looking for. A supreme Imperial Sovereign is worth our effort to recruit."</p><p></p><p>Cold Moon commanded, and the green-haired man complied, then left.</p><p></p><p>Standing alone on the misty pavilion, Cold Moon sighed as she looked at the man's back.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the previous Bridal Princess was also waiting for the Heavenly Deity here, wasn't she? What a pity, what a pity. The Bridal Princess didn't wait for the Heavenly Deity and instead passed away here, leaving behind a new Bridal Princess. But the human world has now entered its darkest hour! The Hundred Cities Alliance, the running dogs of the evil demons, must be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>A cold glint appeared in Cold Moon's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the morning sun shone on the Seven-Month Lake, a resting bird suddenly flew away in fright from Qi Yuan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Any news?" Qi Yuan's voice was a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"No," the green-haired man said. "We've notified the other branches of the Moon Emperor Clan about the person you're looking for. If there's any news, we'll inform you immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Qi Yuan was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat dissatisfied. Why did his game interface disappear after leaving the Heavenly Abyss? That meant he couldn't contact Jinli. Now, with Jinli unable to contact or see him, he didn't know if she was worried or felt that he had broken his promise. Qi Yuan disliked being late, unless there were special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>He sat by the lake, and the green-haired man left after a while. As the sun slowly rose, the lakeside became lively. Some young ladies came to wash clothes, stealing glances at Qi Yuan, some shy, some fearful. Some children were playing noisily on the open ground nearby.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat there motionless, like a wooden stake. A little boy kept stealing glances at him, a hesitant expression on his face. Finally, he mustered the courage to approach Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Faceless man, may I call you that?"</p><p></p><p>"You may." Qi Yuan, hugging his sword, didn't turn his head.</p><p></p><p>The little boy patted his chest, as if to ease his nervousness. "You're so still, I thought you had died here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The curious little boy continued, "What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied, "I'm waiting for someone."</p><p></p><p>The boy said sadly, "When I was little, I used to wait here every day for my father to come home. Sometimes I would draw and write on the ground, and sometimes, when it got late, I would catch some fireflies..."</p><p></p><p>"When you were little?" Qi Yuan focused on that detail.</p><p></p><p>"I'm eight years old now."</p><p></p><p>"Such a young memory, you still remember it."</p><p></p><p>"It's only been two or three years, but I still remember what my father looked like. I even carved a figure of him, so I'll remember his appearance for the rest of my life." The boy happily took out a wooden carving of a man. "My father is a woodcarver, and I'll definitely become a great carver too!"</p><p></p><p>The boy's eyes shone with hope.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a dirty little boy ran over. "Ayu, do you want to eat some sugar hawthorns?"</p><p></p><p>The dirty boy's grimy hand opened to reveal three shriveled sugar hawthorns.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoping, where did you get these?" Ayu took one.</p><p></p><p>"I found them." Xiaoping noticed Qi Yuan and asked, "Weird uncle, do you want some?"</p><p></p><p>He held out the hawthorns to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ayu laughed awkwardly, "He's an adult, he won't eat your dirty hawthorns!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a call came, "Ayu, Xiaoping, come back, it's time to eat!"</p><p></p><p>"Weird uncle, we're leaving!" The two boys quickly ran off.</p><p></p><p>The lakeside became quiet again, with only Qi Yuan sitting there alone.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the boy named Ayu came again and chatted with Qi Yuan for a while before leaving. He said he would carve a statue for Qi Yuan in the future, using the best materials, because Qi Yuan had taught him some carving techniques.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, Qi Yuan noticed that the lakeside had become much quieter. The women of the Moon Emperor Clan no longer came to wash clothes, and the children were also absent.</p><p></p><p>The green-haired man came to see Qi Yuan, saying that the Hundred Cities Alliance would likely attack soon. They were still searching for Jinli.</p><p></p><p>That night, Qi Yuan sat alone by the lake. Suddenly, he stood up. "I can't just wait here anymore."</p><p></p><p>He decided to circle around the ancient Guchi Camphor Tree. Maybe he would encounter something. Unfortunately, he also understood that the probability was low, as it required the alignment of time, space, and people.</p><p></p><p>He flew towards the towering tree trunk. When he had flown about two-thirds of the way, he stopped in shock.</p><p></p><p>The massive Guchi Camphor Tree's branches were hanging with countless bodies - hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, more than he could count. Dry bones, decaying corpses, and fresh bodies with peaceful expressions...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was silent. He had never seen so many dead bodies before.</p><p></p><p>He continued flying around the tree trunk, searching with his powerful martial aura, but could not sense Jinli's presence.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I find her!" Qi Yuan was anxious and distressed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he stopped again, his pupils constricting. He recognized two familiar skeletons - the woman who had been holding a baby outside Kunwu City, and the child she had been embracing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt an inexplicable surge of anger. He drew his sword, about to slash the Guchi Camphor Tree.</p><p></p><p>But then, a melodious female voice called out, "Qi Yuan..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly turned around. In the soft moonlight, a graceful young lady stood there.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with disappointment. "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He knew this was not Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"I am Seven-Month, one of the Twelve Sacrificial Priestesses of the Moon Emperor Clan."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

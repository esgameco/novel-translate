        <h1>Chapter 368</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether this big boss Eastern Lord was friend or foe.</p><p></p><p>Although in the mural, Eastern Lord's character setting was that of a lovesick fool.</p><p></p><p>But that was only towards the female lead.</p><p></p><p>In romance dramas, the domineering CEO is good to the female lead, but a disaster for the maids and butlers around him.</p><p></p><p>What, the female lead angrily flipped over the food? Old Wang, quickly make ten more identical portions.</p><p></p><p>What, the female lead fainted from excessive sadness? </p><p></p><p>Dr. Wang, if you can't cure her, your whole family will pay with their lives!</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it feels good to identify with the female lead, but not so good to identify with the supporting characters.</p><p></p><p>Among the masses, most people are supporting characters.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also felt he was ordinary and unremarkable, just a minor Immortal Infant True Lord, merely a supporting character.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we still need to find Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>My fate is in my own hands, not heaven's. It's time for us supporting characters to stand up!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan declared passionately. </p><p></p><p>The subjects beside him looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>They were just looking for Eastern Lord, how did it turn into "my fate is in my own hands"?</p><p></p><p>But they had grown accustomed to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The divine lord was just like this, occasionally saying inexplicable things, with peculiar thought processes.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, with our strength, we wouldn't be supporting characters in any world, right?" Qi Qi said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other subjects also had strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by how common Yang Spirits were here, as plentiful as cabbages in a field.</p><p></p><p>But...even in the Innate Realm, if Qi Yuan hadn't come.</p><p></p><p>Even given hundreds of millions or billions of years, it might not have produced a single Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Holy Mother of No Food, even other mythical powerhouses had almost no chance of reaching the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>As for these subjects...well, forget about Yang Spirit, most of them couldn't even reach the Great Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Meeting Qi Yuan was the greatest opportunity of their lives.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan wasn't here holding them back.</p><p></p><p>If they were let loose in the Upper Realm, they would likely cause a commotion in the Immortal World.</p><p></p><p>After all, even in the Upper Realm, a Yang Spirit was the foundation of a holy land.</p><p></p><p>With a Yang Spirit present, a holy land could last for tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>"But Dad has a point, Eastern Lord's strength is unknown, we should keep a low profile," Qi Qi mentioned again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Right, it's better to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Even if he's not that strong, what if there's a booger in this Origin Land left behind by the Supreme Dao Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"This...the Dao Ancestor probably doesn't pick his nose, right?" Old Thunder God couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>"Even emperors use golden hoes, why wouldn't the Dao Ancestor pick his nose?" Qi Yuan said very seriously, "According to the Tang Girl Inequality Principle, just because the Dao Ancestor has high cultivation doesn't mean He doesn't pick His nose."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi couldn't help whispering: "Dad, even I haven't done that in a long time, how could the Dao Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe we should drop this topic, it might not be good to speculate about the Dao Ancestor?" Old Thunder God said.</p><p></p><p>When he was weak, Old Thunder God wouldn't have been afraid to curse the Dao Ancestor every day.</p><p></p><p>But now it was different, he was at the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>He had even visualized the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation of the Nine Heavens, and the South Pole Longevity Emperor, one of the Six Emperors.</p><p></p><p>The status of these two was extremely high, unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>So he was quite wary of supreme beings like the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, take me to where the purple qi was born, I want to try to learn from it, see if I can do some bulk purchasing."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>In a shattered palace, Fat Egg Martial Lord suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My father's... aura?"</p><p></p><p>Just a short while ago, as he was resting with his eyes closed, he suddenly caught a whiff of a familiar feeling, along with a stirring of his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>This feeling clearly meant his "father" had come out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, he had been extremely happy.</p><p></p><p>As expected of his never-met "father", Fat Egg Martial Lord's strength had been rising steadily.</p><p></p><p>This also led to a leap in his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had actually reached the Great Martial Lord realm of Martial Lord Stage 4.</p><p></p><p>This kind of improvement was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was related to his good foundation, which not only the beauties knew about, but all the other Martial Lords knew as well.</p><p></p><p>Before the Great Calamity, he had actually been a Titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Now with the leap in his bloodline, his strength frequently increased.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, his status in the Eastern Alliance rose again, and his position was upgraded.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had a hidden powerful father behind him.</p><p></p><p>By the looks of it, possibly at the Titled Martial Lord level.</p><p></p><p>"Fat Egg Martial Lord, your father has appeared?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, a voice came from the shattered palace, belonging to a thin old man.</p><p></p><p>This old man had also been a Titled Martial Lord before the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>However, he was now a Great Martial Lord of Martial Lord Stage 6, one of the higher-ups in the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I seem to have caught his scent, he should have come out of seclusion," Fat Egg Martial Lord said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he? Take me to meet this elder.</p><p></p><p>Our Eastern Alliance is not doing well these days, we need to absorb some fresh blood." The thin old man seemed expectant and urgent.</p><p></p><p>The tasks assigned by Eastern Lord had been progressing smoothly at first.</p><p></p><p>But over the past thousand years, suddenly many tasks had failed.</p><p></p><p>If the task completion rate couldn't reach 60%, when the Dawn's Call came, everyone would die.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Land, the End Land, the Mountain and Sea Scroll, would all be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Now, having an extra bit of strength was always good.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, I'll take you to meet my... father!" Fat Egg Martial Lord gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"Good." The thin old man nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What if my father doesn't recognize me?" Suddenly, Fat Egg Martial Lord hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Fat Egg Martial Lord is overthinking. Your bloodline is very strong, you should have inherited perfectly from him. He looks just like you, how could he not recognize you?" the thin old man said.</p><p></p><p>Fat Egg looked at his own round belly, and finally slowly nodded: "You have a point, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, the Sea of Ten Thousand Souls.</p><p></p><p>This was where the ends of the earth converged in the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>Exuberant vitality flourished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat alone, his clothes fluttering in the wind, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"All things in this world emerged from the Sea of Ten Thousand Souls.</p><p></p><p>Where did all things in the world come from?</p><p></p><p>Born of coincidence, or the One that escaped from the great Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Sea of Ten Thousand Souls, he thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>"No good, I can't think anymore, I'm going to grow a brain."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine realm was a mess, with all sorts of strange things.</p><p></p><p>Planets turned into footballs lying on a football field, dung beetles rolling huge spheres.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts were also a bit chaotic.</p><p></p><p>If he grew more brain or pondered too much, he feared his true spirit couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Qi Yuan felt that his body couldn't match up to his noble and clever mind.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, even someone as smart as me can't replicate the purple qi."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked ahead, countless bits of information pouring in.</p><p></p><p>But replicating the purple qi was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, if he sat here for ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, or even five million years, seeing different information every day, he might be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>But that would take too much time.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly there was a ripple in space behind him.</p><p></p><p>One fat and one thin figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Fat Egg Martial Lord craned his neck, looking around, searching for something.</p><p></p><p>When his gaze fell on Qi Yuan, he was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of shame spread.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to tear his own flesh to pieces.</p><p></p><p>This was too... perfect, wasn't it? "Is this my father?" Fat Egg Martial Lord took a deep breath, sucked in his stomach, trying to look slimmer.</p><p></p><p>The thin old man also looked doubtful, looking at Qi Yuan, then examining Fat Egg Martial Lord: "They don't really look alike."</p><p></p><p>However, the two didn't say anything more and flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Alliance Elder pays respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Alliance Fat Egg pays respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>The two bowed respectfully, standing to the side.</p><p></p><p>One fat and one thin, they were quite eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Although Fat Egg Martial Lord was trying his best to suck in his stomach, his figure was still much rounder than the Elder Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Several times wider.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't answer, his eyes still fixed on the Sea of Ten Thousand Souls: "What do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fat Egg Martial Lord felt somewhat dejected. </p><p></p><p>The boiling blood indicated that the person before him was truly his "biological father".</p><p></p><p>But the other's cold attitude made him inexplicably feel sad.</p><p></p><p>Bloodline martial arts, compared to immortal cultivation, develop much faster.</p><p></p><p>There are even benefits like bloodline leaps.</p><p></p><p>But there is a major problem - those with lower bloodlines tend to feel inexplicably close to those with the strongest bloodlines, and are easily influenced by them.</p><p></p><p>This is completely unimaginable for immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the Dawn's Call is about to begin, and progress on the Mountain and Sea Scroll is slow.</p><p></p><p>Our Eastern Alliance specially invites you to join us in this great endeavor!" Elder God Martial Lord said sincerely. Then he changed tack, "Your descendant, Fat Egg Martial Lord, has also been serving in the Eastern Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Elder God Martial Lord was playing the emotional card.</p><p></p><p>As for the benefits card? There was none.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Land was too poor, with no powerful benefits to offer.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this matter concerned life and death, and no Martial Lord could stay out of it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when the Dawn's Call begins, the world would fall into silence.</p><p></p><p>"Following you to save the world sounds quite interesting," Qi Yuan murmured. "However, saving the world is the job of heroes and chosen ones, and it takes too much time. I'm very busy and don't have time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Elder God Martial Lord was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had anticipated rejection, but hadn't expected it to be on the grounds of being "too busy to save the world".</p><p></p><p>"Senior, time... can always be squeezed out if you try," Elder God Martial Lord said.</p><p></p><p>Fat Egg Martial Lord couldn't help but add: "...Senior, whatever is keeping you busy, the Eastern Alliance can help resolve it for you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Fat Egg with appreciation: "I want to become a Spirit Realm Martial Lord, is there a way?"</p><p></p><p>This was his mission, with higher priority than saving the world.</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of that," Fat Egg Martial Lord frowned.</p><p></p><p>There were no records of Spirit Realm Martial Lords in the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Elder God Martial Lord also frowned, but then thought of something and said softly: "Although we don't know about Spirit Realm Martial Lords, the Eastern Lord's Wall might know!"</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Lord's Wall, what's that?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Within the Eastern Alliance, there is a magical wall left behind by the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>This wall knows all things in the world and can distinguish truth from falsehood.</p><p></p><p>Senior, in a short while, it will be time for the Ancestral Blood Battle. After the battle ends, the Eastern Lord's Wall will appear.</p><p></p><p>Then you can ask the Eastern Lord's Wall about Spirit Realm Martial Lords." Elder God Martial Lord said seriously, "If you're willing, I can recommend you as one of the three chief examiners for the Ancestral Blood Battle!</p><p></p><p>Chief examiners have the right to question the Eastern Lord's Wall!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered briefly: "Sounds... alright.</p><p></p><p>In that case, I'll reluctantly serve as a chief examiner."</p><p></p><p>He was looking forward to becoming a Spirit Realm Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Human Realm Martial Lord mission was almost complete.</p><p></p><p>Once he completed the Spirit Realm Martial Lord mission, he would break through to become a Myriad Dao Martial God, and this game would be over.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder God Martial Lord's face showed joy: "Congratulations on joining the Eastern Alliance, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, let me make it clear, in joining the Eastern Alliance, I won't swear allegiance to the Eastern Lord!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was here to play a game, not to pledge loyalty to anyone.</p><p></p><p>"No problem. Although our Eastern Alliance was established by the Eastern Lord, our purpose is to save the world, not to serve any individual.</p><p></p><p>If the Eastern Lord were to try to destroy the world, we would eliminate him too!" Elder God Martial Lord quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "In that case, I'll go take a look at your Eastern Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me, Senior." Elder God Martial Lord said.</p><p></p><p>The three quickly headed towards the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Fat Egg Martial Lord followed behind the two, his expression conflicted. Finally, he mustered up the courage and said softly: "Senior, please wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan stopped, wariness in the depths of his eyes, "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Anyone who says something like "Fellow Daoist, please wait" usually doesn't have good intentions.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask... are you my long-lost... father?" Fat Egg Martial Lord stammered, finally asking the question that had puzzled him for years.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of his several-thousand-jin body, there was still a trace of childlike innocence.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>Even Great Martial Lords would involuntarily show expressions typical of juniors when faced with a stronger, more perfect bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Fat Egg Martial Lord, barely keeping his composure: "Don't spread rumors, I just got married recently and don't have a child as old as you!"</p><p></p><p>On his household register, there were currently only three people.</p><p></p><p>Himself, Little Wife, and Golden Canary.</p><p></p><p>There was no Fat Egg Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fat Egg Martial Lord's expression couldn't help but show disappointment and dejection.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>He said no more, hurting alone.</p><p></p><p>He understood now, it must be that his mother was too ugly, so she had disgusted his father to the point of not acknowledging him.</p><p></p><p>He was also helpless - why did he inherit from his mother and not his father?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>On the abandoned ship, Mu Yan looked at the ancestor before him, deep respect in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Behind Mu Yan were several peak Martial Kings who had come out from the base with him.</p><p></p><p>Some of these peak Martial Kings had Martial Lord imprints, while others had pledged loyalty to Mu Yan, helping him achieve good results in the Ancestral Blood Battle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Yan looked at a clone of the ancestor with reverence.</p><p></p><p>It was just a clone, but Mu Yan could sense that if the ancestor wished, he could kill everyone present with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>This was a Martial Lord, what all martial artists dreamed of becoming.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, accomplished at a young age. In this Ancestral Blood Battle, strive to enter the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>As long as you enter the top thirty and receive the Ancestral Blood Baptism, you will definitely reach the Martial Lord realm within ten years!" the ancestor's clone praised.</p><p></p><p>All peak Martial Kings with Martial Lord imprints would receive the Ancestral Blood Baptism.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancestral Blood Battle determined the degree of the baptism.</p><p></p><p>For those ranked at the bottom, even with the baptism, it might take many years to reach the Martial Lord realm, and even then, their potential would be exhausted for life, only able to stay at the first level of Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"This junior will do his utmost to reach the top thirty!" Mu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"If you enter the top thirty, I can grant you a small request," the Martial Lord valued this descendant highly, "Tell me now, what do you need?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan was excited internally. Thinking of something, he then said: "On the way through the Black Sea, we encountered a crisis, and a peak Martial King named Qi Yuan saved my life.</p><p></p><p>However, he had a conflict with Zhi Xian and killed him. Behind Zhi Xian stands the Stacked Cat Martial Lord. I hope the ancestor can intervene to resolve this grudge."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>During the Black Sea journey, Qi Yuan had intervened many times, resolving many difficulties.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, he had also saved Mu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Good, you have loyalty and righteousness, you are my good descendant.</p><p></p><p>I will help with this matter.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, have him apologize to the Stacked Cat Martial Lord, and the matter will be settled." The Martial Lord seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, ancestor!" Mu Yan was also delighted.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's life was saved.</p><p></p><p>However, he thought of something and then said: "The Eastern Alliance is currently short of people.</p><p></p><p>This Brother Qi is the strongest and most talented among all the Martial Kings I've seen. I wonder if he has a chance to participate in the Ancestral Blood Battle?"</p><p></p><p>He was still thinking of helping Qi Yuan by letting him participate in the Ancestral Blood Battle.</p><p></p><p>The peak Martial Kings behind Mu Yan heard this, and jealousy flashed in the depths of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they didn't want to see Qi Yuan participate in the Ancestral Blood Battle.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lord pondered: "Without a Martial Lord imprint, one is not qualified to participate in the Ancestral Blood Battle.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing must be approved by the chief examiners.</p><p></p><p>Each chief examiner has strength at the level of a titled Martial Lord. I am of low rank and cannot decide."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan was somewhat disappointed, but still said gratefully: "This junior was presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>Recommended novel, you can check it out, link below</p><p>Book title: "Surviving as the Saint Son in the Demonic Sect, I Just Want to Stay Pure"</p><p></p><p>Recommendation: As the Saint Son of the Demonic Sect, I really just want to stay pure!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

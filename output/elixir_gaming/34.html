        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is it you?" Qi Yuan glanced at Dong Xian and couldn't help but take a step back.</p><p></p><p>The further away he could keep from people like Dong Xian who seemed to have the protagonist's fate, the better.</p><p></p><p>In the TV shows or anime that Qi Yuan watched, whenever a supporting character suddenly showed special care for the protagonist, you didn't even need to think about it - that person was about to get stabbed, and then the protagonist would awaken their inner power.</p><p></p><p>So many TV shows had comments like this.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Fei."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not an old man, and he didn't want to get stabbed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qi Yuan, I have an impolite request, I don't know if I should say it." Dong Xian said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hurriedly said, "You shouldn't say it."</p><p></p><p>This immediately shut down what Dong Xian was about to say.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan also started to look at Dong Xian seriously.</p><p></p><p>[He is an ordinary young man, the remnant soul within him has awakened, he is a weapon forger, and this weapon forger has taken a liking to your kitchen knife.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Dong Xian didn't react, Qi Yuan patted his shoulder, "Young man, there is a strange fire in the back kitchen of Shengyao Peak, I feel it's quite compatible with you."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan directly left.</p><p></p><p>However, as he was walking, he helped conceal the aura of the knife.</p><p></p><p>Just now, that remnant soul had taken a liking to his knife, which had aroused his vigilance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Dong Xian was still standing in the same spot, looking bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Strange fire? What is that?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Elder Qi's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"This Qi Yuan, you must be careful, he is not as simple as he appears."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, when I was in close contact with him, I detected that his kitchen knife had blood on it."</p><p></p><p>"Blood? Isn't that normal?" </p><p></p><p>"The blood of an Elixir Cultivator." Elder Qi said.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Elixir Cultivator?</p><p></p><p>That kitchen knife... had killed an Elixir Cultivator? You must know that Elixir Cultivators are highly revered in the Great Merchant Nation, almost like imperial servants.</p><p></p><p>That ordinary-looking kitchen knife had actually touched the blood of an Elixir Cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Was it a reward given to Qi Yuan by the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak?</p><p></p><p>No wonder Elder Qi said that the kitchen knife was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qi continued, "This Qi Yuan, can only be a friend, not an enemy."</p><p></p><p>He had one more thing to say, that the blood was recently acquired.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian couldn't help but laugh, "What do I have to do with being an enemy of the First Disciple of a Peak? "</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Seven-Color Peak, Jiang Ling Su looked quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you want to leave the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded, "I've already spoken to the Sect Master, and he has agreed to let me go out to build my foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Build the foundation? " Jiang Ling Su was puzzled, "Why do you have to leave the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Couldn't he build his foundation right here on Seven-Color Peak?</p><p></p><p>"Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was stunned for a moment, "Big Brother, sometimes you do speak quite sensibly.</p><p></p><p>But... I feel like you're not just leaving to build your foundation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, "I, your big brother, am escaping for my life, in order to seek a chance at immortality."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he was similar to the tragic figure Nan Gong Xian, daring to gamble for a lifetime of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was speechless, "Big Brother, speak normally."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan said, "Aren't I afraid that the Black Mountain Sect will suspect me of killing Chu Tian Xiong and the others? If the old crow from the Black Mountain Sect brings troops to the peak, and I'm trapped here, won't that be a dead end? It's better to hide outside, wait for the heat to die down, and then come back."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su: "...Big Brother, you'd better just leave quickly, I'm afraid that if I stay with you any longer, my brain will be lost."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su had a look of disdain.</p><p></p><p>However, she thought of something and reminded, "Big Brother, be careful when you're out there alone. </p><p>The people from the Black Mountain Sect might get desperate and cause you trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Great minds think alike, I also feel the Black Mountain Sect has vicious ambitions!" Qi Yuan agreed vehemently.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su: "...Big Brother, I wish you were a mute, you would definitely be a rare beauty then."</p><p></p><p>It's just that when he opens his mouth... he kneels.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this doesn't mean Qi Yuan's voice is unpleasant, but rather that the content of his speech is outrageous.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The two vacant 'Heavenly' spots are still available, those who want to adjust their positions, hurry up, it only takes one spirit stone!" </p><p></p><p>On the spiritual boat, a female cultivator in the Qi Refining Realm called out to the passengers of the Earthly Number.</p><p></p><p>This was a flying boat heading to the Bloodless City.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodless City, located in the northernmost part of the Great Merchant Nation, was a rather chaotic city.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Bloodless City was close to the territory of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, not many righteous cultivators were willing to go there.</p><p></p><p>However, a type of blood crystal was produced outside the Bloodless City.</p><p></p><p>This blood crystal was quite valuable and could be used by some cultivators for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So many scattered cultivators and even disciples of major sects would go to the Bloodless City to collect the blood crystals and improve their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was sitting on this spiritual boat.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual boat was a Foundation Establishment Artifact.</p><p></p><p>But unlike ordinary Foundation Establishment Artifacts, its points were all focused on speed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard the "Stewardess's" words and was quite moved.</p><p></p><p>The other day when he had touched the corpse, he was a poor man who had just...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I wish I could sit in the first-class cabin of a luxury airship," he thought. But then he remembered that he was on an important mission, so he suppressed that desire to maintain a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a beautiful and elegant woman next to him struck up a conversation. "Fellow Daoist, are you also here to mine blood crystals in the Bloodless City? Your demeanor is quite extraordinary, so you must be a senior disciple."</p><p></p><p>The woman was dressed exquisitely, with her hair in an elaborate bun adorned with a peach wood hairpin. She wore a simple yet graceful green robe, giving an air of refined elegance and dignity. It was clear she was a wealthy woman.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was surprised that even with his disguise, his good looks were still recognized. "I am but a wandering cultivator," he replied.</p><p></p><p>"Wandering cultivators are quite admirable, with their unwavering determination," the woman sighed. "I was once a wandering cultivator myself in my youth, but now that I'm older, I've joined a sect and prefer a more stable lifestyle."</p><p></p><p>"But Sister, you are still in your prime," Qi Yuan said. </p><p></p><p>'If only I had known how beautiful this woman was when I was younger,' he thought, 'I might have mistaken her for a young beauty.'</p><p></p><p>This alluring and wealthy woman would surely have many admirers. Though Qi Yuan possessed the powerful "Tyrannical Strength" ability, he did not share the same lustful tendencies as some others.</p><p></p><p>"You really know how to flatter, Fellow Daoist," the woman said with a coy smile, admiring Qi Yuan's tall, muscular frame.</p><p></p><p>She then warned him, "Be careful of the people from the Black Mountain Sect when you go to the Bloodless City to mine blood crystals. Offending the city lord is not as bad as offending the Black Mountain Sect - if you anger them, it may cost your whole family their lives." A trace of fear and disgust flashed in her eyes as she mentioned the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was alarmed. "The Black Mountain Sect is that ruthless? They would kill an entire family?" He worried that if the Black Mountain Sect found out he had killed Lu Tian Xiong, they might come after his family as well. But then he realized he didn't have any family to speak of - he was all alone in the world.</p><p></p><p>The woman nodded grimly. "The Black Mountain Sect is a powerful and tyrannical force. Not only do we have to give one-tenth of our mined blood crystals to the city lord, we also have to hand over two-tenths, sometimes even more, to the Black Mountain Sect." She gritted her teeth, clearly angered by this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was outraged. "The Bloodless City doesn't even belong to the Black Mountain Sect! How dare they be so arrogant and greedy, worse than any capitalist!" </p><p></p><p>The woman hushed him, "Careful, Fellow Daoist, don't let the Black Mountain Sect's people hear you. You'll be in serious trouble."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan told himself that he wasn't just acting selfishly - he was upholding justice! He had taken the moral high ground against the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>He chatted amiably with the beautiful woman during the rest of the river voyage. Of course, this had more to do with his good looks and youthful charm than his social skills.</p><p></p><p>After about five hours, the boat docked. As the cultivators disembarked, the woman politely invited Qi Yuan, "If you have nowhere to stay, you're welcome to lodge at my place for the night."</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan declined. He needed to hurry, or he would miss the last boat back. After all, he had just committed a murder - he couldn't risk returning to the crime scene.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an unsatisfied voice called out, "Mother, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>A young woman in an elegant court dress approached, accompanied by a Foundation Establishment female cultivator. She eyed Qi Yuan with obvious hostility.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Fellow Daoist Liu Piao," Qi Yuan said, quickly taking his leave.</p><p></p><p>The young woman linked arms with the beautiful woman. "Mother, who was that man?"</p><p></p><p>The woman smiled, "Little Ruo, you're always so suspicious of everyone. He was just a wandering cultivator I happened to chat with, who has come to the Bloodless City to mine blood crystals. I thought he seemed quite decent, so I spoke with him. You're not getting any younger, you should start looking for a cultivation partner."</p><p></p><p>The young woman's wariness faded. "With the huge blood crystal mine I have to manage, I hardly have time for that. And Mother, even though I'm not the most gifted cultivator, I'm not just going to settle for some random wandering cultivator. Ugh, I still have to go meet with the Black Mountain Sect in an hour."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Black Mountain Sect, a troubled look crossed the young woman's face.</p><p></p><p>Happy Qixi Festival!

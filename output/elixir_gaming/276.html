        <h1>Chapter 276</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Yin Spirit Elder smiled and said, "The Blood Robe Sword Immortal's actions at the Divine Flower Meeting were truly breathtaking!"</p><p></p><p>His voice carried a tone of flattery.</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Spirits also had some understanding of the Divine Flower Meeting affair, and they all chimed in with praise.</p><p></p><p>"Using one divine technique to fish for techniques from all under heaven - the elder's methods are brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"This isn't just brilliant, it's selfless and righteous! Divine techniques are so precious, how can ordinary techniques compare? The Blood Robe Sword Immortal generously shared his divine technique, contributing it to everyone under heaven to deal with the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>As the group of Yin Spirit Elders heaped on praise and discussed animatedly, Qi Yuan started to feel a bit elated.</p><p></p><p>"Am I really so righteous and selfless?"</p><p></p><p>"So my actions had such profound meaning?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder ancient emperors loved to hear flattery!"</p><p></p><p>Though he felt somewhat lightheaded, Qi Yuan remained calm inside.</p><p></p><p>Because he remembered that in his previous life on Blue Star, there was once a reading comprehension question on the college entrance exam about a scarecrow. </p><p></p><p>One of the questions asked what the scarecrow in the field represented. The correct answer was that the scarecrow was the author's father, expressing the author's longing for his father.</p><p></p><p>When the author learned of this, he cursed loudly. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to tell the exam writer: The scarecrow in the field is YOUR father.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quietly enjoyed everyone's flattery, and also took note of their "deep interpretations", thinking they might come in handy next time.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, why don't you register for an account?" Qi Yuan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirits hurriedly began registering according to Qi Yuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very pleased. Without even giving out eggs, he got these people to register accounts.</p><p></p><p>If only he still had a connection to Blue Star. With the backing of a great world, making money by having people register for accounts would be too easy.</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's orders, the Yin Spirits all registered accounts one after another.</p><p></p><p>They looked expectant, wanting to know what great deed the Blood Robe Sword Immortal had done.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan said casually:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the favor I need from you is to make a cut... no, I'll give you a link, and you can go help boost my junior sister."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan used the jade slip of the Divine Flower Meeting's president to send these Yin Spirits the link to help boost Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirits present looked at each other in bewilderment when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Especially those who understood what "boosting" meant were even more confused.</p><p></p><p>Although it was common for juniors to invite others to help boost them,</p><p></p><p>For Yin Spirits of their level, no one would dare ask them to boost.</p><p></p><p>So this was the first time they were boosting anyone.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing that the favor the Blood Robe Sword Immortal wanted was to boost his junior sister,</p><p></p><p>They all felt it was absurd and unreal.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword Immortal, this old one has successfully boosted. Is there anything else you need us to do?" You Hua Dazun spoke up at this point.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how they felt, the other Yin Spirit Elders all boosted Jiang Lingsu at this time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they became curious about the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's junior sister, that Spirit Girl.</p><p></p><p>Could she also be a powerhouse at the Great Venerable level?</p><p></p><p>"This help is very good, thank you all," said Qi Yuan. "If you want to help more, put some effort into collecting techniques and uploading them here."</p><p></p><p>To him, techniques were the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Seeking Dao Palace was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>They were already collecting and uploading techniques to the Original God Sharing Association as the Blood Robe Sword Immortal had said.</p><p></p><p>These were just small matters to them.</p><p></p><p>The instructions they wanted to receive were arrangements for dealing with the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"When does the elder plan to take action against the great calamity? We are willing to serve!" said the Sect Master of the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity also had wings.</p><p></p><p>Like Dark Sun, who was an extremely powerful wing of the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>But besides Dark Sun, there were other wings, some strong and some weak.</p><p></p><p>The weak ones naturally needed them to eliminate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these people and shook his head: "Your strength is too weak."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these blunt words, the Yin Spirit Elders present couldn't help but feel complex emotions like... inferiority.</p><p></p><p>They were actually considered too weak.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were overlords of their respective powers, but now coming to offer support, this was the result they got.</p><p></p><p>They found it hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>"Don't feel inferior," Qi Yuan consoled them with high emotional intelligence. "Although you don't even qualify to play suona in my band or be part of my music troupe, when I go to destroy the great calamity, you can cheer '666' on the sidelines."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirits looked at each other again, speechless.</p><p></p><p>They naturally knew about the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's music troupe.</p><p></p><p>When killing people, the Blood Robe Sword Immortal would send his music troupe to play suona.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even qualify to play suona for the Blood Robe Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>You Hua Dazun felt somewhat unbalanced: "Elder, do we really not even qualify for this?"</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Spirits felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>But after saying this, You Hua Dazun also felt it was quite absurd that he was dissatisfied about not being allowed to play suona.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to battle the great calamity, the shockwaves from the battle would certainly be very strong. If you went to play music and got too close, you'd be finished off by a stray shockwave. If you stayed far away, even using all your strength, I wouldn't be able to hear you playing suona," Qi Yuan said seriously. "My music troupe is full, and their strength is also very high. </p><p></p><p>Last time when the Four Generals of the Lei family came, I casually sent a few members of my music troupe, and they slaughtered them all!"</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, his music troupe, mourning troupe, chef troupe, and coffin-bearing troupe were already quite complete.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't encounter suitable strong individuals, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to recruit more.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Spirits were still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the Yin Spirits present were shocked to their core.</p><p></p><p>"The music troupe... killed the Four Generals of the Lei family?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword Immortal really does have extremely powerful subordinates!"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Spirits were astounded, and also deeply wary.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Robe Sword Immortal was even more terrifying than imagined, not fighting alone.</p><p></p><p>If even the music troupe could kill the Four Generals of the Lei family, they indeed couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>"Since you want to follow me, join the Original God Sharing Association and do some logistics work," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, these Yin Spirits represented nearly a quarter of the powerful forces in these twenty-some domains.</p><p></p><p>Though they were weak, they still had some use.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yin Spirits were reluctant but nodded with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Some felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they would still feel fear facing the great calamity directly.</p><p></p><p>Doing logistics work at least... seemed safer.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"As you command!"</p><p></p><p>This group of Yin God Venerables bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>In their hearts, they admired the Blood Robed Sword God even more.</p><p></p><p>With so many Yin Gods pledging loyalty, if the Blood Robed Sword God wished, he could immediately become the leader of the most powerful faction in the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Blood Robed Sword God seemed to care nothing for this.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Having gained some new subordinates, he assigned some tasks to these Yin God Venerables.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than collecting cultivation methods and martial arts manuals.</p><p></p><p>In addition, they were to purify the atmosphere in various places.</p><p></p><p>Especially patrolling different areas, as well as the Divine Flower Society forum.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who spoke ill of the Blood Robed Sword God was to face righteous judgment and have their past scrutinized.</p><p></p><p>After all, daring to badmouth the Blood Robed Sword God today, wouldn't that mean they might betray the Azure Waves Realm tomorrow? Qi Yuan casually gave a few instructions, then his form vanished.</p><p></p><p>Only the hundred-odd Yin Gods remained standing in place.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Path-Seeking Palace couldn't help but sigh: "The Blood Robed Sword God is truly a divine being."</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Yu Hua also marveled: "Perhaps only an extraordinary person can lead us to defeat the great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Thirty thousand years ago..." An Yin God Venerable sighed, lost in complex thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Light Swan City.</p><p></p><p>Young men and women recalled the figure that had just flashed by in the sky, complex emotions still lingering in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>For that figure was none other than the Blood Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Blood Robed Sword God had returned to Light Swan City. Any cultivator who saw that blood-red figure stopped what they were doing, bowed respectfully, expressing reverence for the powerful.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a voice sounded by Shi Rulan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Shi, is the senior Blood Robed Sword God as wise and valiant as the legends say?" a female cultivator asked.</p><p></p><p>Shi Rulan and Shi Rushan had come to Light Swan City from another domain, meeting this chatty female cultivator along the way.</p><p></p><p>Shi Rulan nodded halfheartedly, her mind elsewhere: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>The talkative female cultivator continued: "That divine technique on the Divine Flower Society was released by this great one. </p><p></p><p>Oh right, Sister Shi, have you not boosted anyone yet? Would you like to boost me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a trace of displeasure flashed in Shi Rulan's eyes, and her attitude became extremely cold: "I detest that sort of thing!"</p><p></p><p>An apologetic look appeared on Shi Rushan's face, but his eyes also held an icy coldness that kept people at a distance: "I'm sorry, but my sister and I must be going."</p><p></p><p>The two siblings left the inn, their forms vanishing.</p><p></p><p>Only the chatty woman remained, looking utterly baffled. She didn't understand why the Shi siblings' attitude had suddenly turned so cold.</p><p></p><p>On the road, this pair of siblings had seemed very gentle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shi Rushan and Shi Rulan were quickly departing, rapidly conversing.</p><p></p><p>"Did you record it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I looked at him once and have already recorded his aura!"</p><p></p><p>"Good. Such a dangerous element must be eliminated, otherwise how much disaster and uncertain future will it bring to the Azure Waves Realm?</p><p></p><p>As Fate Practitioners, we must do something for the Azure Waves Realm." Shi Rushan's face was full of devotion.</p><p></p><p>Shi Rushan and Shi Rulan were both at the Purple Palace realm of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Their strength was not great, but they came from Fate Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This was an ancient legacy.</p><p></p><p>Fate Mountain had existed even before the great calamity came to the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of Fate Mountain called themselves Fate Practitioners, and were the correctors of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>To them, the operation of Heaven's Way had its own rules, which should be followed step by step.</p><p></p><p>Any change was a violation of the rules and detrimental to the world.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robed Sword God speaks heresy and deceives the masses, causing so much disaster.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, I've seen how many cultivators have turned against their own kin to collect cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>He is the root cause of all this evil, yet those cultivators actually revere him and worship him as a god. How absurd!" Shi Rulan's voice was full of anger and incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the world are all foolish." Shi Rushan sighed, "People like us who can see fate are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the Blood Robed Sword God to grow and challenge the great calamity would absolutely be a huge disaster for the Azure Waves Realm!</p><p></p><p>Thirty thousand years ago, if our ancestors had not turned the tide to save the world, how many innocent people in the Azure Waves Realm would have perished?"</p><p></p><p>Thirty thousand years ago, the ancestors of Fate Mountain foresaw a great catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>They saw visions of the land sinking, the Azure Waves Realm shattering into pieces, all living beings suffering, the world falling silent.</p><p></p><p>So, to prevent the end of the world, the ancestors of Fate Mountain actively approached the great calamity and reported the source of all disasters - that terrifying Yang God powerhouse - to the beings behind the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>In their view, they had prevented the demise of countless living beings, which could be considered saving the world.</p><p></p><p>This was also their glory.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's our turn to sacrifice ourselves to save this world!" Shi Rulan's gaze was determined, "For the sake of the world, sacrificing oneself is a duty that cannot be shirked!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Rushan's eyes were also blazing.</p><p></p><p>Dying for the world was a proud thing.</p><p></p><p>"Our strength is meager. Only through the Gate of Fate can we affect him, but unfortunately his power is too strong.</p><p></p><p>Even if we use the Gate of Fate, we cannot kill him.</p><p></p><p>But the Gate of Fate plus the Water of the Chaos-Defiling Bird will make him go mad and confused.</p><p></p><p>A deranged cultivator can no longer change the operation of this world, nor will he have the power to face the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The end of the world will not occur!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Rulan nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>Fate has its own trajectory, and everything is the best choice.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword God rashly destroyed the Dark Sun, collected cultivation methods, and caused unrest, already bringing turmoil to the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he provokes the great calamity and incurs its frenzied retaliation, how many innocent people would be implicated?</p><p></p><p>Thirty thousand years ago, if their ancestors had not turned the tide, perhaps half the living beings in the Azure Waves Realm would have perished.</p><p></p><p>So, in Fate Mountain, they foresaw the change in fate's trajectory, and thus came down the mountain to erase this anomaly that was the Blood Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their strength was insufficient to erase him.</p><p></p><p>All they could do was use the Gate of Fate plus the Water of the Chaos-Defiling Bird to drive the Blood Robed Sword God mad.</p><p></p><p>A deranged Yin God might cause turmoil in one domain, with countless beings perishing.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the entire Azure Waves Realm, this sacrifice was worth it.</p><p></p><p>"All for fate!"</p><p></p><p>"All for the destined trajectory!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

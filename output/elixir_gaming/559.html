        <h1>Chapter 559</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his finger, and the turtle-like creature struggling with its limbs in the air was foolish and dull, trying to grab and bite the finger, but its limbs were too short and its strength too weak, unable to flip over.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying existence of the second layer of the Yang God, at this moment, was no different from a foolish and ordinary turtle, how could this not shock people?</p><p></p><p>The four people of Xian Ling, Ying Jun, and others looked at Qi Yuan, and the shock in their hearts was easy to imagine.</p><p></p><p>The Yang God hidden in Wu Chun's consciousness also revealed his figure at this moment.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, trembling her body and respectfully saluting.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior."</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang also quickly snapped out of their daze and saluted respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's previous move had indeed stunned them.</p><p></p><p>The majestic existence of the second realm of the Yang God was easily grasped by the person in front of them.</p><p></p><p>What kind of realm was this?</p><p></p><p>The legendary Great Zhi Principle?</p><p></p><p>As for the higher Realm Lords, they didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lords were to them as the Yang Gods were to mortals, the gap was too far.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jun blinked his eyes, his expression twisted: "You... really became a Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>He remembered the message Qi Yuan had sent before.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Later, he convinced himself that his brother wasn't driving a Range Rover, and he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>But now, his brother was actually driving a space battleship.</p><p></p><p>The rest were also stunned. Realm Lord? The cosmic overlord Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>This young man in front of them was the Realm Lord? "Yes, he is the Realm Lord, didn't I tell you already? Could it be that you have also suffered from amnesia and forgotten?"Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jun's mood was up and down, he stared at Qi Yuan, his thoughts countless.</p><p></p><p>As for the expressions of the other three, they were even more spectacular.</p><p></p><p>Realm Lord, it was the legendary Realm Lord!</p><p></p><p>In the universe of Zhou, the Realm Lords were high above, almost never appearing in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yang Gods might not have the qualifications to see a Realm Lord in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>But they actually saw... a living Realm Lord? However, in the next breath, Xian Ling Ying Jun's reaction made them unable to hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Hey... Brother Qi Yuan, cough cough, don't you owe me some favors?" Xian Ling Ying Jun was very bold, his expression fawning and ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>The other three were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Directly calling the Realm Lord's name, weren't they afraid of not even having a true spirit left? And directly telling the Realm Lord that he owed him a favor, that was also too lacking in emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Weren't they afraid that the Realm Lord would get angry and kill them all in a fit of rage?</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded, his reaction calm.</p><p></p><p>"How about this... I'll call you... Grandpa?" Xian Ling Ying Jun shamelessly said.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to be an adoptive father or godfather, after all, the Realm Lord was too far above him.</p><p></p><p>The three around them felt that Xian Ling Ying Jun was audacious and shameless, but they didn't dare to show any expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were not familiar with this Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>If... this Realm Lord killed them, no one could save them.</p><p></p><p>They also didn't dare to speculate on the Realm Lord's thoughts, after all, for an existence of that realm, their speculation was like ants speculating about gods.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The source of the strange, the origin of the Black Sky, is divided, the energy is limitless, and it has a polluting nature... Where the source of the strange is, the Black Sky is present.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the source of the strange in his hand, a curious expression flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>From this Yang God, Qi Yuan extracted a strand of the source of the strange.</p><p></p><p>As for the source of the strange on Kai Huang, since it had been activated, it could not be extracted.</p><p></p><p>The source of the strange in front of him was about the size of a long grain of rice, crystal clear, and dazzling to the heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the strange god of the Black Sky and Black Earth wants to invade the universe of Zhou through the source of the strange..."</p><p></p><p>Through the source of the strange and the turtle-like Yang God, Qi Yuan learned a lot.</p><p></p><p>This Yang God of the Black Sky and Black Earth was using the source of the strange to pollute and fish.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Garden, there were many tasks to record the aura of the source of the strange.</p><p></p><p>Many Void Travelers came to the Shen Mu Universe to record the aura of the source of the strange.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the Yang God of the Black Sky and Black Earth would take action, control these Void Travelers, and implant the source of the strange into their true spirits, and then have them bring it into the Void Garden.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the source of the strange would take root in the universe of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>To the Black Sky and Black Earth, the universe of Zhou was the second Shen Mu Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Black Sky and Black Earth so confident?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The universe of Zhou was not the Shen Mu Universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe of Zhou had the existence of the Realm Lords of the Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength alone, a hundred or even a thousand Shen Mu Universes would not be a match for the universe of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky and Black Earth actually had the confidence to make a move on the universe of Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sky... what is it exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"I really want to see the Black Sky once."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>If he could see the Black Sky with his own eyes, he would know the roots of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see what this so-called Black Sky was.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Yuexian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng, dressed in black, looked like an ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingmiao was drinking some wine, with a hint of sadness in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qingmiao, the matter has come to this, there is no use in being sad." Shangguan Qingteng comforted.</p><p></p><p>They two had followed Yan's orders and rushed from the Tai Star Domain to the Luan Star Domain to rescue the talented Qi Yuan who had the potential to break through the Ancestor God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before they left, the Qingyu Army, Zhanxing Army, Tuoxing Army and a total of seventeen major armies from the Tai Star Domain rushed to the front line to block the Black Sky and Black Earth's main army.</p><p></p><p>These major armies, when added together, numbered over a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>They marched in a hurry, without a moment's rest, rushing to the front, undaunted by wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>After three years of marching, as soon as they arrived at the battlefield, they rushed to the very front line, and in less than three months... they were all wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Sweat and flesh and blood filled the front line.</p><p></p><p>But the result... the front line still fell.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving this news, Shangguan Qingmiao's mood could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Deeply grieved.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, you say... were their deaths worth it? Can the later generations... protect this great land?" Shangguan Qingmiao had a look of deep sorrow.</p><p></p><p>This was not the only such example. Over the years, the number of heroic spirits buried on the front lines of the Shen Mu Universe was countless.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sea was like a huge meat grinder.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng's eyes were filled with a sense of helplessness as he sighed, "Do our best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p></p><p>Surrendering meant certain death, and resisting also meant death, but at least... it would be dying on their feet.</p><p></p><p>"I say, it's better to join the Guangyao Association. Maybe we'll have a slim chance of survival!" Shangguan Qingmiao said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng's eyes flashed with a profound look: "In this universe, there can be those who compromise, but there also need to be those who dare to fight, and we happen to be the ones who dare to fight."</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyao Association, the highest leader on the Shenmuwu side was Wan, the brother of Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Yuan chose the path of enlightening the people.</p><p></p><p>Wan chose the path of enlightening the gods.</p><p></p><p>If the path of enlightening the people is exhausted, the path of enlightening the gods can carry the torch of Shenmuwu into the Yaoguang Universe and rekindle it.</p><p></p><p>Of course... will the benevolent Yaoguang Universe just let you live? That is something no one can predict.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I've always been arrogant and overbearing. I can't become a lackey in the Guangyao Association." Shangguan Qingmiao muttered as he drained the wine in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng tapped the table, his mood also somewhat melancholic: "Once we take Qi Yuan to the Taixing Domain, if he can break through to the Ancestor God Realm, it will also be an enhancement of our combat power."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the elder said that this Qi Yuan has very high talent, and in the future, he may have the chance to break through to the second realm of the Ancestor God." Shangguan Qingmiao said with an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered good news.</p><p></p><p>What the Taixing Domain is most lacking now is high-end combat power.</p><p></p><p>The plans of enlightening the people and enlightening the gods have been unfolding for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The number of forging masters who have died for this is countless.</p><p></p><p>The treasures of the enlightening the people plan now have seven pieces.</p><p></p><p>Facing the invasion of the Black Sky and Black Earth, Shenmuwu is no longer powerless, no longer the time when Yuan alone went to the Void Sea to deal with enemies many times stronger.</p><p></p><p>Now, what is most lacking is high-level combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, now that the Black Sky and Black Earth are invading, we can also bite off a piece of their bone." Shangguan Qingmiao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>As for the final outcome, they knew it, but does knowing it mean they won't resist? "Hmph, even though they have the Devilish Source and can revive endlessly, but... we can still exhaust their Devilish Source!" Shangguan Qingteng said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he also understood that the Devilish Source is endless and cannot be exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Didn't the Lord of the Void Realm in the Zhou Universe not want to provoke the Black Sky and Black Earth?</p><p></p><p>But being able to bite off a piece of flesh from the Black Sky is also a good thing for them.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this is not good!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a divine-level Armored Soldier came over with an anxious expression.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Shangguan Qingteng had a premonition of something ominous.</p><p></p><p>"The recent transportation formations may not be usable." The divine-level Armored Soldier said.</p><p></p><p>Transporting Ancestor God-level experts requires a huge amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>So Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao were waiting here, waiting for the person from the Enlightening the People Association to open the passage, and then transport to the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" Shangguan Qingmiao asked hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I heard... that 15 Yang Gods have gone to the Kuijin Realm, and the surrounding worlds... have all been put under martial law. No one knows what big event has happened in the Kuijin Realm." The divine-level Armored Soldier said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng's expression changed slightly: "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>He had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yuan had once said that the 99 Devilish Gods in the Kuijin Realm were hunting Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightener of the Kuijin Realm was a famous Second Generation Ancestor, with many treasures that could surround and kill Mythical Experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, dozens of Yang Gods are rushing to the Kuijin Realm, which means... the Enlightener has most likely been slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It is very likely that Qi Yuan has broken through to the Yang God Realm in the battle.</p><p></p><p>This kind of talent is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Dozens of Yang Gods... Qi Yuan will certainly die."</p><p></p><p>With dozens of Yang Gods attacking, not to mention Qi Yuan has just broken through to the Ancestor God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the two of them joined forces, they would probably have a hard time dealing with it.</p><p></p><p>"No, we can only be reckless now, forcibly break through the transportation formation, and take Qi Yuan to flee to the Taixing Domain. That's the only chance!" Shangguan Qingteng said.</p><p></p><p>This is the only opportunity, they must seize every second, not allowing the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Shangguan Qingmiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this action, if not careful, would lead to their deaths in the chaotic star domain, but there was no better way.</p><p></p><p>They can die, but those who can wield the Enlightening the People plan... cannot die.</p><p></p><p>They are the hope of Shenmuwu.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two terrifying auras burst into the sky, rushing towards the transportation formation.</p><p></p><p>When the two of them acted, their auras were shocking.</p><p></p><p>The Devilish Gods who tried to block them didn't even have a moment's time before they perished.</p><p></p><p>Since they have taken action, it also means exposing themselves, and what awaits them next will be endless pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in a lazy mood.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, no one has disturbed me, and the progress of my Transcendence has sped up a lot."</p><p></p><p>Now, his Transcendence progress has reached 10%.</p><p></p><p>There is still some distance to reach perfection.</p><p></p><p>"If I can just lie here peacefully for another three or four years, I estimate I can complete the Transcendence."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to sense something, and an expression of helplessness appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, gold will shine wherever it is."</p><p></p><p>"With my handsome appearance, even if I don't go out every day, those Devilish Gods can still find me and stop my Transcendence."</p><p></p><p>"So... should I just slaughter all the Devilish Gods in the Chaotic Star Domain? Maybe then I can transcend in peace?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a sudden inspiration.</p><p></p><p>No one can stop his Transcendence! Just then, two terrifying auras suddenly transmitted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Those two terrifying auras were enough to make the Devilish Gods uneasy.</p><p></p><p>A mighty voice also echoed throughout the area at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, where are you? We are the Ancestor Gods of the Enlightening the People Association, sent by Yuan to bring you to the Taixing Domain.</p><p></p><p>Now, dozens of Yang God-level Devilish Spirits are chasing after us, we must leave quickly!"</p><p></p><p>These two Ancestor Gods did not hesitate at all, directly and quickly stating their purpose.</p><p></p><p>Because they had already sensed that those dozens of Yang Gods were also rushing here, and would arrive very soon.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't leave now, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightening the People Association?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Yuan to actually send people to pick him up.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Sect Master, it should be him who arranged this.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, now that my divine cultivation has reached the Realm Lord level, ordinary enemies can be easily slain by me." Qi Yuan responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, upon hearing Qi Yuan's response, the originally delighted expressions on Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao's faces instantly turned to bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan... didn't he just make his brain stupid? How could he be a Realm Lord already! That's impossible.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, their figures appeared in Qi Yuan's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to explain, let's hurry, the Taixing Domain is safe."</p><p></p><p>The Kuijin Realm is located in the chaotic war zone, this is the territory of the Devilish Gods, they cannot stay here for long.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's safe here, I'm a Realm Lord, who dares to provoke me? And I'm busy with my Transcendence to break through to the Yang God Realm, I don't have time to go to the Taixing Domain with you." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shangguan Qingmiao was speechless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan really has damaged his brain, his words are all over the place.</p><p></p><p>Just now he said he was a Realm Lord, and now he's talking about Transcending to the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 97</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning, my clan was destroyed, and I barely escaped with my life to come to the Great商 (a place name).</p><p></p><p>Finally, by a stroke of luck, I joined the Shenguang Sect."</p><p></p><p>Elder Kumuzhenjun spoke in a calm and detached manner, as if from a third-party perspective.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened, feeling that this stroke of luck must have been Kumuzhenjun being captured by the people of the Moyu Gate and sent to the Shenguang Sect as a spy.</p><p></p><p>"The destruction of the clan and the loss of life, and one of the clan's treasures has also been scattered abroad, becoming a prize among the top 100 of the Eastern Land's Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>There are four more years until the finalization of the Eastern Land's Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>I need you to enter the top 100 and retrieve the treasure of my clan."</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun told Qi Yuan more details.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Land's Prodigy Ranking, the rewards for the top 100 are very rich, even with the opportunity to step into the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Among them, those with higher rankings can choose the treasures first.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun's clan treasure is extremely special, scattered abroad, and unknown to outsiders as to its preciousness, only considered as an ordinary precious treasure, included among the treasures of the Eastern Land's Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>"The top 100, no problem, Sect Master. But what is this great opportunity you mentioned?" Qi Yuan kept wondering about this great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun, hearing this, revealed a trace of tenderness in his calm and unruffled eyes: "This item is called the Void Spiritual Wood, below the Purple Palace, consuming it can increase one's Spiritual Realm by a small level."</p><p></p><p>This is undoubtedly a true treasure.</p><p></p><p>The greatest use is to consume it when breaking through to the Purple Palace realm in the late Spiritual Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>That way, the chance of overcoming the tribulation of the Purple Palace will increase.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun had never used it, just to save it for the breakthrough to the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has given this Void Spiritual Wood to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened the small gourd and immediately saw a rod-like jelly-like substance inside.</p><p></p><p>He looked at it carefully, confirming it, and his eyes showed delight: "Sect Master, you are truly a great person. Even if you are a spy of the Moyu Sect, I will still recognize you."</p><p></p><p>What he currently lacked the most was this kind of treasure that can increase one's Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This treasure is extremely precious, you can keep it first, and use it when you break through to the Purple Palace realm," Kumuzhenjun said, reminding him, despite the corner of his mouth twitching.</p><p></p><p>Because below the Purple Palace realm, it can increase one's Spiritual Realm by a small level.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the later it is used, the better the effect.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Dao Foundation also get better the later it is used?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun paused: "It should be the same."</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the Dao Foundation, so how would he know? Qi Yuan, hearing this, had an idea.</p><p></p><p>No matter how precious this treasure is, it's better to just consume it first and then worry about it, to improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"During this period, you should focus on cultivating your cultivation. When the Eastern Land's Prodigy Battle opens, I will tell you again," Kumuzhenjun said, about to leave.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, Qi Yuan stopped Kumuzhenjun: "Sect Master, may I make a small request?"</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun looked at Qi Yuan: "Don't be too outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"Not outrageous, it's just that, Sect Master, my wife has a small hobby, she likes to eat some snacks."</p><p>Qi Yuan brought up his wife.</p><p></p><p>"Get to the point," Kumuzhenjun said, looking at Qi Yuan with an unfriendly expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Crystal Mine in Wuxue City, I want the Sect to buy it, and all the blood crystals need to be brought to me."</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun looked at Qi Yuan and snorted coldly: "You call this a small request?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Crystal Mine in Wuxue City is well-known among the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many scattered cultivators rely on this to improve their strength.</p><p></p><p>If Kumuzhenjun monopolizes the Blood Crystal Mine, it may provoke the resentment of the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This resentment is nothing to the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>As the Sect Master, he needs to consider comprehensively, how to maximize the benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Give me five days." Kumuzhenjun said, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>In the simple wooden house, only Qi Yuan and his wife remained.</p><p></p><p>In the wooden house, Qi Yuan looked at the Void Spiritual Wood in the small gourd, with a greedy expression.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it can help me break through to the late Dao Foundation stage!"</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can he formally start the second game and truly descend into the game, instead of being trapped in the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Void Spiritual Wood and began to consume and digest it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace of the Great Shang Kingdom, thousands of civil and military officials knelt on the ground, the scene grand and majestic.</p><p></p><p>"First, I worship the Heavens!"</p><p>"Second, I worship the immortal gods!"</p><p>"Third, I worship my ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>The voices were resounding, and all who heard the sound bowed in worship.</p><p></p><p>Colorful flags fluttered, the drums were heavy and sonorous, and solemn and melodious music rang out.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian slowly ascended the steps, the ministers holding jade tablets to show their loyalty and service; the eunuchs raised the scepter symbolizing the supreme authority of the imperial house.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all, Dongxian ascended the throne.</p><p></p><p>"The new emperor has ascended the throne..."</p><p></p><p>All the civil and military officials knelt again.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian, in a dragon robe, had an awe-inspiring gaze.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with excitement, but also a sense of unreality.</p><p></p><p>Without great hardship, without thrilling events, he had simply and easily become the emperor of the Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>This position he had once dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, is this all a dream of mine?" Dongxian couldn't help but ask Elder Qi.</p><p></p><p>The voice of Elder Qi echoed in his mind: "Hmph, you kid just don't have enough experience. Being the emperor of a mere Great Shang, what's that worth? There are over a hundred emperors in the Hundred Nations.</p><p></p><p>But not a single one has reached the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>You'd better focus on your cultivation, and try to reach the Purple Palace realm in a few thousand years, so that you can rebuild my body."</p><p></p><p>Elder Qi's words shattered Dongxian's previous joy.</p><p></p><p>Right, what is being an emperor? Didn't his father also used to be the emperor of the Great Shang? Look at how that turned out.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian restrained himself, and the elation that had arisen in his heart earlier disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an emperor is just to obtain more resources, to reach the Purple Palace realm as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the new emperor's ascension should still be celebrated.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a loud voice came from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"Is the emperor of the Great Shang present?"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a Spiritual Infant realm cultivator flew down, emanating a mighty aura.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Wuduanhe Seng, the Sect's Spiritual Infant realm cultivator, floated up to block the path of that Spiritual Infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Steward of the Guangming Palace from the Eastern Land Cuiyun Prefecture. I come on the orders of the Palace Master to bring the Great Shang into the Guangming Alliance."</p><p>The Spiritual Infant cultivator from Guangming Palace threw down a decree, which fell into Wuduanhe Seng's hands.</p><p></p><p>Wuduanhe Seng scanned it with his Spiritual Sense and, seeing no issues, presented it to Dongxian.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian opened the decree and scanned it, his face revealing an angry expression.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard the Spiritual Infant cultivator from Guangming Palace say: "In half a year at the fastest, three years at the latest, the Hundred Nations Blood War will begin.</p><p></p><p>The Guangming Alliance will clash with the Evil Demon Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Considering that the Great Shang has no demonic cultivators running rampant, the Palace Master, in his benevolence, wishes to bring the Great Shang into the Guangming Alliance.</p><p></p><p>When the Hundred Nations Blood War begins, the Great Shang and the other Guangming Alliance nations must dispatch troops to exterminate the evil demons!"</p><p></p><p>The Guangming Palace cultivator spoke from high above, as if bestowing a grace upon the Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian listened, his head feeling like it was about to explode.</p><p></p><p>This Guangming Palace, how unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>The Great Shang is not a vassal of the Guangming Palace, so why must they join the Guangming Alliance?</p><p></p><p>And the Hundred Nations must follow the Guangming Palace's orders to start the Hundred Nations Blood War.</p><p></p><p>What logic is this? Is the Guangming Palace the lord of the Hundred Nations?</p><p>Dongxian was furious.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that the Guangming Palace was a truly formidable power, even reaching the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few cultivators within the domain of the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>All the forces united across the hundred nations could not be a match for the Bright Palace.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Bright Palace spoke from his lofty position, "Before that, you need to hand over the disciples Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan from the Divine Light Sect, and send them to the Bright Palace."<div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>He made another impolite request.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Xian directly refused, "Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Bright Palace was momentarily surprised, then narrowed his eyes and smiled, "If the Great Merchant is unwilling, then during the bloody battle of the hundred nations, the Great Merchant will become part of the Demonic Faction.</p><p></p><p>All those in the Demonic Faction will be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The Great Merchant... may face national destruction!"</p><p></p><p>The Bright Palace would support the righteous factions, while the Demonic Faction's nations would be utterly destroyed, the worse the better. Preferably, the nation would be ruined and the people slain, with not even chickens and dogs left.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Xian was indignant and deeply aggrieved! The Bright Palace was truly too tyrannical! "In seven days, if you do not hand over Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan from the Divine Light Sect, the Great Merchant will be considered part of the Demonic Faction." After speaking, the cultivator from the Bright Palace turned into a beam of light and left arrogantly, leaving Dong Xian fuming with anger.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to hand them over!...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, unaware of the events happening in the Great Merchant's imperial court, had entered the game world.</p><p></p><p>His face showed a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>Because his spiritual sense in the late Foundation Establishment stage no longer needed the previous pull from Ning Tao's side, he could easily enter the game world.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, he first entered the Heavenly Heart Palace, into the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake?" Not far away, Ning Tao opened her eyes, her half-exposed face as beautiful as a plum blossom in the snow. At this moment, she looked at the Demonic Seed bound by eighteen chains, her eyes filled with deep apprehension.</p><p></p><p>The original Demonic Seed seemed to have been digested, and now it had become a ball of blood-red flesh, seemingly brewing a supreme calamity within.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend Ning Tao, may I ask you a question?" Qi Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, please speak." Ning Tao's phoenix eyes flashed, looking at Qi Yuan coquettishly, seemingly dissatisfied with the address.</p><p></p><p>Her black dress clung to her body, her waist slender, her delicate figure even more alluring. Through the thin black veil, her ivory white and slender jade legs were captivating.</p><p></p><p>"Who is the greatest villain in this world?" Qi Yuan wanted to know who the final boss was.</p><p></p><p>"My lord is joking, if we speak of villains, we Northern Demon Thirteen Witches would certainly be considered great evildoers." As she said this, Ning Tao's phoenix eyes held a self-mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused for a moment, then involuntarily said, "Can I see your other face?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao's eyes in the depths flashed with panic, but she still smiled charmingly, "It's better if my lord doesn't see it, I'm afraid it will disgust you."</p><p></p><p>On half of her face was the character "Demon", which was extremely ugly to the world, causing everyone who saw it to feel revulsion.</p><p></p><p>Since the "Demon" character appeared on her face, even her own mother, who loved her dearly, saw her as a demon and tried to kill her with scissors while she slept.</p><p></p><p>The young Ning Tao fled her own home, but she had another scar next to the "Demon" character.</p><p></p><p>Later, she escaped and was relentlessly hunted by countless cultivators, who all called her the Demon Woman.</p><p></p><p>It was on the run that she encountered Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She wore a black veil over her face.</p><p></p><p>No one had seen the other half of her face, not even herself. When she removed the veil, she did not want to open her eyes to see the thing that even she found repulsive.</p><p></p><p>She did not want Qi Yuan to see it.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the Thirteen Witches, are there any other major antagonists?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the little friend Ning Tao could not really be considered a final boss.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly Heart Palace was a hegemon in the Flowing Wind Realm, but still lacked the ultimate strength.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the antagonists?" Ning Tao smiled lightly, "To the cultivators of the South, all in the North are antagonists; to the cultivators of the North, all in the South are antagonists."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao had another unspoken sentence.</p><p></p><p>To the people of the South and North, the Demons were the greatest antagonists, even more hated than the Demonic Seed.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan did not take it seriously and did not speak further.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you rarely wake up, when will you break out of your shell and accompany me to gaze at the boundless night sky?" Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan intently.</p><p></p><p>"No need." Qi Yuan had no interest in that, he wanted to play the game.</p><p></p><p>Watching the night sky, where was the fun in killing? Ning Tao was not disappointed: "My lord, be good, your little wife is going to earn money to support the family."</p><p></p><p>She put on another veil and put on shoes, her bare feet covered.</p><p></p><p>She left the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>As the Palace Master of the Heavenly Heart Palace, she had many matters to attend to.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the palace, she looked up at the night sky.</p><p></p><p>The night sky was pitch black, as if the entire world had been drenched in ink.</p><p></p><p>She sat on the jade throne, looking at the imperial edict, with a pensive expression: "Blood Demon, supreme... great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>But then she smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>She was a Demon Woman, was she not also a supreme calamity? At this time, the palace maids attending to her noticed her smile and trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao glanced at them, her eyes flashing with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>These people who claimed they were willing to die for her were all terrified of her.</p><p></p><p>Terrified of her every smile and frown.</p><p></p><p>Demon Woman...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>"This mass of flesh is quite strange."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the place where he was currently residing.</p><p></p><p>Every time he looked at this mass of flesh, he could obtain different answers.</p><p></p><p>The names he obtained were also different.</p><p></p><p>This time, the answer was...</p><p></p><p>【Heavenly Thirst for Blood, Extreme Desire.】</p><p></p><p>The previous time, it was still Chaotic Divine Blood.</p><p></p><p>"This must be a good treasure."</p><p></p><p>He guessed that due to the abnormal state of his spiritual sense residing here, this item had also undergone mutations.</p><p></p><p>Its form was constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"What if I were to implant my spiritual sense blood into it?"</p><p></p><p>A thought arose in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly discarded this idea.</p><p></p><p>Now he still did not know what this mass of flesh was, he could not afford to waste his spiritual sense blood.</p><p></p><p>He needed to at least know the general value of this mass of flesh before considering using the spiritual sense blood.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he needed to quickly become stronger.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I can't take it with me, otherwise I could study it daily."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's time to leave this place and enter the game state."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan began to switch into the game state.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless scenes flashed into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He saw a majestic and towering city, the walls thirty zhang high.</p><p></p><p>Countless human cultivators and soldiers were stationed atop the city walls.</p><p></p><p>Below the city, the terrifying Demonic Seed, numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands, surged towards the city like the sea.</p><p></p><p>Arrows fell like rain, landing among the Demonic Seed, yet it was like a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Seed with hideous faces charged up the city walls, turning it into close-quarters combat.</p><p></p><p>The armored soldiers, wielding long spears and swords, charged fearlessly towards the Demonic Seed.</p><p></p><p>The battle raged for three days.</p><p></p><p>The blood dyed the city walls crimson.</p><p></p><p>The walls of this city had turned pitch black.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

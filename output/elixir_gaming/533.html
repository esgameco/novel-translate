        <h1>Chapter 533</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Prince Dingyuan was dressed in military attire, holding a yellowed book in his hands, studying it intently.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, two great Supervisors stood silently, their breath as cold as icicles, daring not to make any movement, afraid of disturbing the divine Commanding General.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Hand faction squinted his eyes, his posture slightly more casual compared to the two Supervisors.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths passed, and Prince Dingyuan put down the book in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Agui, how has the old man Liu been recently?"</p><p></p><p>Old man Liu, the true master of the Liu family.</p><p></p><p>He commands the divine artifact Fusu, with an endless source of vitality, making him the most difficult to kill among the seven gods of the Luosha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>And Prince Dingyuan is among the top three in terms of offensive power among the seven gods, and is most proficient in poisoning.</p><p></p><p>"He has been in seclusion, not showing himself for a month. Recently, the severely injured Qiannian was sent to the Liu family, but he did not appear either." The Blood Hand leader's voice was calm, seeing that Prince Dingyuan did not continue, he seemed to want him to go on, so he said, "According to my subordinates' speculation, old man Liu... must have been deeply poisoned, so he dares not show himself, lest he reveals the fact that he has been poisoned."</p><p></p><p>The two Supervisors next to him hurriedly said, "Your Highness' poison skills are profound, given time, you will surely be able to slay a god and shake the mountains! "</p><p></p><p>Prince Dingyuan smiled slightly, his gaze deep: "After all, Fusu is a divine artifact, I do not know its limit, and old man Liu may be fishing for something."</p><p></p><p>A divine Commanding General can easily slaughter tens of thousands of troops. If the two were to clash head-on, it would be enough to shatter the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Prince Dingyuan did not have full confidence, so he would not make a move. If the divine Commanding General was forced into a corner and allowed to escape, it would be a fatal threat to the Luosha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Hand leader lowered his head and said, "Your Highness represents the will of the royal house, the hearts of the people are all with the royal house, Your Highness represents the great trend, in this Dingbo State, the power of the Liu family will only become weaker and weaker, Your Highness only needs to wait patiently, this old man Liu will only be defeated!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Prince Dingyuan sighed softly: "How could this prince not know this principle, it's just... the time His Majesty has left me is not much, if within thirty years... Dingbo State has not changed hands, the one stationed in Dingbo State will not be this prince."</p><p></p><p>His term and time limit in Dingbo State was only thirty years left.</p><p></p><p>If he could not take it down within the term, this towering achievement would have to be handed over to someone else, how could he bear it? Hearing this, the two Supervisors and the Blood Hand leader present all bowed their heads and dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a anxious voice suddenly came from outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Blood Hand Supervisors rushed in hurriedly, not even bothering to report.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Hand leader's gaze narrowed, wanting to say something like "What kind of conduct is this?"</p><p></p><p>But he saw Prince Dingyuan's expression calm, without a trace of blame in his eyes: "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Cloud Bandits were wiped out last night at midnight!" The reporting Supervisor Liu had a hint of panic in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Cloud Bandits were wiped out? Was it old man Liu?" Prince Dingyuan's eyes showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>But this was only surprise.</p><p></p><p>"No..." Supervisor Lui's eyes flashed with a look of trepidation, "According to the information obtained, it was a hundred-meter-tall blood giant that wiped out the Blood Cloud Bandits!"</p><p></p><p>"A hundred-meter-tall blood giant?" Prince Dingyuan was truly surprised this time, "A demonic spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Supervisor Lui's expression was grim as he reported the information he had obtained in detail.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Supervisor Lui's words, a flash of fear passed through Prince Dingyuan's eyes, and then a sharp edge emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, putting on airs, this world... has long been without gods!" Prince Dingyuan emanated a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>However, his voice still revealed a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is suspicious, it must be... old man Liu's doing!" The Blood Hand leader hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>According to Supervisor Lui's description, to slay the Blood Cloud Bandits with just two punches was beyond the capabilities of a heaven-level Commanding General, it must be at least a divine-level Commanding General.</p><p></p><p>Among the divine-level Commanding Generals in the vicinity, other than old man Liu, who else could it be? "Yes, it must be that Liu causing trouble!" The other Supervisors also hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"He just wants to pretend to be a god and deceive the people, to rebel against the court!"</p><p></p><p>Prince Dingyuan's gaze kept changing.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the news that had come from the royal court recently.</p><p></p><p>The gods have awakened, and there seem to be fragments appearing in Ninguo displaying divine miracles.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Might has been dispatched to Ninguo, but he does not know the result so far.</p><p></p><p>He had hidden worries, and finally spoke: "The affairs here... report to His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Blood Hand leader saw Prince Dingyuan's worries and said in a low voice, "In the previous battle, the gods perished, even if they awaken... they may not be as powerful as the Eleven, Your Highness can easily suppress them!"</p><p></p><p>Prince Dingyuan narrowed his eyes, recalling the scenes of the past, in the depths of his eyes was deep fear.</p><p></p><p>There was one thing he didn't say, even the Eleven... he was not a match for.</p><p></p><p>The gods... are the true gods! A single divine artifact can make the royal house unable to raise its head!</p><p></p><p>He had worries in his heart, if... it was not old man Liu's scheme, but truly the gods, what should he do? "This prince will go to the Blood Cloud Camp in person!" Prince Dingyuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>That day, he quietly disguised himself as a hunter and went to the Blood Cloud Camp.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dingbo State.</p><p>Liuye Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter was dressed in a lotus leaf dress, her entire body emerald green, like a dragonfly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fengzhi stood beside Liu Chuwinter, looking at the Liu family manor with a reverent expression.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour later, an old man with white hair came out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the visitors, Liu Chuwinter's face showed a joyful expression: "Grandpa, what did he say?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fengzhi was an elder of the Judgment Hall, originally intending to leave this morning, but in the end chose to stay and pay respects to Liu Sheng.</p><p></p><p>The old butler shook his head, his face filled with a sense of helplessness: "The ancestor is in seclusion and will not see outsiders."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the old butler felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>This young miss really has no brain! Now the situation in Dingbo State is already complex, and Prince Dingyuan is eyeing it greedily.</p><p></p><p>This young miss directly brought the rebel Judgment Hall elder to the ancestral hall. Is she afraid that Prince Dingyuan lacks opportunities to play?</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter mentioned this, a trace of disappointment flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough... Grandpa still doesn't want to see me.</p><p></p><p>Li Fengzhi heard this and was also extremely disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The current Judgment Hall is facing internal and external troubles, with its living space gradually shrinking.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven gods of Luosha, only Liu Sheng is the one the Judgment Hall has a chance to win over.</p><p></p><p>If they could gain Liu Sheng's support, the current Judgment Hall would be much better off.</p><p></p><p>Now, Liu Sheng doesn't even want to see them, his attitude can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Chuwinter, it's no big deal." Li Fengzhi smiled kindly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter was even more frustrated.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, it's still early, you can see if that young man from Ninguo has returned, and you can ask him about the situation in Ninguo." Li Fengzhi returned the favor.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter's spirits were lifted: "Big Brother Qi..."</p><p></p><p>But before she could finish speaking, the old butler's voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"The ancestor says you can go in."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter was stunned, her face showing an ecstatic expression: "Grandpa has changed his mind?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fengzhi was somewhat surprised, pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Amidst the confusion, Liu Sheng, this divine-level Armaments Master, why has he changed his mind? She was somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>However, being able to meet the divine-level Armaments Master is still a good thing. "Come, let's go see Grandpa," Liu Chudong said happily.</p><p></p><p>However, when they arrived at the depths of the manor, Liu Chudong was blocked from entering, and Li Fengzhi went in to see Liu Sheng alone.</p><p></p><p>She could only stand quietly outside and chat casually with Sister Qian Ran.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Li Fengzhi walked out of the courtyard, her face beaming with a smile, clearly having gained a lot from this conversation.</p><p></p><p>And indeed, she had gained a lot. Because Liu Sheng was actually preparing to provide material support and also shelter the Judgment Assembly in Dingbo State.</p><p></p><p>But the Judgment Assembly needs help from the Liu family to deal with the Blood-Handed.</p><p></p><p>For the Judgment Assembly, this is absolutely good news, joyous news.</p><p></p><p>"Chudong, your grandfather is calling you inside," Li Fengzhi said happily, her tone even more gentle.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chudong paused for a moment, then quickly walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Passing through a bamboo forest and a stream, Liu Chudong's footsteps stopped at the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was vast, filled with the essence of wood, with various bamboos, trees, and flowers decorating it. Even in autumn, it did not appear withered and yellowed, but rather a vibrant green.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa," Liu Chudong called out in a clear voice, her mood quite good.</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion, an old man with white hair and a long beard, the beard seemingly tied with a rope, appeared particularly benevolent.</p><p></p><p>On the table was a painting.</p><p></p><p>The ink on it was not yet dry, clearly just formed.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, what are you painting?" Liu Chudong approached and looked at the painting with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"This painting of the monster... it's quite divine!" Liu Chudong gave her evaluation.</p><p></p><p>She did have some social skills.</p><p></p><p>The painting depicted a giant, seemingly hundreds of meters tall, with a blood-red armor and a murderous aura in its eyes, looking like the Grim Reaper from hell.</p><p></p><p>However, from her grandfather's brushstrokes, she could feel his appreciation for this strange being.</p><p></p><p>So she naturally praised it, being a bit sweet-mouthed.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, just a little something," Liu Sheng said casually, but the joy in his eyes could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had received the news that the Blood Cloud Bandits had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Such news naturally deserved a big celebration.</p><p></p><p>But upon learning the details, he felt that a big celebration was not enough.</p><p></p><p>Especially after his conversation with Li Fengzhi, he had learned more about the situation in Ningguo.</p><p></p><p>Especially a few months ago, the Divine Descent seemed to have truly awakened, not just a myth, but a real existence.</p><p></p><p>Then... does it mean... that the Divine Descent is truly awakening?</p><p></p><p>The one who destroyed the Blood Cloud Bandits, could it be the legendary... Divine Descent? If the Divine Descent is truly still alive, then the situation in Dingbo State will change.</p><p></p><p>He will not be slowly consumed by the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>If there is anyone in this world who hopes the most for the Divine Descent's revival, apart from the Judgment Assembly and those common people who still remember the Divine Descent, it would probably be him.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa is in a good mood today, do you have any wishes? Feel free to say them," Liu Sheng spoke, his brows and eyes full of joy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was an underlying meaning to this, not to be too excessive.</p><p></p><p>Although his granddaughter was not very smart, she still had a certain level of social skills.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Chudong's eyes immediately lit up: "Grandpa, don't you not have a disciple? I recently made a good friend, he's a really good person, and his appearance is also quite refined. Would you consider taking him as a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>To change Grandpa's ideas and thoughts, relying on her alone was not enough.</p><p></p><p>So she decided to team up with Qi Yuan to change Grandpa's mind.</p><p></p><p>Look, your granddaughter and your disciple are both from the Judgment, won't you support the Judgment?</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng chuckled: "I'm old now, I don't take disciples anymore."</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew his granddaughter's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa!" Liu Chudong was a bit dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Taking a disciple is not a small matter. If it ends up troubling your friend, I won't be able to bear the responsibility," Liu Sheng said, "He is currently an outsider, but if he becomes my disciple, he will become an insider, and may... end up being implicated."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chudong paused for a moment, she knew that no matter what she said, Grandpa would not take this disciple.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I feel he has a lot of talent, after all, he came from a small country to Luosha, which is not easy," Liu Chudong's voice carried a hint of sympathy.</p><p></p><p>Ningguo and Luosha are separated by a vast sea, the journey is long, and there are many bandits and pirates. Without any strength, it would be very difficult to cross the sea to Luosha.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng's brow furrowed as he seemed to sense something: "Which small country did he come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Ningguo, the same country that Sister Qian Ran is from," Liu Chudong answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Liu Sheng's gaze changed slightly, his body stiffening.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa? Is there a problem with him?" Liu Chudong was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"No..." Liu Sheng shook his head, his gaze becoming deeper.</p><p></p><p>In this period of time... from Ningguo to Luosha.</p><p>And upon arriving, the Blood Cloud Bandits were destroyed, the Divine Descent descended. </p><p>Are these two events related? Or is it that he... occasionally obtained fragments of the Divine Descent, and brought the Divine Descent to Luosha?</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, if he has any problems, I'll bring him over for you to take a look, then you'll know," Liu Chudong said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Although she trusted her friend Qi Yuan very much, she still couldn't distinguish the priorities.</p><p>A friend she had just known for a few days, of course, was not as important as her grandfather, and she trusted her grandfather more.</p><p></p><p>"No need." Liu Sheng shook his head, as if he had thought of something, and said softly, "I have not yet gone to the Judgment..."</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, you know!" Liu Chudong covered her mouth, somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Fushu has spiritual awareness, it can sense those with impure intentions. I'll take Fushu and help you keep an eye on things, see if there are any ill-intentioned people in the Judgment," Liu Sheng smiled, his gaze deep.</p><p></p><p>He had thought of even more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit sleepy."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan yawned, his face tired and a little pale.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only a Sky-level Armaments Master.</p><p></p><p>Using that thunderous method to destroy the Blood Cloud Bandits, while impressive, had consumed him greatly.</p><p></p><p>But to play the role of the Divine Descent well, he must be impressive, he must be majestic.</p><p></p><p>Now, his portrayal of the Divine Descent is gradually increasing, and he feels he's making a good profit.</p><p></p><p>When he reaches a certain limit, he will receive rewards from the Divine Descent, and perhaps his strength will increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, do you want to eat some buns?" Chen Kang carefully brought over some buns.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "I need to take a nap, and during the time I'm asleep, no one is to disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, then went back to his room and immediately fell asleep, not even bothering to wash up.</p><p></p><p>Last night, he not only destroyed the headquarters of the Blood Cloud Bandits, but also leveled their other strongholds, consuming a great deal.</p><p></p><p>He immediately collapsed on the bed and fell asleep, his breathing even.</p><p></p><p>On the bed, Little Bride was tightly snuggled up to Qi Yuan, her icy sleeve holding Qi Yuan's hand, and if Little Bride had a face, her expression now would be one of utmost focus and tenderness.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan spoke, everyone's gaze fell on that blood sphere.</p><p></p><p>"High Priest of Tianxin Palace, how do you explain this now? How is he not a blood demon?"</p><p></p><p>The seven supreme beings looked at Qi Yuan, but did not detect any terrifying aura from him. </p><p></p><p>They also knew that the blood demon had not yet fully formed and was not worth worrying about.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao turned around and looked at Qi Yuan behind her, her eyes showing a resentful expression: "You finally deigned to come see me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao's injuries, his emotions complex.</p><p></p><p>"You could have abandoned me."</p><p></p><p>After all, this blood sphere was not Qi Yuan's true body. </p><p></p><p>Even if damaged, it would not affect him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao raised her head, her gaze stubborn: "I'm not like someone who disappears for decades or hundreds of years."</p><p></p><p>She turned back to face the seven supreme beings surrounding them: "I said before, no one can hurt you, so no one will hurt you!"</p><p></p><p>The aura of the origin spread from Ning Tao's body, as if she had become one with the world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the seven supreme beings all had solemn expressions and also merged with the world.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan calmly said: "You will... die. Why do this? We've only met briefly and barely exchanged a few words."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan actually couldn't quite understand Ning Tao's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Ning Tao was like an obsessive child.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Ning Tao snorted coldly. </p><p></p><p>She couldn't be bothered to explain to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What did he know of her thoughts and feelings? Just a stupid man!</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the esteemed High Priest of Tianxin Palace would be bewitched by a blood demon and fall into love!" One of the supreme beings laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha... a demon woman... in love..." Another female supreme being's smile was even more mocking.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew demon women were cursed by heaven and earth. All who looked upon them felt disgust and saw them as extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>A demon woman in love was the most laughable thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone possibly love a demon woman?</p><p></p><p>"Have you laughed enough?" Ning Tao's small face turned cold. "Either get lost, or... die!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Qi Yuan had seen such an icy side to Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Like a stray cat, wary of everything in the world, facing people with her most aggressive side.</p><p></p><p>"It seems, High Priest of Tianxin Palace, that today you will die here along with this blood demon." That woman was not angered, but smiled even more radiantly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Tao's voice transmission entered Qi Yuan's ears: "I'll tell you some good news. When the battle starts, I will release your restraints. You can go as far as you're able."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan said: "Actually, I've already left long ago."</p><p></p><p>This blood sphere was not Qi Yuan's body, merely flesh he had once inhabited.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was briefly silent, then said: "Actually... I knew that."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"With seven supreme beings attacking, even with my heavenly foundation, I'm no match for them."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was not surprised. </p><p></p><p>In her view, Qi Yuan was just an ordinary supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Especially coming from outside this realm, he was further restricted by the world's rules and unable to unleash a supreme being's full power.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been so easily trapped by her.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to leave, don't drag me down." Ning Tao's voice was full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"I can't leave." Qi Yuan said seriously. "These seven people framed me as a blood demon and want me dead. Auntie may be able to tolerate it, but uncle cannot!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Ning Tao didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"I want to use your hands to kill them."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're an outsider. How could you understand the origin better than the supreme beings of our Liufeng Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The origin of each world was different.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace of Canglang Realm also had masters who controlled the origin.</p><p></p><p>But if they came to Liufeng Realm, they would only count as half a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Because the origins were not the same.</p><p></p><p>"You underestimate me!" Qi Yuan said proudly. "I'm most familiar with this realm's origin!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had once battled nearly 3000 old men in the Absolute Ground.</p><p></p><p>Those old men had all used the origin of Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Various origins of Liufeng Realm had wounded him, so he remembered them most clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" The seven supreme beings' attacks came at that moment.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they moved, it was the legendary origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Seven origin divine abilities all aimed at Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as Ning Tao was, she seemed weak and powerless facing seven origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>She could not block all seven origin divine abilities at once, and would have to endure one or two.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan's voice came: "Gather the power of humans and demons in the dantian, disperse qi to the palms, move through emptiness..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke extremely quickly, transmitting to Ning Tao's ears.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was a bit dazed, but instinctively followed what Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Only to see her like a carp in the ocean, with one roll she dodged the several origin divine abilities attacking from different directions and levels.</p><p></p><p>She completely blocked all seven origin divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's small face showed an expression of surprise: "How did you do that?"</p><p></p><p>The seven supreme beings were even more shocked than Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's ability to dodge the seven people's origin divine abilities just now demonstrated an extreme understanding of their origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>It was as if she was each of them, facing their own origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>This was simply impossible!</p><p></p><p>How could they have directly told others about their ultimate trump cards?</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this, how did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, why should I tell you how I know?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's help made Ning Tao's heart leap with joy, but the danger was not completely over, so she couldn't let her guard down.</p><p></p><p>She hid within the sky curtain, wielding her long whip. It was as if thunder resounded through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The seven supreme beings had grave expressions: "We must kill her!"</p><p></p><p>Their origin divine abilities had been seen through by one person. If this leaked out, when facing opponents of the same level in the future, they would definitely be among the weakest.</p><p></p><p>"While her injuries are severe, capture her!" That female supreme being said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The seven supreme beings held nothing back, continuing to attack with origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood behind, speaking extremely quickly, constantly transmitting to Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely Qi Yuan's transmissions that allowed Ning Tao to truly contend simultaneously against seven supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could Ning Tao, already seriously injured, be a match for these seven supreme beings?</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, in a desolate desert.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao fell from the sky like a kite with cut strings. Her small face was pale, her black long dress now dyed red with blood.</p><p></p><p>"Cough... we escaped..."</p><p></p><p>With the danger gone, Ning Tao's temperament seemed to become more unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>"Husband truly still cares for this slave. Who would have thought husband would understand their origin divine abilities so well?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's voice was a bit low, seeming somewhat weak.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Why did they say I was a blood demon?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He should have only been gone for about ten years.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao had imprisoned the blood sphere in an underground palace. In theory, besides Ning Tao, no one should have known of the blood sphere's existence.</p><p></p><p>A cold look appeared on Ning Tao's beautiful small face: "Nine years ago, for some unknown reason, news suddenly spread in the Northern Lands that there was a blood demon in my Tianxin Palace. </p><p></p><p>Later, several supreme beings came to Tianxin Palace as guests and suddenly attacked me.</p><p></p><p>After that... you were exposed.</p><p></p><p>I was hunted by over ten supreme beings one after another, constantly fleeing."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao spoke very helplessly.</p><p></p><p>She was certain that she had absolutely not leaked Qi Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>Even the few supreme beings of Tianxin Palace did not know of Qi Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>As a result, news of a blood demon in Tianxin Palace inexplicably appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone was targeting Ning Tao, deliberately spreading false news, only to suddenly discover the false news was true.</p><p></p><p>"You should have abandoned me." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Because of the blood demon, Ning Tao had been hunted by over ten supreme beings for nearly ten years and was seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>If she had abandoned Qi Yuan, none of this would have happened.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, are you feeling sorry for this slave?" Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes revealing a smug smile. "This slave said before, I will not abandon husband."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the half of Ning Tao's beautiful face that was revealed, and asked curiously: "I'm very curious about demons. May I see the other half of your face?"</p><p></p><p>At Mount Jiupan, he had not heard that having the character for "demon" carved on one's face made one a demon woman.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Demon, that is, Buddha, the demon woman he loved did not have a carved character on her face.</p><p></p><p>What exactly did "demon" mean?</p><p></p><p>Why were they despised by heaven and hated by people?</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see her true face.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Ning Tao's reaction was a bit extreme. She looked at Qi Yuan with hooked eyes: "I will not let husband see."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan did not insist.</p><p></p><p>"You should heal first." Qi Yuan fell silent. He had mixed feelings about Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, Zhao Zilong carried Liu Shan in and out seven times, riding alone for a thousand li.</p><p></p><p>Today, Ning Tao carried him in a great escape through the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't say anything more and began to heal seriously.</p><p></p><p>Night fell. Qi Yuan did not leave the blood sphere to go to Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>He still stayed by Ning Tao's side.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao had her eyes closed. Too severely injured, she had fallen into a coma. Her healing technique was still operating, slowly healing her petite body.</p><p></p><p>She frowned, sleeping on her side. Her dress revealed delicate jade-like feet, with five tender jade toes also curled up. Though a supreme being, it showed her extreme lack of security.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao's face, his expression indescribable, not knowing what he was pondering.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a tearful voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Am I very ugly now? Why haven't you come to see me yet?"</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was Ning Tao. Her eyes were brimming with moisture, like small pearls about to squeeze out the next second.</p><p></p><p>Her body was curled up like her jade toes, her face showing a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>And her eyes also opened after the voice fell. She stared at Qi Yuan, somewhat surprised: "You didn't leave?"</p><p></p><p>"You were sleep-talking again." This was the third time Qi Yuan had heard Ning Tao talk in her sleep. "I didn't expect even supreme beings would</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sleep talking."</p><p></p><p>The content of the sleep talking was the same as the previous two times.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't!" Ning Tao thought of something, half her face turning crimson, making her peach blossom-like face even more charming. "Even if I did talk in my sleep, it has nothing to do with you!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't say it had anything to do with me," Qi Yuan said calmly. </p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Ning Tao turned her head away, unwilling to look at Qi Yuan anymore.</p><p></p><p>However, she was gripping the chains binding Qi Yuan very tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you really a blood demon? Otherwise, how could you see through the flaws in their innate divine abilities?" After a long while, Ning Tao's slightly cold voice came, "Is that why everyone wants to kill blood demons?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao had her suspicions.</p><p></p><p>She never believed the talk of blood demons bringing calamity to the world. </p><p></p><p>After all, "demon woman" represented disaster.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not some damn blood demon!" Qi Yuan didn't think he was a blood demon at all.</p><p></p><p>Even on Nine Pan Mountain, he was called the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary also called him Blood Pearl, what did that have to do with being a blood demon?</p><p></p><p>"But if everyone in the world thinks you're a blood demon, then you can only be a blood demon," Ning Tao said, a trace of worry flashing in her eyes before she laughed, "A demon woman paired with a blood demon, husband and wife truly destined to be together."</p><p></p><p>"If I say I'm not a blood demon, would you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was silent, only answering slowly after a few breaths: "This servant believes you."</p><p></p><p>The second half of the sentence went unspoken - it doesn't matter if this servant believes, the whole world needs to believe.</p><p></p><p>"That damned Venerable, insisting on calling me some blood demon. If I ever run into him, I'll definitely have to give him a good beating."</p><p></p><p>"This servant will beat him together with husband." Ning Tao smiled charmingly.</p><p></p><p>"With your small frame, you'd better focus on recovering. If you get chased again, even with me here it would be hard to survive." Qi Yuan was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>He was a big help to Ning Tao, but he couldn't change her current situation. </p><p></p><p>There were so many supreme beings in the North, and they were undamaged supreme beings, not like the old man in Di Jue.</p><p></p><p>The only way for Ning Tao to change her situation was to abandon Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This servant is already used to being hunted," Ning Tao smiled like spring mountains, "In the past when hunted, this servant was always alone. Now... with husband by my side, what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Several decades passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>During these decades, Ning Tao brought Qi Yuan along, enduring endless sieges and pursuits. Qi Yuan alone saw over a hundred unique supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's guidance and help, Ning Tao escaped many dangers time and time again.</p><p></p><p>However, the injuries on her body inevitably became more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not always by Ning Tao's side. He often returned to No Return City to slay demons, continuously increasing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's power had risen sharply to level 109, not far from level 120, which was the supreme level of this world.</p><p></p><p>There were no living creatures in the clear pool. Ning Tao, wearing a black dress, her bare feet as white and tender as lotus roots, slowly entered the water.</p><p></p><p>The water in the pool instantly turned red, then the red disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, it was by this pool that I first heard your voice," Ning Tao's face showed a reminiscent expression.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she was young and being hunted by many people.</p><p></p><p>It was here that she heard Qi Yuan's voice.</p><p></p><p>Her gloomy life only then underwent some changes.</p><p></p><p>The cold water enveloped her skin, but what she felt instead was drowsiness.</p><p></p><p>After decades of this great escape, she had still injured her essence.</p><p></p><p>Her life force was flickering, on the verge of perishing at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan with an indescribable expression: "Husband, may I see what you look like? This servant is truly curious."</p><p></p><p>"I'm also very curious what your other face looks like. If you let me take a look, I'll let you see what I really look like," Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't let his true self appear beside Ning Tao, "If you don't send a photo, don't try to trick me into a video call."</p><p></p><p>The stubborn Ning Tao might lock up his true self here.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind." Her delicate head half-submerged in the water, Ning Tao gently blew on the surface, rippling the still pool, "It's better if this servant doesn't let husband see. Otherwise husband will be like those other people, fighting and killing me."</p><p></p><p>She would absolutely not let Qi Yuan see her other half-face.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want the only person in this world she still cared about to also despise her.</p><p></p><p>However, Ning Tao still seemed unwilling to give up: "Why is husband so obsessed with my other half-face? After all, when night falls, husband can completely treat me as someone else. This servant can also wear the black stockings husband likes, allowing you free rein."</p><p></p><p>"I'm very pure, don't tempt me!" Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>Although the demonic source had influenced Qi Yuan's lust before, he was unwilling to be a slave completely controlled by desire.</p><p></p><p>When feelings run deep, things progress naturally.</p><p></p><p>The two didn't speak, Ning Tao quietly soaking in the water.</p><p></p><p>After about a quarter hour, Qi Yuan suddenly asked: "Do you know how strong the Venerable and the White Emperor are?"</p><p></p><p>He was now at level 109, still considered insignificant in the battle between North and South.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to understand the power ceiling of this world by learning about the strength of the Venerable and White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable and White Emperor..." A solemn look appeared in Ning Tao's eyes, "If they wanted to, they could kill me with one finger."</p><p></p><p>"That strong?" Qi Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Among supreme beings, Ning Tao was not considered weak.</p><p></p><p>To be able to kill her with one finger.</p><p></p><p>Converted to the Cang Lan Realm, could this be Yin Spirit level? Thinking of the power of Yin Spirits, Qi Yuan felt great pressure.</p><p></p><p>Even the incomplete version of Yin Spirit like Great Sun was so difficult for him, not to mention two complete versions of Yin Spirits in this world.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to keep a low profile and not expose myself to the big bosses' sight too early," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Recently, a handsome young man came to No Return City, claiming to be a disciple of the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>That handsome young man had even invited Qi Yuan to the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Go to hell! Qi Yuan wouldn't dare meet the White Emperor until he reached at least level 99999.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of reality, where he faced the Light Palace which also had suspected Yin Spirit level power.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "Ning Tao, do you think a powerful overlord has any chance of killing the Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>An overlord was equivalent to Foundation Establishment in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao couldn't help but smile: "Husband is being too fanciful."</p><p></p><p>"If an overlord can't do it, what about a powerful nation protector?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, he was not even at the level of a nation protector, which was equivalent to Core Formation.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao continued smiling: "Even the strongest nation protector couldn't do it."</p><p></p><p>At the nation protector level, Ning Tao could kill them with a breath.</p><p></p><p>"What if that nation protector was as big as Ultraman?" Ning Tao was currently the strongest being Qi Yuan had met who could communicate properly, a late-stage supreme being, so he naturally wanted to ask more questions.</p><p></p><p>In case she gave him some inspiration, he could use it against the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>To deal with the Light Palace, Qi Yuan needed Yin Spirit level power to sleep soundly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he couldn't eat or sleep in peace.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how big Ultraman is, but... if Ultraman was as big as the Flowing Wind Realm, perhaps this nation protector really could kill the Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"A nation protector as big as the Flowing Wind Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned, a flash of inspiration in his mind.</p><p></p><p>What Ning Tao said made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>If... he formed a Golden Core as big as the Flowing Wind Realm, wouldn't throwing that Golden Core directly crush the Light Palace?</p><p></p><p>Such a Golden Core would be too mighty and domineering, right?</p><p></p><p>See anyone who doesn't submit, directly smash them with the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>This was much stronger than his previous fantasy of forming a Golden Core from the demonic source.</p><p></p><p>The more Qi Yuan thought about it, the more excited he became: "Ning Tao, you're so smart, even smarter than my wisdom-filled brain by a small margin."</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking for a bit, Qi Yuan felt helpless again.</p><p></p><p>Such a large Golden Core... where could he get it? Even if given an excavator and allowed to dig freely in the Flowing Wind Realm, he couldn't hollow out the entire realm to make his Golden Core, no matter how long he dug.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan felt conflicted.</p><p></p><p>He stopped thinking about celestial-grade Golden Cores. How could celestial-grade Golden Cores compare to... the thrill of refining an entire world into a Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>Such a Golden Core would be worthy of Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment!</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't speak again, continuing to soak in the water.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was exercising his clever brain, pondering the feasibility of refining the Flowing Wind Realm or other worlds into his own Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun was truly a genius! Qi Yuan felt the Daydreaming Technique was becoming more and more suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed.</p><p></p><p>"Husband..." Ning Tao's voice had become soft and sweet, just like when Qi Yuan first heard her voice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped thinking and looked over. The water's surface was sparkling, and Ning Tao's eyes held an expectant look.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm gone, can you let me see husband's appearance?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't raise death flags for yourself." Qi Yuan said, his voice full of regret, "If you had abandoned me earlier, everything would still be fine. Now that you've offended the entire North, even if you throw me away now, it won't help."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's strength was very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Over the decades, she had killed six supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in today's North, the number one wanted criminal was the blood demon, and number two was Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>"This servant said she wouldn't abandon husband, so she won't abandon you. I'm not as heartless as husband, casually abandoning this servant and leaving me all alone and helpless." Ning Tao's voice was soft and sweet, seemingly with a crying tone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't take it completely seriously.</p><p></p><p>Who knew how much truth there was in Ning Tao's words?</p><p></p><p>But her words also gave Qi Yuan a lot of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>He needed to level up quickly, reach level 120, and increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go to Nine Pan Mountain again.</p><p></p><p>Every time, he had left without saying goodbye.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ning Tao: "Have I ever abandoned you?"</p><p></p><p>They had never even met before, so how could that count as abandonment?</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked on the fallen leaves, heading towards the blind woman's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>A man's innocence is also innocence! Don't trivialize the innocence of men.</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, he arrived at the blind woman's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The sound of flowing water came, the blind woman seemed to be washing her face?</p><p></p><p>From Qi Yuan's perspective, well, he was blind, so he couldn't see anything clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Out of materials? So fast? Or are you here to mooch a meal." The blind woman came out, still holding a wooden basket.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman now seemed very calm, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Did you come find me last night?" Qi Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"No." The blind woman furrowed her brows, "What happened last night?"</p><p></p><p>"Last night... a woman suddenly attacked me and... you know." </p><p></p><p>"You must have had a wet dream, there are no other women in this Shenmu Abyss besides me." The blind woman said indifferently, her tone calm.</p><p></p><p>"That woman last night... I suspect it was you."</p><p></p><p>"You had a wet dream, and the leading lady was me?" The blind woman seemed to glare at Qi Yuan angrily, very upset, "Filthy!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt the blind woman's reaction, feeling a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Her tone didn't sound fake.</p><p></p><p>"You really didn't go last night?"</p><p></p><p>"I was sleeping here all night last night!" The blind woman said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit suspicious.</p><p></p><p>His nose didn't grow longer, which meant she was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>"There are no other women here?"</p><p></p><p>"Aside from me, there is no one else here." The blind woman's voice turned cold, as if she had developed a disgust for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The blind Qi Yuan "stared" at the blind woman, full of doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to go check my bed... there's still a scent lingering there."</p><p></p><p>"You... shameless!" Even though the blind woman had been living in solitude, her face flushed red at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's a floral scent, exactly the same as the one on you." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman stood there in silence for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This was too absurd.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan didn't seem to be the kind of person who would shoot in the dark.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go take a look."</p><p>The blind woman decided to go to the scene.</p><p>If she smelled any other scent, she would get angry.</p><p></p><p>"I warn you, don't have any improper thoughts!" The blind woman cautioned.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm the victim here!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p>Although one shouldn't trivialize the victimization of men, if this got out, it would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at Qi Yuan's simple bedroom.</p><p></p><p>"This is the crime scene." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman bent down, her delicate nose twitching, she seemed to smell something and fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Is there the same floral scent as on your body? You don't have the habit of sleepwalking, but you don't know about it, do you?" Qi Yuan asked. </p><p>Apart from sleepwalking, the other possibility was that she had a split personality.</p><p>This would be difficult to deal with.</p><p>According to the law, this might not even be a crime! "No." The blind woman stood up.</p><p></p><p>"This floral scent..."</p><p></p><p>"This floral scent is like a dream, not like reality, who knows if it's real or not?" The blind woman's voice sounded a bit desolate.</p><p></p><p>"Don't speak in riddles."</p><p>He felt the blind woman was hiding something from him.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenmu Abyss is very special, other than the places I usually go, don't wander around elsewhere, you might get dirty." </p><p></p><p>The blind woman said and then left on her own.</p><p>Leaving Qi Yuan alone in the wind, feeling confused.</p><p></p><p>"Dirty things?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I possessed by a ghost?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could only comfort himself this way.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I'm blind now, otherwise I would have known who the mastermind was last night."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, will she come again tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"Should I take a bath to seduce her tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'm too weak now, I shouldn't seduce her."</p><p></p><p>"What if she comes after and says 'who told you to wear so little', that would be so embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's good that my willpower is as strong as steel, otherwise I might get corrupted."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gathered his emotions and continued to cultivate the art of forging, creating magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>A mature man must face life bravely! Even if he was ravaged last night, he must work hard today!</p><p></p><p>However, when night fell, Qi Yuan was still cautious and vigilant when sleeping, hoping to catch the mastermind.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the mastermind did not come, leaving Qi Yuan quite disappointed.</p><p>This incident became an unsolved mystery.</p><p></p><p>Several months later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in the simple forging room, his face filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>"The Eight Doors Forging Art has finally all reached the grandmaster level, I didn't expect... the fusion to be so simple."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are so many opportunities in the midst of battle!"</p><p></p><p>If it were before, for Qi Yuan to fuse the Eight Doors Forging Art and forge his own path, it might have taken some time.</p><p></p><p>But ever since he fused the Death Radiance and Absolute Adaptation, Qi Yuan felt that the fusion of cultivation techniques had become easier.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Doors Forging Art was also quickly fused.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's forging art had reached the peak of the divine level.</p><p></p><p>"So, as long as I can forge another Divine Arrival, the role of the blind artifact master and the Divine Arrival will both come to an end?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mood was quite good.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Radiant Universe.</p><p></p><p>In the unknown realm, the sea of blood was surging, with stars constantly falling, like eggs dropped into a hot oil pan.</p><p></p><p>"Fengti Venerable, it's been a while." </p><p></p><p>A terrifying figure appeared, his physique towering, as tall as several stars.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of blood, the white-robed man opened his eyes, his eyes seeming to have experienced countless cycles of reincarnation, but then instantly regained their divine light.</p><p></p><p>"Old Three Wood, what do you seek me for?" Fengti Venerable was neither pleased nor angry.</p><p></p><p>Before this terrifying existence was a Realm Lord.</p><p>In terms of cultivation, he was one layer higher than Fengti.</p><p></p><p>But Fengti's master was a powerful Realm Lord, and Fengti had already grasped the essence of the ultimate rules at the Great Venerable Realm, it was only a matter of time before he stepped into the third layer of the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>So, he and the Realm Lord Three Wood were on equal terms.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when you will be able to step into the third layer of the Yang God Realm, attaining great freedom and great ease." Three Wood Realm Lord's figure flashed, transforming into a mischievous child, but this child had white hair and white eyebrows, looking old and decrepit.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult." Fengti replied.</p><p></p><p>Even at the Great Venerable Realm, he had already grasped the essence of the rules, but to truly etch it into the universal rules, it was extremely arduous.</p><p></p><p>He had been stuck at this realm for a hundred million years.</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivation time is still short, this is nothing, I was stuck for a full twelve hundred million years." Three Wood Realm Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what did you come find me for?" Fengti looked at Three Wood Realm Lord, asking seriously.</p><p></p><p>Realm Lords had almost endless lifespans, their souls persisting even after the universe's destruction.</p><p>A tiny true essence would eternally exist, and when the next era began, they would awaken again within the universal rules.</p><p></p><p>Three Wood Realm Lord had lived through three eras, and although he was a bit eccentric, since he came to find Fengti, it was definitely not for no reason.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, I learned of an interesting news, in the Radiant Realm, the Fengti created in your image... was actually defeated by a native of the Shenmu Universe." Three Wood Realm Lord narrowed his eyes, looking quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>Fengti was his old friend, and Three Wood Realm Lord often compared himself to Fengti, quite resentful towards the fact that Fengti was ranked third in the current era's Stepping into the Heavens Five Steps battle strength.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is it a legend?" Fengti pondered, not surprised.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, the Shenmu Universe was still a nascent universe, the appearance of some true geniuses was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>But whether those geniuses could grow, was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>In his generation, there was also a genius whose battle strength was even stronger than his.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he never even stepped into the Yang God Realm and perished.</p><p></p><p>"No... it's a Great Venerable, or perhaps even a Venerable." Three Wood Realm Lord said, his eyes shining with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>Fengti's eyes finally revealed a trace of emotion: "Oh, are you interested in him?"</p><p></p><p>He also had the idea of taking in such a person as a disciple, but it was just an idea.</p><p></p><p>After all, that person was a being of the Shenmu Universe, even if he stepped into the Yang God Realm in the Radiant Universe, it would still be very difficult for him to advance to the third layer of the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because the Radiant Universe's rules did not recognize him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But there are some existences that have been stuck on the second layer of the Celestial God for hundreds of millions or even billions of years, and perhaps that person would be interested in them.</p><p></p><p>"The waters of the Divine Wood Universe are deep, and the Dao Master has issued an edict that the Domain Lords cannot enter the Divine Wood," said the Three Wood Domain Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Domain Lords have integrated the laws of the universe, and if they rashly descend into other universes, they may be seen as provocative by those other universes, and some special events may occur.</p><p></p><p>So the Domain Lords rarely leave their own universes.</p><p></p><p>After all, their own universes are infinitely vast, and an ordinary Domain Lord cannot explore them completely even in several eras.</p><p></p><p>"As for my disciple, he is competitive and has always wanted to become the top martial artist of the current era..."</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord had a peerless genius disciple, who was only at the Great Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Because of the Three Wood Domain Lord's constant mention, this disciple has always had the goal of defeating the young Feng Ti.</p><p></p><p>"This time, he has gone to the Divine Wood Universe in his true form, ready to compete with that native.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, you say, if my disciple wins, won't that mean... you are not as good as me?" The Three Wood Domain Lord chuckled.</p><p></p><p>This was the real reason he came here.</p><p></p><p>For beings of their realm, getting stronger is really too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Having a little more fun in life is considered a happy thing.</p><p></p><p>If his disciple surpasses the young Feng Ti, this will be a joyful event worth recording in history.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, aren't you afraid your disciple will die in the Divine Wood Universe?" Feng Ti snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"If he dies, the old man will just go and ask... the Temporal Domain Lord to fish out his true spirit from the Cosmic Mother River," the Three Wood Domain Lord said casually.</p><p></p><p>There is a big difference between universes with a Dao Master and those without one.</p><p></p><p>In Zhou's universe, where there is no Dao Master, if a living being dies, its true spirit will be extinguished, and that is true death.</p><p></p><p>But once a Dao Master is born in a universe, a Cosmic Mother River will appear, and all true spirits will be recorded by the Cosmic Mother River.</p><p></p><p>Even if a living being dies, it can be resurrected by great means from the Cosmic Mother River.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Three Wood Domain Lord does not have such abilities, but the Temporal Domain Lord is a Realm of All Things Domain Lord, capable of fishing out a Great Venerable from the Cosmic Mother River.</p><p></p><p>"Boring." Feng Ti snorted coldly, "Even if your disciple wins, at the Great Venerable realm, ten of you are not my match!"</p><p></p><p>He boasted proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if I hadn't been born earlier, maybe I could have also grasped the essence of the laws at the Great Venerable realm!" the Three Wood Domain Lord said.</p><p></p><p>In each universe era, the cultivation civilizations are gradually progressing.</p><p></p><p>In the current era, there have even been cases of Great Venerables being able to grasp the essence of the laws.</p><p></p><p>This was unimaginable in the universe era of the Three Wood Domain Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Old thing, if you were born in my era, you wouldn't even have the qualifications to be my disciple!" Feng Ti said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, my disciple is stronger than you!" the Three Wood Domain Lord said proudly, "Wait for my good news."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the Three Wood Domain Lord disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This place was left with only Feng Ti, his gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"How's it going, do you want to leave the Radiant Light... and come with me to find..."The last few words seemed to be muted.</p><p></p><p>Feng Ti remained silent and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"A universe with a Dao Master... is nothing but a stagnant pool, without a future," the voice continued to tempt.</p><p></p><p>Feng Ti's gaze flashed with a sharp look: "Like... the Divine Wood Universe, does it have a future?"</p><p></p><p>"Not even that." The voice whispered, "Targeted by the Black Sky, even if your Dao Masters intervene, I'm afraid they won't be able to do anything about it, except... all worlds, any universe... are nothing but..."</p><p></p><p>"Your ambitions are too great, time is so long, the universe is so vast, full of uncertainties, enough for me to explore for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"Real uncertainties? A world that can be expressed by zeros and ones... everything is predetermined."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the voice fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Fairness, justice, equality, order..."</p><p></p><p>In the abyss of the Divine Wood, Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a frigid white flame was burning, and a terrifying aura permeated this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Descent!"</p><p></p><p>He whispered softly.</p><p></p><p>As I descend as a god!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the aura of the Divine Descent descended.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's aura became holy and majestic.</p><p></p><p>Now, the new Divine Descent is almost complete, just lacking the final step.</p><p></p><p>That step is the "will" of the Divine Descent, or the laws.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the new "Divine Descent", Qi Yuan actually has many ideas.</p><p></p><p>He wants to create it perfectly, truly realizing the idea of "if there is injustice, call upon me, the Divine Descent".</p><p></p><p>But the more he thinks about it, the more Qi Yuan realizes that this is difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>There is no perfection in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even the AI judge cannot be truly perfect.</p><p></p><p>The "will" of the Divine Descent, the laws of the Divine Descent, come from the person who creates it.</p><p></p><p>So in the end, Qi Yuan simply did not change it, and passed on the "will" given to the Divine Descent by Sheng Nü to the new Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>A vast amount of will and laws flowed through Qi Yuan at this moment, infusing the body of the new Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>The thoughts in Qi Yuan's eyes kept changing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after forty-nine days, Qi Yuan sat down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I've succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"But... I still feel it's not quite complete."</p><p></p><p>The new Divine Descent now has the complete will bestowed by Sheng Nü, and in terms of strength, it is actually stronger than the old Divine Descent.</p><p></p><p>But as Qi Yuan caressed the new Divine Descent, he still felt that it was not quite complete, lacking something.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear voice sounded: "Succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>The Blind Woman stood behind Qi Yuan, calm and serene.</p><p></p><p>Since being pushed by Ni last time, Qi Yuan vaguely sensed a subtle change in the Blind Woman's attitude towards him.</p><p></p><p>It could also be because they have been together for too long, becoming more familiar, and the Blind Woman has been idle, often chatting with him about the past.</p><p></p><p>It was mostly the Blind Woman talking, and Qi Yuan was a listener.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship has also improved.</p><p></p><p>"It's still lacking something, not quite complete," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blind Woman looked at the Divine Descent, her face showing hesitation and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want me to help you?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Isn't the Blind Woman unable to forge? How can she help? The Blind Woman's face showed a look of pride: "The Great Dao is fifty, the Heavenly Unfolding is forty-nine, whatever is not perfect, has departed from one of them.</p><p></p><p>I will give it... a spring blossom."</p><p></p><p>With the Blind Woman's voice, the new Divine Descent in Qi Yuan's hand underwent a special change.</p><p></p><p>This change, Qi Yuan could not fully perceive.</p><p></p><p>But... he could feel that the new Divine Descent has now infinitely approached perfection.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it has been constantly approaching perfection.</p><p></p><p>"There is no perfection in the world, but now... it has the opportunity to pursue perfection," the Blind Woman said, her eyes full of a nostalgic look.</p><p></p><p>Perfection does not exist, only the people in the world have a heart that pursues perfection.</p><p></p><p>The new Divine Descent now, with the addition of "one", will carry the "will" and move forward step by step.</p><p></p><p>This path may be rugged, may be setbacks, but it is always getting better.</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü's will, "Holding the light, driving away the darkness; if there is injustice, call upon me, the Divine Descent", may one day truly be realized.</p><p></p><p>The Blind Woman thought of a person.</p><p></p><p>"You're a lot like him."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"My future husband."</p><p></p><p>"That's not very fortunate!"</p><p></p><p>"Just similar, at least... he's not blind, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't discriminate against the blind, don't forget you're blind too."</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, thank you, if it weren't for you giving me the Eight Doors Forging Art, maybe... I wouldn't have been able to complete my own task." Qi Yuan said happily, "The swing, and your eyes... I will help you forge them!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, I'm actually not blind, no, I'll no longer be blind soon."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see, what you really look like!"</p><p></p><p>Curiosity showed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Divine Descent and the blind forging master's roles were complete, and he finally regained his sight in this moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards where the Blind Woman was.</p><p></p><p>"Blind Woman?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

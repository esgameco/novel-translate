        <h1>Chapter 211</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." Zhang Feng spat out fresh blood, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The burly man was clad in iron armor with intricate patterns, densely carved with human figures. </p><p></p><p>He looked at Zhang Feng with furrowed brows and asked, "How are your injuries?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man was a captain in the recent Evil God army camp, also with the strength of Three Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate it will take several decades of recovery before I can fight again," Zhang Feng said, his gaze seemingly full of sorrow. "I'm afraid I won't be able to serve the master during this time."</p><p></p><p>"You were too careless to be wounded by an assassin. The assassin has been executed, but your injuries..." The burly man frowned, his expression uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The camp commander had always valued Zhang Feng highly, entrusting him with all kinds of dirty and tiring work. After all, Zhang Feng was an Ancient God, so of course he should be worked to death.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the assassin was also at the Three Steps to Heaven level. Because of my loyalty to the camp commander, I've offended too many Ancient Gods and often face assassination attempts," Zhang Feng said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The burly man looked at Zhang Feng's injuries and said, "You rest for now. I will report this matter truthfully to the camp commander."</p><p></p><p>With that, the burly man left the palace with three New Gods.</p><p></p><p>The burly man narrowed his eyes, seeming to be thinking about something.</p><p></p><p>One of the New Gods couldn't help but snort coldly, "This Zhang Feng must be faking his injuries!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, he just doesn't want to do work for the camp commander anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"His brother-in-law died, and he's not seeking revenge. Does he expect us to avenge him instead?"</p><p></p><p>The New Gods speculated maliciously.</p><p></p><p>"He claims to have been assassinated by an Ancient God at Three Steps to Heaven, but where's the Ancient God's corpse?"</p><p></p><p>Last night, upon hearing news of Zhang Feng's assassination attempt, they had hurried to Cai Kingdom to provide support as instructed. But they were turned away at the door and only saw the injured Zhang Feng at daybreak.</p><p></p><p>The burly man glanced at his subordinates and sighed, "His injuries don't seem fake. Whether he staged this or not, it looks like our camp commander really won't be able to deploy him for several decades."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this is all our territory with the camp commander in charge. How could there be an Ancient God at Three Steps to Heaven taking action? An assassin is just a joke!"</p><p></p><p>"An assassin appearing here is utterly ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>The New Gods couldn't help but be confident. </p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods in occupied areas were in precarious positions. Not being purged was already lucky, and they rarely carried out assassinations. Those who could flee had already fled long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, a terrifying voice suddenly boomed like thunder:</p><p></p><p>"Execute the traitor Zhang Feng! Anyone who stands in the way will be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The four New Gods present were stunned for a moment upon hearing this voice. </p><p></p><p>There really was an assassin? At this time, Zhang Feng in the palace was also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>There really was an assassin!</p><p></p><p>"How bold!" the burly man shouted. "Your grandfather is here, who dares to be so reckless!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man was enraged.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Zhang Feng's assassination attempt was real after all.</p><p></p><p>The previous assassination attempt was one thing. But now, with their military camp's people here, someone still dared to come openly - this was a slap in his face.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be furious?</p><p></p><p>He soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, seven New Gods around him also flew up.</p><p></p><p>Powerful Evil God spiritual energy spread out, sweeping across the entire capital of Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>All the ordinary citizens trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan and the others also stopped in the sky above Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the burly man with narrowed eyes: "Are you Zhang Feng?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi beside him quickly said, "My lord, he's not Zhang Feng!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man also looked at Qi Yuan with surprise in his eyes: "I was wondering who would be so bold as to come to the capital of Cai Kingdom. It turns out to be over twenty True Gods!"</p><p></p><p>It must be said that Qi Yuan and his group's appearance was quite imposing.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty True Gods, and the vast majority were at Two Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This was definitely a very strong force in the surrounding countries.</p><p></p><p>However, the burly man was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>This time, those who came from their military camp to the capital of Cai Kingdom were all elites.</p><p></p><p>Eight True Gods, four at Three Steps to Heaven and four at Two Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>They were fewer in number compared to Qi Yuan's group of True Gods, but far superior in strength.</p><p></p><p>He himself was at the peak of Three Steps to Heaven, about to condense the embryonic form of a divine domain.</p><p></p><p>He alone could actually suppress these Ancient Gods.</p><p></p><p>"So many people, all merits!" the burly man spoke, his voice quite excited.</p><p></p><p>"Not Zhang Feng, yet you dare to block the way. Are you seeking death?" Qi Yuan spoke, a fierce light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a regretful voice came, and a pale-faced Zhang Feng rose into the sky: "Wenqi, I'm also very sorry about what happened to your great-grandfather. Who knew he would be so stubborn? If he had followed me in pledging loyalty to the New Gods, how could he have provoked their wrath? When the New Gods are angered, no one can bear the consequences. Your great-grandfather died, but he's also implicated innocent civilians throughout the city. It's really... sigh. So for the greater good, for the people, it's better not to resist the New Gods."</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi looked at Zhang Feng, his eyes instantly turning red.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes turned to Zhang Feng, narrowing. He immediately changed the subject, not bothering to listen to Zhang Feng's hypocritical speech: "Why are you pretending to be injured? Do you think that by pretending to be injured, I'll spare your life?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zhang Feng, his eyes seeing a lot of useful information.</p><p></p><p>For example, Zhang Feng now looked weak, as if seriously injured, but in reality, he wasn't injured at all.</p><p></p><p>The burly man beside him was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng coughed again, coughing up fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The burly man looked at Qi Yuan: "It seems the assassin who attacked Brother Zhang Feng yesterday was your accomplice. We misunderstood Brother Zhang Feng."</p><p></p><p>The other New Gods also felt guilty for misunderstanding Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Assassin? What happened to him?" Qi Yuan quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Thunder God Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Of course he's been executed!" the burly man said proudly. "Next, it's your turn!"</p><p></p><p>Executed?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>He then smiled: "As if Zhang Feng is worthy!"</p><p></p><p>Even if the Thunder God Great Venerable was seriously injured, he was still a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly die without even killing Zhang Feng when dealing with him?</p><p></p><p>If the Thunder God Great Venerable had such a record, Qi Yuan would laugh at him for three years.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan understood that the Thunder God Great Venerable probably hadn't arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>This was also normal.</p><p></p><p>To hunt Zhang Feng, the Thunder God Great Venerable definitely wouldn't charge in recklessly like him, but would be careful and cautious, avoiding all major cities.</p><p></p><p>Some accidents could happen along the way, causing a delay of a day or two, which was normal.</p><p></p><p>The stone in Qi Yuan's heart fell, and he no longer felt such a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Evil Gods before him, a greedy light appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So much Evil God spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>He could probably visualize quite a few powerful deities.</p><p></p><p>The burly man felt uncomfortable being stared at by Qi Yuan: "I don't like your look!"</p><p></p><p>Because he was supposed to be the hunter, while Qi Yuan and the others were the prey, the merits, the military achievements.</p><p></p><p>"I don't care if you like it or not," Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to say more. "Except for Zhang Feng, capture all the others dead!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave the order directly.</p><p></p><p>His words also confused the Ancient Gods and New Gods present.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't it be to capture them alive? How do you capture the dead? But since Qi Yuan ordered it, all the Ancient Gods didn't hesitate at all and immediately scattered, surrounding the eight Ancient Gods including Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>The smile on the burly man's face froze: "Am I still dreaming? A group of Two Steps to Heaven dares to surround us?"</p><p></p><p>He really didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Had these Ancient Gods gone mad?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about how they came to assassinate Zhang Feng so openly, everything became easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>"Attack. After killing them we still need to go find someone. That old Thunder God is really unreliable," Qi Yuan said with an annoyed look.</p><p></p><p>People really do become useless when they get old.</p><p></p><p>He even suspected if the old Thunder God had developed Alzheimer's and gotten lost?</p><p></p><p>The other Ancient Gods heard Qi Yuan's order and quickly took action.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the powerful Evil Gods, they didn't hide anything and directly deployed their embryonic divine domains.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, nearly twenty embryonic divine domains expanded simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The space above the capital of Cai Kingdom froze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Zhang Feng's face finally froze.</p><p></p><p>A look of terror appeared on the burly man's face.</p><p></p><p>"Embryonic divine domain..."</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>They were confused and couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>How could they encounter such Ancient Gods, and not just one.</p><p></p><p>Within the embryonic divine domains, these Evil Gods, whether at Two Steps or Three Steps to Heaven, couldn't move at all.</p><p></p><p>The dozens of divine acupoints in their bodies also became obscure at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The difference between a Venerable and a Great Venerable is the divine domain.</p><p></p><p>The number of divine acupoints determines the amount of divine spiritual power and the speed of its circulation.</p><p></p><p>When a Great Venerable's embryonic divine domain expands, it can directly block a Venerable's divine acupoints.</p><p></p><p>The Three Steps to Heaven present were now as fragile as One Step to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do the killing. It's been so long since I've beheaded anyone, too boring!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Due to world restrictions, Qi Yuan had been stuck at the peak of Purple Palace for a long time before.</p><p></p><p>Later when fighting with deities, it was always his subjects who killed the enemies.</p><p></p><p>Every time he watched, his hands itched, but he couldn't participate in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Thunder God Great Venerable directly subdued an Evil God for Qi Yuan to kill, but Qi Yuan couldn't even kill him.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Now, with so many heads, he was naturally very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Sword, come." Qi Yuan spoke, and a blood-colored long sword immediately appeared, moving through the air like a swimming dragon.</p><p></p><p>The long sword entered the embryonic divine domains as if entering unguarded territory.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed past the eight powerful Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the terrifying Evil Gods fell.</p><p></p><p>Their heads fell to the ground, their entire bodies shattered by Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>They died as thoroughly as possible.</p><p></p><p>"This time I can eat the feast with a clear conscience."</p><p></p><p>After killing the eight Evil Gods, Qi Yuan obtained a lot more Evil God spiritual energy, and his experience also increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze finally turned to Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Feng was like a dead dog,</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The embryonic divine realm and the power of many gods pressed down, making it impossible to move.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exhaled: "It feels so good to bully others with power!"</p><p></p><p>He had always been timid before, but this time he could finally strike back hard.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Zhang Feng, his gaze turning sharp: "I've wanted to kill you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng was pinned down by the other gods, his face full of terror: "Have I... offended you, sir?"</p><p></p><p>He tried hard to recall, but couldn't remember anything.</p><p></p><p>However, hearing that Qi Yuan said it was a long time ago, could it be from tens of thousands of years ago?</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan spoke, "Before I kill you, I'm going to... search your soul!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rarely searched souls.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with enemies, he always killed them directly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng's face showed terror: "How has this lowly one offended you, sir? Please enlighten me so I can die with understanding!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng had always lived by any means necessary, grasping at any chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Tianbao was an elder worthy of my respect, but I never met him. </p><p></p><p>You were closest to Venerable Tianbao, I want to see what he actually looked like."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, ignoring Zhang Feng's bewildered expression, his divine sense brutally pierced into Zhang Feng's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Tearing, penetrating.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, endless memories entered Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In Zhang Feng's memories, Qi Yuan finally saw that kind old man.</p><p></p><p>He often wore hemp clothes, fishing by the lake.</p><p></p><p>With all the memories obtained, Qi Yuan looked at the dazed Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Tianbao, this time, I remember you."</p><p></p><p>This time, he had seen Venerable Tianbao, and learned quite a bit about him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always remembered those who had shown him kindness.</p><p></p><p>Being remembered meant not completely perishing.</p><p></p><p>This way, when the day came that he stepped into the realm of mythical Daluo,</p><p></p><p>Those old acquaintances might appear again.</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, he killed Zhang Feng with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi, who had only been somewhat excited before, now had a tear fall from her eye.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister said at this time: "Sir, we need to leave quickly. The people from the Evil God's military camp will probably be here soon.</p><p></p><p>Next time, it may be a Great Venerable who takes action!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded upon hearing this. He suddenly thought of something and shouted loudly: "People of the Cai Kingdom capital, good morning! We can't have a feast this time, but next time I come, I'll treat you all to a meal."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed he couldn't eat at the home of the deceased.</p><p></p><p>But it was okay, there would be other chances.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the common people of the Cai Kingdom capital looked at each other in bewilderment, feeling it was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan also knew they had to leave.</p><p></p><p>Their group was strong, but compared to the Evil God's military camp, there was still quite a gap.</p><p></p><p>If all those evil gods from the military camp were fearless of death, like robots, they really might be able to hold them back.</p><p></p><p>The group instantly transformed into streaks of light and fled rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Killing people and running away was so thrilling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very used to this feeling.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was not being able to feast at the victim's home.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a deep voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, you might as well all stay!"</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods present changed expression upon hearing this voice.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable had taken action!</p><p></p><p>Only to see, in the distant north, a huge pillar of light unreasonably rushed towards everyone present at an extreme speed.</p><p></p><p>This pillar of light was filled with an aura of destruction, as if it could dissolve everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly a full-force strike from a certain Great Venerable, thousands of miles away, aimed at them.</p><p></p><p>The gap between a Great Venerable and a Venerable was comparable to that between a Yin God and a Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Although the people present had consumed divine realm elixir and could manifest embryonic divine realms!</p><p></p><p>However, their embryonic divine realms were far too inferior compared to a Great Venerable's complete divine realm.</p><p></p><p>A full-force strike from just thousands of miles away made all the ancient gods present feel a sense of destruction and inability to resist.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister's expression turned serious: "Let's all act together to help the lord block this strike!"</p><p></p><p>She was calling to the other seven ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>These seven ancient gods were all veteran ancient gods with powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>With the eight of them joining forces, they might be able to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even so, the losses would be severe.</p><p></p><p>If two out of the eight survived, it would be fortunate.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between a Great Venerable and ordinary Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for you to act!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Zhuangshi stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xifan, Shi Zhongshan and Mu Tong also stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Hadn't these four just broken through to the True God realm?</p><p></p><p>The four of them intercepting would be completely suicidal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "North Pole Four Saints, don't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>That's right, these four had used the North Pole Four Saints divine visualization method.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi was Marshal Tianpeng; Shi Zhongshan was the Xuantian Supreme God, also known as the later True Martial Emperor; Chen Xifan was Marshal Tianyou; Mu Tong was Marshal Yisheng.</p><p></p><p>"Even for myths, the gap is too big now..." the twin sister was anxious inside.</p><p></p><p>Those four had visualized myth-level divine visualization methods, but hadn't grown into them yet. Dying here would be such a waste.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't dare contradict Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>They could only worry in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the four villagers fly towards the sky, meeting that huge pillar of light.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Great Venerable's full-force strike, they showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I old Zhu will show you what true power is!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>The other three behind him also let out loud shouts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, time seemed to stagnate.</p><p></p><p>With their shouts, suddenly, the appearance of these four villagers changed drastically, emanating a sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying shadows condensed behind them.</p><p></p><p>Behind Zhu Zhuangshi, a terrifying celestial god with four heads and eight arms appeared, holding eight different weapons in his hands, over 40 zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way flowed in his palms, terrifying heavenly lightning danced in his hair like little snakes.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of Tianpeng appeared.</p><p></p><p>The other three villagers were the same.</p><p></p><p>Behind each person, terrifying shadows appeared.</p><p></p><p>The shadows were like celestial gods descending, impossible to look at directly.</p><p></p><p>Just one glance induced fear in the heart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was as if the endless Milky Way was churning.</p><p></p><p>The sound of weapons and horses came.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods couldn't help but look behind the shadows. Behind the shadows, it was as if there were thousands of troops and horses.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... what myths are like?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is it a thousand, ten thousand times more terrifying than the myths I imagined!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods trembled as they watched.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a purple lightning flash, the Milky Way churning.</p><p></p><p>Countless sounds of weapons and horses assaulted them. They seemed to see countless gods behind the shadows, wearing golden armor, holding long spears and halberds, like soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Every soldier was actually a god!</p><p></p><p>These gods, densely packed, formed an army. At a glance, there were no less than a hundred thousand!</p><p></p><p>Shouts also rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Tianpeng Tianpeng, Nine Yuan Evil Child!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Strongmen, Guard the South Against Evil!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Steeds Charge Fiercely, Guard the North Against Attacks!"</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred thousand troops, protect our nine levels!"</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Myths?</p><p></p><p>To hell with myths! Where in the Mortal Heart Realm were there myths commanding three hundred thousand True Gods? Three hundred thousand True Gods as soldiers!</p><p></p><p>Even the Hong Tang War didn't dare to fabricate like this.</p><p></p><p>"I am Marshal Tianpeng, leader of the North Pole Four Saints!"</p><p></p><p>"You dare to harm me!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi shouted again.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying shadow behind him opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The other three great marshals also opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>A strong pressure instantly swept over everything.</p><p></p><p>This scene was beyond description as gods descending to earth!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the shadows of the North Pole Four Saints reached out their hands to grab that terrifying, all-destroying pillar of light.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!" Zhu Zhuangshi shouted.</p><p></p><p>The other three villagers also had solemn expressions!</p><p></p><p>With Venerable bodies and divine realm seeds, they clashed hard against the Great Venerable's full-force strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The pillar of light dissipated with a rumble!</p><p></p><p>Recommending a book "After Going to Sea, Meeting Miss Witch".</p><p></p><p>[Recommendation]: Western fantasy + sailing + world-crossing + witches, those who like this type can take a look.</p><p></p><p>Here's the synopsis:</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious world, opened eyes to find oneself at sea.</p><p></p><p>At the start, framed and barely rescued, but the captain turns out to be an indifferent, murderous Miss Witch.

        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How much housing can 10,000 spirit stones buy?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not sure.</p><p></p><p>But the functions of this jade slip were even more primitive than a mobile phone.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's mouth curled up: "Sister has money."</p><p></p><p>"But the functions are too few. If it could do video calls and voice calls, it would be even better," Qi Yuan spoke eloquently, even wanting to copy Tencent QQ, "If it could send red envelopes and snatch spirit stones, it would be even more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Picking at flaws and offering suggestions, Qi Yuan was as skilled as an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you'd better shut up!" Jiang Lingsu gave Qi Yuan a cold look, "You explore it yourself, I'm tired, going back to sleep for a while."</p><p></p><p>The soft hand slipped away from Qi Yuan's hand, and Jiang Lingsu returned to her own thatched hut that looked like a dilapidated house.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then directed his divine sense into the jade slip of the Spirit Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>"Should I take a nickname?"</p><p></p><p>"How about 'Faceless Swordsman'?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I wore a mask when I killed Chu Tianxiong."</p><p></p><p>"I'll establish the 'Qi Yuan Sutra', and be the Patriarch of this realm! I'll be called the Primordial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan modified his nickname for himself and entered the forum.</p><p></p><p>The forum had three modules: the public area, the advanced area, and the high-level area.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tried it out, and found he could only access the public area.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't enter the advanced area or the high-level area.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because my contribution points don't meet the standard to enter the advanced area?"</p><p></p><p>The other areas of the Spirit Flower Association required contribution points to enter.</p><p></p><p>Contribution points were obtained by contributing to the Spirit Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's contribution points were currently 0, so naturally he couldn't enter the other areas.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any hidden sections?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered, and entered the public area.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, information similar to posts from a previous forum appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Cultivation Experience of the Flying Sword Cultivator"</p><p></p><p>"Seeking to Purchase a Grade One Foundation-Building Spiritual Object, the Coiling Dragon Grass"</p><p></p><p>"The Experiences of Tempering in the Profound Mountain Secret Realm"</p><p></p><p>"These titles are all very serious," Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>He clicked open the first post he saw, the cultivation experience.</p><p></p><p>The poster was called the Flying Sword Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The post mentioned that the Flying Sword Cultivator was a mid-grade Foundation Cultivator in the earth vein.</p><p></p><p>He talked about some of his cultivation experiences.</p><p></p><p>Among them, he mentioned that the most important thing in Foundation Cultivation was to establish a solid foundation, refine one's spiritual power to be majestic, so that when entering the Elixir Realm, the condensed Elixir would be more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Below the post, there were many polite replies.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"When you have time, fellow Daoist, come to my cave dwelling, and we can drink and chat."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exited the post.</p><p></p><p>He looked at other posts as well.</p><p></p><p>There were many posts in the public area, of all kinds of types.</p><p>Cultivation experiences, requests to purchase spiritual treasures and techniques, sharing of secret realm experiences, casual chats, invitations to duels, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a post caught Qi Yuan's eye.</p><p></p><p>"Water Needle Gold Flowing Out of the Red Rock Realm, For Sale"</p><p></p><p>"The Red Rock Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clicked in to take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>In the post, the poster introduced the Red Rock Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Red Rock Realm was a small mortal realm adjacent to the Cyan Wave Realm, and it produced various gold-attribute treasures.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Sect controlled the portal to enter the Red Rock Realm, conducting "trade", and many of its unique treasures had flowed into the Cyan Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So, the world doesn't just have one realm, the Cyan Wave Realm and the Red Rock Realm are adjacent, what about the Yueyue Continent?"  Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and searched for the term "Yueyue Continent".</p><p></p><p>The result was that there was no information related to the Yueyue Continent, which left Qi Yuan a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like this game isn't very popular."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, and also prepared to make a post.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a while, and then published a post.</p><p></p><p>"Shocking! I, who have cultivated the Heavenly Dao Foundation, have such a tragic fate! Seeking help from all the great experts!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the titles of their posts were all too serious, in a formal style, so he decided to go with a shocking style.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, since I captured the Heavenly Dao and cultivated the Foundation, I feel that the path ahead is unclear.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Heavenly Dao Foundation is too difficult, the cultivation methods are hard to come by. I request that the great experts bestow upon me a Mysterious-grade cultivation method or a Heavenly-grade cultivation method, or a method to strengthen my divine sense. I am the Primordial Venerable, and in the future I will have great gratitude, we can discuss the details.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes, can the fellow Daoists tell me about the Yueyue Continent? That realm is the place where I will attain the Dao, and I miss my homeland and wish to revisit it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's post was very simple, basically saying: I cultivated the Heavenly Dao Foundation, give me some cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan exited the connection with the Spirit Flower Association's jade slip and continued cultivating the "Hundred Refinements to Enhance the Spirit Technique", strengthening his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's post had already attracted the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Lands, the Emerald Cloud Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a cave dwelling, there was a young man with a handsome appearance, wearing golden robes, clearly an extraordinary figure.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness entered the jade slip of the Spirit Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he would go to the public area and browse, looking at the posts that interested him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those seniors or fellow Daoists were too boring.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he had only made two like-minded friends in the Spirit Flower Association, and had established a discussion group.</p><p></p><p>As he looked at the posts in the public area, a post with a very long title suddenly caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>"So long? Shocking? Cultivated the Heavenly Dao Foundation?"</p><p></p><p>The man in golden robes was startled when he saw the title.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that our Spirit Flower Association has another descendant of an ancient monster?"</p><p></p><p>The man in golden robes was a Foundation Cultivator, and he knew the difficulty of cultivating the Heavenly Dao Foundation.</p><p></p><p>It required capturing the Heavenly Dao Qi.</p><p></p><p>And to catch the Heavenly Dao Qi, one would need the help of an Yin Deity Realm ancient monster, or even a Yang Deity Realm ancient monster.</p><p></p><p>And such ancient monsters, in the Emerald Cloud Immortal Realm, had not been seen for many years.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing someone cultivating the Heavenly Dao Foundation, he naturally felt that this must be the beloved grandson of some ancient monster.</p><p></p><p>They would not hesitate to expend cultivation and spend time to help this person catch the Heavenly Dao Qi.</p><p></p><p>Such explosive content, he must click in to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Captured the Heavenly Dao, cultivated the Heavenly Dao Foundation? Primordial Venerable, Heavenly-grade techniques?"</p><p></p><p>The man in golden robes was stunned.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Dao Foundation cultivation must be fake! Suddenly, he slapped his thigh.</p><p></p><p>"This is a talented person, how come I didn't think of adding 'shocking' to the title when posting?"</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and decided to apply to add the Primordial Venerable as a friend.</p><p></p><p>Then, he also posted a thread.</p><p></p><p>"Shocking! After three hundred years of closed-door cultivation, the Elephant Rhythm Ancient Ancestor has a eighteen-year-old child."</p><p></p><p>The Elephant Rhythm Ancient Ancestor was the old enemy of the man in golden robes.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't defeat him, he could only do this, right?...</p><p></p><p>At night, Qi Yuan entered the jade slip again.</p><p></p><p>He re-entered the forum, slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because the originally serious forum now had a few eye-catching posts, starting with the word "shocking".</p><p></p><p>There were only a few such posts, but they seemed to be quite popular, with many replies.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered his own post.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if he had encountered any kindred spirits.</p><p></p><p>The comments below, however, made him slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"At such a young age, not studying well, just blowing your own horn."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the Heavenly Dao Foundation is not like this. In your sect or family, do you have any Yin Deities or Yang Deities?"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you are truly an extraordinary person."</p><p></p><p>These comments were all disbelieving of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this and couldn't help but say, "Indeed, true geniuses are always doubted."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to browse the comments.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one was willing to give him Mysterious-grade techniques or Heavenly-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>One comment caught Qi Yuan's attention.</p><p></p><p>"The Yueyue Continent, the name contains the word 'Yueyue', it may be the world of the Moon Sovereign Monarch.</p><p></p><p>In the extreme north of the Cyan Wave Realm, there is a Sacred Gate called the Moon Emperor Palace, belonging to the Dao lineage of the Moon Sovereign Monarch." The responder was anonymous.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quietly looked at the content above, his thoughts racing.</p><p></p><p>He quickly asked, "May I ask the senior, who is the Moon Sovereign Monarch, and where is he? How can I contact him?"</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for the anonymous person to reply.</p><p></p><p>"He manifests in myriad forms, and is said to be enthroned in the Heavenly Realm above the Void."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll have to visit the Moon Emperor Palace in the future."</p><p></p><p>In the Yueyue Continent, there was the Moon Emperor Clan, perhaps it was a coincidence, or perhaps not.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Sovereign Monarch..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the remnant consciousness he heard when he obtained the White Day Illusion Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun had encountered an external enemy and was ultimately defeated by that enemy, only able to hide and barely survive in the Earthly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Was that external enemy the Moon Sovereign Monarch, or was there some connection with the Moon Sovereign Monarch?</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan faced only a wisp of the Great Sun's remnant consciousness, he had paid such a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine how powerful the opponent the Great Sun faced at the peak of its power must have been.</p><p></p><p>Matters concerning immortal gods seemed too distant from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I've just cultivated the Foundation, thinking about these things is too early. At least I need to reach the Elixir Realm first."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Yuan felt helpless.</p><p></p><p>His "Qi Yuan Sutra" had no successors!</p><p></p><p>He must obtain some high-grade cultivation methods to perfect his own techniques.</p><p></p><p>"White Moonlight, Zhu Lianhua, where are you, my White Moonlight?" Qi Yuan yearned for the attention of the White Moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hoped that the White Moonlight would come gently like Miss Zhu Lianhua of the Lilac Lady, bringing various cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The White Moonlight did not arrive, and Qi Yuan saw that he had received two friend requests.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Lady? Is she my shijie (junior sister)?" Qi Yuan was surprised, and he accepted the request, then sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie, I've hidden myself so well and even changed my nickname, how did you find me?"</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong (senior brother), your aura is like the stars, if I couldn't find you, I wouldn't be your shijie."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, "Indeed, even though I've kept a low profile, I still can't conceal the brilliance within me."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the second request.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Great Day didn't die, he even ascended to the real world to hunt me down?"</p><p></p><p>The requester's nickname was Great Day Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's probably just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and accepted the friend request.</p><p></p><p>In Cuiyun Continent, the man in golden robes saw the request accepted and a faint smile appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow Dao friend is truly extraordinary, he only sent out one message and got over a hundred responses. </p><p></p><p>I posted a message in the public area and only got dozens of responses, but when I imitated this Dao friend, I also got nearly a hundred responses. This Dao friend is truly my benefactor."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief, it seems it was just a coincidence. </p><p></p><p>This Great Day Flame Emperor was not the real Great Day.</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm your benefactor, how about you give me some Heaven-grade techniques, or even Mysterious-grade ones!"</p><p></p><p>"...Origin Venerable, do you really need techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I urgently need them."</p><p></p><p>"I have a discussion meeting here, I see you are compatible, would you like to join?"</p><p></p><p>"...Okay."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan was invited into a chat group similar to a discussion forum.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked around, and with him there were only four people in the group.</p><p></p><p>The group leader was Great Day Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The other two were Rogue Immortal Saint and Ice Empress.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Saint: "Wow, a new person has arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Great Day Flame Emperor: "This brother is the one from the public area who is cultivating the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Saint: "Wow, big shot, cultivating the Heavenly Dao, a fellow cultivator. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, I've already reached the Immortal Foundation realm after ten million years, but I can't re-cultivate, which is my lifelong regret."</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, if you have any Heaven-grade techniques, please show me your strength." Qi Yuan said humbly.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, we don't have any Heaven-grade techniques, but since you've joined the discussion group, you're our brother, our fellow cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the group, we've placed some techniques above, three Mysterious-grade and seven Jade-grade, you can take a look." Rogue Immortal Saint said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "How can I accept this?"</p><p></p><p>He had already flipped through the three Mysterious-grade techniques and seven Jade-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>"We're all brothers, if you have any techniques, you can also share them with us, we'll walk the great path together in the future." Great Day Flame Emperor said.</p><p></p><p>"You're all good people." Qi Yuan thought for a moment and uploaded the "Brilliant Sword" technique to the group.</p><p></p><p>He also quickly opened those techniques and memorized them.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, you're amazing, you even have the 'Brilliant Sword', which is from the Hall of Light." Great Day Flame Emperor put away his previous condescending attitude.</p><p></p><p>Being able to bring out a Mysterious-grade technique, and even the "Brilliant Sword", this shows that Origin Venerable has some strength.</p><p></p><p>Although they like to boast, they do have some real power.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm just an ordinary Heavenly Dao cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just an ordinary Immortal Saint." Rogue Immortal Saint felt that he had previously spoken too poorly, and Origin Venerable's words were more interesting, "I just kill some demonic and evil Dao practitioners occasionally."</p><p></p><p>"Big shot is powerful, when I was in the Wangyue Continent, I once faced three thousand foreign demons, to prevent them from harming the world, I trapped them in a dead end and slaughtered them single-handedly for a whole month before killing them all!"</p><p></p><p>"'Single-handedly for a whole month', this phrase has a nice rhythm, I'll borrow it in the future, is that okay?" Great Day Flame Emperor said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>After getting the techniques, Qi Yuan exited the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that the two people in the group, although very nice, might have some problems with their heads? Their speech was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>He quickly started to study the Mysterious-grade and Jade-grade techniques, using his own eyes to perfect his own techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I've perfected the 'Qi Yuan Sutra' to the point of approaching the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, but it's a pity that the cultivation is too slow.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it will take at least five years for me to reach the middle stage of Foundation Establishment."</p><p></p><p>These techniques were far superior to the ones he had obtained from the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, the Great Liang Empire was still too small, a village-level cultivation unit, not as good as those larger places.</p><p></p><p>Just a few techniques have greatly supplemented the "Qi Yuan Sutra", but he also felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was too slow.</p><p></p><p>Five years from just starting Foundation Establishment to the middle stage, it sounds very fast.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it was really too slow.</p><p></p><p>Who knows when the Black Chicken old monster would suddenly awaken to the Divine Infant late stage.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Infant old monster, Qi Yuan was still afraid of him.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, he always felt that in that dream, when he beat up the person in the wooden house, even though he was living in the wooden house, he didn't win, leaving hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Game, when will you open up?" Qi Yuan felt that it was still faster to increase his cultivation through fighting and killing in the game.</p><p></p><p>Following the steps, the cultivation was too slow.</p><p></p><p>"White Moonlight, please bring me a technique that can increase my divine sense!" Qi Yuan prayed devoutly to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The "Hundred Refinements Bestow Soul Technique" only had limited daily increases to his divine sense, he needed more techniques to further perfect and transform it into a stronger one.</p><p></p><p>"My divine sense has also increased a lot, let me try to touch that game icon again!" Qi Yuan acted on his words, spreading his divine sense towards the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Liufeng Realm, the demonic woman Ning Lao still wore a black dress. She stood on a high mountain.</p><p></p><p>She had severe injuries on her body.</p><p></p><p>Five powerful experts with terrifying auras surrounded Ning Lao.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were here, he would find that these five were all at the Heavenly Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic woman, hand over the treasures on you, and we'll leave you with an intact corpse!" An elderly Taoist-looking man spoke, his eyes filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>This demonic woman, in just a hundred years, had reached the same realm as them.</p><p></p><p>They naturally felt that this demonic woman must have treasures on her, allowing her to cultivate so quickly.</p><p></p><p>The other four also looked at Ning Lao with greedy eyes.</p><p></p><p>Compared to her past self, Ning Lao's figure was now more tall and slender, her waist delicate, her bosom like an overturned jade bowl, only a handful. </p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching was her snow-white skin that contrasted sharply with the black dress, so white it was as if the moonlight had fallen on the pristine snow.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the five, her eyes carrying a proud air: "Is it possible that I've relied on my own talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit talent!" A burly man stared at Ning Lao, "Where's the man behind you? Call him out!"</p><p></p><p>In recent years, Ning Lao had grown rapidly without being suppressed, and there were rumors that she had a powerful cultivator behind her, so everyone was somewhat wary.</p><p></p><p>But no one knew who that powerful cultivator was.</p><p></p><p>"Old man thinks she's just making it up, there's no so-called powerful cultivator behind her!" A cold-looking woman said, eyeing Ning Lao maliciously.</p><p></p><p>These five were the controllers of the Bloodshed City, every year they would offer three hundred boys and girls to the City of Sin, Ning Lao was once one of those children.</p><p></p><p>The five slowly approached Ning Lao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao looked at them and smiled sweetly: "To kill you, do I need a husband?"</p><p></p><p>When she first heard that strange voice, Ning Lao took the opportunity to kill the people attacking her.</p><p></p><p>But she was very afraid of the owner of that voice.</p><p></p><p>Her mother had once said that if she called a man "husband", that man would temporarily put aside the killing.</p><p></p><p>When she was young, she had called out "husband" to the heavens to protect herself.</p><p></p><p>But after a hundred years, Ning Lao was no longer the weak girl she once was.</p><p></p><p>Now she had the ability to protect herself.</p><p></p><p>No need to be so anxious about that strange voice anymore.</p><p></p><p>Today, on the surface it was the five controllers of the Bloodshed City attacking her, but in reality, she was the one planning to kill these five great enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Today is your day of death!" Ning Lao held the Scythe of Death, the wind blowing her hair, falling on her face that could captivate all.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura began to spread.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a thunderous voice suddenly came from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Break the game, dare to block me, die... Ah, I'm not your husband!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! That voice rang out for no reason.</p><p></p><p>As if the gods in the heavens were rebuking the mortal world, resounding in the ears, like crashing thunder.</p><p></p><p>The five powerful experts saw that in the heavens, the energy was rolling, condensing into a purple-red lightning.</p><p></p><p>"Primal Spiritual Technique, Five Realms Supremes!"</p><p></p><p>These five people's faces showed horrified expressions.</p><p></p><p>Was this the Supreme making a move? Did this demonic woman really have a powerful expert behind her? (Chapter end)</p>

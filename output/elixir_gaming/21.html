        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even though the Venerable Ku Mu was a renowned Venerable, his heart was now in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, wanting to say something.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan simply left.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ku Mu sat down, his hand caressing the purple sandalwood chair, and a faint fragrance of the mundane world rose up, though he did not know what he was contemplating.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Divine Light Sect, Qi Yuan was again wandering with his own sword.</p><p></p><p>"A Grade 1 Foundation Establishment Spiritual Object... the Golden Flower Fruit." In truth, Qi Yuan was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>The price of a Foundation Establishment Spiritual Object was exorbitant.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Foundation Establishment Assembly requires defeating the disciples of other sects to obtain the reward... too much trouble." </p><p></p><p>Thinking about the competition, Qi Yuan felt bored, and he would rather grind his cultivation through gaming, as his strength would truly increase that way.</p><p></p><p>But when he went to a shop and inquired about the price of a Grade 1 Foundation Establishment Spiritual Object, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"What, it's worth 10,000 spirit stones? Extremely rare and in high demand?"</p><p></p><p>"There was once a noble clan willing to pay 50,000 spirit stones, but they couldn't even get a Grade 2 one?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, he could only obtain 10 spirit stones per month.</p><p></p><p>But after offending his master, his supply of spirit stones was cut off.</p><p></p><p>He had been living a frugal life, even reluctant to spend spirit stones to repair the leaky thatched hut, and had to climb up the roof to fix it himself.</p><p></p><p>What kind of immortal life was this?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once Qi Yuan established his Foundation, the amount of spirit stones he would need would be astronomical.</p><p></p><p>The refinement of spiritual power during the Foundation Establishment stage consumes the most spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Foundation Establishment disciples of the Divine Light Sect often go on missions outside to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Should I give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, too much trouble."</p><p></p><p>"If only some villain could win it for me, then I could stand on the moral high ground and take it back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts were all over the place, but they remained just thoughts.</p><p></p><p>An object of this caliber would surely be guarded by powerful figures, and in his current weak state, he had no chance of snatching it away.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around like a street urchin for a day, Qi Yuan felt like he was missing a will-o'-the-wisp and the eloquence of a young maiden to say to her father, "Dad, you really don't understand him."</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan caught the scent of a rich fragrance.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual carp, intoxicating mushrooms, Northern precious melons..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's nose was quite sensitive.</p><p></p><p>These aromas stimulated his appetite greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, the ingredients in this pot... they must not have been cheap, right?" Qi Yuan remembered that in the half year since he arrived in this world, he had only eaten such a delicacy made with spiritual materials once, and it was worth less than one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it's not too bad, just a few dozen spirit stones." Jiang Lingsu said lightly, patting her hands, "It won't be long before I establish my Foundation, so I need to eat some good food to nourish my body."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Jiang Lingsu had other considerations as well.</p><p></p><p>By displaying a bit of her financial capability, she hoped to catch the attention of the aloof immortal lady on the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>After all, when the impending dark turmoil arrives, the one who might be able to resist it would likely be that immortal lady on the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was dumbfounded: "Where did you get so many spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu smiled sweetly: "I was reborn into a good family."</p><p></p><p>"Spoiled rich girl." Qi Yuan gritted his teeth, "The seasonings in your spiritual dish are a bit lacking, so the flavor might be a bit off."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't afford these spiritual materials, not even a single mushroom.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, last time you made chicken soup for me, this time I'm treating you to a spiritual soup." Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression immediately changed: "Smells delicious, the ingredients are great, so naturally fragrant."</p><p></p><p>He even took the opportunity to advertise Jiang Lingsu's spiritual dish.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu: "..."</p><p></p><p>Truly a fool of a path, his mind was a bit problematic.</p><p></p><p>She served Qi Yuan a full bowl of the spiritual dish.</p><p></p><p>She also served herself a bowl.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a sip, and the flavors danced on his tongue, making his mouth water.</p><p></p><p>"Truly..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's a delicacy of the human world," Qi Yuan evaluated, finding it much more delicious than the takeout from Hextech Technology he had bought in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with just that one bite, he felt his spiritual power had increased a little. This was no less than when he had slain a level 70 demonic beast in the game's jade slips, and the feedback of the increased cultivation had reached his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt that grinding games was no longer as delicious, and it would be better to eat spiritual food.</p><p></p><p>And it was so delicious, far more so than Hextech Technology or pre-made dishes.</p><p></p><p>It was just that at this moment, Jiang Lingsu frowned, "Unfortunately, the level of the spiritual materials is too low, so the spiritual food made from them tastes a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt that the spiritual food in the bowl was no longer delicious.</p><p></p><p>Although it was no longer delicious, he didn't hold back when eating it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Time to grind games."</p><p></p><p>As the night had already fallen, Qi Yuan entered the game again.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Qi Yuan crawled out of the pit.</p><p></p><p>"After a full stomach... time to grind games!"</p><p></p><p>He held the great treasure sword and stealthily moved through the forest.</p><p></p><p>Tonight's Yiguan Demons were no different from usual.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the damage dealt to the Yiguan Demons last night had not left them with any memory.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan arrived at the place where the Yiguan Demons hung themselves.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xiang Sword Rain!</p><p>Wrist Powerful Fist!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began the slaughter again.</p><p></p><p>The Yiguan Demons were killed one by one by him.</p><p></p><p>And the other Yiguan Demons also woke up on the trees.</p><p></p><p>They had no faces, no eyes, no ears, and even no mouths.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan could feel their anger.</p><p></p><p>If they were given mouths, Qi Yuan was certain he would hear a string of beautiful ancestral language.</p><p></p><p>"You ****** ***"</p><p></p><p>Of course, these Yiguan Monsters could not speak, could not curse Qi Yuan, and could only attack Qi Yuan to vent their anger.</p><p></p><p>Alas, they all became Qi Yuan's experience babies.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan went in and out of here seven times, comparable to Zhao Yun and Wen Yang.</p><p></p><p>After a few hours, when he saw the Yiguan Monsters gathering again, Qi Yuan directly left without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Qi Yuan dug a pit and buried himself in it.</p><p></p><p>He was summarizing.</p><p></p><p>"The speed at which the Yiguan Monsters gather has become faster."</p><p></p><p>"It seems they are also growing."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm also growing, I've leveled up again, though it will become slower from now on."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished summarizing, and opened the chat interface.</p><p></p><p>He replied to the stream of messages sent by Jinli as usual.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's messages were very fragmented, such as saying that there was a flood in the area where the memorials were, and she was a little worried; or that the horse she was leading suddenly went crazy today, and she almost got injured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied slowly, and then shared his daily life in the game.</p><p></p><p>In a short while, he had sent a string of messages.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting late, time to log off."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he had been in the game long enough.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, what surprised him was that Jinli sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Still not asleep so late?" Qi Yuan wanted to look up at the moon, but unfortunately the pit couldn't see the moon.</p><p></p><p>"There were a lot of things happening today," Jinli said, feeling the calmness in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"I went to see Aunt Qin today and used the imperial medicine picked from the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land. Her injury has healed a lot."</p><p></p><p>Jinli slowly recounted the events of the day.</p><p></p><p>She didn't like to spread negative energy, so she tried to express it in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>"Your task seems quite difficult." Qi Yuan felt that if he were in Jinli's position, he might not have done as well as her.</p><p></p><p>After all, the court was full of human relationships, and he only knew how to fight and kill.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

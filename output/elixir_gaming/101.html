        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You can talk... Wow, you're a monster!"</p><p></p><p>The canary flapped its wings, flying three meters high, its small body trembling, looking extremely frightened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless when he heard this: "I'm human, a genuine human. </p><p></p><p>You're a bird that doesn't speak bird language but human language, you're the monster!"</p><p></p><p>"This young lady can speak bird language!"</p><p></p><p>"Biubiubiubiu... Jijijiji..."</p><p></p><p>The canary's voice sounded like a machine gun, or like an electric bike alarm, crisp and clear yet piercing.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady used bird language, so this young lady is not a monster. Your turn now, you're a drop of blood, say something in blood language, otherwise you're the monster?" the canary questioned.</p><p></p><p>Her conversation with Qi Yuan now lacked any logic, just like a foolish internet commenter.</p><p></p><p>How could blood talk?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't let himself be outdone by a bird.</p><p></p><p>"Dinosaur... carry wolf... blood blood blood..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instantly made something up.</p><p></p><p>The canary's little eyes widened, eyeballs rolling around: "You're lying to me, where have you heard blood talk like that?"</p><p></p><p>"You're not blood, how would you know how blood talks?" Qi Yuan felt his intelligence had gained the upper hand against the canary, directly applying the allusion of 'You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish?'</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the canary was stunned by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Neither of us are monsters?" It cautiously flew over, landing near Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, realizing he had been drawn in.</p><p></p><p>Whether one could speak bird language or blood language had nothing to do with being a monster or not.</p><p></p><p>"You're a monster, I'm not." Qi Yuan emphasized.</p><p></p><p>The canary landed beside Qi Yuan: "Even if this young lady is a monster, she's a very beautiful monster, while you're an ugly freak!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan couldn't tolerate it: "If I were to transform, I would also be handsome and dignified."</p><p></p><p>The two argued like children for a while, gradually becoming familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan discovered that this canary's intelligence wasn't very high, it was rather silly, and it was especially vain, or rather, loved beauty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that this canary had dragged him down to its level of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>He stopped arguing about meaningless things and asked: "Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"This is Mount Jiupan."</p><p></p><p>"Where is Mount Jiupan?"</p><p></p><p>"It's in Mount Jiupan, of course?" The canary gave him a look as if he were an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless, thinking "Why don't you just say it's on Second Immortal Bridge or Chenghua Avenue?"</p><p></p><p>But he understood that he wouldn't get any useful information from this canary.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the South-North Confrontation?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Anyone from the Liufeng Realm would generally know about the South-North Confrontation.</p><p></p><p>The canary shook its head.</p><p></p><p>"Then... do you know about the Demon Scourge?" Perhaps this wasn't the Liufeng Realm after all.</p><p></p><p>The canary's little eyes widened, showing a fearful expression: "You mean those ugly things? There are many, many of them at the foot of the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the starless sky above and roughly understood that this should still be the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Those ugly things are crazy and deranged. When they see us, they come to attack us."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what that door in the sky is?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>The door in the sky was mysterious and ancient.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Liufeng Realm before, he had never seen such a door in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the place he was currently in...</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," the canary shook its head.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't want to talk anymore, as he couldn't get any useful information out of this silly canary anyway.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Door of Myriad Distinctions in the sky, slowly contemplating.</p><p></p><p>The canary beside him glanced at Qi Yuan, then returned to its own nest.</p><p></p><p>The small nest, hanging on a big tree, looked quite delicate and exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Back in its nest, the canary groomed its smooth feathers.</p><p></p><p>It spent half a day just grooming.</p><p></p><p>After some time, it seemed to sense something and poked its little head out: "Blood bead, what are you doing? What's so interesting about that door?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm comprehending the origin," Qi Yuan answered the canary.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of the origin wasn't like in TV shows where one needs to be fully immersed and can't be disturbed.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to look at it with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, fragments would fall.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Door of Myriad Distinctions, Back Scratching Ability +1.]</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Door of Myriad Distinctions, Mutation Ability +1.]</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Door of Myriad Distinctions, Mental Disorder +1.]</p><p></p><p>Anyway, all sorts of strange comprehensions.</p><p></p><p>The more Qi Yuan comprehended, the better his mental state became.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the origin, what's that?" The canary looked up at the Door of Myriad Distinctions in the sky, its eyes showing a hint of instinctive fear, "Can it make one more beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably... it's possible," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the things comprehended were all sorts of strange abilities, so becoming more beautiful was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the canary became excited: "I want to comprehend too!"</p><p></p><p>It imitated Qi Yuan, staring blankly at the Door of Myriad Distinctions in the sky.</p><p></p><p>As he comprehended, Qi Yuan's form gradually grew larger.</p><p></p><p>Over the past month, what he had comprehended the most was the Mutation Ability.</p><p></p><p>He had a full ten of them now.</p><p></p><p>As for other bizarre abilities, they were just fleeting glimpses, not forming any system.</p><p></p><p>A month later, a sudden downpour swept over Mount Jiupan. The wind blew through the trees, the whole world was drenched, but Qi Yuan still stared at the Door of Myriad Distinctions in the sky through the rain.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the thunder and lightning.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Door of Myriad Distinctions, slight increase in combat power during thunderstorms.]</p><p></p><p>"This is possible too?" This was the first time in a month that Qi Yuan had comprehended an increase in combat power.</p><p></p><p>However, the cold rain hitting his face made him quite uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a banana leaf covered his head, shielding him from the rain.</p><p></p><p>The canary's voice came: "Blood bead, it's raining heavily."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at it, its feathers were half wet, and it was shivering: "I'm not afraid of rain, you should go back to your nest. Your feathers are getting wet, they won't be beautiful anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The canary held the banana leaf, "We're neighbors, this young lady saw you had no hands or feet and felt sorry for you, so I'm covering you... Achoo!"</p><p></p><p>"Can canaries sneeze too?" This was the first time Qi Yuan had seen this.</p><p></p><p>The canary was wet and a bit cold, it turned its head away, not wanting to look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said softly: "Fire."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a weak flame rose up beside them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the canary's eyes rolled around: "You know magic?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a small ability gained from comprehending the Door of Myriad Distinctions, but it's unstable."</p><p></p><p>This kind of ability was different from Qi Yuan's fireball technique in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>The fireball technique could be used in the Canglan Realm, but when operated in the game, it would have no effect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a feeling that the abilities gained through comprehending the Door of Myriad Distinctions were interconnected, not only usable in the Liufeng Realm but also in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat similar to his game skills.</p><p></p><p>Although these abilities seemed useless, Qi Yuan felt their potential was extremely great.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, blood bead, you're so powerful. Why is it that when I comprehend the Door of Myriad Distinctions, I don't comprehend anything, and my eyes even become a bit blurry?" The canary moved closer to the flame, feeling lazy, some of the cold in its body dispersing.</p><p></p><p>"You're not becoming nearsighted, are you? How can you become nearsighted looking at the sky? Maybe you should stop comprehending."</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to become beautiful!" The canary said stubbornly. Suddenly, its eyes rolled, "Do you smell something strange, like something burning?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced over, the canary's tail had been set on fire by his flame: "...Your tail is on fire."</p><p></p><p>"Ah... uh... My feathers are on fire!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood bead, this young lady isn't done with you!"</p><p></p><p>The banana leaf was lifted, rain poured onto the canary's feathers, and the fire finally went out.</p><p></p><p>There were still scorch marks on its tail.</p><p></p><p>How could it, who loved beauty the most, accept this result? It glared angrily at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady will never speak to you again for the rest of her life."</p><p></p><p>It was like an angry child, running back to its own house.</p><p></p><p>It looked at its own tail, its expression pitiful and aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>It muttered: "Blood bead, if you don't take the initiative to talk to me, this young lady won't pay attention to you."</p><p></p><p>The canary looked at the heavy rain outside and decided to sleep in its nest.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that only sleep could alleviate the pain in its heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At night, a banana leaf fell above Qi Yuan, blocking most of the rain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at that specially shaped bird's nest that could block wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>He saw the flustered canary, who seemed to realize it had been discovered and glared angrily at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? If you don't apologize, this young lady won't forgive you."</p><p></p><p>In the following days, the canary indeed didn't chat with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that having its feathers burned had truly angered the naturally beauty-loving bird.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to comprehend the Door of Myriad Distinctions, and his Mutation Ability kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>A full year passed, and Qi Yuan's Mutation Ability had nearly reached one hundred.</p><p></p><p>As for other bizarre abilities, there was a whole basket of them, all fleeting.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, blood bead, when are you going to take the initiative to apologize to this young lady!"</p><p></p><p>One evening, the canary appeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Its tail seemed to have grown back, and it glared at Qi Yuan angrily.</p><p></p><p>After a year, it finally recognized Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"...Who are you?" Qi Yuan felt a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"You... forgot about this young lady, unforgivable!" The canary looked at Qi Yuan, its feathers bristling as it paced around him incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're the canary. I remember now. Thank you for the banana leaf," Qi Yuan said with a smile as he tried hard to recall.</p><p></p><p>The canary glared at Qi Yuan: "You're not like the fish in the river with a bad memory, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Time flowed on, and twenty-seven years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form grew from the size of a small marble to that of a soccer ball.</p><p></p><p>His mutation ability also accumulated to nearly one thousand.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Differences in the sky gradually faded, becoming fainter and fainter, as if it could disappear at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Blood bead, tell me, who's more beautiful - me or that white fox from Seven Plate Mountain?" The canary fluttered its wings and landed in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Around Nine Plate Mountain, there were several other mountain ranges. </p><p></p><p>On Seven Plate Mountain lived a white fox that could speak human language. It was the most popular creature among the nearby mountains.</p><p></p><p>Home sweet home.</p><p></p><p>"You're the most beautiful," Qi Yuan said insincerely, comforting his neighbor.</p><p></p><p>"I knew this young lady was the most beautiful! Those guys have no taste, rating that white fox as the number one beauty!" The canary complained resentfully.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the canary looked up at the sky, a blank expression on its little face: "Blood bead, the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences you've been watching... is gone. Don't be sad."</p><p></p><p>"Blood bead?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood bead?!!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Has he returned?</p><p></p><p>Enlightenment of the origin came and went in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes and looked at his surroundings. He had returned to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>"So this is enlightenment of the origin?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He had gained enlightenment for twenty-seven years, and what he gained most was mutation ability.</p><p></p><p>When the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences disappeared, his enlightenment ended.</p><p></p><p>"Mutation ability... what exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>"And what is the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at his own body.</p><p></p><p>"Fire," he said softly.</p><p></p><p>A flame ignited.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't used any Cang Lan Realm spells, nor any abilities from the game.</p><p></p><p>He said fire, and fire appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Mutation?" Qi Yuan said quietly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his body showed no changes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I haven't gained enough mutation ability? Or have I not discovered the issue?"</p><p></p><p>"The next enlightenment probably won't come until I reach level 90."</p><p></p><p>He had gained one chance for enlightenment at level 60, so he would likely gain more at levels 90 and 120.</p><p></p><p>Putting these thoughts aside, Qi Yuan embraced Little Jia, and they lay down again in the large pit by the city gate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the windless desert, as far as the eye could see was yellow sand, with a magnificent vastness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the city wall embracing Little Jia, quite leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"This garrison mode is actually quite good. If I had to keep fighting monsters, even if I were made of iron, I couldn't withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had Death's Radiance, he was still too weak now, and recovering from injuries was troublesome.</p><p></p><p>He would have to wait until at least level 80 or 90 before using Death's Radiance would be most effective.</p><p></p><p>Only then would he be like an immortal cockroach.</p><p></p><p>"Are they coming?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan squinted his eyes and looked towards the vast desert.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, dust was flying.</p><p></p><p>The demonic army's advance kicked up a sandstorm-like scene.</p><p></p><p>And this time, compared to before, they seemed much stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Eight hundred of them?"</p><p></p><p>"Over twenty at level 49?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the past, there were usually only one or two monsters of this level.</p><p></p><p>This time, there were clearly over twenty.</p><p></p><p>"They come with ill intent!"</p><p></p><p>A happy smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"After dealing with the small fry, the big ones have finally come?"</p><p></p><p>He grabbed his broken sword and leapt down from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>As before, he shouted at the approaching demonic army: "I am the guardian of No Return City. Trespassers... will be killed without mercy."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his sword, his thin figure forming a stark contrast with the 300-foot high city wall.</p><p></p><p>This time, unlike before, the advancing demonic army suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>A woman's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What a handsome man."</p><p></p><p>Following this voice, a scantily clad woman walked out.</p><p></p><p>Her face was ordinary, barely above average, but her figure was extremely voluptuous. She wore a blood-red dress slit up to the waist, revealing half her hip bone as she swayed. On her slightly tanned buttocks, a deep handprint could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Her face was covered in strange tattoos.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was Cai Xia, the demon controller.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes revealing an ambiguous expression: "I wondered why we couldn't conquer No Return City. So a cultivator has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Cai Xia with surprise: "Apart from otherworldly demons and the shadows in Tian Jue, this is the first time I've seen a human-shaped experience pack."</p><p></p><p>A trace of regret flashed in Cai Xia's eyes: "You're handsome and have a strong body, it's just a pity about your brain. </p><p></p><p>But you know, I'm not interested in your brain, just your body."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Cai Xia's greedy gaze fell on Qi Yuan as she licked her lips: "Are you interested in joining our Northern faction?"</p><p></p><p>This kind of communication was normal.</p><p></p><p>Every day, large numbers of demon hunters guarding the 108,000 cities fled to the North, becoming part of the Northern faction.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xia's previous male pet had escaped from Qielan City.</p><p></p><p>"I only see you as an experience pack, yet you lust after my body. You're asking for death!" Qi Yuan held his broken sword, his face filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>Narcissistic woman, shrimp head!</p><p></p><p>"It seems... you haven't realized the reality of the situation." Cai Xia's smile froze. "You're alone in No Return City, without any support.</p><p></p><p>While the demonic army under my command is endless.</p><p></p><p>Do you really think that blocking a few waves of the demonic army means you can defend No Return City?</p><p></p><p>Even if you were a nation-protecting expert, even if you were a terrestrial myth, you alone cannot defend No Return City!</p><p></p><p>The 108,000 cities will slowly fall one day!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Cai Xia retreated.</p><p></p><p>As a demon controller, her own strength was actually quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts were her greatest reliance.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty overlord-level demonic beasts were enough to sweep through a small city like No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the hundreds of other demonic beasts behind them.</p><p></p><p>As Cai Xia retreated, the demonic army roared and charged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood alone in front of No Return City, facing an army of 800 demonic beasts, and charged into their midst single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>A flash of sword light was seen, and over a dozen demonic beasts were instantly sliced to pieces.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an unusual prompt sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>[Mutation progress 1%, extracting 1% demonic essence.]</p><p></p><p>[Obtained demonic essence x1.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he killed demonic beasts, he could only gain experience.</p><p></p><p>Now when he killed demonic beasts, he could also obtain demonic essence.</p><p></p><p>Was this related to the mutation ability he gained from enlightenment of the origin?</p><p></p><p>What exactly was demonic essence? However, he had no time to think about it now.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was still in the midst of a great battle. Everything would have to wait until after the battle was over.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter had just begun!</p><p></p><p>And with the demonic essence, Qi Yuan felt more excited, putting more effort into killing monsters.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, seeing this scene, the greedy look in Cai Xia's eyes intensified: "Such a strong body, I want to lick it."</p><p></p><p>However, after about a few hundred breaths, the greedy look on her face completely disappeared, replaced by wariness.</p><p></p><p>Because out of the 800-strong demonic army surrounding that one man, over a hundred had already been killed by him, and he still showed no signs of injury.</p><p></p><p>He wielded a broken sword, not at all like a swordsman, but more like an assassin charging into a military formation.</p><p></p><p>Yet even as an assassin facing an army's encirclement, he still managed to kill several demonic beasts with each thrust of his sword.</p><p></p><p>Since when did assassins face armies head-on?</p><p></p><p>She finally realized the seriousness of the situation: "You're a nation-protecting expert!"</p><p></p><p>To think there was actually a nation-protecting expert in this small No Return City!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his broken sword, killing an overlord-level demonic beast with one strike. He looked greedily at Cai Xia: "Thank you for bringing me this appetizer."</p><p></p><p>Level 60 and level 59 were a watershed.</p><p></p><p>According to the Cang Lan Realm's classification, it was the difference between Foundation Establishment and Core Formation.</p><p></p><p>According to the Wangyue Continent's classification, it was the difference between an Emperor and a Supreme Emperor.</p><p></p><p>According to the Liufeng Realm's classification, it was the difference between a nation-protecting expert and an overlord.</p><p></p><p>In the past, without merging with Little Jia, it would have taken some effort for him to kill this army of 800.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could do it with ease.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Cai Xia didn't hesitate at all and immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>A nation-protecting expert was not something she could deal with!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

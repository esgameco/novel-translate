        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the bell rang, the final battle began.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Divine Light Sect looked at the arena with a hint of worry on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also moved at this time.</p><p></p><p>Since the opponent was wielding a Foundation Establishment Artifact, then... let's not allow the opponent to fully unleash the power of the Foundation Establishment Artifact.</p><p></p><p>Although, he was not afraid either.</p><p></p><p>But if he could easily resolve it, why bother?</p><p></p><p>Stealth Technique!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared from the arena.</p><p></p><p>Chu Yun Dong was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Where's the person?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a huge fist landed on the back of his head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Chu Yun Dong didn't even have time to react, and was directly knocked down by a punch! Qi Yuan had played games for so long, with rich monster-clearing experience, what about sniping, positioning, and combos? It was easy-peasy for him! Dealing with Chu Yun Dong was a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's single strike knocked down Chu Yun Dong, and then he cast a Dust Cleansing Technique on his fist, wondering if Chu Yun Dong had any dandruff on his head.</p><p></p><p>He extended his fist, just like a boxing champion: "I won."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were no sexy ring girls here to hold up the cards for him, nor were there any bold ones to even offer a passionate kiss.</p><p></p><p>Only the old bearded man, the Prince of Chang Shan, stood up and enthusiastically waved at Qi Yuan without any grace.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Light Sect, Qi Yuan wins!"</p><p></p><p>As this voice rang out, the others finally noticed what had happened on the arena.</p><p></p><p>While Chu Tian Xiong had a gloomy expression, looking at the fallen Chu Yun Dong: "Useless!"</p><p></p><p>Even the Patriarch Bai Chicken was momentarily stunned, but ultimately said nothing.</p><p></p><p>The other sect disciples were not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was the top disciple of the Seven Colors Peak.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were no behind-the-scenes dealings in this Foundation Establishment Conference, he would probably have a chance to win the championship.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Peak Master of the Seven Colors Peak had not made prior arrangements, this Foundation Establishment Conference might not have been so harmonious, and the outcome could have been unknown.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the top disciple of the Seven Colors Peak!"</p><p></p><p>"It's clear that he's not just a cultivator of spiritual power, his mastery of the Dao of Combat is also so profound!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, how did you win?" asked the Divine Light Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Qi Yuan was a cultivator of the Dao of Obsession, with decent talent, but in terms of the Dao of Combat?</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that the eldest disciple of the Seven Colors Peak had never even gone to the Dao of Combat Hall to spar.</p><p></p><p>He was always obsessed with games, or just strolling around with a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>"By playing a lot of games," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the disciples all laughed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stepped down from the arena, feeling light and carefree.</p><p></p><p>This Foundation Establishment Conference was held and concluded in a sloppy manner.</p><p></p><p>As he stepped down, he saw a white-haired sect elder with a kind expression, holding a brown wooden box with patterns of birds, fish, and insects on it.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, this is the reward for this Foundation Establishment Conference, a Grade One Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item, the Golden Flower Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>The sect elder handed the box to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding them, the Divine Light Sect disciples and other disciples all eyed the box with envy.</p><p></p><p>Even some elders also had a covetous gaze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes also sparkled.</p><p></p><p>Over ten thousand spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>This was worth over ten thousand spirit stones! The sect elder encouraged, "I hope you can use this Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item to quickly establish your Foundation, and become an even greater combat force for our sect!"</p><p></p><p>Establish the Foundation?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no intention of using the Golden Flower Fruit to establish his Foundation. After all, he had a better choice.</p><p></p><p>To establish the Foundation, he would choose the best, the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment that Executor Xu Ren Shan had spoken of last time had already entered his mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't say these words.</p><p></p><p>Under the envious gaze of everyone, Qi Yuan bid farewell to the various sect elders and prepared to return to the Seven Colors Peak.</p><p></p><p>"You, this kid, with time, you will surely ascend to the peak of the cultivation world!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Onto the Heavenly Prodigy Ranking of our Great Merchant Clan!</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment Assembly has ended, and this old man is going to find your Sect Master to have a drink.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the Prince of Changshan waved his sleeve and left elegantly.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the crowd, Chu Tianxiong looked at Qi Yuan, a glint of greed flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan also seemed to have noticed Chu Tianxiong, his expression filled with concern: "Senior Brother, you must be careful lately. The ominous aura of bloodshed around you has grown even more intense."</p><p></p><p>He felt that Chu Tianxiong was not far from death.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know whose blood this ominous aura was meant for.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Tianxiong's expression darkened: "Hmph, you should be more concerned about your Shijie, Jiang Ran. I think it is she who has the ominous aura of bloodshed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? Let me divine the fortune of Shijie Jiang Ran as well." Qi Yuan said, as if he had truly taken Chu Tianxiong's words to heart.</p><p></p><p>【She is an ordinary cultivator, but recently an auspicious light has emerged around her, indicating that a joyous event is about to occur.】</p><p></p><p>After the divination, Qi Yuan looked at Chu Tianxiong: "My divination tells me that Shijie Jiang Ran is about to experience a joyous event. Why don't you go and kowtow to her, bask in the auspicious energy, and maybe the ominous aura of bloodshed around you will dissipate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke sincerely, truly concerned for Chu Tianxiong.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Chu Tianxiong was furious, and finally waved his sleeve and left, unwilling to continue conversing with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, "A dog bites Lü Dongbin, not recognizing the kind-hearted person."</p><p></p><p>He said this as he held the yellow flower fruit, preparing to return to the Seven-Colored Peak. Since his Master cared for him so much, he should show some filial piety.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, thank you." At this moment, Jiang Ran approached, her eyes still slightly red.</p><p></p><p>Today, Chu Tianxiong had confronted her, and she had been terrified.</p><p></p><p>But it was Senior Brother Qi Yuan who had stepped forward and helped her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was taken aback: "What are you thanking me for?"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Qi Yuan, for coming to my rescue, and for saying that... Chu Tianxiong has the ominous aura of bloodshed, which made him so angry." Jiang Ran felt a sense of relief as she said this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "What I said is true, he does have the ominous aura of bloodshed. It's a pity he doesn't listen to advice. If he had just kowtowed to you, maybe the ominous aura would have dissipated. People, they just need to listen to advice. I once knew someone who was especially good at listening to advice, and in the end, he became a great live-streamer."</p><p></p><p>Listening to Qi Yuan's rambling words, Jiang Ran's worries dissipated quite a bit: "Senior Brother, you are truly amusing."</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Jiang Ran's expression became grave: "Senior Brother, you must be careful of Chu Tianxiong. He is a ruthless and vengeful person. Recently, you should try to not leave the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Little Chu Tianxiong, what is there to fear? I'll just chop off his dog's head, fulfilling his ominous aura of bloodshed." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran knew Qi Yuan was not serious, but still said, "Chu Tianxiong is a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and moreover, his wife has even been given to the old demon Black Chicken as a concubine. Because of this, he is especially favored in the Black Mountain Sect. No matter what, Senior Brother, you must be careful."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his brows: "I didn't expect this fellow to have a hat on his head, quite safety-conscious."</p><p></p><p>After finishing his conversation with Jiang Ran, Qi Yuan left while holding the yellow flower fruit.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran looked at Qi Yuan's retreating back and sighed softly: "With a Grade One Foundation Establishment spiritual treasure, perhaps in five hundred years, Senior Brother may be able to step into the Divine Infant Realm. I wonder if I will still be alive by then."</p><p></p><p>The old demon Black Chicken was like a thick, gloomy cloud, weighing heavily on her heart.</p><p></p><p>And the arrogant, cruel, and tyrannical Chu Tianxiong was like a thorn, hated by all the disciples of the Divine Light Sect, including Jiang Ran.</p><p></p><p>After all, the crimes Chu Tianxiong had committed in Rongcheng recently had not been punished at all.</p><p></p><p>And when she learned that the Black Mountain Sect's group would be resting in Rongcheng for a night, Jiang Ran felt even more furious and powerless.</p>

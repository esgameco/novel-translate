        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had brought many steamed buns, and it took him about seven or eight minutes to arrange them all.</p><p></p><p>However, as he looked at the remaining bleached and withered skeletal remains, a pained expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the steamed buns I brought are not enough, not enough for them to eat."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "I have brought a lot of vegetables, you can cook them."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, various cabbages, pork ribs, rice and noodles flew out from his storage artifact.</p><p></p><p>When it was time to wield the vegetable knife, he had prepared many ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang hurriedly began cooking.</p><p></p><p>The other Imperial Guards were all looking at the words on the ground, sometimes lost in thought, sometimes sighing.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just simple text, and the calamity of the end of the world sounded too far away from them.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was no suitable background music to create the atmosphere, so they did not have much empathy.</p><p></p><p>Only the Confucian-robed scholar seemed deeply saddened, as his elder brother had died here.</p><p></p><p>"The world has fallen... Danger has come from the outside... Why was no one told us?" Tuo Sihai exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"If what is written here is true, the Qingshan Realm is probably... in grave danger!" the old blind man said in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to what was written, nearly 300,000 elite craftsmen from the Qingshan Realm had gathered here to refine the Heavenly Origin, in the hope of attracting the attention of the gods and transforming it into fragments of luminous treasures to fight against the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty thousand people hiding their identities, and there was hardly any news in the world about them. These people... I admire them," the charming lady said.</p><p></p><p>When they entered the underground palace, they had hoped to gain some rewards.</p><p></p><p>But looking around, the only word that could describe the scene was "desolate".</p><p></p><p>Aside from the skeletons, all the magical artifacts and materials had lost their spiritual essence, indistinguishable from ordinary junk.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that there was nothing of value in the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything valuable, it would probably be...</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Origin is what they forged?" the elder brother of the Black Sha brothers said in a deep voice. "With so many craftsmen gathered together, after decades of effort, they were even able to create numerous divine artifacts. Yet the Heavenly Origin was still forged in vain, and could only devour the flesh and blood of 300,000 craftsmen, as well as everything in the underground palace. Just what kind of terrifying existence is this Heavenly Origin?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, if we've intruded, will the Heavenly Origin devour us as well?" Wang Dao's face showed a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>After all, even divine-level craftsmen had been devoured, their fate if they rashly barged in could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records, the Heavenly Origin should have already finished devouring... We should have nothing to worry about, it's just... Did they succeed?" Tuo Sihai asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>These craftsmen had come to this mysterious realm, forging the Heavenly Origin day and night, hoping to attract the attention of the gods and be blessed with luminous treasures.</p><p></p><p>"They must have failed," the Confucian-robed scholar said hoarsely. "If they had succeeded, the people of the Radiant Hall would have come to take the Heavenly Origin long ago.</p><p></p><p>Now, the mysterious realm remains sealed, with no one coming to claim it, indicating that... the Heavenly Origin did not receive the gods' favor, nor was it transformed into fragments of luminous treasures."</p><p></p><p>In the Ten Thousand Mountain Peaks, they had established this mysterious realm to gather the best craftsmen from a realm, and the Radiant Hall must have been closely monitoring the progress of the realm.</p><p></p><p>If they had succeeded, the Radiant Hall would not have left the fragments of luminous treasures to be buried here, but would have taken them away.</p><p></p><p>Now, the mysterious realm remains undisturbed, as if forgotten, indicating that even after feeding the blood and flesh of 300,000 craftsmen to the Heavenly Origin, they had ultimately failed.</p><p></p><p>"If they failed, where is the Heavenly Origin now?"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Guards present felt a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>What if they had forged a terrifying demonic weapon!</p><p></p><p>Now, the underground palace was a ruin, and the most valuable thing here was probably this so-called Heavenly Origin.</p><p></p><p>After devouring numerous divine artifacts and the blood and flesh of 300,000 craftsmen, it was probably... beyond even divine artifacts in power. This terrifying existence could not even attract the attention of the gods and be transformed into fragments of luminous treasures.</p><p></p><p>The legendary luminous treasures, what kind of precious things could they be?</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, this old man must go find my elder brother, I shall take my leave." The Confucian-robed scholar bowed respectfully and headed deeper into the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, endless white bones were scattered, all buried in the ancient forest.</p><p></p><p>The sight was heartbreaking, the valley desolate and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he stopped on a staircase, where a skeleton was sitting, as if lazily basking in the sun.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this skeleton, the Confucian-robed scholar knew he had found his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother..."</p><p></p><p>The scholar's voice was choked with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Although he had suspected his elder brother's fate after his disappearance, seeing his brother's skeleton still filled him with deep sorrow.</p><p></p><p>His elder brother was the legitimate heir of the family, carefree and fond of fine clothes and horses, wandering the rivers and lakes. Their father had always worried that his brother's temperament would not be able to shoulder the family's responsibilities and burdens. His brother's journey to the mysterious realm had also surprised the scholar.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the palm of his brother's skeleton, and through the gaps between the finger bones, he could see some words carved on the staircase behind.</p><p></p><p>"If any later visitors see these words, I wish to bestow upon them a forging technique, only asking that they go to the Tianxiang Hall in the capital of Shang Kingdom to redeem the courtesan Anxiang. I would be grateful."</p><p></p><p>These simple words made the scholar's eyes moist with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>This writing style was his elder brother's.</p><p></p><p>When his elder brother was young, he had been carefree and dissolute, most fond of visiting brothels and listening to music.</p><p></p><p>He had loved a courtesan named Anxiang and wanted to redeem her to marry, but had been opposed by their father.</p><p></p><p>This had caused a rift between his elder brother and their father.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand, wanting to touch his brother's skeleton.</p><p></p><p>But the moment his hand made contact, the white bones crumbled into dust.</p><p></p><p>The traces of his elder brother's existence in this world vanished.</p><p></p><p>The scholar's hand movement stopped, his voice filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty thousand warriors hidden in the mountains, loyal and righteous in the cold night.</p><p>Their bones buried in the secluded valley, is there any regret? Their heroic names will not be passed down for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so I actually encountered the Grand Libationer of the Shang Kingdom's Literature Pavilion here!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of over ten people came walking over, led by none other than the Fifth Tyrant.</p><p></p><p>He exuded a strong aura of malice, as well as the arrogance unique to those of high status.</p><p></p><p>He strode forward, trampling on the scattered bones as if they were just weeds, completely uncaring.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomers, the Confucian-robed scholar's eyes narrowed: "The Fifth Tyrant!"</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Libationer of the Literature Pavilion and the Judgment Hall have always been in cahoots. It's perfect that I've caught you, let's see if the clowns in the Judgment Hall have the guts to come out," the Fifth Tyrant said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>After entering the underground palace, he had gained nothing, naturally putting him in a bad mood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Confucian-robed scholar, murderous intent rose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a burly divine-level Imperial Guard stepped forward, preparing to attack the scholar.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a calm voice rang out like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>"Hold it, the son-in-law Qi Yuan is here, you all better not be reckless!"</p><p></p><p>A group of people approached, led by a young man with a handsome appearance and a lazy expression - Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Confucian-robed scholar, a smile blossomed on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>This old man was truly his lucky charm.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had brought him Mosan.</p><p></p><p>And now, he had brought him a full twelve divine-level Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Tyrant swept his gaze over the group, his expression disdainful: "A bunch of nobodies, daring to come here and seek death!"</p><p></p><p>The divine-level Imperial Guards behind him couldn't help but laugh at the low-level cultivators before them.</p><p></p><p>Any one of them could easily slay these earth-level Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tuo Sihai anxiously said, "Brother Qi, they are divine-level Imperial Guards, their strength is extraordinary. You are just a son-in-law, you mustn't..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>When the Fifth Majesty heard this, he originally thought they had some self-awareness, but for some reason, as he listened, he always felt that there was something hidden in Tuo Sihai's words.</p><p></p><p>The other Prefectural-level Divine Soldiers Commanders also hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"You are just a small son-in-law, how can you fight against the Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders? If you offend these great figures, Ningguo will have no place for you to stay."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, quickly kneel and beg for forgiveness, beg the Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders to forgive you!"</p><p></p><p>A group of people kept talking endlessly, seeming to speak from the heart, but the Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders present did not hear any fear in their tone.</p><p></p><p>In fact... they even revealed a sarcastic and ironic tone.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders present were all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The scene before them was really strange.</p><p></p><p>What they said... seemed to make sense.</p><p></p><p>But... there was something sarcastic and ironic about it.</p><p></p><p>As if they were deliberately saying it.</p><p></p><p>This made the twelve Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders present feel inexplicably puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid?" the Fifth Majesty couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Afraid, I'm terrified to death, you are a Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commander!" Tuo Sihai hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, son-in-law Qi Yuan, should you beg them for forgiveness? Maybe they have a big heart and will let us go!" Wang Dao also said from behind.</p><p></p><p>They spoke all kinds of humble words, and their acting was also very skillful, making it look like it was real.</p><p></p><p>But the Fifth Majesty and the Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders present felt something strange and unpleasant in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They always felt it was sarcastic and ironic.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty's angry fire burst out on his face: "Outrageous, die for me!"</p><p></p><p>He was a genius who had been praised, and he could not tolerate even a grain of sand in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was angry and attacked directly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tear your mouths apart!"</p><p></p><p>He did not attack Qi Yuan, but those Prefectural-level Divine Soldiers Commanders who kept talking endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Tuo Sihai's eyes showed a look of terror, and this time he was afraid: "Don't tear my mouth, tear Brother Qi's, he's going to be crooked-mouthed!"</p><p></p><p>After all, a Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commander attacking him, that terrifying pressure was enough to frighten him. His body was tense, as if he was being stared at by a huge monster, and he couldn't even move.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The Fifth Majesty, I didn't expect you to bully ordinary people in addition to being a son-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty's figure suddenly stopped: "You know me?"</p><p></p><p>When the Confucian-robed scholar called out his name earlier, this group of people had not yet arrived.</p><p></p><p>"You sent Mo Sankong to try to take my wife as a maid, why didn't I know about it? Isn't it common knowledge that for a son-in-law, his wife is his bottom line?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was passionate and stirring.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, the dragon has its taboo scales, and to touch them is to die!"</p><p></p><p>"You dare to touch the woman of a son-in-law?"</p><p></p><p>After experiencing so many worlds, Qi Yuan's acting skills were particularly superb.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his looks and acting skills, if he were to make a movie called "The Dragon King's Son-in-law", he would be a natural fit for the role.</p><p></p><p>He would easily win an award.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty paused: "Are you Shen Lingxuan's husband?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze changing, and then revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The King has changed his mind, I won't kill you, but I will castrate you and send you to the palace!"</p><p></p><p>"The King wants you to watch with your own eyes, how your wife will..."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty was about to speak, but he suddenly found that he couldn't say the following words for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, even if he said them, there was no sound.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, this is a proper game, don't say sensitive words, or the river crab god will come. If I get banned, will you compensate my investment?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Fifth Majesty, somewhat angrily.</p><p></p><p>This game is not an adult-only one, can you not say words that violate the rules?</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Fifth Majesty was a bit startled.</p><p></p><p>Today's events were too strange.</p><p></p><p>Especially the words he just said, which mysteriously had no sound, or rather, the sound did not come out.</p><p></p><p>"You what, die!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan punched towards the Fifth Majesty.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders behind him all had a relaxed expression.</p><p></p><p>This strange situation looked very weird, but after all, there was no heavenly-human unity, so it was impossible to hurt the Fifth Majesty.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty naturally also had this idea: "Pretentious and deceptive fellows, what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the heaven and earth within a radius of thirty meters suddenly converged on his body.</p><p></p><p>He stood in place, like the overlord of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The living beings around him seemed to be all under his control.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of heaven and earth, this was true power.</p><p></p><p>What kind of pretentiousness and deception, what kind of strangeness, under such mighty heavenly power, would all be reduced to dust!</p><p></p><p>"Your own hard-earned power, how can it be as stable as the power I've gained through experience and level-ups?" Qi Yuan punched again.</p><p></p><p>After completing the role of the kitchen knife, his body had become terrifyingly hard.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Heavenly-level treasure weapon struck him, he could still meet it head-on.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Fifth Majesty, he showed no mercy.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying punch fell! Without any accident, the heavenly and earthly power around the Fifth Majesty retreated like the tide.</p><p></p><p>He had a look of horror and great bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>A voice also reached his ears at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"See, the power you've painstakingly cultivated is not reliable!"</p><p></p><p>The punch landed on the chest.</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered, a huge hole appeared in the Fifth Majesty's heart.</p><p></p><p>His face showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"How..."</p><p></p><p>"The biggest mistake you made was underestimating the son-in-law. Let me tell you, in these myriad worlds, the son-in-law, the security guard, the bodyguard, the delivery man... are not to be trifled with."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't even look at the Fifth Majesty's corpse.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the remaining eleven Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders, and a smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Now... it's time to hunt."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's speed increased tenfold.</p><p></p><p>The Prefectural-level Divine Soldiers Commanders present couldn't even see Qi Yuan's figure clearly.</p><p></p><p>The other Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders had not yet woken up from the shock.</p><p></p><p>"Monster!"</p><p>"This is a monster!"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>Even the prince had been killed, they were no match for this Qi Yuan.</p><p>This Qi Yuan... was too strange.</p><p>Not a Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commander! Why... was the heavenly and earthly power useless against him?</p><p>They had no time to think more, frantically fleeing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you're really too playful. If you had worked hard to cultivate when you were young, maybe you could have given me more experience, and you could have breathed in the fresh air of this world a little more."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chopped down a burly man with a palm strike.</p><p>His figure flashed again, and the drones also changed, affecting the escape of these people.</p><p>He was like a killing god, entering a realm with no one to contend with him.</p><p></p><p>Within a hundred breaths, the palace was dyed in blood.</p><p>The Heavenly-level Divine Soldiers Commanders present were all killed.</p><p></p><p>This barren and desolate palace now had spots of plum blossoms.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lazily stretched.</p><p></p><p>"The harvest is not bad."</p><p></p><p>These white moonlight figures of the Rakshasa Kingdom were all fat sheep, with plenty of banknotes and precious materials on them.</p><p>And he also gained a lot of experience points.</p><p>The heavenly-human unity also consumed a lot, but there was still a long way to go before a breakthrough.</p><p>The performance of the son-in-law... has improved a lot.</p><p>Qi Yuan guessed that what was currently lacking was... riding Shen Lingxuan?

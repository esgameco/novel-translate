        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw that Caixia wanted to escape, and his face turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He chased after Caixia.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!" Caixia shouted loudly. Immediately, all the demonic creatures became even more violent, rushing towards Qi Yuan recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the demonic creatures temporarily trapping Qi Yuan, Caixia's courage grew.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected a Guardian of the Nation to come to Wugui City! You are very strong, I'm no match for you. But so what if you're a Guardian? There are so many Guardians in Qielan City, yet they were still beaten back by us northerners and don't dare to come out. The South is destined to perish, why sacrifice yourself for it? Life is short, one should enjoy it while you can. Why bother with the so-called common people? Doing these things is just for your own moral satisfaction."</p><p></p><p>Caixia looked at Qi Yuan with a smug expression in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving. The next time I appear, Wugui City will surely be overthrown."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she turned and left without looking back.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became anxious: "You dare to overthrow Wugui City that I'm guarding? You're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Sky-Cleaving Sword Technique! Qi Yuan used his strongest sword technique.</p><p></p><p>With this sword strike, a gap was forcibly cut through the hundreds of demonic creatures that had surrounded Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene from afar, Caixia's face showed a shocked expression. </p><p></p><p>Killing over ten overlord-level creatures with one sword strike - this was not something an ordinary Guardian could do.</p><p></p><p>A powerful gust of wind came, and Caixia heard Qi Yuan's shout.</p><p></p><p>"Villain, don't run! Stay... and be a dog!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful wind struck her waist, and she fell from the sky like a kite with its string cut.</p><p></p><p>With just one aftershock, she lost all her fighting ability.</p><p></p><p>She turned with difficulty and saw that handsome young man approaching her with a broken sword in hand.</p><p></p><p>She was filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to die here.</p><p></p><p>"I... I'm willing to be a dog!" Lying on the scorching yellow sand, Caixia felt an odd ripple in her heart. She looked at Qi Yuan as he approached, her eyes showing a fawning expression. She even stuck out her tongue, just like a real dog.</p><p></p><p>"Bootlickers don't get houses!" Seeing this, Qi Yuan felt disgusted and directly slashed his sword at Caixia's body.</p><p></p><p>Caixia's body fell limply. She didn't understand - she had agreed to be a dog, why wouldn't he spare her?</p><p></p><p>Was there such a deep blood feud between them?</p><p></p><p>Weren't cultivators from the North and South often surrendering to each other?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she had no time to think further, because she was dead.</p><p></p><p>After killing Caixia, Qi Yuan turned his attention back to the army of demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>He raised his sword again and charged into battle.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan returned to the walls of Wugui City that he was guarding.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to understand most now was what exactly the so-called "source of evil" was.</p><p></p><p>He looked inward at his own body, carefully sensing.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Within his soul, he observed a wisp of gas about the size of a grain of rice.</p><p></p><p>This gas was multicolored, with countless hues.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the source of evil?"</p><p></p><p>[Source of evil: the evil of living beings - pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, lust.]</p><p></p><p>"The seven deadly sins?"</p><p></p><p>"This doesn't seem to be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>When his soul touched the rice-grain sized source of evil, he immediately felt countless images flash through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He slashed the Palace of Light in half with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>He gorged himself on mountains of delicious food.</p><p></p><p>He violently tore open the clothes of his junior sister Jiang Lingsu, and put stockings on her thighs.</p><p></p><p>"6."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan just wanted to go with a single 6.</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly feeling that mutation abilities are not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan realized he had fallen into a big trap.</p><p></p><p>However, after pondering for a while, he rejected this idea.</p><p></p><p>"How does that saying go? There are no evil martial arts in the world, only evil people."</p><p></p><p>"The source of evil is the other side of human nature.</p><p></p><p>If I killed all the demonic creatures in this world, how much source of evil would be in my body?</p><p></p><p>If I refined it into my golden core, it might be very powerful."</p><p></p><p>When the golden core emerges, it may trigger the seven emotions and six desires in enemies, giving birth to inner demons.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p></p><p>If so, wouldn't his golden core control something like the seven emotions and six desires?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rationalized to himself.</p><p></p><p>His mood improved quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the vast desert, Yuan Qi walked alone. His face was cracked and dry, and his overall condition was poor.</p><p></p><p>On the way to Wugui City, he encountered many wandering demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>He narrowly escaped death several times, but managed to survive.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>But the wooden box on his back had never been discarded.</p><p></p><p>"The road from Da Xia to Wugui City is full of demonic creatures everywhere.</p><p></p><p>How did my brother and the others reach Wugui City? Or... is my brother not in Wugui City?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi's heart was full of doubts. He needed to find out what exactly was going on in Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow traveler, are you also a cultivator from the South?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi turned around sharply and saw a man and a woman behind him, looking at him warily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and you are?" Yuan Qi asked in return, many thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that among the 108,000 cities, many cultivators defected to the North every year.</p><p></p><p>The two people before him showed no characteristic marks of demon controllers, but he had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"We are cultivators from Qielan City, heading to Wugui City," the tall man spoke. "Judging by the direction you're going, are you also heading to Wugui City? Could it be that you're from Da Xia?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi thought for a moment, and didn't conceal it: "That's right."</p><p></p><p>"I see." The tall man's face showed delight.</p><p></p><p>The woman beside him quickly asked: "Since you're from Da Xia, do you know the guardian of Wugui City?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian of Wugui City? Yuan Qi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know.</p><p></p><p>"I only know that a few years ago, my elder brother led troops to support Wugui City and never returned."</p><p></p><p>"Wugui City has been isolated for too long, we don't have much news about it either.</p><p></p><p>But we've heard that the guardian of Wugui City is a Guardian of the Nation.</p><p></p><p>He has been guarding the city alone for nearly three years!" The tall man's eyes showed admiration. "This time, my sister and I are going to Wugui City to pay a visit to this guardian and discuss some important matters!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Guardian of the Nation? Da Xia didn't have Guardians of the Nation.</p><p></p><p>Who was this guardian of Wugui City?</p><p></p><p>One person guarding a city alone? That seemed too... desolate.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yuan Qi's nose stung a little.</p><p></p><p>"Since we're all going to Wugui City, let's travel together."</p><p></p><p>Five days passed. During this time, Yuan Qi had learned the basic information about this pair of siblings, as well as their purpose for going to Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>This pair of siblings were named Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei.</p><p></p><p>They were going to Wugui City to persuade that guardian to go to Qielan City to guard it instead.</p><p></p><p>The reason they specifically sought to travel with Yuan Qi was that they thought Yuan Qi might know that guardian, and could help persuade him.</p><p></p><p>He was actually resistant to this idea. After all, why should a guardian from Da Xia abandon Wugui City to go to Qielan City? However, the words of Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei convinced him.</p><p></p><p>There really was no need to guard Wugui City anymore.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That guardian, guarding the lonely city alone, yet the Great Xia could not provide any help.</p><p></p><p>Continuing like this would only lead to pointless death.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi felt unwilling, guilty, and deeply remorseful.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, the three of them, travel-worn, finally saw the majestic city walls of Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the towering fortress, Liu Wentai felt admiration in his heart: "One person guarding an entire city, how magnificent."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Liu Wenmei summoned all her strength and shouted at the massive city: "Envoys from Jialan City request an audience with the guardian of Wuguicheng!"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was powerful, echoing as it entered Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>However, after a full ten breaths, there was still no response.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai had an ominous feeling: "This is not good, could something have happened to Wuguicheng?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them hurriedly ran towards the interior of Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>But as they approached the city wall, they all crashed into an invisible barrier.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The three fell to the ground, looking ahead with puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me," a lazy voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>At the base of the city wall, amid a cloud of dust, a young man holding a broken sword appeared, as if he had crawled out from underground.</p><p></p><p>He still seemed to have a sleepy look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi looked over, staring at the man with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>So young?</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei had the same thought.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't heard that this person had been guarding Wuguicheng alone for three years, they wouldn't have believed he was a national guardian.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the guardian of Wuguicheng?" Liu Wentai stepped forward to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The man who emerged from the ground was naturally Qi Yuan. "Why have you come to my Wuguicheng so early in the morning, disturbing my sleep?"</p><p></p><p>"I am Liu Wentai, and this is my sister Liu Wenmei. We siblings come from Jialan City to pay our respects to the guardian and discuss important matters!"</p><p></p><p>"Speak," Qi Yuan said concisely.</p><p></p><p>"Your guarding of Wuguicheng alone is truly admirable. Even the guardian of our Jialan City speaks highly of you," Liu Wentai began with praise.</p><p></p><p>"Get to the point," Qi Yuan was becoming impatient.</p><p></p><p>He felt it was easier dealing with demons than humans. Humans had mouths and talked endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Demons only roared like evil dragons.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai's face showed embarrassment: "Your guarding of a city alone is a heroic feat.</p><p></p><p>I have been sent by the guardian of Jialan City to specially invite you to Jialan City.</p><p></p><p>In our Jialan City, we have dozens of national guardians and over a hundred overlords, with formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Since the North-South decision, we have held the city for a hundred years without losing it.</p><p></p><p>Now, Jialan City is preparing to counterattack the demon army, to defeat the demon leader Mi Sang in this region in one fell swoop, bringing ten years of peace to our Jialan City.</p><p></p><p>However, Jialan City is short-handed, and you are a national guardian. Why not come to our Jialan City and join us in counterattacking Mi Sang!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai became very excited as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>After all, counterattacking the demons was something unprecedented in the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>If successful, it would greatly boost morale in the Great Sui nation.</p><p></p><p>And they would go down in history.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan shook his head: "Sorry, I'm not interested."</p><p></p><p>His refusal was straightforward.</p><p></p><p>This surprised both Liu Wenmei and Liu Wentai.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai quickly said: "Won't you reconsider?</p><p></p><p>If you join our Jialan City, we will provide ten great medicines every year, and even open up some powerful techniques to help you increase your strength."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai tried to tempt him with benefits.</p><p></p><p>Great medicines?</p><p></p><p>Techniques?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't need them.</p><p></p><p>With the Radiance of Death, demons were the best supplements for him.</p><p></p><p>To increase his strength in the game, he didn't need to cultivate, he just needed to kill demons.</p><p></p><p>"I am the guardian of Wuguicheng and need to guard Wuguicheng. I won't go anywhere else," Qi Yuan shook his head, his attitude very firm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Liu Wenmei stepped forward and said: "Your guarding of Wuguicheng is admirable.</p><p></p><p>But you are just one person. You've been able to guard Wuguicheng for three years, repelling wave after wave of demons, but the demons that come later will also get stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>How long can you hold out?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Liu Wentai also continued: "Behind Wuguicheng is the Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>The current Great Xia doesn't have a single overlord, and can't even gather a thousand leaders.</p><p></p><p>You guard Wuguicheng alone, without any backup. One day, Wuguicheng will fall, and you will perish with it.</p><p></p><p>Please consider the bigger picture, don't limit yourself to a small country, think of the interests of humanity!"</p><p></p><p>First tempting with benefits, then speaking of dangers, and finally appealing to a greater cause - most people would probably agree.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Yuan Qi listened silently.</p><p></p><p>What Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei said made sense.</p><p></p><p>This unfamiliar guardian, guarding Wuguicheng alone, had no future.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong one person is, how can they fight against all the demons of the North?</p><p></p><p>Guarding here alone, only death awaited him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "Don't try to guess a player's thoughts with an NPC's mindset.</p><p></p><p>I won't easily leave my post guarding Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>My mind is made up, please go back."</p><p></p><p>The rewards for guarding Wuguicheng might be comparable to fragments of the Heavenly Way, how could he possibly leave?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he wasn't necessarily on the same side as these people from Jialan City, they might even be competitors.</p><p></p><p>After all, these people would compete for his demons.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei looked grave.</p><p></p><p>There were some things in Qi Yuan's words they didn't understand, but they grasped the general meaning. They hadn't expected Qi Yuan's attitude to be so firm.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenmei raised her head stubbornly and looked at Qi Yuan: "What would make you willing to leave Wuguicheng for Jialan City?</p><p></p><p>Whatever conditions you propose, I am willing to agree!"</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was determined, truly meaning what she said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled lightly: "I want to become the lord of this realm, is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Wenmei knew this guardian could not be persuaded.</p><p></p><p>The siblings looked at Qi Yuan, their eyes showing complex emotions: "If that's the case, please take care of yourself. Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>The two didn't hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that things weren't working out, they left directly, without any dithering.</p><p></p><p>"Wait," Qi Yuan spoke up at this point.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenmei, who was about to leave, looked excited: "Have you changed your mind?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "No, I wanted to say, when you're slaying demons, if you can't finish them off, you can drive them towards me. My hands are itching."</p><p></p><p>Recently, hordes of demons had been attacking every two or three days.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had been killing them with great satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>But who would ever complain about too little experience?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Wenmei was somewhat stunned. She couldn't understand Qi Yuan's thinking, but she still nodded: "I will report this to our guardian."</p><p></p><p>She just assumed that Qi Yuan also wanted to contribute to Jialan City's grand plan.</p><p></p><p>The siblings said goodbye and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Yuan Qi: "Why aren't you leaving with them?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi looked at Qi Yuan, his emotions running high: "The Great Xia cannot support you in guarding Wuguicheng. I, Yuan Qi, am willing to die for you with my humble life!"</p><p></p><p>There was another sentence in his heart that he didn't say out loud: The people of Great Xia stand with you.</p><p></p><p>If possible, tens of thousands of Great Xia's soldiers and civilians would also be willing to rush to Wugui and die valiantly.</p><p></p><p>It's just... most of them would probably die on the way.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

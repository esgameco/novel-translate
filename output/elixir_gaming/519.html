        <h1>Chapter 519</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Water Snake twisted his body and looked at the endless stream of strange fish in front of him, his face showing a ferocious and excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"Once the situation is established, with the achievements here, I may not be unable to be transferred to the core of the headquarters, and finally... even go beyond the sky, truly becoming one of them!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Elder Water Snake's expression was filled with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Blood of Thorns is an extremely ancient, mysterious, and powerful organization.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that by joining them, one can embrace immortality and become indestructible.</p><p></p><p>This indestructibility is not as simple and long-lasting as the strange spirits.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the appearance of the strange spirits in the Green Mountain Realm and other realms is greatly related to it.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the strange fish are increasing, and if time goes on, this area of water will become a paradise for strange fish!" </p><p></p><p>The old man in the gray robe spoke with reverence. His body had been partially transformed and was now infinitely close to the strange spirits. As he spoke, the fish gills on his face opened and closed, looking quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>"But recently... it seems that many newborn strange fish have died, and some have even been discovered by the people of Tianzhong!" The old man in the gray robe mentioned this with a hint of worry in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's inevitable that so many strange fish will be discovered. As long as we produce them quickly and continuously, what does it matter if some are discovered and killed?" Elder Water Snake was completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"The elder is right."</p><p></p><p>"How many died, dozens or hundreds?" Elder Water Snake asked nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"About... seventy thousand."</p><p></p><p>"Seventy... wait, seventy thousand?" Elder Water Snake was shocked, "Almost all the ones released have died, how is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>These were seventy thousand strange fish, extremely agile in the water. Even a Realm-level Armored Soldier would find it difficult to kill them all.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed them?" Elder Water Snake hurriedly asked, a hint of fear in his voice.</p><p></p><p>"Unknown," the old man in the gray robe shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"There couldn't have been any accidents, right?" Elder Water Snake twisted his body, then shook his head, "The Weilong Xuantuan is in ruins, and Ningguo's current strength cannot threaten Lord Luorong Water. Even if there are accidents, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Elder Water Snake heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Lord Luorong Water was his greatest support.</p><p></p><p>In Eshan Lake, Lord Luorong Water was the true master.</p><p></p><p>With the Weilong Xuantuan unrepaired, even if the Patriarch of Tianzhong came, he would have to retreat in defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Keep an eye on the number of strange fish released. If there are any accidents, notify me immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Okay... Elder, not good, the three-ten thousand strange fish just released... are gone."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, the twenty thousand strange fish also disappeared!" The old man in the gray robe broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>The strange fish created here were constantly flowing through the water into Eshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>The number was no less than hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>But now, the strange fish that went out were constantly dying.</p><p></p><p>How could this old man in the gray robe not be terrified.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a supreme expert blocking the entrance, constantly killing the fish.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that as soon as they go out... they're gone." The old man in the gray robe spoke with difficulty, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Elder Water Snake's expression changed slightly: "Is someone blocking the entrance? Or... is there some other mishap?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Water Snake was extremely perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Elder Water Snake led the old man in the gray robe towards the fish release point.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, at the fish release point, Jiang Yunxi was holding a kitchen knife, a radiant smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect strange spirits to be so easy to kill!"</p><p></p><p>She stood in place, unmoving, simply placing the kitchen knife in the small pool in front of the fish release point, and then waiting for the strange fish to enter the pool.</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife was sparkling with lightning, and the sound of electric current was constant.</p><p></p><p>Any strange fish that entered the pool was electrocuted to death and then discharged into Eshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true chef, wielding a kitchen knife, using Eshan Lake as a pot, and stir-frying and boiling the fish." Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Don't just stand here electrocuting fish. As a qualified chef, you also need to debone, scale, and pick out the bones." Qi Yuan reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Chef Grandpa, you're right, it's just that these fish... who dares to eat them?" Jiang Yunxi still had some brains.</p><p></p><p>Almost no one dared to eat strange fish.</p><p></p><p>Although she said that, she still followed Qi Yuan's advice and began to debone the electrocuted strange fish.</p><p></p><p>"The old man will eat them." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Even the Winged Snake Elder Chen Kang had to take a bite, let alone these electrocuted fish.</p><p></p><p>"Chef Grandpa, there are too many fish, and it's a good thing you're here. With just a light touch, the fish can be electrocuted to death without any effort!" Jiang Yunxi was in a good mood, swinging the real kitchen knife and slicing the strange fish.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Yunxi's pupils contracted, and her trembling body showed that she was now somewhat frightened.</p><p></p><p>"Chef Grandpa, have you ever seen an old man with a fish head?"</p><p></p><p>"Fish head man?" Qi Yuan was surprised, "I've seen fish head women, shrimp head women, shrimp head men, but this is the first time I've seen a fish head man."</p><p></p><p>In the Shanhai Scroll, Qi Yuan had seen the Xiji Fish Woman, whose figure was quite impressive, with two big breasts and a fish head.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Elder Water Snake's voice came, and he looked at Jiang Yunxi with fury on his face.</p><p></p><p>Because the woman was holding a kitchen knife, and the knife was emitting lightning, any approaching strange fish were being electrocuted.</p><p></p><p>"A talking snake?" Jiang Yunxi was shocked, and then thought of the expression, "Are you an elder of the Blood of Thorns?"</p><p></p><p>She was very afraid.</p><p></p><p>Because in the many novels she had read, the Blood of Thorns were always the big villains, and they were very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Were these strange fish the handiwork of the Blood of Thorns elders?</p><p></p><p>"Chef Grandpa, what do we do? This is an elder of the Blood of Thorns, a terrifying big villain. </p><p></p><p>They are evil and powerful, and do all kinds of evil deeds!" Jiang Yunxi had almost exhausted all the idioms in her brain.</p><p></p><p>"What big villain, they look like pretty good ingredients to me." Qi Yuan casually transmitted, "You are a chef, a chef who saves the world. When you see delicious ingredients, how can you be timid?"</p><p></p><p>"Ingredients?" Jiang Yunxi hesitated.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Elder Water Snake's eyes shone, and he stared at the kitchen knife: "What a divine tool, could this be the legendary divine artifact?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's strength was obviously not worth mentioning, it seemed she was only a Profound-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>But the kitchen knife she held was extraordinary, emitting lightning, and any strange fish that touched it would die instantly.</p><p></p><p>This power was far beyond what a Realm-level artifact should have, it must be a Heavenly artifact!</p><p></p><p>Elder Water Snake felt that his luck was very good.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a surprising scene happened that made him astonished. The kitchen knife actually spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The gods have lost their minds, the thorns are stained with blood, I am the Caidao of the催债门, hand over the silver on your body!"</p><p></p><p>"...??" Elder Water Snake stared wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had received a transmission from the headquarters, saying that if anyone said this secret password, he should remember the person's information and hand over the banknotes on his body to the other party.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the other party was a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Elder Water Snake's thoughts turned, and his face showed even more delight: "The artifact can actually speak, this is not an ordinary divine artifact!"</p><p></p><p>There were rumors of some special artifacts that could emit human voices and had wisdom beyond that of a child.</p><p></p><p>Such artifacts were rare treasures even among the same rank, a rarity in the world.</p><p></p><p>He actually encountered one! His luck was too good! First he encountered the Water Lord, and now he encountered this kind of artifact.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Mandate of Heaven favors me? Elder Water Snake thought so, and he looked at Qi Yuan with a greedy gaze: "Follow me, all the banknotes on my body are yours."</p><p></p><p>"You want to keep me as a mistress?" Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, "Unfortunately, although you barely meet the qualifications of my white moonlight, you are too old and don't like to bathe, but my kitchen knife doesn't like the feeling of being kept."</p><p></p><p>He then secretly sent a small report to the staff of the Blood of Thorns through the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>"Your Blood of Thorns is not good, I'm going to find an old man to ask for money, he said the secret password, but he didn't give the money and said he wanted to keep me. </p><p></p><p>I can't stand this evil and wicked behavior, so I'll help you clean up."</p><p></p><p>After sending this message, Qi Yuan said to Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>"Cooking requires speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness. You have to let the food die painlessly, otherwise it's not cooking, but slaughter."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi gathered her courage.</p><p></p><p>She was a brave chef, and she wanted to save the world like the protagonists in the novels.</p><p></p><p>How could she be stopped by mere ingredients?</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Blood of Thorns were all the same standard villain template! When they encountered her, the savior, they should obediently go to their deaths and help establish her reputation, right?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Yunxi held the kitchen knife and charged towards Elder Water Snake.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a mere Profound-level Armored Soldier, looking for death!" Elder Water Snake's eyes were full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Not only a Profound-level Armored Soldier, even if Jiang Yunxi was a Realm-level Armored Soldier, he would not be afraid.</p><p></p><p>That artifact was powerful, with lightning swirling around it.</p><p></p><p>But the owner using it was just a noob.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly struck, no, he swung his snake tail, because he no longer had hands.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, his eyes widened, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast, Jiang Yunxi's eyes were filled with joy: "I'm actually this powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife in her hand accurately landed on Elder Water Snake's body, cutting him in half in one stroke.</p><p></p><p>"Cutting potato strips should be thin, continuous, and unbroken. Your knife skills still need improvement." Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was indeed weak in strength, but the kitchen knife was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Elder Water Snake died thinking he was facing Jiang Yunxi wielding a Heavenly artifact.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know, a good kitchen knife can guide the chef.</p><p></p><p>He was facing not only Jiang Yunxi, but also Chef Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more, don't waste it." Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's self-confidence was now overflowing.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>She held the kitchen knife and charged wildly towards the old man with the fish head.</p><p></p><p>Poor old man, his legs were not agile, and he was hacked to death by Jiang Yunxi's wild slashes.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the elders of the Blood of Thorns are no more than this!" Jiang Yunxi held the kitchen knife, panting heavily, her sizable chest rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi thought that when she returned home, she must record her heroic deeds in her diary, using as many obscure idioms as possible.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to pay attention: "Let's go, continue killing the fish, there are quite a few strange fish here."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Jiang Yunxi obediently nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days later, on the giant ship, the expression of the Mountain King was particularly worried.</p><p></p><p>"Still haven't found Yunxi?"</p><p></p><p>It had been three days since Yunxi's disappearance.</p><p></p><p>He had sent all his subordinates to search Eshan Lake, but there was no trace of Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>He even sent people to capture Chen Kang, but aside from finding a yard full of buns, they didn't find anything useful, and Chen Kang was also nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>"No." Yun Li lowered his head, his face pale, "It was my negligence that caused me to lose the Princess. I am willing to die as atonement!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, wait until you find the Princess, then you can atone with your death!" The Mountain King snorted coldly, his eyes bloodshot, obviously not having slept well these past few days, "In the vast Eshan Lake, where could Yunxi have gone?"</p><p></p><p>He was extremely worried.</p><p></p><p>"It's all that old scammer's fault, always tricking Yunxi into being a savior!" said a Realm-level Armored Soldier angrily.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Yun Li and Yun Hu had reported Jiang Yunxi's fish electrocution, which made the Mountain King...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>King Wang was greatly shocked, and it also caused many of the imperial guards to turn their heads.</p><p></p><p>However, the subsequent incident of losing track of Jiang Yunxi was what really worried the King of the Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"That kitchen knife, even if it is a peak-level divine artifact, has special powers, and how could Yunxi control it with her current strength? If she accidentally falls into the water and encounters the Water Lord..." The King of the Mountain was extremely concerned.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, many major events had occurred at Eshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>First, the Artifact Master Conference was convened, and just as the elders and experts of the Tianxong had predicted, no one could repair the Mighty Dragon Xuan Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although a young genius artifact master proposed a method, according to his method, the Mighty Dragon Xuan Yuan would not be successfully repaired until a hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>This left the Tianxong and the major families of Jining Prefecture greatly worried.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's proposal also sparked discussions among many people again.</p><p></p><p>Some were secretly fanning the flames, wanting to send Shen Lingxuan to the Heavenly-ranked Imperial Guard of the Middle Earth Rakshasa Kingdom to save Jining Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>What surprised everyone was that not only did the Shen family resist fiercely, but the opposition from the Tu family, the first family of Jining Prefecture, was no weaker than the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>With the opposition of these two major families, this proposal could only be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, today is Yunxi's birthday, but unfortunately, I... I..." The King of the Mountain regretted and blamed himself.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, do not worry, the Princess has her own luck, even if she is kidnapped by the Water Lord, she will be able to survive!" comforted a peak-level Imperial Guard.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Mountain glared at this person.</p><p></p><p>If you can't say anything good, don't say anything!</p><p></p><p>What do you mean "kidnapped by the Water Lord"? Can't it be that she got lost while playing at Eshan Lake?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a hurried figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, it's not good, we've caught a member of the Thorny Blood, and from his mouth, we learned that there is a Thorny Blood's Spirit Nourishing Ground in Eshan Lake, and the Thorny Blood's Water Snake Elder is in the Spirit Nourishing Ground!" </p><p></p><p>The visitor was an elder of the Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>"What? The Thorny Blood's Spirit Nourishing Ground, those strange fish... It must be their doing!" The King of the Mountain's thoughts moved quickly.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something, and the worry in his eyes deepened.</p><p></p><p>In the previous period, his daughter had used that strange kitchen knife to slay the strange fish.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that this has drawn the attention of the Thorny Blood? So the Thorny Blood has sent people to kidnap his daughter? "Where is the Spirit Nourishing Ground? I want to go there myself!" The King of the Mountain said.</p><p></p><p>Although this was just a guess, it was a matter of his daughter's life and safety, so he had to try any possibility.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Thorny Blood was a deadly poison to the Green Mountain, and everyone wanted to eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxong elder hurriedly said, "We have already detected the location, it is under Eshan Lake, and we of the Tianxong have already organized powerful experts, ready to attack with thunderous force and destroy the Thorny Blood's Spirit Nourishing Ground!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The King of the Mountain nodded.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, on a small boat, ten Imperial Guards of varying builds gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Their auras were suppressed, but it was still evident that they were not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>These ten were among the strongest peak-level Imperial Guards around Eshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>The Sorrow Wind Hand Wei Kun's eyes flashed with killing intent: "The Thorny Blood actually dares to interfere with the affairs of Eshan Lake, they are really courting death!"</p><p></p><p>As one of the strongest in the Tianxong, he had the strength of a Patriarch, and his words were imposing.</p><p></p><p>"This time we must succeed, no failure is allowed!" Wang Qingyi said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Water Lord Luorong is already extremely difficult to deal with, if the Thorny Blood's schemes succeed, there will be no Jining Prefecture left in this world!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even if our Ningguo produces a Heavenly-ranked Imperial Guard, it still won't be able to break the siege of Jining Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>These Imperial Guards sighed, feeling the immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"King of the Mountain, if the Princess is truly kidnapped by the Thorny Blood, we will prioritize rescuing the Princess," said an elder of the Tianxong, showing goodwill to the King.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you all." The King of the Mountain cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"The Princess has a kind heart, punishing evil and promoting good, a good person who worries about the troubles of Eshan Lake and wants to slay the Water Lord, such a good person should not fall into misfortune," said an Imperial Guard.</p><p></p><p>He had heard from Xie Danran about Jiang Yunxi's matter, saying that she wanted to go slay the Water Lord and save the world.</p><p></p><p>He naturally felt that the Princess was overestimating herself, but he couldn't say such words in front of the King of the Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The other Tianxong elders, who among them didn't have the same thoughts? In Eshan Lake, even the Patriarch of the Tianxong was not a match for the Luorong Water Lord, let alone the Princess, a young girl.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, conceal our auras and enter the Spirit Nourishing Ground, use thunderous methods to slay the Thorny Blood's Elder, and rescue the Princess!"</p><p></p><p>"The speed must be fast, don't attract the Water Lord's attention, otherwise we may lose many people here."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The group responded, their hearts heavy.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the ten Imperial Guards disembarked the boat and headed towards the Spirit Nourishing Ground.</p><p></p><p>"Such a dense bloody smell..."</p><p></p><p>"Why do I smell a scorched fragrance!"</p><p></p><p>"It's clearly a fishy smell!"</p><p></p><p>"Be more careful."</p><p></p><p>The ten carefully concealed their auras and advanced towards the underwater palace.</p><p></p><p>The underwater palace was a large-scale artifact, isolating all the water, allowing people to walk underneath.</p><p></p><p>The few present all had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This underwater palace... looks to be thirty years old!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, thirty years? Doesn't that mean the Thorny Blood's layout has been in place for thirty years?"</p><p></p><p>The people present became even more worried.</p><p></p><p>If the Thorny Blood's layout was only a few months or even a year or two, then the situation would still be within control.</p><p></p><p>But thirty years... they dared not imagine.</p><p></p><p>Even to the extent that the appearance of the Luorong Water Lord might be the Thorny Blood's doing.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then the matter was truly too big! The Sorrow Wind Hand Wei Kun's eyes flashed with a complex expression: "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He quickened his pace, and the rest followed swiftly.</p><p></p><p>However, just a dozen breaths later, the breathing of everyone present was held.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in front of them, there were densely packed strange fish corpses, piled up like a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Sorrow Wind Hand Wei Kun's eyes narrowed: "Water Snake?"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at the few corpses on the ground, revealing shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Thorny Blood's Water Snake Elder, he's actually dead!"</p><p></p><p>"He was at the peak of the Earth Realm... Who killed him?"</p><p></p><p>Those present all felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Water Snake Elder's wounds, it was a single fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>This meant the opponent was very strong, very strong.</p><p></p><p>Could it be an internal conflict? The group had many guesses.</p><p></p><p>"We must be careful..."</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, then quickly headed towards the underwater palace.</p><p></p><p>The deeper they went, the more shocking it became.</p><p></p><p>In this underwater palace, there were strange fish corpses everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"So many strange spirits, if they are released... Jining Prefecture is doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"They're all... dead?"</p><p></p><p>Some Imperial Guards couldn't help but look at the King of the Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Because the deaths of these fish were somewhat peculiar.</p><p></p><p>"More corpses!"</p><p></p><p>"So many corpses, all members of the Thorny Blood, killed with a single blow!"</p><p></p><p>As the group went deeper, they became more and more alarmed.</p><p></p><p>There were over a hundred Thorny Blood members dead in the underwater palace.</p><p></p><p>All of them killed with a single blow.</p><p></p><p>The worry on the King of the Mountain's face deepened, as he did not see his daughter.</p><p></p><p>The events before them were mysterious and unbelievable, beyond his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that a terrifying and mysterious spirit had been born, slaughtering all the living beings here.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute.</p><p></p><p>The underwater palace was vast, and it took the group three full hours to walk through it.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, they would discover more corpses of Thorny Blood members, as well as a large number of strange fish, shrimp, and turtles.</p><p></p><p>Those present were deeply worried.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Sorrow Wind Hand Wei Kun's pupils shrank drastically: "This is..."</p><p></p><p>His body trembled involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The others all looked over, their eyes filled with horrified expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Luorong Water Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"It... is dead!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the massive creature in front of them, their gazes shocked and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>They had imagined encountering the Luorong Water Lord, but they never expected to find its corpse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Luorong Water Lord was immensely huge, like a house, with various soft flesh and crystalline structures piled up, forming an eye, appearing particularly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>There was a huge gash on its neck.</p><p></p><p>Its entire body seemed to have been crushed.</p><p></p><p>Its aura was completely gone, as if it had just died a few hours ago.</p><p></p><p>Those present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Luorong Water Lord, which the might of Jining Prefecture could not contend with, had died so simply, it was almost dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>"The water here is very deep, who exactly killed the Luorong Water Lord, killed the Thorny Blood's people, and for what purpose?" Wang Qingyi took a deep breath, her back chilled.</p><p></p><p>Those present felt both relief and a sense of hidden conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Mountain was a bit irritated, because he did not see his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a surprised voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, there seems to be writing on the back of the Luorong Water Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The other peak-level Imperial Guards saw this and quickly crossed over the Luorong Water Lord's corpse.</p><p></p><p>"The Number One Chef in the World, the Savior of Ningguo, Jiang Yunxi slew the great villain, and went for a stroll in the underwater palace!"</p><p></p><p>Those present were all shocked, some even finding it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but look towards the King of the Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Mountain blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is Yunxi's handwriting..."</p><p></p><p>"The Princess Consort actually killed the Luorong Water Lord?" The Tianxong elders who had previously looked down on Jiang Yunxi now felt a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>This was just too... ridiculous, right? The King of the Mountain was also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>His subordinates reported Yunxi's situation to him every day, that Yunxi was tricked by an old man to learn cooking, and also wanted to save the world, he knew this very well.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to mock her in the future, what does cooking have to do with saving the world? But judging from the situation, she had truly learned some real skills? And even accomplished a great feat? He was now very confused and wanted to see his daughter, to ask what exactly had happened.</p><p></p><p>The other peak-level Imperial Guards mostly had the same thoughts, the scene here completely exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on a small boat, a young lady in a blue dress, holding a kitchen knife, looked heroic and imposing.</p><p></p><p>"Chef, am I impressive?"</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!" </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I never thought that one day Jiang Yunxi would also become the protagonist." Jiang Yunxi was very proud, but suddenly she thought of something and looked at the kitchen knife. "Chef, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't call me Chef anymore, I'm not going to lay eggs." Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>The role of the kitchen knife has been fulfilled, he's not going to be the kitchen knife anymore.</p><p></p><p>It's time to leave. </p><p></p><p>This performance has been completed satisfactorily, and Qi Yuan has gained a lot, and also unlocked new character roles to play.</p><p></p><p>The joy that had dispersed the worries in her heart, Jiang Yunxi felt a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Is the Chef going to leave?</p><p></p><p>"Chef... actually, today is my birthday..."</p><p></p><p>"You're the Chef!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you angry with me? Resenting me for being selfish, if I had known, I would have included your name too, it would be Jiang Yunxi and the Kitchen Knife traveling together!" Jiang Yunxi stole a glance at Qi Yuan, feeling a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

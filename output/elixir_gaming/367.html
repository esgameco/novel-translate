        <h1>Chapter 367</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Husband... is this the Black Sea?" </p><p></p><p>The petite and delicate figure of the golden canary appeared, her eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when Qi Yuan's strength had reached the Yang Spirit realm, he was able to bring the golden canary into the world of death energy.</p><p></p><p>Now, summoning the golden canary was effortless.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan rarely brought the golden canary along when carrying out missions. </p><p></p><p>After all, someone needed to stay at home.</p><p></p><p>"How do you like this place? Is it suitable for you?" Qi Yuan asked, pointing at the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Endless power of time, both real and illusory... The person who created this Black Sea must be extremely powerful!" The golden canary's face showed a look of awe.</p><p></p><p>"According to Grand Master Dazhi, they are likely above the Celestial realm," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit father and daughter he encountered in the Mortal Heart Realm were merely at the Lesser Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>But the big boss of this game could restart timelines, create the Mountain and Sea Scroll, and construct a Black Sea connecting the present and past.</p><p></p><p>These abilities were not something an ordinary Yang Spirit could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Above the Celestial realm was the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>And there were even higher realms beyond that.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't sure if this display of power was at the Ultimate Principle level or even beyond.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... you must be careful!" the golden canary said.</p><p></p><p>By now, she was able to set aside her shyness and call Qi Yuan "husband".</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm." Qi Yuan nodded and pinched the golden canary's cheek. "Don't worry, I'm just a player. Besides, I'm just a weak little Divine Infant - how would such a powerful being notice me?"</p><p></p><p>The golden canary smiled, "Do you want me to go back and summon the other Golden Core cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Qi Yuan had acquired nine stellar Golden Cores.</p><p></p><p>So the people of the Azure Waves Realm were blessed to have ten suns above their heads.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan planned that when he returned to the Azure Waves Realm, the first thing he would do was search the world for any archers or martial artists with names containing "Yi".</p><p></p><p>Such people would need to be closely monitored.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Hou Yi shot down his Golden Cores, he would be finished.</p><p></p><p>"No need. Nine Golden Cores are still too few to win by numbers. Let's wait until I have 9,999 Golden Cores," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Nine stellar Golden Cores were too meager.</p><p></p><p>And the quality of these cores wasn't great either. </p><p></p><p>He'd wait until he could swallow a big one and try becoming a black hole before deciding.</p><p></p><p>"The time energy in the Black Sea is very abundant. These blood beasts' bodies also contain a lot of time energy. This will be very beneficial for you, so you should stay here," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze shifting: "This time, I will definitely reach the Yang Spirit realm!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became complex: "Yang Spirit is truly so easy and simple for you all!"</p><p></p><p>Of the Divine Infants within him, almost 99% of those who had entered the Origin Land had reached Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>If the golden canary fully absorbed the time energy in this Black Sea, she would be qualified to enter Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan worked hard day and night, diligently cultivating, never forgetting to practice even while playing games.</p><p></p><p>And yet, after all his efforts, he was still only at Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Although his game avatar had Yang Spirit level combat power, that was just in the game.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was merely a Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>"Once I reach Yang Spirit, I'll protect you," the golden canary giggled. Her small body drew close, pressing her soft lips against Qi Yuan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Then, both my past self and present self will accompany you."</p><p></p><p>With those words, the golden canary's form vanished, entering the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>When mythical powerhouses reach the Yang Spirit realm, they gain a past self and a present self.</p><p></p><p>The past self's strength is comparable to a high-level mythical being.</p><p></p><p>The present self is the main body.</p><p></p><p>Generally, Yang Spirit cultivators use their past selves to handle affairs.</p><p></p><p>The present self remains in seclusion to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, powerful Yang Spirits can have past selves with Yang Spirit level combat power.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was different - even if he reached Yang Spirit in the game, he wouldn't have any分身 (divided bodies/avatars).</p><p></p><p>He was just himself.</p><p></p><p>Watching the golden canary disappear, a thoughtful look appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The black mist dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Excitement showed in the eyes of everyone on the ship.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the distance, their gazes filled with exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>"We've reached the Origin Land!"</p><p></p><p>"We've finally arrived at... the beginning of everything!"</p><p></p><p>The peak Martial Kings on board were excited, unable to contain their joy.</p><p></p><p>Those who could cross the Black Sea to reach the Origin Land were all unwilling to stagnate and eager to progress.</p><p></p><p>In the Mountain and Sea Scroll and the strongholds, the path forward was already blocked.</p><p></p><p>Only in the Origin Land was there a chance to advance to Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the Origin Land is near. I'll be taking my leave," said a peak Martial King as he left the ship and flew into the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>"This old man will also bid farewell."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, many more peak Martial Kings departed.</p><p></p><p>These departing peak Martial Kings did not bear the Martial Lord imprint.</p><p></p><p>They were used to being free and unrestrained, unwilling to follow other Martial Kings with Martial Lord imprints, but still wanting to forge their own path.</p><p></p><p>So it was best to leave before reaching shore.</p><p></p><p>They did not trust the Martial Lords waiting on the shore.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally stood up, his eyes filled with anticipation: "Returning to the starting point from here is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>He turned to Mo Yan and said softly: "Brother Mo, I have friends waiting for me here, so I'll be parting ways now. May we meet again if fate allows."</p><p></p><p>With those words, Qi Yuan's form dissipated, vanishing into the Black Sea like the other peak Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mo Yan felt somewhat regretful: "Brother Qi still isn't willing to stay and help me. What a pity."</p><p></p><p>The monkey-faced woman beside him couldn't help saying: "That guy is quite interesting. Being afraid of attracting a Martial Lord's attention and leaving early is one thing, but he had to say he has friends here.</p><p></p><p>What friends could he possibly have here?</p><p></p><p>Hmph, Brother Mo, you're just too gentle and kind.</p><p></p><p>If I were you, with how he's targeting you, rest assured, he wouldn't be able to reach shore."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mo Yan frowned, feeling somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"I was leaving, but oh my, hearing someone badmouth me, I've come back."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan's form reappeared on the ship.</p><p></p><p>The returned Qi Yuan had a faint smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the monkey-faced woman's expression changed slightly, looking somewhat embarrassed. Then her expression turned cold: "I wasn't badmouthing you, I was just stating facts.</p><p></p><p>A peak Martial King may be considered a big shot in a stronghold.</p><p></p><p>But in the Origin Land, what are you?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of her Martial Lord imprint and the Martial Lord backing her, the monkey-faced woman grew bolder.</p><p></p><p>People are often like this.</p><p></p><p>In the past when she was weak, the monkey-faced woman was extremely cautious during various missions, not daring to offend anyone for fear of provoking terrible enemies.</p><p></p><p>But as her strength grew, she became increasingly arrogant and overbearing.</p><p></p><p>This is just like many people in the real world who, once they put on a certain facade, think they are superior to others.</p><p></p><p>Of course, having a sense of superiority is inevitable and normal, a common human trait.</p><p></p><p>But for some, it's not just a simple sense of superiority.</p><p></p><p>That's why they say...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Demystifying some "powerful people".</p><p></p><p>Even kings and high officials - don't they also do foolish things? </p><p></p><p>Dignity? Wetting themselves in fear when caught, right?</p><p></p><p>The monkey-faced woman felt this way at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan's expression was not very pleased: "You were in the wrong to begin with, and now you've been overheard. It's best to apologize."</p><p></p><p>The monkey-faced woman looked somewhat aggrieved upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>Because she really didn't want to apologize.</p><p></p><p>However, for this ancestral blood battle, she still needed to rely on Mu Yan's energy.</p><p></p><p>She glared fiercely at Qi Yuan, her expression extremely conflicted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan extended his hand: "No need to apologize."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the monkey-faced woman felt she had intimidated Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In her heart, she looked down on him even more.</p><p></p><p>But then Qi Yuan's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"If she apologizes, how can I refuse without feeling bad? If I don't refuse, I'll have a huge psychological burden when I kill her!"</p><p></p><p>The monkey-faced woman's expression changed drastically, instantly becoming alert: "You dare to kill me? How dare you! Do you know who's behind me?"</p><p></p><p>"When an ordinary man is enraged, blood splatters five steps. Why wouldn't I dare kill you! Just because I don't have a Martial Ancestor's lineage, I deserve to be bullied by you? Alas, this world is too unfair, with too much malice towards someone like me without backing. No, everything must be fair!"</p><p></p><p>However, as he was speaking, Qi Yuan suddenly remembered he seemed to have a Martial Ancestor "grandson" - did that count as having "front-end support"? No backing, but front-end support?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan confused himself, so he simply stopped thinking, otherwise he'd grow another brain.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He attacked directly, without any mercy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mu Yan beside him became nervous and hurriedly shouted: "Spare her life!"</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner for the rest of the excerpt]</p>

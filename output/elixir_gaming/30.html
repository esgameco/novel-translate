        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Bear Attendant, when I went into the city today, I seemed to hear the sound of firecrackers and gongs, as if someone's family was celebrating a marriage.</p><p></p><p>I deliberately released a spirit insect to follow and recorded the address.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Bear Attendant, would you like your disciples to accompany you tonight to practice the Dao techniques?"</p><p></p><p>A disciple of the Black Mountain Sect said in a flattering tone.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong heard this and revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>"Is that you, Liu Wei? You're capable, I'll remember you.</p><p></p><p>Tonight we'll cultivate the Fa, and I'll let you be the first to taste the flavor of the new bride."</p><p></p><p>The crowd burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>However, as if thinking of something, Chu Tianxiong's face took on a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>"That Seven-Colored Peak disciple Qi Yuan has truly gone too far!</p><p>If it weren't for him having a good master, I would make him understand what a blood calamity and hell on earth really are!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Bear Attendant, I've heard that Qi Yuan has a problem with his head. Why should the senior bother with a fool? When we unify the Immortal Cultivation World of the Great Chu, you can do whatever you want to that fool."</p><p></p><p>The night gradually grew later.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a seemingly very rhythmic knocking sound suddenly came from the main gate.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect members in the courtyard stopped their conversation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong looked towards the gate and said, "Liu Wei, go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wei stood up and walked towards the gate.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and a masked man appeared in the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The mask was very simple, without even the outline of features, completely flat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Liu Wei couldn't help but reveal a mocking expression: "What are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>The masked man took out a kitchen knife and slowly spoke in a hoarse voice, "I'm a bit hungry, preparing to kill some fish to eat."</p><p></p><p>"Is he a fool?" Liu Wei paused.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong noticed the events at the gate and his voice came, "There are fish in the pond, let him come in."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wei smiled, "Heavenly Bear Attendant is kind, rewarding you with a fish to eat."</p><p></p><p>But inside the courtyard, someone asked, "Heavenly Bear Attendant, why let him in?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong replied, "It's boring here, let's find some entertainment.</p><p>That person is crazy, but his skin... quite white."</p><p></p><p>They were very bold and powerful, not worried about encountering any unsolvable troubles.</p><p>Moreover, they did not detect any dangerous aura from the masked man.</p><p></p><p>The masked man, holding the kitchen knife, entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Elder Bai was cultivating in the inner courtyard, and the rest looked at the masked man with mocking expressions.</p><p></p><p>When the masked man approached, Chu Tianxiong suddenly called out, "Take off the mask, let me see what you look like."</p><p></p><p>The masked man paused for a moment, then spoke after a long time, seeming very hesitant, "Do you really want to see?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what, you won't show it? Could it be that you're ugly beyond belief?"</p><p>"If you're ugly, I'll give you a new face!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect burst into laughter, the moonlight shining on their faces, making them appear extremely ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, before I put on this mask today, I've already said, those who see my face won't have a good end."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of bad end? Tell me about it!" Chu Tianxiong said.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, something unexpected happened that no one could have anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the masked man raised the kitchen knife.</p><p>A flash of white light passed, and the crowd couldn't even react in time.</p><p>Chu Tianxiong's huge head directly fell to the ground.</p><p>His face still bore the previous smile, which was frozen in that moment.</p><p></p><p>The people present were all shocked.</p><p>The event happened too fast, too suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The masked man looked at Chu Tianxiong's severed head and said thoughtfully, "It turns out, your blood calamity was meant to be upon me.</p><p>Encountering me is your tribulation.</p><p>If you have a next life, be reborn as an ant, I'm kind-hearted and have never used hot water to scald ant nests."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rest were dumbfounded, furious, and shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Bear Attendant!"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>"Treacherous person!"</p><p></p><p>These disciples, although inwardly terrified, reacted one after another, rushing to attack the masked man.</p><p></p><p>The masked man saw this and a carefree smile appeared in his eyes: "The monsters in the game don't have health bars, and you don't have health bars either. What's the difference between you and the monsters?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there is still some difference."</p><p></p><p>"You will scream in agony, no need for me to dub the voice myself."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if I have the talent, it must be useful. You will all cry in pain!"</p><p></p><p>"I rhymed, I'm truly a genius!"</p><p></p><p>At the moment when everyone was perplexed, puzzled, terrified, and furious.</p><p></p><p>He held a cleaver, like the most graceful dancer.</p><p></p><p>The knife rose and fell.</p><p></p><p>Eight slashes in the summer.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, most of the Black Mountain Sect disciples present had already died.</p><p></p><p>Only four or five people were left, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an anxious and angry voice came from the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Scoundrel! Coward!"</p><p></p><p>The originally cultivating Patriarch Bai Ji finally woke up and took action.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Black Mountain Sect disciples saw this and all showed expressions of relief at having survived.</p><p></p><p>Although the masked man in front of them was extremely terrifying, he was definitely not an Elixir Cultivator! With Patriarch Bai Ji's furious roar, a beam of elixir light shot towards the masked man.</p><p></p><p>The masked man saw this, held the cleaver, and let out a loud roar: "Heavenly Sword Slashing Technique!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had used this powerful skill in reality! The idea was solid, so he had to unleash his trump card.</p><p></p><p>He leaped up, and the moonlight poured down on his white robe.</p><p></p><p>The parts outlining his body emitted a faint white glow.</p><p></p><p>His entire figure appeared extremely illusory, with only the outlined parts being extremely solid.</p><p></p><p>In Patriarch Bai Ji's line of sight, it was as if a cleaver was slashing out from the moon.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelmingly mighty and unimaginable blade light directly charged towards Patriarch Bai Ji.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Patriarch Bai Ji suddenly showed an expression of fear at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was an Elixir Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The other party... was definitely not an Elixir Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The blade light swept through everything, instantly submerging Patriarch Bai Ji's elixir light.</p><p></p><p>And in the next moment, that blade light directly sliced through, shattering Patriarch Bai Ji's protective elixir light as well.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Patriarch Bai Ji was directly slain by a single blade.</p><p></p><p>The round golden elixir core also shattered into a small broken ball at this moment, covered in countless holes.</p><p></p><p>The masked man paused: "That's it?"</p><p></p><p>He knew he would win, but he didn't expect it to be this easy.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, he was just too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, his knife was also very good.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps...</p><p></p><p>He looked at the small golden elixir core on the ground and commented: "His elixir core is too small, and his elixir light is also not strong enough, unable to withstand even a single one of my blows.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in the future, if I were to form an elixir core, I should form a larger one, and the elixir light should be at least as bright as the moonlight."</p><p></p><p>The masked man said this as he looked up at the moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, the elixir light should be as bright as the moonlight, right?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the remaining few small cats were trembling uncontrollably, with some even fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The masked man saw this and chanted: "I am a patriotic person, I love killing entire families the most!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he swung his blade, and those few small cats died an even more miserable death.</p><p></p><p>The masked man looked at the corpses on the ground, then slowly walked towards the pond.</p><p></p><p>"Time to catch a fish to eat."</p><p></p><p>He said, rolling up his pants, and by the pond, he cleaned the cleaver, then caught a black fish.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

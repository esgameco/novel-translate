        <h1>Chapter 210</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is there something?" Qi Yuan looked at Great Venerable Lishan.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan waved his hand, and the burly black man and the elder from the ancestral land instantly lost their five senses.</p><p></p><p>He was about to do the same to the other ancient gods, blocking their perceptions.</p><p></p><p>But then he heard Qi Yuan say: "They are all my subjects now. If you have something to say, you can speak directly."</p><p></p><p>After using the lost fluorescent rod, Qi Yuan had returned from the past to the present. </p><p></p><p>Only about two hours had passed in the present.</p><p></p><p>After he came back, those ancient gods all decided, like the ancient god Wangsong, to become Qi Yuan's subjects forever.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, there was no time limit now.</p><p></p><p>It was because Qi Yuan's eight myth-level methods of observing gods were too shocking.</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, they decided to follow him permanently.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan glanced at these ancient gods, with only a moment's confusion in his heart. He looked at Qi Yuan and said: "Origin Venerable, you have visualized eight myth-level methods of observing gods. This matter is of great importance. You must not reveal your identity.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the evil gods will certainly send powerful beings to intercept and kill you!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan's expression was calm. </p><p></p><p>He was very clear about this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't care too much.</p><p></p><p>In games, it's normal for villain bosses to come one after another to die.</p><p></p><p>"Qingshui Village is located in the occupied area. If you go back now, you will face many dangers.</p><p></p><p>In the occupied area, we ancient gods cannot help you.</p><p></p><p>If an evil god attacks you, you will be fighting alone!" Great Venerable Lishan tried to clarify Qi Yuan's predicament.</p><p></p><p>"Fighting alone? I'm used to it.</p><p></p><p>Now, I can't really be considered fighting alone. Behind me, I have so many villagers supporting me, each with a bright future." Qi Yuan replied softly.</p><p></p><p>On the Wangyue Continent, he had always fought alone at first.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, Jinli had always been there to chat with him, and later, Little Jia had fought alongside him.</p><p></p><p>When he alone blocked the Absolute Ground, that was truly fighting alone.</p><p></p><p>In games, isn't it normal to solo farm bosses?</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan was silent for a moment. These eight villagers with myth-level methods of observing gods indeed had bright futures, but the others might not.</p><p></p><p>Being in the occupied area determined the cruelty of their future.</p><p></p><p>He hesitated for a moment, then continued.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Venerable can visualize eight myth-level methods of observing gods, the Venerable's importance even surpasses that of the Child of Destiny.</p><p></p><p>Has Origin Venerable heard of the Myth Plan?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"In the Hong Tang War, all the foundations of the Mortal Heart Realm were exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Two-thirds of the ancient gods died in battle, and all the mythical beings perished.</p><p></p><p>However, even though the mythical beings died in battle, they left a glimmer of hope for the world, a seed of the world." At this point, Great Venerable Lishan's voice became wistful.</p><p></p><p>He had participated in the Hong Tang War.</p><p></p><p>In such a brutal battle, true gods fell every day.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion cultivators were even less than cannon fodder in it.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just a few hours ago, he had personally witnessed the Hong Tang War, seen the pillars of heaven break, and watched the Holy Mother of No Food single-handedly block the projection of the Sun God's avatar, ultimately perishing.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Mortal Heart Realm at its peak could not stop the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Let alone us, so our only option is to create a few mythical powerhouses through the Myth Plan.</p><p></p><p>Then, those few will hastily act to tear open a gap at the passage of the Mortal Heart Realm, sending the seeds of hope out of the Mortal Heart Realm! Originally, the success rate of the Myth Plan was less than half a percent.</p><p></p><p>But with you, if you join, the success rate of the Myth Plan will surge to 30%! At that time, we old fellows will fight to the death to send you, along with some young people and the seeds of hope, out of the Mortal Heart Realm together!" Great Venerable Lishan did not conceal anything from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The villagers and ancient gods behind Qi Yuan were shocked to hear this, and at the same time, a deep sadness arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Mortal Heart Realm was still far too weak compared to the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened to this with a very calm expression: "Oh, I see."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's reaction surprised Great Venerable Lishan on the scene. He said solemnly,</p><p></p><p>"I request the Venerable to join our Myth Plan, to leave some embers for the Mortal Heart Realm! When the Myth Plan begins, the Venerable can also leave the Mortal Heart Realm and enjoy great freedom!"</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Great Venerable Lishan's proposal was extremely sincere.</p><p></p><p>He considered everything for Qi Yuan's benefit.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he even gave Qi Yuan the opportunity to leave the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it were other prodigies, they would probably agree to Great Venerable Lishan's request at this point, follow them to carry out the Myth Plan, and leave carrying the hope of the world.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan was Qi Yuan after all, and he flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>"Running away is not my style. Otherwise, how can I level up without completing the mission?"</p><p></p><p>He had gone through so much trouble to enter this game, how could he run away from the game? Wasn't that ridiculous?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words stunned Great Venerable Lishan.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods behind Qi Yuan were also surprised, and admiration arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan they were following seemed carefree and behaved strangely on the surface.</p><p></p><p>However, on such a major issue, he showed fearless courage.</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely kill the one above the true gods in the pillar of heaven!" There was intense killing intent in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had just traveled through time and space to watch a movie.</p><p></p><p>But that projection of the Sun God's avatar kept babbling, calling him a little bug, and even attacked him!</p><p></p><p>It was like Sadako in the TV sensing the existence of the audience, constantly blabbering and gesticulating.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's personality, he would definitely seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Holy Mother of No Food had invited him to eat fish and given him a free tour. Although Qi Yuan didn't mention it, he remembered this kindness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He must kill the Great Saint of the Blood Sun.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't kill him, he would make a plan.</p><p></p><p>A meticulous and ingenious plan would greatly increase the success rate of what Qi Yuan wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>He directly spoke arrogantly, saying he would kill the Sun God.</p><p></p><p>This completely shocked everyone present.</p><p></p><p>If someone else said this, they might take it as a joke.</p><p></p><p>But the one saying this was Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable who had created countless miracles in the ancestral land and could visualize eight myth-level methods of observing gods.</p><p></p><p>When such an unparalleled prodigy spoke like this, it was definitely not empty talk, but more like setting an aspiration.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the villagers behind Qi Yuan spoke up one after another, united in purpose!</p><p></p><p>"I, Old Zhu, am willing to be the vanguard and clear obstacles for the master!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man Yulu is willing to serve as a dog or horse!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Chen Xifan, can do more than just cook!"</p><p></p><p>"Stone Zhongshan's life was given by the master. Whatever the master says, I'll do!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the ancient god Wangsong felt quite emotional and his fighting spirit soared.</p><p></p><p>"I am a pine tree that became a god, with the strongest unyielding spirit. What is there to fear about those above true gods?"</p><p></p><p>These subjects spoke lightly, as if they were not facing a terrifying being above true gods.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan and the other two Great Venerables looked at Qi Yuan, listening to the words of these villagers.</p><p></p><p>They had never expected to receive such an answer.</p><p></p><p>They had thought Qi Yuan might refuse, but they didn't expect Qi Yuan to refuse for this reason.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Venerable really... want to choose this path?" Great Venerable Lishan's expression was somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, there were ancient gods who supported the Myth Plan, and there were those who didn't.</p><p></p><p>The thoughts of those ancient gods were somewhat similar to Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to sink with the Mortal Heart Realm and die in battle in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I want to choose this path, it's that they forced me to!" As soon as Qi Yuan said this, he suddenly felt very into the role.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the evil gods were really forcing him at every turn.</p><p></p><p>He was like a son-in-law pouring foot-washing water for his mother-in-law, enduring all kinds of humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Great Venerable Lishan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He knew he couldn't persuade Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"When the Venerable returns to Qingshui Village, you need to keep a low profile in everything. Wait until these eight grow up before showing your edge. It's not too late then." Great Venerable Lishan remembered what Great Venerable Thunderbolt had said, that this Origin Venerable was very reckless, so he couldn't help but advise.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the reminder. Don't worry, I'm very measured in what I do.</p><p></p><p>I don't do anything without a plan.</p><p></p><p>I've always been cautious, never reckless.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing major events, I would advance step by step, first making a detailed plan." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He was not the kind of reckless person who acted on impulse.</p><p></p><p>He pursued meticulousness in his actions, making plans that were praiseworthy.</p><p></p><p>The villagers behind him heard this and had strange expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The ancient god Wangsong heard this and also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Following such a guardian god, there was hope and a future.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan was puzzled, could it be that everything Great Venerable Thunderbolt said was false?</p><p></p><p>Didn't Great Venerable Thunderbolt say that Origin Venerable was very reckless? Looking at Qi Yuan's demeanor, he indeed seemed very careful and cautious, which couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>"Take care of yourself." Great Venerable Lishan could only say this, but then, thinking of something, he said heavily, "Great Venerable Thunderbolt once entrusted me to take care of you."</p><p></p><p>"Entrusted?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>This word couldn't be used carelessly.</p><p></p><p>"He told me about your coming to the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>He entrusted me to take care of you, to bring you into the Myth Plan, so that your future would have one more glimmer of hope." Great Venerable Lishan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Where is old Thunderbolt now?" Qi Yuan quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"He... went to find Zhang Feng." Great Venerable Lishan sighed, "His injuries are very severe, he doesn't have long to live."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately understood the whole story.</p><p></p><p>He frowned and said:</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why are all the old folks in the world so stubborn?" </p><p></p><p>With a wave of his big hand, all the villagers and ancient gods immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>Everyone entered the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi was a bit anxious: "This old guy bullies me and then runs away, huh!"</p><p></p><p>He still remembered how he was humiliated by the Thunder God Sovereign before.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others emerged from the teleportation array, landing in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's feet touched the ground, tapping lightly. Instantly, a short girl spun out from underground.</p><p></p><p>The girl who emerged was Snow, the current Earth God's maid.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Thunder God Sovereign?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Maid Snow hurriedly replied: "The Thunder God Sovereign left... last night."</p><p></p><p>She quickly told Qi Yuan about what happened yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"This is what the Thunder God Sovereign asked me to give you before he left." Maid Snow handed a storage bag to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inside this storage bag were the Thunder God Sovereign's private possessions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually glanced at it and took the storage bag: "Zhang Feng... of the Cai Kingdom, right!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng was an ancient god of the Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The true god Qi Yuan killed in Feiwu City, his brother-in-law was Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng had defected to the evil gods, becoming the son-in-law of the Evil God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The fall of the Jiang Kingdom, where Venerable Tianbao was, was partly Zhang Feng's doing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my plans need to be moved up," Qi Yuan's eyes held a trace of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The twin sisters beside him heard this and became anxious: "My lord, if we move against the neighboring kingdom's evil gods now, it will definitely alert the Evil God."</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods had the same thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Qingshui Village had just reaped great rewards from the ancestral lands.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they should keep a low profile, consume resources, and accumulate strength.</p><p></p><p>Making a big move against true gods in the Cai Kingdom would expose their identities.</p><p></p><p>This was occupied territory, they would certainly face encirclement and annihilation by evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The older twin sister spoke up at this point, her voice serious: "There's no need for you to go personally, my lord. I will go to the Cai Kingdom myself and bring back the Thunder God Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister!" The younger twin was alarmed when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>She knew exactly what her sister was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Her sister was afraid of Qingshui Village being exposed to the evil gods' eyes, so she wanted to go alone to the Cai Kingdom to rescue the Thunder God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she knew that it was very likely the Thunder God Sovereign had already perished.</p><p></p><p>Her sister going there would be suicide.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, her sister's actions were completely meant to sacrifice herself, to put Qi Yuan's mind at ease and extinguish his thoughts of going personally.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, I am willing to go in my sister's place!" the younger twin said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the twin sisters, a smile appearing in his eyes: "Do you really take me for a brash fool who acts without thinking?</p><p></p><p>The strongest enemy around here is just Zhang Feng, isn't it? His divine power is quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>It would be too wasteful to let that old Thunder God steal the kill.</p><p></p><p>Today, I'm just bringing something that was outside my plans into my plans.</p><p></p><p>That's all."</p><p></p><p>The group communicated telepathically, taking only an instant in total.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's words clearly hadn't convinced these people.</p><p></p><p>The faces of these ancient gods were all written with the words "don't go".</p><p></p><p>But to save Qi Yuan's face, none of them spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but secretly grumble that this batch of NPCs was hard to fool.</p><p></p><p>"No need for more nonsense, I'm too lazy to explain."</p><p></p><p>"I'm the boss, listen to me!"</p><p></p><p>"We march on the Cai Kingdom to slay Zhang Feng!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan commanded directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, none of the ancient gods objected further.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The group of over twenty turned into streaks of light, flying towards the Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Wang Wenqi also joined the team, heading to the Cai Kingdom together.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi's great-grandfather, Venerable Tianbao, had once been on good terms with Zhang Feng, only to be killed by him.</p><p></p><p>How could Wang Wenqi forget this grudge!</p><p></p><p>The current Jiang Kingdom was in tatters, which had much to do with Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan and the others made no attempt to conceal themselves, flying straight for the Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when Qi Yuan marched, he would still dawdle along.</p><p></p><p>This time, they went directly, unafraid of alerting the new gods.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless voices were startled along the way.</p><p></p><p>"What reckless fools dare to come to our..."</p><p></p><p>Those evil gods stationed in the cities, sensing ancient gods passing by ostentatiously in advance, immediately released powerful auras to intercept.</p><p></p><p>The ones charging straight through were Qi Yuan and his group.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan ordered directly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the older twin sister made her move, a divine light flashing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the evil god in the city revealed a look of terror: "How can there be so many!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>This was occupied territory!</p><p></p><p>Yet there were twenty ancient gods parading through.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly suicide.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that not far from this area, there were evil god military camps.</p><p></p><p>In those camps, large or small, there were at least hundreds of new gods in slumber.</p><p></p><p>Unlike those new gods who ruled over assimilated areas like him,</p><p></p><p>Those new gods had truly formidable combat power.</p><p></p><p>This group's actions would definitely alert the evil god military camps.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that in occupied territories, no ancient gods dared to act so brazenly, to avoid being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Probably within a quarter hour, evil gods from the military camps would come out to hunt down this group of ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't live to see that.</p><p></p><p>He felt very stifled and pained.</p><p></p><p>Why did he rush out to intercept without understanding the situation?</p><p></p><p>The older twin sister's embryonic divine domain unfolded. This evil god had no ability to resist at all, and could only let the divine power forcibly enter his body, perishing instantly.</p><p></p><p>A mighty evil god, one who had lorded over others, died so easily and plainly.</p><p></p><p>The price of his death was slowing down Qi Yuan's group's speed considerably.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "There are so many of these suicidal little bugs."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, along the way, they had already killed three such little bugs.</p><p></p><p>Each time before they reached a city, the arrays of the evil gods' cities would give advance warning.</p><p></p><p>Those evil gods would then come out to intercept.</p><p></p><p>Including this one, they had already killed three.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, we must strike quickly and withdraw, otherwise if we're surrounded by the evil god military camps, we won't be able to leave!" The older twin sister said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was extremely worried.</p><p></p><p>In each evil god military camp, there was at least one Sovereign presiding.</p><p></p><p>Combined with hundreds of evil gods, if they were surrounded, escape would be impossible even with wings.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, it's just that on the way to the Cai Kingdom, there are always some evil gods blocking the road. It's annoying."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan very much wanted to shout:</p><p></p><p>Young miss needs to pee, everyone get out of the way.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, their speed was faster than ordinary sound.</p><p></p><p>Shouting like that would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Unless he used Dao techniques to transmit sound.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Right... there was still Dao sound transmission.</p><p></p><p>He quickly gathered all his divine power and used Dao sound transmission.</p><p></p><p>"We go to slay the traitor Zhang Feng. Those who obstruct, kill without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>With the Dao sound transmission clearing the way, Qi Yuan's group charged madly towards the Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Qi Yuan's voice intimidated some evil gods. Those evil gods in the cities all refrained from taking action.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhang Feng was a true god who had taken three steps to heaven.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to go slay Zhang Feng, mustn't they also have taken three steps to heaven? What use would it be for these evil gods to block the way? To throw away their lives? Better to wait for the true gods in the military camps to take action!</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Qi Yuan's group charged straight through, unimpeded.</p><p></p><p>This time, no one obstructed them.</p><p></p><p>The voice proclaiming the slaying of the traitor Zhang Feng spread from the Lin Kingdom to the Jiang Kingdom, and then to the Cai Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Countless new gods were shaken, raising their heads to look at the streaks of light in the sky.</p><p></p><p>There were also many hidden ancient gods who revealed shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The traitor Zhang Feng, has a righteous god finally come to slay him?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, may the righteous god have a safe journey!"</p><p></p><p>They naturally thought that Qi Yuan shouting in the sky was a powerful ancient god with no way out.</p><p></p><p>This ancient god, knowing he had no hope of survival, wanted to take an enemy down with him before death.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng's defection to the evil gods had led to the Cai and Jiang Kingdoms falling under evil god rule.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the surrounding five kingdoms had changed drastically, also becoming part of the evil god camp.</p><p></p><p>Which of these hidden ancient gods did not despise Zhang Feng, which of them did not want to kill Zhang Feng?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a transmitted message entered Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, be careful. Evil gods from the military camps have entered the capital of the Cai Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The voice came quickly and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was an ancient god taking a great risk to transmit this message.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting it, they disappeared without a trace, afraid of being detected by other new gods.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's heart tightened: "Evil gods from the military camps have entered?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the Thunder God Sovereign had already attacked the Cai Kingdom, so it alarmed the true gods of the evil god military camps?</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also heard this and felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The older twin sister spoke up at this point: "My lord, why don't we split into two groups? My sister and I will go to the Cai Kingdom, while you all secretly withdraw."</p><p></p><p>"No need." Qi Yuan's voice was calm. "Zhang Feng... I want to see him, alive or dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He was determined to go to this Cai Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

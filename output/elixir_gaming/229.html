        <h1>Chapter 229</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were puzzled and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Was the battle in the North really done by you, Origin Venerable One?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually true!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity Tianbao Venerable One can't see this moment, alas."</p><p></p><p>"I heard the evil gods' headquarters fled directly, it's really... so satisfying!"</p><p></p><p>This was beyond just satisfying! After all, the mortal realm had been oppressed for so many years, completely helpless against the evil gods. </p><p></p><p>Now... they were driven away by Origin Venerable One! So many things happened in just one day, without any warning signs.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable One is mighty!"</p><p></p><p>"Long live Origin Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable One is a god descended to earth!"</p><p></p><p>The group chat was boiling with excitement. Only this could perhaps relieve some of their agitation.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, did Origin Venerable One visualize another legendary feat?"</p><p></p><p>Messages in the group were flooding the screen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan thought of something and asked in the group:</p><p></p><p>"We've become acquainted, shall I give you all some benefits? Do you want them?"</p><p></p><p>"What benefits?" Black Dragon Venerable One asked.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable One saved the mortal realm. Even if you send me to drink the northwest wind, I'm willing!" God Cat Venerable One said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I second that," White Xi Venerable One also sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered the first time he saw Origin Venerable One in the group chat. Back then, Origin Venerable One was still shy and awkward, calling him "boss".</p><p></p><p>Now, Origin Venerable One had become a hegemon.</p><p></p><p>He also learned through his master, Great Venerable One of Pear Mountain, that what happened in the North was all true.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable One led the villagers of Qingshui Village, and even nearby towns, to utterly destroy the evil gods' headquarters.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable. </p><p></p><p>Could it be... that all the villagers were geniuses?</p><p></p><p>"Come to Lin Kingdom, Flying Wuyi City, and become my subjects!" Qi Yuan spoke up, extending an invitation. "Since we've become acquainted, I will lead you to overthrow the evil gods!"</p><p></p><p>The game was not over yet. The Yang God in the Heavenly Pillar was still wantonly devouring the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still quietly accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>In diplomatic terms, the Yang God had reached the end of its path, while he still had great room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Subjects!"</p><p></p><p>"I, God Cat Venerable One, am the first to be willing!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget becoming subjects, even if it means death, so what?"</p><p></p><p>After all, Origin Venerable One had done a great favor for the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One's kindness could not be repaid in lifetimes. What was wrong with becoming subjects?</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing too!" White Xi Venerable One replied.</p><p></p><p>Even his master had become Origin Venerable One's subject, why should he be coy about it?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the excitement of the ancient gods in the group, Dong Jianghe was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He was a young Heavenly Emperor who had visualized a mythical-level god-observing method. To become someone else's subject, he couldn't bring himself to do it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a form here. I'll send you the information to fill out. Those who want to become my subjects, fill it out and I'll give you some benefits." Qi Yuan was like a generous tycoon, casually throwing money around.</p><p></p><p>After all, money was too easy to earn.</p><p></p><p>If he had worked hard to earn a little bit, perhaps he wouldn't be so generous.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time, the ancient gods in the group didn't hide anything and directly gave their personal information to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dong Jianghe's eyes widened: "These people... do they have no backbone left? I'm a young Heavenly Emperor who visualized a mythical-level god-observing method. I can't be so classless like them. Origin Venerable One must personally invite me, and I'll refuse once or twice before agreeing!"</p><p></p><p>"Is there anyone else? If not, I'm leaving. Those who become my subjects later won't get the benefits," Qi Yuan asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Jianghe's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>Leaving? Not personally inviting him?</p><p></p><p>He was anxious and blurted out: "Wait for me, Origin Venerable One, I haven't filled it out yet!"</p><p></p><p>Such an opportunity should be seized first.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone else in the group had become Origin Venerable One's subjects. Many even directly called him adoptive father.</p><p></p><p>If he also became a subject, it wouldn't be embarrassing, right? ...</p><p></p><p>The slaughter continued.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the evil gods' headquarters happened very quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, the speed of hunting down the remaining evil gods slowed down.</p><p></p><p>After all, the evil gods were scattered in various places. Upon learning that the main army of the headquarters had all fled, they were now fleeing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Qingshui Village army had been killing for three full days, but still hadn't completely exterminated the remaining evil gods.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on top of a high mountain, Village Chief Yu Lu had a head full of white hair, emanating a profound aura.</p><p></p><p>Divine Official Shen Tu followed behind, with a very cold aura about him.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who saw him inexplicably felt a hint of fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi sat on the body of the big black dog, grinning to reveal his big white teeth, looking very smug.</p><p></p><p>"Stinky dog, now you know who the master is?"</p><p></p><p>The big black dog made whimpering sounds, not daring to retort.</p><p></p><p>Just then, several ancient gods of the Second Step of Treading Heaven appeared.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods saw Yu Lu and the others, and their eyes showed respectful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed sirs, Lin Li and the other two evil gods are hiding in the mountains ahead.</p><p></p><p>A banquet has been prepared in the city. After the esteemed sirs slaughter the evil gods, we can eat... together!"</p><p></p><p>This ancient god spoke carefully, looking at Yu Lu and the others with admiration in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may withdraw. Leave this to us," Village Chief Yu Lu spoke.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, these ancient gods bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, these ancient gods seemed to be quietly discussing something.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Qingshui Village army. No wonder they're Origin Venerable One's direct subordinates. Each one is extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"A single village, and everyone is a god. What kind of blessed land is this Qingshui Village?"</p><p></p><p>"This Origin Venerable One is also a strange person, actually issuing a 'ban on kill-stealing order', letting their people kill these evil gods."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, with our meager strength, we were no match for the evil gods to begin with, how could we... steal kills!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's just follow Origin Venerable One's preferences and prepare the banquet!"</p><p></p><p>"I can do that."</p><p></p><p>As these ancient gods retreated, the Village Chief couldn't help but sigh on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when we encountered a Purple Palace level divine being, we trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Now... true gods see us and are cautious."</p><p></p><p>"All of this is thanks to the master's bestowal!" Divine Official Shen Tu said.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi's gaze also underwent a subtle change: "Who could have imagined that my fat body, old Zhu, could also become a heartthrob?"</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had been on a killing spree and encountered many ancient gods giving him flirtatious looks and secret glances.</p><p></p><p>Such things were unimaginable to him before.</p><p></p><p>Goddesses who were once high and mighty were now more fawning than the big black dog.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhu, how are things going?" Village Chief Yu Lu asked at this time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi frowned: "Killed three evil gods, made some progress.</p><p></p><p>The assimilation method... is indeed ingenious."</p><p></p><p>These past few days, they weren't just killing. They also captured some evil gods to interrogate them about the assimilation method, and then did some experiments.</p><p></p><p>When evil gods came to the mortal realm and occupied a place, they could slowly assimilate the subjects, turning them into puppets.</p><p></p><p>The task Village Chief Yu Lu gave Zhu Zhuangshi was to crack the mystery of assimilation.</p><p></p><p>"I hope we can crack it soon, so those assimilated subjects can also be freed," Village Chief Yu Lu couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>In the mortal realm, there were still over a million subjects who had been assimilated and turned into puppets.</p><p></p><p>Entering such cities, one would see desolation, gloom and terror everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Divine Official Shen Tu's gaze also became profound: "For the next three evil gods, keep them alive. We need to continue researching, we must crack the assimilation method, and also..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu didn't finish the rest of his words.</p><p></p><p>But the three people present all tacitly understood and didn't continue speaking.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan had returned to Flying Wuyi City.</p><p></p><p>He had opened up in Huaye City for two days</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan occasionally listened to the suona dance led by Xiao Xing, occasionally ate at the banquet, receiving information from various parts of the mortal realm, feeling quite joyful. At this time, he had returned to Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the orderly Feiwu City that had restored order, he felt quite emotional inside.</p><p></p><p>"The song ends and people disperse, the game... is also coming to an end soon." Whenever the game was about to end, Qi Yuan always felt inexplicably emotional, with a sense of emptiness and loss in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his gaze turned towards a residence.</p><p></p><p>His figure turned, appearing outside the residence.</p><p></p><p>In front of Qi Yuan was an ordinary house with red bricks and green tiles.</p><p></p><p>It looked somewhat similar to his brick house on the Seven-colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought that when the game ended and he broke through to the Divine Infant stage, he would tear down the brick house and build a more upscale house.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the residence in front of him, and his elegant and amiable voice sounded: "Is anyone there? The Origin Venerable... has come to visit."</p><p></p><p>The people living in the house were a pair of sisters.</p><p></p><p>The older sister was named Yang Lian, and the younger sister was named Yang Hua.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Qi Yuan had received a gift from these sisters - the Blood Jade Leaf.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Jade Leaf contained the fortune of the world.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had obtained the Lost Glow Stick but couldn't use it.</p><p></p><p>It was the aura of the Blood Jade Leaf that allowed him to activate the Lost Glow Stick.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the person who sent him the gift had conveyed a message saying they didn't like to see strangers.</p><p></p><p>So he hadn't disturbed them.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the game was about to end, he thought of coming to see the people in the house.</p><p></p><p>There was silence inside the house.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan could still hear the thudding heartbeats of a woman, who seemed very nervous.</p><p></p><p>The sisters inside the house seemed to be communicating something, but Qi Yuan was gentlemanly and didn't eavesdrop.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't gentlemanly, he wouldn't have waited outside the door but would have barged in directly.</p><p></p><p>After about a few dozen breaths of time passed, the creaking sound of the door opening was heard, and the tall Yang Lian appeared, her eyes carrying a hint of vigilance: "Venerable, please come in."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Yang Lian, his eyes quite curious.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he entered the house and saw the frail girl lying on the bed.</p><p></p><p>The girl was small and thin, her face pale and bloodless. At this moment, she opened her deep, big eyes, looking quite spirited.</p><p></p><p>The information about the little girl entered Qi Yuan's sight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also caught several key words.</p><p></p><p>A flash of disappointment appeared in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your gift, it was a great help to me," Qi Yuan thanked sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The little girl Yang Hua squeezed out a smile on her face, like a spring breeze: "You saved a city full of people in Feiwu City, you saved me, I should be the one saying thank you to you."</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian beside her kept watching Qi Yuan, her body tense.</p><p></p><p>Her sister carried the seed of the world in her body.</p><p></p><p>If it appeared in the eyes of some venerable ones, or even great venerable ones, her identity might be exposed.</p><p></p><p>For her, this would be an irredeemable situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone coveted the seed of the world.</p><p></p><p>Even mythical beings craved it immensely.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable had turned the tide in the North, driving away evil gods, and was indeed a great benefactor of the mortal realm, but one can never truly know another's heart.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one is, the more they would covet the seed of the world.</p><p></p><p>"I once had an old friend, who, like you, had the seed of the world in her body.</p><p></p><p>However... she was a bit different from you." Qi Yuan recalled the Holy Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had also sensed the aura of the world seed in the Holy Mother of No Food's body.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the seed of the world.</p><p></p><p>However, the world seed in the Holy Mother of No Food's body was different from the one in the girl in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The one in the girl in front of him seemed to be the world seed that originally came from the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mother of No Food's was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>However, the Holy Mother of No Food had already perished.</p><p></p><p>The girl in front of him was not the reincarnation of the Holy Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, a flash of surprise appeared in the girl's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian was also very surprised in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't expected that the Origin Venerable would also know someone who contained the seed of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Her, you should be very familiar with, she is... the Holy Mother of No Food."</p><p></p><p>"What, it's her?" Yang Lian was somewhat surprised in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The little girl, however, was very calm, as if she had a maturity that didn't belong to her age.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi Yuan, you are very mysterious and very powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Just average."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to scare away the evil gods, you are the first person in the history of the mortal realm." Yang Lian spoke at this time, her voice carrying a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Don't flatter me, I'm still very weak, at most I can beat a baby." Qi Yuan recalled the news he saw in the ancestral land and couldn't help but say, "I've already seen the person, so... I'll be leaving."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words made Yang Lian feel a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Leaving...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Yang Lian, his eyes smiling: "Although my bottom line is flexible, I won't eat people.</p><p></p><p>The seed of the world... may be precious in some people's eyes, but to me, it's not as good as a delicious fish soup."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Lian immediately felt guilty.</p><p></p><p>She had judged a gentleman with a petty person's heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't coveting the seed of the world at all.</p><p></p><p>She believed his words.</p><p></p><p>If he was really greedy, he would have just taken it directly, why would he need to deceive them? There was no need.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, let me see you out." Yang Lian thought of something and quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan walked out of the house without any lingering attachment.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian kept following beside him, the expression on her face changing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Venerable plan to do next?" Yang Lian finally gathered the courage to ask, referring to the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally... to slay two beings above True God." Qi Yuan said confidently, this was also the last part of his plan.</p><p></p><p>As long as two beings above True God were killed, his mission to protect Qingshui Village would be completed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yang Lian lowered her head, her gaze carrying a hint of desolation: "The mortal realm is a primordial world... this realm has all possibilities, but... it's impossible to break through to above True God.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable's talent is unprecedented, but... facing two beings above True God, without breaking through to above True God, you won't be a match."</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian had many more words unsaid.</p><p></p><p>Only after completing the Seven Steps of Heaven Treading can one enter the realm of Yang God.</p><p></p><p>But how long and arduous are the Seven Steps of Heaven Treading.</p><p></p><p>One needs to truly tread the heavens.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao of Heaven in the Heavenly Pillar consumed, perhaps not even hundreds of years of time remain.</p><p></p><p>There's not much time left for the Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that it's impossible to break through to Yang God in a primordial world, even if it were possible, this time is too short.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Yang Lian say: "The mortal realm is destined for destruction, two beings above True God... are simply unbeatable.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Venerable's previous life or true form is noble beyond compare, but being in the mortal realm is like being in a cage.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian wants to ask the Venerable to take my sister away from the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>My sister has the seed of the world in her body. If the Venerable likes, when my sister grows up, you can dual cultivate with her, which will also greatly benefit the Venerable's cultivation. If the Venerable breaks through to above True God, you will also be no ordinary being above True God!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable was a person worth entrusting.</p><p></p><p>She felt at ease leaving her sister to him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, besides the Origin Venerable, who else could send her sister away from the mortal realm?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Yang Lian's face, feeling quite speechless: "I really have no interest in your world seed.</p><p></p><p>Leave the mortal realm? How can I continue playing this game then? I'm sorry, but I can't accept your request."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

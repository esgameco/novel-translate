        <h1>Chapter 311</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This young man speaks strangely, but... as long as it's what you calculate and seek, today... I will fulfill it for you."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the method to remove the curse on him.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller Yuxi silently said this to himself. </p><p></p><p>The curse that had contaminated him could only be partially resolved by using these tools and coming... here to tell fortunes.</p><p></p><p>These tools were all single-use.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that anything in this world could be calculated.</p><p></p><p>"Place your hand on the copper plate, and I will know the answer," the fortune teller said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan put his hand on the copper plate.</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xianyun's face revealed a strange expression. The two people before him were quite odd.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller was mysterious enough without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan participating in the martial arts tournament spoke deliriously - "completing the game"? What did that mean? Nan Shi Zhang Yang's mouth curled into a disdainful smile: "It seems there's more than one crazy person here today."</p><p></p><p>He had always been arrogant, looking down on everyone.</p><p></p><p>He came from a noble background and was a family friend of the legendary Seven Martial Star families, so he always felt superior to others.</p><p></p><p>His presence in the martial arts circle was an honor for them.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was about to leave the martial arts circle for a better future, he naturally looked down on these people even more.</p><p></p><p>After all, generally speaking, very few true nobles entered the martial arts circle.</p><p></p><p>Generally... they were mostly nouveau riche.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuxi was fully focused, his blood boiling, waiting for a hint from the copper plate.</p><p></p><p>He was just an ordinary doomed person, how could he understand the ways of divination.</p><p></p><p>The so-called divination was all done by the copper plate tool.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed second by second, no hint came.</p><p></p><p>A look of bewilderment appeared in Yuxi's eyes, his face full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's eyes stared at Yuxi, and he said softly: "Well, how's the calculation going? When will I be able to complete this game?"</p><p></p><p>Yuxi was silent for a moment, his heart seemingly stirred up by huge waves.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a thing.</p><p></p><p>He had ten thousand questions in his mind. After all... this was the first time he had encountered a tool malfunction.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the other person was like him? But...</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with a troubled expression: "Your question has truly stumped me, sir.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... you could ask a different question, and I'll try again?"</p><p></p><p>His form of address for Qi Yuan had changed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan sighed: "Your divination ability is not good, I overestimated you.</p><p></p><p>How about this, just calculate whether I will win this martial arts tournament!"</p><p></p><p>Before the fortune teller Yuxi could speak,</p><p></p><p>The martial artists present burst into laughter again.</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xianyun looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help but laugh: "Brother Qi is too confident!"</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had already exchanged names with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Nan Shi Zhang Yang's eyes naturally revealed a trace of disdain. His voice was like a bell as he looked at Qi Yuan: "I'm also participating in this martial arts tournament."</p><p></p><p>His meaning was obvious - since I'm participating, the champion will be me.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists all agreed.</p><p></p><p>A year ago, Nan Shi Zhang Yang had only lost to the martial arts tournament champion by one move.</p><p></p><p>This year, his martial arts must be even more profound, so there was no doubt he would win the championship.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, the person next to you is Nan Shi Zhang Yang. The champion of this martial arts tournament will definitely be him without a doubt. Don't let your imagination run wild."</p><p></p><p>Faced with these voices, Qi Yuan ignored them completely.</p><p></p><p>His hand rested on the copper plate, waiting for fortune teller Yuxi's answer.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some information also entered his view.</p><p></p><p>[Blood Compass replica, seems able to glimpse fate and capture destiny's trajectory, produced by Blood Compass Island.]</p><p></p><p>However, just then, there was a sudden crack.</p><p></p><p>The copper plate under Qi Yuan's hand cracked and shattered directly.</p><p></p><p>"Puff..." A look of shock appeared in Yuxi's eyes, along with a hint of confusion, as a mouthful of blood spilled from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The tool actually... broke!</p><p></p><p>How... is this possible!</p><p></p><p>Just calculating a fortune, and it broke! The people around saw this with strange looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is he spitting blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they acting?"</p><p></p><p>The people around were bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Nan Shi Zhang Yang gave a cold laugh: "Playing tricks, I won't stay here to watch you continue this act."</p><p></p><p>With that, he left directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, most of the surrounding martial artists also smiled and left.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they thought Qi Yuan and this fortune teller knew each other and were probably scheming something.</p><p></p><p>Even Bei He Han Xianyun looked at Qi Yuan with some suspicion.</p><p></p><p>This fortune teller had previously revealed some secrets about him, could it be that he was really connected to him?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan reached out and took out his mental illness certificate.</p><p></p><p>"Look carefully, this is my certificate. Don't try to scam me, I didn't break this!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been cautious and carried his mental illness certificate with him, just in case he encountered scammers.</p><p></p><p>Now it came in handy.</p><p></p><p>This operation immediately dispelled the doubts in Bei He Han Xianyun's mind.</p><p></p><p>If it was a plan targeting him, would Qi Yuan act like this? What would be the point of such an act?</p><p></p><p>Fortune teller Yuxi looked at Qi Yuan, also bewildered, many thoughts flashing through his mind: "This indeed... has nothing to do with you, sir."</p><p></p><p>Tools... especially special ones like this, don't break for no reason.</p><p></p><p>This could only mean that the person and matter he was calculating... were somewhat beyond the tool's capabilities.</p><p></p><p>But... doesn't this usually happen with terrifying monsters? How could it happen with a person? Could it be that this person has a tool that blocks divination?</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where did you get this Blood Compass? It's quite interesting, I'd like to get one too.</p><p></p><p>If I had this, wouldn't I make a fortune?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>At this question, a look of alertness flashed through Yuxi's mind: "You... how do you know it's called a Blood Compass... There's no death aura on you at all!"</p><p></p><p>The words slipped out, and Yuxi immediately regretted it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered: "Because I have a mental illness, isn't it normal for someone with a mental illness to know these things?</p><p></p><p>By the way, I want to ask you a question, do you know about the Spirit Path Martial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Coming to this world, Qi Yuan's mission was to become the Human Path Martial Lord, the Spirit Path Martial Lord, and cultivate to the realm of the Ten Thousand Path Martial God.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Human Path Martial Lord was simple, just win the martial arts tournament 100 times.</p><p></p><p>But for the Spirit Path Martial Lord, he had no clues at all.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller before him seemed unusual, so Qi Yuan thought to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Path Martial Lord?" Yuxi shook his head, "I've never heard of it, but... I've heard of the Human Path Martial Lord, and the Mythical Dragon Martial Lord."</p><p></p><p>This time, Yuxi didn't conceal anything. He felt that Qi Yuan also seemed to be hiding secrets.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would he know the name Blood Compass?</p><p></p><p>"Martial Lord?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuxi's face suddenly changed drastically: "Not good, I... have to go."</p><p></p><p>With the Blood Compass shattered, there was still a trace of the curse lingering on him.</p><p></p><p>He had to hurry to resolve it.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he quickly left.</p><p></p><p>As for the table, it was left behind, not taken away.</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xianyun watched Yuxi's retreating figure with curiosity: "Are you two sure you don't know each other?"</p><p></p><p>"We don't know each other... he's quite an interesting person." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the words "death aura" the other had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that the other was not an individual, but a group.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed interesting, as interesting as you.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the rumors are true?" Han Xianyun murmured, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>"What rumors?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also used his phone to send the keywords Blood Compass, Blood Compass Island, death aura, and Mythical Dragon Martial Lord to the robot Zero One, asking it to help look up information on these terms.</p><p></p><p>"A while ago,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Something big happened in the Wu Gui country - a military camp was completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>I watched the video and saw a giant blood-red sword appear in the sky. Instantly... all the soldiers in the camp died.</p><p></p><p>There are rumors that the immortal path has been revived, and that person was a cultivator!" Han Xianyun said in a lowered voice. As he said this, he was very excited, but there was also a hint of dejection in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If there really is an immortal path, what's the point of all our years of effort...?"</p><p></p><p>He was indeed very dejected. </p><p></p><p>If there really was an immortal path, the martial way would be completely obsolete.</p><p></p><p>Even if one broke through the limits of martial arts... would it still have any meaning?</p><p></p><p>Could it wipe out a legion of 3,000 people with one sword strike?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and said: "After all your years of effort, can you defeat genetically enhanced soldiers?"</p><p></p><p>"..." Han Xianyun was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even without the immortal path, martial arts didn't amount to much.</p><p></p><p>The limits of martial arts couldn't even defeat soldiers who had taken advanced genetic enhancement drugs.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't know how to talk, then don't say anything!" Han Xianyun said dissatisfied. But his mood had improved quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>That's right, if martial arts weren't good enough then so be it. They weren't good enough to begin with anyway.</p><p></p><p>"My only worry now is that if the immortal path revival is real, the martial arts tournaments might be cancelled in the future... then..." There was a hint of desolation in Han Xianyun's voice.</p><p></p><p>No matter how inadequate martial arts were, they were still something he viewed as his child.</p><p></p><p>He had watched the martial arts tournaments since he was little.</p><p></p><p>To him, those martial arts limit-breakers were the professional athletes he idolized.</p><p></p><p>Given how things were developing, perhaps there really wouldn't be martial arts tournaments in this world anymore.</p><p></p><p>"You're overthinking it. Even if the Qin Yuan country is destroyed, the martial arts tournaments will continue for 100 more sessions!" Qi Yuan said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"You sure can boast. If there's no more Qin Yuan country, how the hell can there still be martial arts tournaments!" Han Xianyun couldn't help but retort.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm here, the martial arts tournaments will be here."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk!"</p><p></p><p>The two chatted and laughed as they entered the branch of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Next up was the testing.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who passed the test could directly participate in the official martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>In the hall, there were over 30 people, each one a martial artist emanating a sharp aura.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Southern Lion Zhang Yang let out a loud shout, unleashing his innate martial technique.</p><p></p><p>A sound like a thunderclap rang out on the arena stage.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang's opponent, a powerful martial artist, had no chance to resist and fell heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Southern Lion Zhang Yang wins!" With the referee's announcement, Zhang Yang arrogantly came down from the stage. As for the martial artist he defeated, he didn't even spare him a glance, completely disregarding him.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists below looked at Zhang Yang with envy and shock in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Southern Lion Zhang Yang's strength has improved again compared to last year!"</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the champion of this martial arts tournament will undoubtedly be him!"</p><p></p><p>"But he's... too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Next up... Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>At the referee's call, Qi Yuan also walked forward.</p><p></p><p>Northern Crane Han Xianyun, who had passed the test, smiled and said: "Good luck, future champion. Don't fail the test."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan smiled and said: "You're underestimating Qi Yuan too much. His talent... is even higher than yours!"</p><p></p><p>"Higher than me?" Han Xianyun was stunned. "What level is he at?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll see." Yang Shan's smile grew wider.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was just over 20 years old, 7-8 years younger than Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>But he had already reached the limit of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Qi Yuan had only been practicing martial arts for less than a year.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he really could break through the martial arts limit like Luo Bufan.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to records, Luo Bufan's martial arts talent was not as good as Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stepped onto the arena stage with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>His opponent was a very burly man, whose arms were thicker than Qi Yuan's thighs.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the stage, he was like a wall.</p><p></p><p>"This kid has bad luck, he's actually up against Iron Armor Crazy Wind!"</p><p></p><p>"Iron Armor Crazy Wind practices the Iron Armor technique with unparalleled defense. That young guy won't be able to break through his defense at all!"</p><p></p><p>"How did he end up here?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists below discussed animatedly. Han Xianyun also showed a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"His luck is too bad. Even an average martial arts limit-breaker would have no chance of winning against Iron Armor Crazy Wind.</p><p></p><p>After all... martial arts... have limits!"</p><p></p><p>Martial arts were still weak after all, and differences in physique were also very important.</p><p></p><p>That big guy looked to be over 300 pounds, 2 meters tall. Even without martial arts training, such a brute could easily defeat martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention he had also cultivated the Iron Armor technique, a hard skill.</p><p></p><p>However, on the stage, Qi Yuan looked at this burly man with a regretful expression in his eyes: "Your build is very suitable for corpse refinement.</p><p></p><p>What a pity, I'm a good person."</p><p></p><p>With his words, Qi Yuan suddenly struck out fiercely.</p><p></p><p>His speed was shockingly fast in the eyes of the martial artists present.</p><p></p><p>Iron Armor Crazy Wind had no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous force landed on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Iron Armor Crazy Wind let out a loud cry.</p><p></p><p>But his body flew out of the arena uncontrollably, with a loud crash.</p><p></p><p>The battle started quickly and ended quickly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present revealed shocked expressions. The scene before their eyes was too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>"This... is the martial arts limit, and not just an ordinary martial arts limit!"</p><p></p><p>The people present reacted, and their gazes towards Qi Yuan became different.</p><p></p><p>"So young... this talent is even stronger than Northern Crane and Southern Lion!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists at the scene were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even some elderly martial artists on the high platform stood up excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Has another Luo Bufan appeared in this world?"</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists looked at Qi Yuan differently now.</p><p></p><p>After all, breaking through to the martial arts limit at such a young age.</p><p></p><p>This talent... was unprecedented, and probably would be unmatched in the future.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... he had the potential to break through the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the martial artists present all became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes towards Qi Yuan also changed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a martial artist looked at Southern Lion Zhang Yang with a strange expression in his eyes: "Zhang Yang, you have a rival this time. His strength... is probably not below yours."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang glanced at Qi Yuan, his eyes still arrogant: "I'm participating in this martial arts tournament, so the champion can only be me.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, his strength... in the past I might have given him a second look, but I'm no longer who I was before.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for getting the championship to make a perfect exit, I wouldn't even bother participating in this martial arts tournament."</p><p></p><p>He was no longer his former self.</p><p></p><p>He... was already a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Although he had just started... dealing with some mortal martial artists... wasn't it easy? Facing Qi Yuan and other upstart martial artists, he felt nothing but disdain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a small alley.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller Yu Xiu's face was full of pain. Dense red marks had grown all over his face.</p><p></p><p>These red marks covered his entire face, looking very terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Not good..."</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! A sound like beating drums rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He collapsed on the ground, his eyes blurry. He saw a terrifying horned giant beast walking towards him from the mist ahead.</p><p></p><p>The beast held a bloody axe in its hand.</p><p></p><p>This scene was very frightening.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu's face was full of fear.</p><p></p><p>"How could it be a monster of this level... I'm done for, I'm going to die here..."</p><p></p><p>He felt bitter in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just doing some ordinary fortune telling and removing a curse.</p><p></p><p>How did he end up in such terrible luck?</p>

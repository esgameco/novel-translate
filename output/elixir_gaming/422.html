        <h1>Chapter 422</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord's eyes lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>The more flustered and panicked the Demon Flame Heavenly Lord became, the more excited he felt.</p><p></p><p>"The fortune of the Nine Heavens is with me. It is my destiny to transcend!" </p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord plunged headlong into the Gate of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>Transcending the Nine Heavens and becoming the first in this realm was right before his eyes! In an instant, the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord stepped into the Gate of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding aura changed drastically. Ahead, he saw the blood-red robed Demon Flame Heavenly Lord with his back turned, his body seemingly trembling with rage and fear, as if sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>A frenzied look flashed in the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord's eyes: "Hahaha, destiny is on my side. To hell with the Tai Huang Palace and Moon God Palace. From now on... they'll all answer to me!"</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ultimate Principles was the greatest treasure of creation in the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was already a Yang Spirit of Ultimate Principles. After spending a million years in the Gate of Ultimate Principles comprehending all the principles, he would surely enter the realm of Great Ultimate Principles. </p><p></p><p>Once he comprehended the principles understood by other Great Ultimate Principles, who in the Nine Heavens could stop him from soaring freely? However, at this moment, the blood-colored figure ahead gritted his teeth, and trembling words floated out.</p><p></p><p>The speaker's fury was evident!</p><p></p><p>"You actually followed me!"</p><p></p><p>"Stalker, peeping tom!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you peeped on me bathing too?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot, I haven't bathed in a while!"</p><p></p><p>"Stalking, peeping, breaking and entering... you've committed... ten capital crimes!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was extremely infectious. If this were in an ancient county yamen on the Blue Star, the magistrate would probably believe this little composition without even investigating.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord suddenly became wary.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Heavenly Lord's state was far too abnormal. </p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the Gate of Ultimate Principles affected one's emotions?</p><p></p><p>Those nonsensical words from earlier were nothing like what that Demon Flame fellow could say.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely cautious as he watched the Demon Flame Heavenly Lord's back.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Demon Flame Heavenly Lord turned around. The mist around his body dissipated, revealing a face as white as jade and incomparably handsome.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord blinked, momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>Not only could the Gate of Ultimate Principles affect your emotions, it could also... give you plastic surgery? This Demon Flame Heavenly Lord looked completely different from his memory!</p><p></p><p>"Those who break the law shall be executed by all!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not Demon Flame?" The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was surprised and extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>A solemn expression appeared in his eyes as countless eyeballs rose behind him, rotating to examine Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Observing the Subtle was also activated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see Qi Yuan's true face clearly.</p><p></p><p>However, as powerful as the Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle was, when it fell on that crimson-robed figure, the feedback obtained was extremely sparse.</p><p></p><p>He was apprehensive in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm not Demon Flame. I am the spirit of the Gate of Ultimate Principles!" Qi Yuan pretended to be addicted, "You dare trespass in my home? I'll borrow your dog head!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the blood-red long sword raised, its dark red light dazzling to the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Greed, envy, lust... various powerful auras permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>"Great Celestial Rank?"</p><p></p><p>"No? Primordial Divine Ability?"</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord felt somewhat absurd.</p><p></p><p>The pressure from the opponent was close to that of a Great Celestial Rank Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>But the attack was a Primordial Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>This sense of absurdity was similar to competing with a mathematics professor on the Blue Star, and his ultimate move being a "quadratic equation".</p><p></p><p>However, this was the Gate of Ultimate Principles, so the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was still extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing a Primordial Divine Ability, he activated his Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Know Heaven's Punishment!"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when an ordinary Great Celestial Rank Yang Spirit encounters an Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit, the former has almost no chance of survival in a fight.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Ultimate Principle realm, looking at mountains and waters is not like looking at mountains and waters.</p><p></p><p>With Observing the Subtle activated, all of Qi Yuan's movements and spiritual power circulation trajectories seemed to be under the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord's control.</p><p></p><p>The weakest point of that overwhelming sword strike brimming with blood qi and imposing aura also entered the Demon Eye's sight.</p><p></p><p>He was confident of victory and counterattacked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Mere alternative Yang Spirit, nothing special!"</p><p></p><p>He had already estimated Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know that the other was particularly foul-mouthed.</p><p></p><p>"You actually peeped at me!"</p><p></p><p>"Your gaze makes me very uncomfortable!"</p><p></p><p>"This is sexual harassment!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raged, unleashing a powerful sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord's eyes held a smile. This sword strike clashed with his attack, evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Ultimate Principles belongs to me. The one from Tai Huang Palace you want to kill... I'll kill for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck... so much bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, also realizing the power of the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>For Yang Spirits like the Demon Flame Heavenly Lord, he could take them down with a sneak attack or a slide tackle.</p><p></p><p>But against an Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirit, he sensed danger and caution.</p><p></p><p>"Your sword is nothing special!" With Observing the Subtle operating at its peak, the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was full of confidence. As long as Qi Yuan's sword strike fell, he would be able to severely injure him.</p><p></p><p>However, that extremely sharp and domineering sword strike was suddenly withdrawn at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Oops, I'm withdrawing my sword!"</p><p></p><p>When his brows indicated impending disaster, Qi Yuan withdrew his sword and stopped attacking.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was slightly stunned and let out a cold snort: "Nothing special after all!"</p><p></p><p>"Here I come again!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan struck out with his sword again, unleashing the Heaven-Cleaving Sword Draw technique. A powerful aura swept out, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord sensed a strong aura of danger. The Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle activated again, frantically searching for flaws or weak points in that sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless pieces of information flashed by, and his eyes fixed on a point.</p><p></p><p>Found it! However, Qi Yuan's ridiculous voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Oops, I tricked you. I'm retreating!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said he would retreat and immediately withdrew his sword again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, even though the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was usually even-tempered, he was already furious and wanted to rip Qi Yuan's mouth apart.</p><p></p><p>His Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle was more focused on defense.</p><p></p><p>So if Qi Yuan withdrew his attack, his Ultimate Principle would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't at the Great Ultimate Principle level, so using the Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle consumed a lot of energy.</p><p></p><p>That's why he was somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>And the opponent was an alternative Ultimate Principle. Setting aside Ultimate Principles, his raw strength was still a notch above his own.</p><p></p><p>So he was very annoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, here I come again!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful sword strike, accompanied by that annoying voice.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord didn't hesitate at all and activated the Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle again, looking for flaws.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving again, retreat retreat retreat!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan didn't surprise him and retreated again, wasting his Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord was somewhat exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"I know you're anxious, but don't be!" Qi Yuan was quite relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!" The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord looked at Qi Yuan and suddenly used his Ultimate Principle, clearly launching an active attack.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Principle of Observing the Subtle was mainly defensive, but that didn't mean it couldn't be used offensively.</p><p></p><p>It just consumed more energy and had weaker power when used offensively.</p><p></p><p>Against an ordinary Great Celestial Rank, he could take them down even without using the Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was no ordinary Great Celestial Rank.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all you've got?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't move.</p><p></p><p>Ten Thousand Dao Martial God!</p><p></p><p>Four thousand divine infants focused their power on his body.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord's strike, he chose to meet force with force!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The collision between Yang Spirit Heavenly Lords had enough power to completely shatter an ordinary small world, turning the crust to ashes.</p><p></p><p>This strike was so powerful that even space became unstable, with the surrounding space starting to crack.</p><p></p><p>Spatial cracks expanded and then annihilated.</p><p></p><p>With his long hair flowing like a waterfall, Qi Yuan stood firm holding his blood-colored long sword, the shattered space passing by his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Can you still eat?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Celestial Lord was enraged. "Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>He was truly angry. </p><p></p><p>When had he ever encountered such an enemy? Even facing the Embracing Moon Celestial Lord, he could gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"How about... you try again?" Qi Yuan said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>A look of wariness flashed deep in the Demon Eye Celestial Lord's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Taking the initiative to attack consumed too much of his Observing Subtleties, and the power was weak with no results.</p><p></p><p>So he did not move again.</p><p></p><p>"If you won't make a move, I'll have to take the initiative."</p><p></p><p>"Who told you to be my pure love, you old geezer!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said with a doting expression, as if speaking to a greedy little girl.</p><p></p><p>The sword was drawn again, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Each time, Qi Yuan's attacks could not be faked.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Celestial Lord did not hesitate, activating Observing Subtleties again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, you're too strong, I'll retreat..."</p><p></p><p>"No retreat!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan noticed his right eyebrow did not twitch.</p><p></p><p>This meant the opponent's ultimate principle was merely a fake.</p><p></p><p>A powerful sword strike pierced the sky, and in that instant stabbed into the giant eyeball.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the tens of thousands of densely packed eyeballs on his back all felt as if they had been pricked by needles.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The Demon Eye Celestial Lord let out a miserable cry. An expression of disbelief appeared on his face. "You... you also have an ultimate principle?"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could not understand how Qi Yuan was able to see through his disguise.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have an ultimate principle. This is a man's intuition, you wouldn't understand!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm striking with my sword again, will you dodge?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swung his sword once more.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Celestial Lord was anxious, frantically activating his Observing Subtleties ultimate principle.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe the other's consumption could be lower than his! He was a Yang Spirit of the Ultimate Principle realm, how could he not match even a Great Celestial?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was gravely mistaken.</p><p></p><p>He was just one person!</p><p></p><p>While Qi Yuan had over 4,000 divine infants.</p><p></p><p>These Yang Spirits provided Qi Yuan with endless power.</p><p></p><p>In terms of consumption, he was not afraid of ultimate principles at all. He could even dare to provoke a Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>"Here I come again!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going out again!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Purple Palace, Qi Yuan toyed with the Demon Eye Celestial Lord like a cat playing with a mouse, constantly attacking and harassing him.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Celestial Lord's initial vigor gradually faded to elderly frailty.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>With ten thousand martial gods empowering him and 4,000 divine infants infusing him, Qi Yuan held nothing back in this strike.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Demon Eye Celestial Lord activated his Observing Subtleties ultimate principle.</p><p></p><p>But facing Qi Yuan's attack, his eyeballs shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!" </p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Celestial Lord screamed in agony, but the attacks kept coming relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>At this level, one defeat led to total defeat. He had no chance to fight back at all.</p><p></p><p>After countless collisions, the curtain finally fell. Qi Yuan sat in the air, looking at the shattered eyeballs, and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"You are not the Demon Eye Celestial Lord. You are my past self!"</p><p></p><p>With his Purple Palace body, he had reversed the kill on a Yang Spirit of the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>A Yang Spirit of the Ultimate Principle realm was an absolute high-level existence in the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in the Six Heavens, apart from the Black Demon Abyss, any other holy land faction would not refuse if an Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirit declared loyalty and joined.</p><p></p><p>He should have been happy, but his expression was extremely solemn at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It took so much effort just to defeat an Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirit of the Demon Luo race.</p><p></p><p>Then... what about a Great Ultimate Principle? What about that person from the Supreme Radiance Palace? Qi Yuan felt an intense sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>"The enemy... is too powerful."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the soundless voice from the game jade slip transmitted again, seeming somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "My enemy is that person from the Supreme Radiance Palace. He's a tough nut to crack."</p><p></p><p>The soundless voice transmitted again.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, people should communicate more. I feel like you've gotten smarter."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed more emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk, I need to take a bath. I'm about to... see Jin Li."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>As for the spoils of war, he would sort them out after bathing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ultimate principles have levels."</p><p></p><p>"Heaven grade, Earth grade, Profound grade, Yellow grade."</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Eye Celestial Lord's Observing Subtleties is a Profound grade ultimate principle!"</p><p></p><p>"If Profound grade is already this strong, what about the Heaven grade above it?"</p><p></p><p>"As for the even higher Supreme Ultimate Principle... it's unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat urgent.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had inhabited the body of the Boundless Buddha and, as an observer, saw a trace of remnant consciousness from the Great Sun Radiant Buddha.</p><p></p><p>That kind of power and majesty was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Just a trace of remnant consciousness was enough to suppress Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How powerful would a complete Great Ultimate Principle realm expert be? And even among Great Ultimate Principle realm experts, there were differences in strength, related to the grade of Great Ultimate Principle they had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"There are four Supreme Ultimate Principles, namely... Absolute, Unique, Cyclic, and Primordial."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Ultimate Principle was the highest and most powerful grade of ultimate principles.</p><p></p><p>There were four types.</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens, the number of Great Ultimate Principle experts who had comprehended a Supreme Ultimate Principle could be counted on less than two hands.</p><p></p><p>These Great Ultimate Principle experts were truly the supreme and unrivaled figures of the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>If this were the primordial world of Earth, these people would be Sages, while other Great Ultimate Principles would be demi-Sages.</p><p></p><p>As for the other ordinary Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirits, they would be Golden Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"The honorific title of that person from the Supreme Radiance Palace is Unique Great Sun, and the ultimate principle he comprehended is also Unique Great Sun, so he does not allow the Great Sun Radiant Buddha to live."</p><p></p><p>"The Moon God Sovereign is Primordial Great Yin."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I must attend the Ultimate Principle Discourse Meeting. Without comprehending a Supreme Ultimate Principle, there's no way to play with these old fellows!"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had the Gate of Ultimate Principles, comprehending inside the gate would take several hundred thousand years, or even a million years. He couldn't afford to wait.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of ultimate principle is a Supreme Ultimate Principle that can be comprehended?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mind was in chaos now.</p><p></p><p>This was not something a Purple Palace cultivator should be considering.</p><p></p><p>But there was no choice. On Earth, someone earning 3000 a month could concern themselves with major national affairs, so why couldn't a Purple Palace cultivator ponder ultimate principles? Putting aside all his thoughts, Qi Yuan changed into a blood-red robe, as handsome as a jade tree. Looking at the stars in the sky, his gaze became gentle.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go to the Absolute Moon Abyss."</p><p></p><p>His form changed again, this time into the appearance of the Demon Eye Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the underworld, he had already brainwashed the remnant soul of the Demon Eye Celestial Lord and obtained some memories.</p><p></p><p>Now, impersonating the Demon Eye Celestial Lord was no big deal for him.</p><p></p><p>However, this impersonation probably wouldn't last long.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Demon Abyss was a war zone.</p><p></p><p>"While it hasn't been discovered yet, can I take the opportunity to... steal back the well from my home?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these schemes would be implemented after seeing Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>The promise from long ago had crossed millions of years of space and time.</p><p></p><p>The July Lake was gone, the ancient Qi Chun tree was gone.</p><p></p><p>But none of that mattered.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing you..."</p><p></p><p>Recommending a book called "My Cultivation Narration is Strange"</p><p></p><p>Recommendation: When an overly normal host meets an abnormal dragon-proud-sky narrator</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's cultivation talent is not ideal... but fortunately he has a dog narrator</p><p></p><p>It's just that this narrator seems a bit off?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 281</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, information about Qi Yuan was revealed.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of those present were not very good.</p><p></p><p>"Even if he can successfully be reborn, he will only have one year of memories," said a tall woman with elaborate and exaggerated makeup on her face, as if she had just attended a ball and hadn't had time to change.</p><p></p><p>Following Gongyi Jing's words, there was silence among those present. </p><p></p><p>That voice was true, the world would restart.</p><p></p><p>Only those who restarted could return with their memories intact.</p><p></p><p>These people were not the lucky ones who would restart.</p><p></p><p>So even if they went back ten years, they wouldn't have the memories of those ten years.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan in the grave before them was fortunately also one who would restart.</p><p></p><p>He was also the restarter allocated to the Gongyi family of the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if it weren't for the Su family's interference, we wouldn't have been allocated this person!" said a man who looked somewhat drained by drink and debauchery.</p><p></p><p>The Su family was also one of the Seven Martial Star families, quite at odds with the Gongyi family and having the upper hand over them.</p><p></p><p>This sudden incident saw the Su family join forces with other families to suppress the Gongyi family, allocating a dead man to them.</p><p></p><p>If there wasn't another living person allocated to the other families, the Gongyi family certainly wouldn't have stood idly by.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle has already met with the other restarter. For now, we just need to do what needs to be done with this one," said Gongyi Qing, his voice refined but carrying a hint of authority that made others unconsciously feel inferior.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai nodded, his eyes somewhat cloudy: "Give the order, open the coffin and dig up the grave!"</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they needed to see the corpse.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, under Li Shenkong's command, many soldiers came forward and began to dig up the grave.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and under the strong lights, the graveyard was illuminated as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, many specially-made soft chairs appeared, and the Gongyi family members all sat down.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, various foods were served, and these twenty-odd people slowly began to eat.</p><p></p><p>After all, today's events were sudden, and these people had been busy all day without a chance to eat.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man drained by drink and debauchery took out his phone, looked at the contents, and revealed a contemptuous smile: "This restarter has a mental illness, and he also has a terminal disease. Even if he lives again, he's probably not far from death, so he's not of much use."</p><p></p><p>He scanned the QR code on Qi Yuan's tombstone and saw quite a bit of information about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Type 3 mental disorder, accompanied by severe delusions, difficult to communicate with.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Gongyi family members all agreed with this man's words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan before them was indeed unfortunate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was also lucky.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had gained the chance to live again.</p><p></p><p>Although, only for a year.</p><p></p><p>"I guess he won't be able to see the grand spectacle of the hundred clans flourishing.</p><p></p><p>And we will have to wait another ten years," said the refined man from earlier, his voice strong.</p><p></p><p>Those present changed their expressions slightly upon hearing this, filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"So all these opportunities must be completely in our hands!" Gongyi Cai's eyes flashed with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Over these ten years, many opportunities had emerged, but most were in the hands of the other Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>To change the situation in the future, they needed to make good use of this restarter situation.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity he's a dead man, otherwise we could make a deal with him!" Gongyi Jing couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>As for the deal, it would simply be to send encrypted text to Qi Yuan, for him to go back to the past to find the Gongyi family and pass on the information.</p><p></p><p>In return, the Gongyi family would also transfer enormous benefits to the restarter.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of cooperation was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>After all, the restarter held the initiative. What if they were unwilling to tell the various big families the encrypted text?</p><p></p><p>So, facing those restarters, the big families of the Seven Martial Stars went all out.</p><p></p><p>Women, wealth, power, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan was a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Dead men can't communicate, nor can they cooperate.</p><p></p><p>The main force of the Gongyi family had all gone to find the other person, leaving only them dispatched here.</p><p></p><p>Today's efforts were destined to be in vain.</p><p></p><p>With the cooperation of several soldiers, the grave was quickly dug up, and the coffin appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>Those present looked at the coffin, all feeling somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Jing looked forward, frowning: "Only bones remain."</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Gongyi family looked at Qi Yuan's remains, exchanging glances.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Gongyi Cai said: "Proceed according to the original plan."</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan was already dead, they still decided to tell the plan to the remains in the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Although the bones couldn't hear, what if? Qi Yuan was dead, but what if his soul was still floating around?</p><p></p><p>After all, if something as outrageous as a world restart could happen.</p><p></p><p>If even more outrageous things happened... that would be normal too, right?</p><p></p><p>"Who will inform him?" Gongyi Cai spoke, his voice old.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-odd members of the Gongyi family looked at each other, all somewhat reluctant.</p><p></p><p>After all, talking uselessly to bones, and in the middle of the night at that, none of them wanted to do it.</p><p></p><p>The man drained by drink and debauchery said: "Uncle, I haven't slept all night."</p><p></p><p>Clearly refusing.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Jing hesitated, about to say something, when she saw Gongyi Qing say: "I'll do it."</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai then nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although Gongyi Qing came from a remote branch, his abilities were not bad, so he was also entrusted with important tasks by the Gongyi family.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Qing stepped forward, holding some documents in his hand, approaching the remains.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, I am Gongyi Qing of the Gongyi family.</p><p></p><p>I apologize for suddenly opening your grave and disturbing you.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if you can hear my words.</p><p></p><p>I come here with great sincerity...</p><p></p><p>Nine years ago, you died of a cerebral hemorrhage, and even going to the hospital for emergency treatment couldn't save you.</p><p></p><p>Our Gongyi family has the best medical environment, and even great medicines. As long as you choose to cooperate with us, passing on the cipher I'm about to tell you, our Gongyi family will not only treat your illness for free.</p><p></p><p>Opportunities, power, status, wealth... we can give you all of this...</p><p></p><p>The content of the cipher is..."</p><p></p><p>The Gongyi family's cipher was something they had ten years ago. As long as Qi Yuan told them the cipher, they could translate it to get the answer based on the cipher.</p><p></p><p>The content of the cipher was divided into three categories. The first category recorded the world restart event, understanding the reason, and letting the Gongyi family understand this reason; the second category was about the location of opportunities; the third category was about major events.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Qing spoke seriously, the content of the cipher quite complex.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if you can hear, or if you can remember if you hear. Regarding the content of the cipher, I'll repeat it several more times."</p><p></p><p>In the lost mountain, Gongyi Qing continued to speak to the bones.</p><p></p><p>This scene looked particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>The man drained by drink and debauchery yawned and took another sip of wine. He looked at Gongyi Qing, a hint of arrogance hidden in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the Gongyi family, his father was in power, while Gongyi Qing's relationship was more distant.</p><p></p><p>"He's been repeating like this for an hour now, isn't he tired?</p><p></p><p>If I were him, I'd just use a recorded broadcast."</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Jing's beautiful face showed a helpless expression: "We're cooperating with Qi Yuan, using a recorded broadcast would be impolite and wouldn't show sincerity."</p><p></p><p>"Talking about sincerity with a pile of bones?" The middle-aged man laughed, a hint of mockery in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Respecting a corpse was the best joke he'd heard today.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai glared at the middle-aged man, who then stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, and in the slightly eerie graveyard, Gongyi Qing's clear voice could be heard.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Gongyi family members all sat in place to rest.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had been busy all day too.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With less than a quarter of an hour left until the restart, Gongyi Qing supported himself on the coffin lid as he continued speaking. The middle-aged man, drained by drink and debauchery, yawned again with sleepy eyes: "Still going on about that?"</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai glared once more at this useless descendant, then walked over to Gongyi Qing and said gently: "Why don't you take a break? The results are in from the other side - that restarter has agreed to cooperate with us."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, these great families would not cooperate with just one restarter. The ciphertexts given to the restarters also had overlaps, in order to avoid errors.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, Second Uncle. There's only about ten minutes left, I'll keep reciting a bit longer. It's no trouble," Gongyi Qing replied.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Jing picked up a glass of water and handed it to Gongyi Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Gongyi Qing said as he took the water, about to drink.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the ground began to shake violently. </p><p></p><p>The earth beneath their feet churned, trees swayed back and forth, and tall buildings trembled.</p><p></p><p>The glass in Gongyi Qing's hand shook and fell into the coffin.</p><p></p><p>This tremor, similar to an earthquake, lasted only three breaths before stopping.</p><p></p><p>The crowd reacted with expressions ranging from bewilderment to shock.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai's eyes were deep: "Strange phenomena before the restart - it seems to be true."</p><p></p><p>A complex look flashed in Gongyi Jing's eyes: "After the world restarts... will I still be me?"</p><p></p><p>In truth, Gongyi Jing was resistant to and didn't want the world to restart.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, a lazy voice spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you spilled your water on my bones."</p><p></p><p>At this voice, everyone's gaze turned sharply towards the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Inside the coffin, a skeleton had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Fear and incredulous expressions arose in the hearts of those present!</p><p></p><p>"A ghost!" </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man drained by alcohol nearly fell over in terror.</p><p></p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p></p><p>It had come back to life! It had actually come back to life!</p><p></p><p>"Are you... Qi Yuan?" Gongyi Qing looked at the skeleton before him, his eyes revealing astonishment.</p><p></p><p>If the world restart wasn't imminent, encountering such a horrifying thing, he would certainly have taken Qi Yuan's bones to a lab for research.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... are you people here to dance on my grave?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's bones were scattered about, barely forming a whole.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>He had actually become a corpse.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that in this life he would become a puppet?</p><p></p><p>An excited expression appeared on Gongyi Qing's face: "You actually... have consciousness. Could it be that ghosts really exist?"</p><p></p><p>With the world restart existing, the existence of ghosts became easier to understand.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the hollow skull shook, looking quite stiff and loose: "Young man, don't be superstitious. Believe in science - there are no ghosts in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had quite the authority to speak on this matter.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Purple Palace cultivator perished, they would truly perish, with no ghost remaining.</p><p></p><p>Only experts at the Yin Spirit level might retain a wisp of primordial spirit, surviving in another form.</p><p></p><p>If you called that a ghost, it could barely pass as one.</p><p></p><p>So, there were no ghosts in this world.</p><p></p><p>The skull looked at everyone present very seriously, its voice also very serious.</p><p></p><p>However, to these people, what Qi Yuan said seemed extremely ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Who could understand? A skull on a burial mound saying to believe in science, that there were no ghosts in this world.</p><p></p><p>This was the thought in everyone's mind.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Gongyi Cai's mouth twitched: "Little brother, you may not have realized yet, but you're already dead."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, this game avatar of mine is indeed dead," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he would have to take the path of ghost cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words once again confused those present. Game avatar?</p><p></p><p>But then, remembering that Qi Yuan had been mentally ill in life, it all started to seem normal.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi Yuan, do you know what Brother Qing said earlier?" At this point, Gongyi Jing mustered up the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if it weren't for the impending world restart giving her some certainty, she wouldn't have dared to call a skull "brother".</p><p></p><p>"What did he say?" Qi Yuan was surprised. "Are you all sick? Talking to a corpse that's turned to bones - could you be mentally ill?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words once again left those present speechless.</p><p></p><p>However, Gongyi Qing hurriedly said: "The world is about to restart. Our Gongyi family hopes to cooperate with you..."</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Qing explained the whole situation.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Qi Yuan was extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The world is actually about to restart?"</p><p></p><p>This was something he had never imagined.</p><p></p><p>After all, what kind of power could restart the world? He couldn't fathom it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he controlled the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent, he couldn't restart the Wangyue Continent and turn back time.</p><p></p><p>He never expected to encounter such a thing after coming to this world.</p><p></p><p>"How interesting. It seems this game is quite difficult," Qi Yuan murmured. "Do you know who the game's final boss is?"</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Qing frowned - communicating with a mentally ill person was quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't a game, this is reality!" Gongyi Jing said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Gongyi Qing also spoke up: "It's about to restart. Our Gongyi family wants to cooperate with you. What do you think..."</p><p></p><p>This was the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan didn't have memories of the past ten years, the ciphertext was enough for the Gongyi family to use.</p><p></p><p>"I have my own game tasks to complete," Qi Yuan wanted to refuse. "Let's leave it to fate. If I encounter you someday, that will count as cooperating with you."</p><p></p><p>He spoke casually and carelessly, not taking cooperation with the Gongyi family seriously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the man drained by drink and debauchery revealed a dissatisfied expression: "It seems you don't know what the Gongyi family represents! If you latch onto our Gongyi family's thigh, power, wealth, women - you'll have it all!"</p><p></p><p>If it were another restarter with ten years of memories, he would still be wary.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was mentally ill, with only a year of memories.</p><p></p><p>So, offending them meant offending them.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at that man: "In-game assets... aren't they just numbers? Wealth... I have that.</p><p></p><p>Power... I'm not lacking that either.</p><p></p><p>As for women... I have a wife, I never mess around."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words left those present confused.</p><p></p><p>The man who had spoken provocatively earlier was also speechless.</p><p></p><p>What was he arguing with a mentally ill person for?</p><p></p><p>At this point, Gongyi Qing hurriedly said: "The content of the ciphertext is..."</p><p></p><p>He quickly repeated the ciphertext once more. After all, there were less than ten minutes left, and he was afraid Qi Yuan wouldn't remember.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "I'll reluctantly accept your task. I'll do it when I have time or if it's convenient. If it interferes with my main quest, then I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>After all, he still had a main quest to complete.</p><p></p><p>The remaining time was spent with the Gongyi family painting a grand picture for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened casually, also quietly waiting for the world to restart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sound of the earth shaking grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's skull sockets seemed to have spirit, gazing at the sky. Was the world about to restart?</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see exactly how it would restart.</p><p></p><p>His vision gradually became blurry at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The entire world seemed to become overlapping lines.</p><p></p><p>The Gongyi family members before his eyes also became segmented.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a shrill bird cry rang out.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see a huge red bird, bloody and extremely miserable, spreading its wings and soaring.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his bones also suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

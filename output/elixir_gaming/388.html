        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting finally left, satisfied.</p><p></p><p>On the upper floor of the pavilion, only Qi Yuan and Jiang Lingsu remained.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu blinked her eyes: "Senior brother, now you know she's not my sister, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared to be thinking: "She's our creditor."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? You really need money?" Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"A little bit," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you say so earlier? Is this enough?" Jiang Lingsu took out a storage bag and handed it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She thought of something and rummaged around her body, pulling out four more storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she even gritted her teeth and took out a pink storage bag from her bosom.</p><p></p><p>"These six storage bags contain all my spirit stones. Is it enough? I'll lend them to you!" Jiang Lingsu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan felt slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister, this rich lady, was still as kind-hearted as ever.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan was still weak, she would shower him with gold coins, spirit stones, and even cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it's probably not enough. Junior sister, you should keep this money," Qi Yuan said, unconsciously placing his hand on Jiang Lingsu's head and rubbing her hair.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough? What are you buying that requires so much money?" Jiang Lingsu thought of something, and a hint of disappointment flashed across her face as she started to take back her private savings.</p><p></p><p>She had forgotten that her current senior brother was very different from before.</p><p></p><p>These private savings she had accumulated over so many years were hardly worth mentioning to her senior brother now.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's hand pressed on Jiang Lingsu's delicate hand, stopping her from pulling back the pink storage bag: "Junior sister, I don't want to owe money. The feeling of being in debt is really not good - I want to run away whenever I see the creditor.</p><p></p><p>How about this - instead of lending me these spirit stones, why don't you invest in me? In this game of mine, the real estate industry is especially profitable, it's a sunrise industry.</p><p></p><p>Why don't you use these spirit stones to invest in me buying a plot of land? After I build the underworld, I'll reserve a spot for you to build a house, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was saying things that were difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu seemed to be seriously considering it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Qian, the manager of the Jiang family business, stopped in her tracks. Hearing Qi Yuan's words, she couldn't help but show a helpless expression in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young miss, investing in housing and land contracts in Cloud Sky City is not very wise," Jiang Qian couldn't help but remind her.</p><p></p><p>In her heart, her evaluation of Qi Yuan dropped a few more points.</p><p></p><p>However, he was the young miss's senior brother, so she couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Although she couldn't discern Qi Yuan's cultivation level, just based on his face alone, it would be enough for him to marry into the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu glanced back at Jiang Qian: "I'm investing in my senior brother, not in Cloud Sky City. I trust my senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she pushed the pink storage bag into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Save me a good spot!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry!" Qi Yuan patted his chest in assurance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Qian didn't say anything more on this matter. She said softly, "Young miss, there's news that the Strange Painter will return tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, good. Tomorrow I'll go with senior brother to find her!" Jiang Lingsu was a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>She could still be of help to her senior brother.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu thought of something and casually asked, "I heard our Jiang family's business is encountering some difficulties here?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of worry flashed across Jiang Qian's eyes, but she said gently, "Young miss, I will handle these matters. You just need to focus on your cultivation. Once your strength is great enough, all problems will cease to be problems."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qian was quite envious of Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>The young miss was from the main branch of the Jiang family, born with a silver spoon in her mouth, enjoying abundant cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the young miss had a high aptitude for cultivation and was qualified to see the Jiang family's greatest treasure, enhancing her talent with it.</p><p></p><p>As for herself, she was from a branch family. Without exceptional talent or outstanding beauty, it was almost impossible to make significant progress on the path of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Generally, people like her would go out to manage some businesses, earning spirit stones and resources for the main branch of the Jiang family to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, she was extremely envious of the young miss, who excelled in both appearance and talent.</p><p></p><p>If she could have any one of the young miss's looks, talent, or background, her life would be completely different.</p><p></p><p>After reporting the situation, Jiang Qian walked out of the pavilion, her eyes carrying a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>If only she were born in the main branch, she could choose what she liked, even keeping a trophy husband wouldn't be bad.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she pushed these thoughts aside, hurrying back to deal with the Jiang family's business in this area.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of footsteps approached: "Manager Jiang, what a coincidence to meet you here."</p><p></p><p>A man with shifty eyes appeared before Jiang Qian. He was wearing a blood-red robe and holding a fan, looking extremely flamboyant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Jiang Qian frowned slightly: "Young Master Feng."</p><p></p><p>The person before her was named Feng Ruohan.</p><p></p><p>His name was nice, but his reputation was not good. He was a well-known playboy in Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>However, the Feng family was a major family in Cloud Sky City and even in the entire Helan Province, with much stronger power than the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>Feng Ruohan's red robe was clearly imitating the legendary Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>He closed the folding fan in his hand and said, "I heard that the young miss of the Jiang family's main branch is as beautiful as a heavenly fairy. I wonder if I might have the fortune to meet her?"</p><p></p><p>"That would need to be asked of the young miss herself."</p><p></p><p>"Manager Jiang, you're just someone from a branch family in the Jiang clan. You probably don't have much hope for promotion in this lifetime," Feng Ruohan suddenly sighed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, Young Master Feng?" Jiang Qian frowned, feeling wary in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. I want to make a deal with you," Feng Ruohan said with a smile on his face. "I've long admired the Jiang young miss and wish to form a marriage alliance with the Jiang clan. But I'm not very good-looking, and the young miss has a handsome senior brother by her side.</p><p></p><p>So, I hope to get your help. Pour this vial of potion into the bowl the young miss drinks from.</p><p></p><p>Once she drinks it, she'll fall deeply in love with me, and the Jiang family won't notice anything.</p><p></p><p>Don't you want to cooperate with our Feng family? As long as you help me this time, the Feng family will immediately assist you, helping you resolve your crisis.</p><p></p><p>I will also strongly support you behind the scenes, helping you get promoted. In this lifetime, you won't be limited to being a mere manager, and might even have a chance at reaching the Divine Embryo realm.</p><p></p><p>How about it? Is my sincerity enough?"  Feng Ruohan stared into Jiang Qian's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qian's face turned pale, and her hand was already preparing to activate a teleportation talisman: "I'm sorry, Young Master Feng, but this kind of joke is not funny."</p><p></p><p>The expression on Feng Ruohan's face froze: "You mean... you want to refuse?"</p><p></p><p>Killing intent surged in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before coming here, he had already set up a formation in this area.</p><p></p><p>Since Jiang Qian had heard his plan and didn't agree, there was only one path left for her - death.</p><p></p><p>After Jiang Qian dies, he would then properly meet that Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>He grinned, revealing a cruel and lewd smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll only play with your corpse for one day."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qian's face turned deathly pale as she realized the teleportation talisman had failed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, suddenly, a flash of red light appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A thin line appeared on Feng Ruohan's neck, and in an instant, his head separated from his neck, revealing a smooth cut.</p><p></p><p>His body collapsed to the ground with a thud.</p><p></p><p>A cold voice filled with killing intent came:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's better to stay at home. You don't encounter so many disgusting things.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, the atmosphere in the immortal cultivation world is still too poor."</p><p></p><p>A handsome man in a blood-colored robe appeared, his words carrying a hint of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Jiang Qian's eyes changed slightly: "Young Master Qi!"</p><p></p><p>She hadn't expected that the one who saved her would be Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength... Divine Embryo realm?</p><p></p><p>Her heart suddenly tensed.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Qi had killed Feng Ruohan. The sky over Cloud Sky City... was about to change.</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Qi, he is the young master of the Feng family from Cloud Sky City, the local boss here. Please, Young Master Qi, take the young lady and leave this place quickly. I will stay behind to handle this matter!" Jiang Qian, befitting her role as a manager of an area, remained very calm, prioritizing the interests of the main branch.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and said: "I'll leave after I see the strange painter." With that, his figure disappeared, leaving Jiang Qian standing alone, her expression constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. We can't let the Feng family know so quickly that Feng Ruohan died in our Jiang clan, otherwise no one will be able to leave. Sigh... Young Master Qi was impulsive, he shouldn't have used lethal force!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qian lamented, but what's done was done, and she had no way to change it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, hurry and get ready, we're going to the Divine Infant Banquet. Oh, where did you just go?" Jiang Lingsu sat at the dressing table, glancing at Qi Yuan from the corner of her eye.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't really understand why Jiang Lingsu was putting on makeup.</p><p></p><p>She was already naturally beautiful, with good skin, and didn't need any makeup at all.</p><p></p><p>As for those women on Gongxing, who were lacking in natural beauty, like Wu Qi, makeup could indeed raise their appearance by a level in the eyes of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"I went to kill someone, and by the way, I used the Ten Kills Domineering Fist to destroy a sect, to rectify the atmosphere of the cultivation world a bit. The atmosphere in this Cloud Sky City is too poor," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Kills Domineering Fist was not a Dao technique, but a martial art.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Qi Yuan was how special the martial way truly was.</p><p></p><p>According to records, when Yangsheng realm cultivators from the immortal path went to some strange lands, their cultivation would drop by one level.</p><p></p><p>And when Yangsheng realm cultivators from those strange lands' cultivation systems entered the immortal world, their cultivation would also drop by one level.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, as a Myriad Path Martial God, didn't have this limitation, retaining his Martial God, which was equivalent to Yangsheng realm, combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, killing bad guys." Jiang Lingsu was used to this. "Senior Brother, quickly look at how my makeup turned out?"</p><p></p><p>"It's better without it," Qi Yuan objectively evaluated.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu glared at Qi Yuan, "This young lady must completely overshadow Qiong Yunting's presence!"</p><p></p><p>"Why bother competing with a bro?" Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"What? Bro?" Jiang Lingsu was stunned for a moment, then understood Qi Yuan's meaning and laughed, covering her mouth. "Senior Brother, you really know how to talk. Later at the Divine Infant Banquet, if you can talk, say more!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu suddenly remembered that her senior brother's mouth was much more poisonous than hers.</p><p></p><p>"I'm socially anxious. I'll just find a place to eat melon seeds casually when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Jiang Lingsu heard this and thought for a moment. "I'll keep you company."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud City, Divine Infant Banquet, bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>Not only were many young cultivators present, but older generation cultivators also appeared in droves.</p><p></p><p>People from Cloud City and other major forces in Helan Province all came.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist of this Divine Infant Banquet was the young master of the Wang family, Wang Yunteng.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that when he was born, there was a natural fragrance, and white deer came to offer spirit liquid.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng was seen as the hope of the Wang family.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Wang Yunteng is about the same age as me, but he's already become a Divine Infant. We're not on the same level anymore."</p><p></p><p>"The Wang family has produced such a qilin child, they've gained a thousand years of fortune!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Wang family has an important announcement to make at this Divine Infant Banquet!"</p><p></p><p>"What important announcement?"</p><p></p><p>"It's said to be related to the legendary Blood-Robed Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, a Yinshen realm powerhouse!"</p><p></p><p>The visiting guests kept flattering.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng held Qiong Yunting, looking arrogant.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present could all understand this kind of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>For a young person, being a bit arrogant was normal.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting's eyes kept scanning the guests, and when she saw a familiar figure, she immediately went over to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you've finally come. Your elder sister has been waiting for you.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, this is Miss Jiang Lingsu of the Jiang clan, and also my close friend!" Qiong Yunting said happily.</p><p></p><p>"Someone from the Jiang family? Wang Yunteng's face is indeed big. The Jiang family is far away in another province, yet someone still came to attend the Divine Infant Banquet!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you need to mention the Wang family's face? Which prominent family or sect in Helan Province hasn't come?"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, it's strange. Why hasn't anyone from the Feng family of Cloud Sky City come?"</p><p></p><p>The Feng family was the number one force in Cloud Sky City, and behind them was the Phoenix Palace, ranking among the top three forces in Helan Province.</p><p></p><p>Being in the same city, the Feng family should have sent their congratulatory gifts early, but no one had come yet, which was indeed strange.</p><p></p><p>"The Feng family has always been arrogant. Isn't it normal for them to want to make a grand entrance at the end?"</p><p></p><p>These guests discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting's attention was completely focused on Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a rare opportunity for her to outshine Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Sister's dao partner is truly talented. Who would have thought that such a small place like the Hundred Countries Region could produce a dragon!" Qiong Yunting's first words were full of hidden barbs.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, she was praising Qi Yuan's talent, but in reality, she was belittling his background.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when the guests heard that Qi Yuan was from the Hundred Countries Region, those who had originally wanted to befriend him because of his good looks all retracted their intentions.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Countries Region seemed to not even have a single Purple Mansion level force.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Light Palace incident, they wouldn't even know about the Hundred Countries Region.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qiong Yunting deliberately refer to her senior brother as her dao partner, Jiang Lingsu blushed, but at this moment she had no time to explain. Instead, she proudly boasted, "Sister is right, my senior brother is a true dragon. He's been on the East Land Young Genius Ranking!"</p><p></p><p>The East Land Young Genius Ranking was not something just anyone could get on. It represented the strongest batch of the younger generation in the East Land.</p><p></p><p>"He's actually a genius on the East Land Young Genius Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, I don't seem to have heard of him."</p><p></p><p>"It sounds a bit familiar, but that person doesn't seem to be a young genius."</p><p></p><p>On the East Land Young Genius Ranking, the strongest of the younger generation were only at the Divine Infant realm, with most being at the Yuan Dan realm.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting was slightly stunned when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't expected Jiang Lingsu to have hidden so much.</p><p></p><p>Such important information, and she only mentioned it now!</p><p></p><p>It was just to steal her thunder.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's a pity Yunteng was in closed cultivation a few years ago. Otherwise, if he had gone to participate in the East Land Young Genius Ranking, getting in the top three wouldn't have been a problem," Qiong Yunting said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu kept rolling her eyes at Qiong Yunting in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Usually, she wouldn't bother to compete with Qiong Yunting.</p><p></p><p>But slandering her senior brother was absolutely unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>She was about to say something when Qi Yuan beside her spoke up: "Fairy Qiong, earlier today, didn't you say that if I attended the Divine Infant Banquet, you and Wang Yunteng would lend me some spirit stones to help me out of my urgent need?</p><p></p><p>I won't beat around the bush. I've already said the congratulatory words. When will Fairy Qiong bring out the spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very direct, getting straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>He planned to borrow the money and leave.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting was stunned, not expecting Qi Yuan to bring this up so directly. His face was really thick.</p><p></p><p>Was this really someone from the East Land Young Genius Ranking?</p><p></p><p>"Your Jiang family's business in Cloud Sky City has encountered some problems. Lingsu and I are sisters, so if you need anything, I will definitely help. How much do you need to borrow? Your elder sister will certainly do her best to help you solve your difficulties!" Qiong Yunting said with a smile, appearing quite gracious.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators all looked at Qi Yuan with strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>He came to borrow money?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I've calculated. The Wang family's assets are worth about 1 billion spirit stones, and the Qiong family is worth 50 million.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, you're a bit poor, with few spirit stones, so I won't ask for too much. Just lend me 1.05 billion spirit stones." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, many people on the scene drew in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>This guy... was he here to borrow spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>It seemed more like he was here to cause trouble!

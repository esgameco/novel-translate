        <h1>Chapter 201</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To Qi Yuan's surprise, quite a few people signed up for this selection to enter the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>For these villagers, entering the ancestral land was almost certain death. </p><p></p><p>Yet, over fifty people still signed up.</p><p></p><p>This was very unexpected for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the end, eight people were chosen to enter the ancestral land, including Village Chief Yu Lu, Shaman Shen Tu, Shi Zhongshan from Stone Family Village, Chen Xifan from Chen Xi Village, Zhu Zhuangshi and others.</p><p></p><p>These people were all prominent figures in Qi Yuan's fief.</p><p></p><p>They were all selected to go to the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid of death?" One day, Qi Yuan casually asked these eight people in front of the temple.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi shrugged: "Compared to death, I'm more afraid of being pressed down by a big black dog for life!"</p><p></p><p>As a member of the ancient clan, Zhu Zhuangshi naturally knew the dangers of entering the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>The death rate of True God Venerables in the ancestral land exceeded 50%, and even Great Venerable level powerhouses had many instances of perishing there.</p><p></p><p>If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs?</p><p></p><p>If he didn't even have the courage to enter the ancestral land with the divine lord, how could he hope for the divine lord to be merciful and grant them the method of observing gods?</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhu, don't insult my sworn brother!" Shi Zhongshan defended the big black dog beside him.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked at Shi Zhongshan with disgust: "If I'm lucky enough to get the method of observing gods this time, you'll be worse than pigs and dogs!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present laughed.</p><p></p><p>The fear of going to the ancestral land also dissipated a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since the entrance to the ancestral land has opened, let's not dilly-dally. We should... go quickly and return quickly!" Qi Yuan was always a man of action. Once he made a plan, he would strive to implement it.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu took a deep breath from his dry tobacco pipe and placed it in the corner of the temple wall.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers were also in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Great Venerable Thunder God: "It will take one or two days at the fastest, four or five days at the slowest. I'll be back soon. Please take care of Qingshui Village, Old Deng."</p><p></p><p>"Is 'Old Deng' really meant as a term of respect?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Cultivators don't lie to cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded seriously, very sincerely, "Before you kill someone, shout 'Old Deng is coming', it's very imposing!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man will reluctantly believe you then." Great Venerable Thunder God patted his sleeves. Looking at Qi Yuan who was about to leave, he was moved to say:</p><p></p><p>"May you be like the stars, brilliant and shining across the sky."</p><p></p><p>Above the myriad worlds, the stars and moon were clear, the Milky Way in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Why suddenly so poetic? Were you a literary youth when you were young?" Qi Yuan looked at Great Venerable Thunder God suspiciously, then said, "I'm not cultured, so I'll just wish you great wealth and immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Who are you cursing? My family only has ten thousand taels?" Great Venerable Thunder God looked at Qi Yuan with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Too greedy." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>After saying goodbye to Great Venerable Thunder God and others, Qi Yuan followed Village Chief Yu Lu and Shaman Shen Tu to an ancient well in the north of the village.</p><p></p><p>The well was so deep that the bottom couldn't be seen. The well rim was glowing with a faint light, looking quite eerie at night.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu, dressed in a green robe, stepped forward and dropped a drop of blood into the well.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the faint light flared up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a strong spatial fluctuation coming.</p><p></p><p>"A teleportation formation?" Qi Yuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>Because in the Canglan Realm, he had seen many formations, but had never seen a teleportation formation before.</p><p></p><p>The movement ahead made him feel similar to the teleportation formations in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu, with his white beard, nodded: "This is a teleportation formation left over from ancient times. It can teleport to the ancestral land."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's curiosity grew: "What's the principle behind the teleportation formation? Is it the law of space?"</p><p></p><p>This was what Qi Yuan was particularly curious about.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Canglan Realm, he had been curious about why there were no teleportation formations.</p><p></p><p>He had asked Sect Leader True Lord Withered Wood, and the answer given was that the Dao of Space could only be controlled by Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>On the Wangyue Continent, he had also seen teleportation formations in the Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>He had a higher evaluation of that lofty Moon God Monarch.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shaman Shen Tu answered: "Teleportation formations have nothing to do with the law of space."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused, "Isn't controlling the law of space about tearing open space to escape?"</p><p></p><p>"Tearing open space leads to the Great Void. Entering the Great Void with a physical body will be dissolved by it.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a True God can also condense a primordial spirit, and the primordial spirit can enter the Great Void when it leaves the body.</p><p></p><p>The Great Void can't be used for traveling. In fact, walking for ten years in the Great Void is not as far as walking for one day in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The place entered by teleportation formations is called the Dark Void. It's the opposite of the Great Void. The coordinates inside correspond one-to-one with the mortal world, but the distances are extremely short." Shaman Shen Tu explained seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan understood somewhat.</p><p></p><p>On a plane, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Void is like folding the paper to make the two points closer.</p><p></p><p>It seemed a bit like the wormholes in Qi Yuan's memory.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know so much as a small Element Core cultivator? Are you an NPC specifically for explanations?" Qi Yuan looked at Shen Tu playfully.</p><p></p><p>"As a shaman, these inherited memories come naturally." Shen Tu explained.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, this is your setting. Everyone has their own setting, in games and in reality." Qi Yuan sighed, "Let's go, enter the teleportation formation and take a look."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the more than ten people present all entered the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt that everyone present seemed to be wrapped in a transparent membrane.</p><p></p><p>Following the transparent membrane, he looked out, and it was pitch black outside.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Dark Void, without any light or sound." Shen Tu sighed.</p><p></p><p>It was also his first time using a teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Generally, cultivators gain night vision ability at a certain level, allowing them to see things even without light.</p><p></p><p>But this doesn't work in the Dark Void. Even cultivators can't see or hear anything.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that could be heard was the communication between people in the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked around and saw nothing but darkness.</p><p></p><p>[Teleportation formation, special artifact, able to walk in the Dark Void.]</p><p></p><p>All he could see was the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Unable to see the true Dark Void through the teleportation formation, he couldn't obtain useful information.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes and listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>With his vision blocked, what about sound? His ears, in the Canglan Realm, could hear the voice of Ning Tao from the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, several urgent voices entered Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"The Tama people will never be slaves!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, we've discovered a world ahead, let's hurry and occupy it to sell. With my savings from the past tens of thousands of years, I should be able to gather enough for little Ning's tuition!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity it's not a primordial world. Primordial worlds can be placed inside the body."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, real men are just born that way. How can they compare to creations researched over countless generations?"</p><p></p><p>The voices were urgent, appearing quickly and disappearing quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes, with curiosity in them.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few people in this Dark Void." He looked at the Dark Void, but unfortunately couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>The villagers around him looked at each other in confusion when they heard this: "Divine Lord, where are there people?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Dark Void." The voices Qi Yuan had just heard came from the Dark Void.</p><p></p><p>They sounded quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, a faint light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others' journey was ending, about to emerge from the Dark Void and enter the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Is everyone here?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the ancestral land of the ancient clan, a burly man spoke, looking fierce and evil.</p><p></p><p>A pair of twin sisters, ancient goddesses, stood a little distance from the burly man. The elder sister looked at the hazy ancestral land ahead: "We're still missing one."</p><p></p><p>More than thirteen ancient gods had gathered here, all guardian gods of the ancient clan, or unknown ancient gods who had entered the ancestral land through the ancient clan's methods.</p><p></p><p>They stood in twos and threes, not looking very familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister's gaze swept over everyone, finally landing on a man in white robes: "It seems Ancient God Yan Xi's cultivation has improved. This time he actually brought three attendants."</p><p></p><p>Almost none of the ancient gods present had brought attendants.</p><p></p><p>They could barely protect themselves in the ancestral land, bringing attendants would only be sending them to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral land changed in an instant, so attendants wouldn't be used as expendables to scout ahead. Therefore, almost no True Gods would bring them.</p><p></p><p>Those who wanted to bring them did so because their attendants were stuck at the peak of the Purple Palace realm, unable to break through, hoping to find supreme treasures in the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Some supreme treasures, once taken out, might only be able to stay for less than a hundred breaths, so they needed to bring attendants.</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Yan Xi glanced at the younger twin sister, with an indescribable look in his eyes: "I was lucky to break through to the second step of Treading Heaven. In this ancestral land, I can only barely survive."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Yan Xi had broken through to the second step of Treading Heaven, more than ten ancient gods present</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>All the gods looked at Yan Xi once more.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, the Two Steps to Heaven technique was considered top-tier.</p><p></p><p>The older twin sister suddenly frowned, then relaxed her brow: "It seems Yan Xi the Ancient God is very confident this time."</p><p></p><p>Those present exchanged polite greetings, then fell silent. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the older twin sister transmitted a message to her younger sister: "Elder Yan Xi's situation doesn't look good."</p><p></p><p>The younger sister glanced at the three attendants beside Elder Yan Xi and said coldly: "Those three must be the Arrogant Supreme Lord's lackeys!"</p><p></p><p>The Arrogant Supreme Lord was once an Ancient God, but later became a New God.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral land of the Ancient Clan had four entrances, three of which were controlled by the Arrogant Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>Only one entrance remained in the hands of the Ancient Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Arrogant Supreme Lord wanted to uncover the secrets of the ancestral land, so he surrounded three sides but left one.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that the Arrogant Supreme Lord seemed close to uncovering the ancestral land's secrets, so he was preparing to take control of the last entrance and fully possess the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity we can't leave for now, and news from here can't be sent out," the younger sister said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"We can barely protect ourselves. Who knows which of these Ancient Gods have already sided with the Arrogant Supreme Lord?" the older sister sighed. "Once we enter the ancestral land, stay away from Elder Yan Xi."</p><p></p><p>The ancestral land of the Ancient Clan was located in the central region of the southern territory.</p><p></p><p>In this place, the power of the Evil Gods slightly surpassed that of the Ancient Gods, but not by much.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a faint light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a group of over ten people appeared in grand fashion.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods present were all momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"How... how are there suddenly so many mortals?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>As the newcomers arrived, they casually scanned and only detected two with divine auras.</p><p></p><p>The rest had none and appeared to be mere mortals.</p><p></p><p>This grand procession was, of course, Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He looked at those present and couldn't help saying: "Don't tell me... I'm the last to arrive again?"</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister, being more straightforward, looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help asking: "Ancient God, why did you bring so many people?"</p><p></p><p>The others were also very curious.</p><p></p><p>If he had brought powerful experts, that would have been fine.</p><p></p><p>But most of these were only at the Elemental Core or Divine Embryo stage.</p><p></p><p>"There's strength in numbers," Qi Yuan casually replied.</p><p></p><p>The previous burly black man flashed a mouthful of white teeth: "You've brought far too many people. Didn't you do your homework before coming? The ancestral land is extremely dangerous. </p><p></p><p>Don't tell me you want to imitate some ignorant people and use your subjects as expendable scouts?"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of dissatisfaction in the burly black man's words, as if he was criticizing Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is it very dangerous here?" Qi Yuan looked at the hazy ancestral land ahead.</p><p></p><p>The burly black man said solemnly: "Very dangerous. Even True Gods have a high chance of perishing inside.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral land changes in an instant. Using people as scouts is useless. Bringing these subjects... is just sending them to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>How about this - give me three of your subjects, and I'll give you a Yin God artifact in return."</p><p></p><p>The burly black man felt he could protect at most three mortals, so he was moved by compassion.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he rather despised Ancient Gods like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "Following you would be the real danger."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ancestral land, and his left eyebrow suddenly twitched: "As they say, when the left eye twitches it means wealth, when the right eye twitches it means disaster. This time when we enter... I'll make a fortune."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, his eyes revealed a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this time, there was a chance of success.</p><p></p><p>The burly black man glanced at Qi Yuan and said with displeasure: "Your eyebrow can predict fortune and misfortune? Come, make a prediction for this lord."</p><p></p><p>He naturally felt Qi Yuan was trying to fool him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't look at the burly black man, but instead swept his gaze over the Ancient Gods present, his mouth twisting.</p><p></p><p>"Meeting like this is fate. I'll be a free fortune teller and make predictions for you all.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this is my first time divining for True Gods."</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner, conveying the dialogue and events described in the original Chinese text.]</p>

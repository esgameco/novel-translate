        <h1>Chapter 506</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside Fengshan County, the mountains and rivers stretched endlessly, creating a captivating scenery.</p><p></p><p>"This river is called the Weishui River. During the rainy season, it is sixty zhang wide, with its source originating from the Yeshan Lake."</p><p></p><p>The cliffs on both banks were steep, with winding paths snaking down to the rushing Weishui River below.</p><p></p><p>Thorns and wild grasses grew abundantly, reaching up to half a person's height.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the Weishui River, one could occasionally see boats passing by.</p><p></p><p>"If I were a poet, I would be unable to resist composing a poem upon seeing this scenery. </p><p>Alas, I am but a kitchen knife, and I only wish to slaughter fish."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but be moved by the sight, sighing wistfully.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had no homesickness or a sense of being unappreciated, so he couldn't compose any poetry.</p><p></p><p>"The taste of fish meat buns must be delicious!" Chen Kangbao said.</p><p></p><p>He was constantly preoccupied with thoughts of food.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked towards the Weishui River, his eyes gleaming with excitement: "I've heard that in the Yeshan Lake above the Weishui River, there is a Water Lord, whose true form is a giant fish. Its taste must be exquisite."</p><p></p><p>"Whenever we have the chance, we should capture it and have a chef prepare fish meat buns for you," Qi Yuan casually remarked.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a crisp voice rang out, carrying a hint of coquettishness: "Sir, you dare to speak so boldly. The Water Lord of Yeshan Lake has already reached the peak of the Earth Realm, commanding the waters of Yeshan Prefecture. Even if a legendary Heaven Realm Armament Master were to come, they would be unable to slay it."</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, two graceful figures, one tall and one petite, appeared.</p><p></p><p>Both had a light veil covering their faces, obscuring their true features.</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke was small in stature but exuded a sense of wealth, her youthful appearance belying her mature figure.</p><p></p><p>The taller one wore a long, black dress, embroidered with golden threads, exuding an extraordinary elegance. Her figure was curvaceous, with a slender waist and a blooming, untouchable beauty.</p><p></p><p>Although their faces were hidden, with such an exceptional physique, their appearance was already beyond question.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, my young master is a divine being descended from the heavens. How dare that Water Lord be so arrogant?" Chen Kangbao couldn't help but retort.</p><p></p><p>The petite woman's laughter rang out like silver bells, crisp and clear: "The Water Lord now resides in Yeshan Lake. If your young master is truly so capable, why doesn't he go to Yeshan Lake and slay that Water Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"How my young master chooses to act is his own decision." </p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm afraid you're just boasting and are too afraid to actually do it!" the petite woman sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, be calm," the tall woman spoke, her voice frigid and icy.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Chen Kangbao felt a chill, as if a late summer frost had descended.</p><p></p><p>This icy coldness was bone-piercing and sharp.</p><p></p><p>If Zhi Shuang's coldness was merely skin-deep, then this woman's coldness froze to the bone.</p><p></p><p>Just her voice alone evoked this sensation.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan sigh in admiration, truly acknowledging the extraordinary world they were in.</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, he had heard alluring, childish, and mature voices, but never one that felt so tangibly icy.</p><p></p><p>"Sister... " the petite woman said, her voice tinged with a hint of distress, but she dared not argue with her sister.</p><p></p><p>It was clear she greatly feared her.</p><p></p><p>The tall woman then turned to Qi Yuan: "If you two are determined to slay the Water Lord, you should consider participating in the upcoming Forging Competition."</p><p></p><p>Her voice remained cold and detached, enough to overshadow the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go if I have the time," Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>He had been too busy lately, and his sleep quality had not been good.</p><p></p><p>The petite woman looked at Qi Yuan with disdain, feeling that he was just boasting.</p><p></p><p>"We shall take our leave." The icy woman's voice was like a frozen spring in the snowy mountains.</p><p></p><p>She turned and left with the petite woman.</p><p></p><p>"Beautiful lady, please wait!" At this moment, Qi Yuan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The petite woman blushed: "You scoundrel, how dare you address me in such a way?"</p><p></p><p>"I wasn't calling you. I was calling the one beside you," Qi Yuan clarified.</p><p></p><p>"You!" The petite woman puffed up, her veiled face looking even more adorable in her anger.</p><p></p><p>"What did you wish to say, sir?" The icy woman's voice was polite, yet carried a faint air of detachment.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in need of a mount. I think you... look quite suitable. Would you consider becoming my mount?" Qi Yuan made the invitation, looking at the icy woman earnestly.</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao couldn't help but shiver from the chill.</p><p></p><p>The icy woman's eyes held an even greater icy chill.</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying?" The petite woman was like an explosive, nearly leaping up.</p><p></p><p>A mount? This person actually said such words, insulting her sister.</p><p></p><p>"Consider it, with benefits like social insurance, room and board, excellent treatment, and opportunities for promotion. If you perform well, you could even be promoted from a mount to a personal maid," Qi Yuan offered generous terms.</p><p></p><p>Such treatment would likely attract hordes of university students on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>The icy woman's gaze remained cold and indifferent. She did not speak further, but simply turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The petite woman quickly followed after her sister.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, these two are so impolite, leaving without even a word," Chen Kangbao lamented on Qi Yuan's behalf.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, you've overestimated the world. People with my level of social intelligence are a rare resource," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the petite woman heard this and nearly stumbled, becoming extremely incensed.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the petite woman sat on a boat, hands on her hips: "These two are truly outrageous, not only arrogant and conceited, but also foul-mouthed. If my sister hadn't held me back, I would have hooked them and used them as fishing bait!"</p><p></p><p>"Why bother arguing with a madman," the icy woman's voice was cold.</p><p></p><p>"Madman?" The petite woman paused, then recalled the earlier events. "So they were both madmen?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, she felt quite exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Getting angry over madmen was utterly irrational.</p><p></p><p>The icy woman's voice carried a hint of suspicion: "It seems they were heading towards Kunling Ferry."</p><p></p><p>"Kunling Ferry?" The petite woman furrowed her brows.</p><p></p><p>She and her sister disembarked the boat and headed towards Kunling Ferry, as instructed by their master.</p><p></p><p>According to their master, the Thorny Blood of the Evil Sect had been particularly active recently, and she was concerned there might be something amiss at the Kunling Ferry, which was a place of spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After investigating, the icy woman and the petite woman found everything to be normal at Kunling Ferry.</p><p></p><p>"Could they be from the Thorny Blood?" the petite woman said, her eyes gleaming with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"No, the old monsters of the Thorny Blood have mostly discarded their human forms, becoming neither human nor ghost. That madman earlier, though his words were rude, still had a rather handsome appearance," the petite woman shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... it was just a coincidence," the icy woman said faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, will you be staying at the manor tonight when you return home?" the petite woman asked, her face lighting up with excitement. "I'd love to see your husband... hehe."</p><p></p><p>"No need, the situation at Yeshan Lake is grave. After retrieving the Golden Xuanshi Stone from Father, we will return to Yeshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>As for him, he should be at the manor now, so you can go see him," the icy woman replied, her voice indifferent.</p><p></p><p>When mentioning her husband, she spoke of him as if he were a stranger.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had never even met him.</p><p></p><p>But given her icy nature, she was not nervous about it either.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he... is good-looking, otherwise it would be too much of a bargain for him!" the petite woman said, stealing a glance at her sister.</p><p></p><p>The sister remained silent, serene and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kunling Ferry. The water was misty, a branch of the Wei River.</p><p></p><p>The aquatic plants were not verdant green, but rather pitch-black, making it particularly frightening.</p><p></p><p>It was as if human hair was constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Fengshan County Annals' records that in the 7th year of the Tian'yuan era, there was a great flood, and Kunling Ferry was submerged, with 75 households completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>At first, everyone thought Kunling Ferry was flooded by a flood, a natural disaster.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that later, the place of spirit cultivation was exposed, and everyone realized that this was not a natural disaster, but a man-made calamity.</p><p></p><p>The thorns and blood were used to create the spirit cultivation site, cultivating strange spirits, and then releasing the water to flood Kunling Ferry."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao recounted calmly, without sorrow or joy.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying that the strange spirits here were originally the residents of Kunling Ferry?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this was originally a ferry, and the people living here were mostly dock workers earning a living," Chen Kangbao continued, "A day's hard labor could barely feed a family, they couldn't even afford a few more steamed buns, how pitiful."</p><p></p><p>"It does seem quite difficult to enter." Qi Yuan looked at Kunling Ferry, sensing many strange spirits lurking within.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Hongyan Stronghold, there were many more.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, Kunling Ferry was filled with miasmas and poisonous gases, ordinary people could not enter.</p><p></p><p>The muddy ground concealed various dangers.</p><p></p><p>Even an unbreakable Earth-grade Armored Soldier might easily become trapped there.</p><p></p><p>Likely, only a Heavenly-grade Armored Soldier could easily enter.</p><p></p><p>The miasmas and poisons within were also extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to refine some anti-poison masks and large drones, then go in," Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>Now, for him to directly enter would be troublesome and a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master is mighty!" Chen Kangbao continued to flatter.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a closer look at what other dangers there are, then we'll deal with them all together," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The biggest challenge with Kunling Ferry was entering it.</p><p></p><p>He needed to carefully observe with his own eyes what difficulties he would face upon entering, then find solutions.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he would return to the Shen Mansion, purchase materials, and refine countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>After about a few hours, night had fallen deeply, but Qi Yuan did not return to the Shen Mansion. Instead, he went to the Ghost Market.</p><p></p><p>After purchasing the prepared materials, he continued to set up his stall.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I'm short on money, so short on money!" Qi Yuan sighed, "If only there was a kind of 'white moonlight' in this world, that was both wealthy and could provide experience..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The strange spirits were all poor, only able to provide experience points.</p><p></p><p>He was lacking in silver, very lacking.</p><p></p><p>Buying a pile of materials was good, but his silver was already running out.</p><p></p><p>To earn some pocket money, he had no choice but to continue operating his stall and making money.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his business was very poor, he had not seen any foolish rich young masters like Tu Sanguizi.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, could it be that the talismans I refine are really... not good enough?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask in doubt.</p><p></p><p>After all, on TV, the male lead's fried rice bowl was selling for thousands, and it was in such high demand that it could not be met.</p><p></p><p>The male lead would wave away customers with a cold expression, like a god.</p><p></p><p>But looking at himself, even the sound in the audio had been changed to a sweet voice, yet no one came to buy his things.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the world is ignorant and does not recognize true goods," Chen Kangbao said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"If you're not ignorant, then why don't you buy it?" Qi Yuan stared at Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, Young Master, you're not making it easy for this old servant, am I? This old servant may not be ignorant, and my wisdom is astounding, but this old servant has no money!" Chen Kangbao said embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>"If you're not ignorant, how come you have no money?"</p><p></p><p>"...They were just lucky!" Chen Kangbao seemed to be making excuses.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a surprised voice rang out: "Sister, quickly look, those two lunatics!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a faint, fragrant aura mixed with a cold chill permeated the air, like a snow lotus, and two women, one tall and one small, appeared on the banks of the Wei River.</p><p></p><p>The petite woman curiously looked at the items on Qi Yuan's stall, unable to hold back a tsk-tsk sound: "You're still a talisman master... it's just that your skills aren't very good, what kind of junk is this you've made?"</p><p></p><p>Normally, when leaving the Shen Mansion, Qi Yuan would use Thousand Changes and Transformations to change his appearance with Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was playing the role of a son-in-law, and if the Shen Mansion people saw him acting arrogantly outside, wouldn't he become the Dragon King's son-in-law?</p><p></p><p>He was playing the role of a son-in-law, not the Dragon King's son-in-law, getting them mixed up wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>So, in the Ghost Market, the petite woman recognized Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the strange and bizarre items on the stall, her gaze critical, but when her eyes fell on the audio, a gleam of delight flashed in them: "This, at least it can produce sound, it's somewhat interesting."</p><p></p><p>"You two ladies, would you like to buy some talismans?" The currently penniless Qi Yuan wore a smile, "My stall may have just opened for three days, but business is very good, averaging 3,000 taels of silver in sales per day!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was skilled at using statistical methods.</p><p></p><p>"What, 3,000 taels a day?" The petite woman exclaimed, "You're not trying to trick us, are you?"</p><p></p><p>3,000 taels could buy a Mysterious-grade talisman, and not just any ordinary Mysterious-grade talisman.</p><p></p><p>On this stall, there were a pile of talismans, most of which had no grade, and none had any certification.</p><p></p><p>All of these things added together probably wouldn't even reach 1,000 taels, yet they were sold for 9,000 taels?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this brother is not lying to you," the neighboring stall owner chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Since he saw Qi Yuan setting up his stall in the Ghost Market again, he had become more polite and close to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the first day, Qi Yuan had earned 10,000 taels, so he must have attracted the attention of some malicious people.</p><p></p><p>But he was still operating his stall properly, which meant... those with ill intentions had all been dealt with by him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the neighboring stall owner's words, the petite woman believed it, and said, "You really are good at lying! I wonder which idiots would spend so much money to buy this junk."</p><p></p><p>With her discerning eye, she could tell that all these things added up were probably only worth around 1,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>"This costs 99 taels!" Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"A bit expensive..." The petite woman sniffed, but still paid the money and bought it, "But this young lady has money, so I'll buy it."</p><p></p><p>She took out the money and bought the audio.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was quite curious about the principles behind it.</p><p></p><p>And she also felt that this audio was quite interesting, and if it could be mass-produced, it might have great use, with hidden business opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Qi Yuan was always respectful towards customers.</p><p></p><p>The icy woman beside her stood quietly like jade, her elegant brows sweeping over the talismans on the stall, slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just then, hurried footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I didn't expect you to be here!" </p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than Tu Sanguizi.</p><p></p><p>He came to the Ghost Market almost every day, but he didn't always encounter Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the big customer, Qi Yuan's smile became even more amiable: "What, you also want the other two light swords? Today I'm in a good mood, there's a discount, only 21,998 taels of silver, you can buy both light swords."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the petite woman stared wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>The idiot has arrived?</p><p></p><p>10,000 taels of silver... to buy a Yellow-grade talisman?

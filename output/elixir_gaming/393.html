        <h1>Chapter 393</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The sky was filled with countless stars, solemn and profound. </p><p></p><p>Each star's projection represented a terrifying deity.</p><p></p><p>The radiance of the sun shone brilliantly, dazzling to behold.</p><p></p><p>Among all the celestial stars, it may not have been the most powerful, but it was certainly the most eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The starry realm trembled. </p><p></p><p>All the star projections shook in this instant.</p><p></p><p>Countless mythical beings sensed something and looked up at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Has a Venerable One ascended to a divine throne?"</p><p></p><p>"How enviable!"</p><p></p><p>"When will this old man be able to do the same!"</p><p></p><p>These mythical beings all served Venerable Ones who had granted them the qualification to reflect across the heavens, with their own stars, which is why they could sense it.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the abyss, unknown lands, the Celestial Hanging Sea... within the Six Heavens, in sacred grounds.</p><p></p><p>Many Yang Spirit Venerable Ones looked up with surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>"A new divine position has appeared?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder who has ascended to a divine throne."</p><p></p><p>"There are fewer and fewer divine positions available."</p><p></p><p>Yang Spirits reflecting across the heavens was different from mythical beings.</p><p></p><p>It required a definite divine position. </p><p></p><p>Generally, this position was obtained by chance and opportunity, or through exchange of benefits, or... forceful seizure.</p><p></p><p>Forceful seizure was very rare.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Spirits with divine positions and those without was like the difference between Yang Spirits of the same level, one with a primordial treasure and one without.</p><p></p><p>The gap was enormous.</p><p></p><p>Those with the power to seize a position by force could obtain one without needing to do so.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, a Yang Spirit Venerable One narrowed his eyes, revealing a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun... the Solar position... this fellow cultivator has gone mad, daring to seize the position of that one in the Sixth Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Many Yang Spirits who were paying attention to the starry realm were either surprised and amused, or horrified.</p><p></p><p>For so many years, they had not seen any fellow cultivator dare to forcibly seize a divine position.</p><p></p><p>Now, they finally saw one, and the result was... he went for a big one! That one in the Sixth Heaven, seated in the Taihuang Palace, was an absolute powerhouse among the Yang Spirits of the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>For an unascended Yang Spirit to dare challenge him was truly... suicidal!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I thought it was an ancient powerhouse, but it turns out... he's quite ordinary, just with an oversized ego!" a blue-robed Yang Spirit spoke, looking at the small new sun that had appeared in the starry realm.</p><p></p><p>That star also represented the Great Sun divine position.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the Great Sun of Taihuang Palace, it was far too small.</p><p></p><p>"What a farce!"</p><p></p><p>"How laughable!"</p><p></p><p>"If the one from Taihuang Palace takes action, no matter which heaven he hides in, there will be no chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>That blue-robed Yang Spirit, as if having watched an amusing show, now prepared to continue his secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up at the starry realm again, his eyes revealing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"Two... Great Suns." The blue-robed Yang Spirit was very curious, "He has some ability, but not much.</p><p></p><p>With this level of power, he could easily obtain a divine position, yet he dares to challenge the one from Taihuang Palace, truly not knowing his own..."</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, another sun was reflected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed the words he was about to say.</p><p></p><p>"Three Great Sun stars, how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Not all star projections were qualified to obtain divine positions.</p><p></p><p>For instance, the star projections of mythical powerhouses could not.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary Yang Spirit Venerable One, even with lucky encounters throughout their life, could only grasp one star projection bearing a divine position.</p><p></p><p>These three... what did it mean? However, his expression changed drastically in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Only to see among the myriad stars, one Great Sun after another rising in succession.</p><p></p><p>It was like the majestic scene of "A lonely smoke rises straight in the desert, A long river of setting sun rounds in the sky", but on a cosmic scale.</p><p></p><p>One round sun after another rose up, each one larger than the last!</p><p></p><p>The dark yet luminous starry realm flashed with waves of light as the Great Suns rose.</p><p></p><p>Four!</p><p></p><p>Five!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Until... ten!</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad stars of the heavens, ten stars bearing the Great Sun divine position had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>These ten Great Sun divine positions represented ten suns!</p><p></p><p>"The sky cannot have two suns, the battle for the divine position... has begun!" The blue-robed Yang Spirit gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>If before he had looked down on the Yang Spirit seizing the Great Sun divine position,</p><p></p><p>Now, he felt that he himself was too old, having lost his grand ambitions.</p><p></p><p>A Yang Spirit capable of condensing ten star projections bearing the Great Sun divine position was extremely rare since the beginning of the world.</p><p></p><p>And such Yang Spirits, which one had not... ascended to the Nine Heavens?</p><p></p><p>Now, this mysterious Yang Spirit had launched an attack on the Great Sun divine position, declaring war.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Heaven... would no longer be peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Taihuang Palace... had trouble on its hands.</p><p></p><p>But then he paused again.</p><p></p><p>The sky cannot have two suns, but what if this mysterious Yang Spirit... won?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean... there would be ten suns in the sky?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>That old mythical being wiped his sweat, looking at the suns in the sky: "This old man's eyes must be failing, how come there are ten suns in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>The other mythical beings also looked at the celestial stars, their expressions shocked.</p><p></p><p>An old man, shocked in his heart, couldn't help but say: "This is a Venerable One... challenging Taihuang Palace's Great Sun divine position!"</p><p></p><p>The other mythical beings were inwardly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Such a major event, they had only seen in records, never witnessed in person.</p><p></p><p>"Ten suns hanging in the sky... damn... no divine position?" A mythical being felt somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One he served, well... compared to these ten suns, was useless, but still had a divine position.</p><p></p><p>But this...</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Taihuang Palace is quite hot, this old man is going back to cool off!" An old mythical being said, then scurried away in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other old mythical beings also stood up one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, the 1786th grandchild of my Venerable One is about to be born, I must go back to see!"</p><p></p><p>These mythical powerhouses were clear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, when the one from Moon Palace was injured, the Venerable Ones they served might have dared to get involved.</p><p></p><p>But now, a fierce character was challenging the divine position of the one from Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The struggle for divine positions was a fight to the death, even more intense than the conflict between Taihuang Palace and Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now, Taihuang Palace would surely slow down its attacks on Moon Palace to deal with that "Ten Suns Venerable One"!</p><p></p><p>If they went to cause trouble for Moon Palace now, wouldn't that be seeking death?</p><p></p><p>These mythical powerhouses left one after another.</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man saw this scene, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... why is it so hot!"</p><p></p><p>He angrily flipped over the table!</p><p></p><p>He didn't care that someone was challenging the divine position of the one from Taihuang Palace, what he cared about was that his... achievements were gone!</p><p></p><p>Across the myriad worlds, in all realms, at this moment, all living beings suddenly saw ten suns appear above their heads.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what had happened, but they knew that something terrifying must have occurred.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Canglang Realm, Qi Yuan's expression was relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Ten suns hanging in the sky, ten versus one, an overwhelming victory.</p><p></p><p>I am younger than the one from Taihuang Palace, victory.</p><p></p><p>I am more handsome than the one from Taihuang Palace, victory!</p><p></p><p>I have a beautiful blood-colored robe that he doesn't have, victory!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used the comparison method familiar to Blue Star, immediately drawing a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I am the true sun, and he is the false one."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When will you fall, arrogant sun?"</p><p></p><p>Now, with ten suns in the sky, Qi Yuan was officially declaring war on the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to wait for more stars, at least a trillion Golden Core stars before ascending. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there were too many unfamiliar stars in the myriad worlds, and he was socially anxious.</p><p></p><p>Now, in order to find the Liufeng Realm, he had to move up his plans.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the myriad worlds are too cold. This cold is not just between people, but also the frigid climate, causing gynecological cold in beauties and impotence in handsome men.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately I've arrived, bringing ten suns. Finally, this world will no longer be cold!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to give a speech.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there weren't enough Golden Cores yet. Otherwise he would have arranged them to spell out the words he wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>Then all living beings in the myriad worlds would be able to see Qi Yuan's slogan.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more regret - there's no black hole sun. All the suns look the same, losing biodiversity. The world is always unchanging, which is too boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>Imagine a world without a sun.</p><p></p><p>Like in "The Wandering Earth", an icy world covered in frost. The people there must really lack sunlight.</p><p></p><p>The background of "The Wandering Earth" is similar to the Blue Star. If Qi Yuan were to give their Earth a sun, considering they're half-compatriots, he definitely wouldn't give them an ordinary sun, but a black hole sun.</p><p></p><p>The people of "The Wandering Earth" would surely be moved, and sing to him "Thank you, because of you, the four seasons are warmed."</p><p></p><p>Putting aside these thoughts, Qi Yuan softly said to the golden canary: "Hmm, move the sun Golden Core a bit closer to that star. It's too dim, not bright enough."</p><p></p><p>Within the stellar Golden Core, Ning Tao opened her eyes, with a hint of resentment in her expression. But she still nodded gently: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the stellar Golden Core in the sky wandered through the star realm, heading towards that dim and ordinary star.</p><p></p><p>Moon God Palace, frontline battlefield, Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Sun God Celestial Venerable sat in a mysterious place, looking at the ten stars in the star realm, with a delighted smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly... a great joy!"</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Sovereign was injured recently, which couldn't be concealed.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't know why the Moon God Sovereign had left the Moon God Palace, the injuries were real.</p><p></p><p>Once this news spread, the Tai Huang Palace would definitely take the opportunity to unite with other forces and launch an attack on the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>But now, suddenly, there was a Celestial Venerable seeking to forcibly take a Venerable position! And it was the Great Sun Venerable position of Tai Huang Palace! Tai Huang Palace was suddenly mired in a quagmire.</p><p></p><p>This was absolutely great news for the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>With Tai Huang Palace in trouble, the other fence-sitters definitely wouldn't get involved.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on the Moon God Palace was reduced.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Sun God Celestial Venerable's expression suddenly changed slightly: "These ten suns... seem to be coming towards the star realm where my Moon God Palace is located."</p><p></p><p>Then she thought of something: "Could it be a friend of the Moon God Sovereign? No, all Great Sun Venerables are enemies!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun and Moon God Sovereign positions were in conflict and opposed to each other.</p><p></p><p>For either to advance to a higher level, they must become Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>But one side was destined to become a sacrifice, to achieve the other's advancement.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Great Sun and Moon God Sovereign were irreconcilable enemies.</p><p></p><p>The Sun God Celestial Venerable's expression became complex: "If he achieves the Great Sun Venerable position, he will be an even more terrifying enemy of the Moon God Palace, alas..."</p><p></p><p>With a thousand worries in her heart, she stopped thinking and cast aside these anxieties.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Demon Abyss was black and deep red, deep red and becoming bright.</p><p></p><p>Mist permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>In an elegant room, a strong smell of blood lingered, along with a faint fragrance.</p><p></p><p>The woman brushed aside her black hair, revealing a white robe stained red with blood. The white was elegant and simple, without elaborate decorations, with only an exquisite jade ornament hanging from the waistband.</p><p></p><p>As her clothes fell away, the blood-stained white robe dropped to the ground, and the woman bathed.</p><p></p><p>Above the water surface were shoulders like white porcelain, and a collarbone like a crescent moon, naturally sensual, with a few drops of water resting on it. Below the water, perhaps due to the temperature, her jade-like skin flushed red.</p><p></p><p>The woman held the exquisite jade ornament, a look of loss flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't remember how many years it had been since the jade ornament had lit up.</p><p></p><p>Every time she returned from killing enemies, she would bathe and stare at the jade ornament.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she was waiting, hoping that like in the past, the jade ornament would light up again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a communication jade slip lit up.</p><p></p><p>It was a message from her senior sister.</p><p></p><p>"Just returned from killing enemies again?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, after so many years, you're still like this.</p><p>Wanting to accumulate enough merits to ask the Moon God Sovereign to act once, how could it be so simple?"</p><p></p><p>"It's already more than half done, very soon." The young woman clutched the jade ornament tightly, her expression determined and stubborn.</p><p></p><p>In the past, as an empress, she had preferred to stay out of conflicts. If not for his help, pushing her forward, she might have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>But after returning to the Moon God Palace, she changed. She knew she couldn't be like that anymore.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming stronger, only by accumulating merits, could she ask the Moon God Sovereign to act once, to see him who had stood with her under the ancient Qichi tree, by the July lake, in the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>"You're so busy with accumulating merits, you've fallen far behind the other Moon Maidens. It's very dangerous, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"You're too stubborn. I won't try to persuade you anymore.</p><p>But... the Moon God Sovereign was injured recently, so even if you have enough merits, it may be very difficult to ask her to act!"</p><p></p><p>The cold woman frowned. Her gaze passed through the skylight, through the formations, to the lonely moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The gray-white moonlight fell like snow at night. The woman reached out her hand to catch the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's fortunate that the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable has appeared, otherwise our Moon God Palace... would be in great difficulty."</p><p></p><p>The Ten Suns Celestial Venerable - the woman knew of this mysterious powerful figure who had just appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she suddenly sensed something and looked up at the myriad stars, at her own star that reflected across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Her beautiful eyes contracted slightly, because she... saw ten suns.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a message came through the communication jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see? The star projection of the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable has come to the area of our Moon God Palace, seemingly very close to you."</p><p></p><p>The woman stared blankly at the starry sky. Perhaps because the ten round suns were approaching her star projection, she felt some heat.</p><p></p><p>The light of her star also seemed to brighten a bit.</p><p></p><p>"I see it." She looked at her own delicate and well-proportioned palm, and saw the light of the ten great suns fall into her palm, warm and nourishing.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't stop, and is coming towards our Moon God Palace's star realm. It seems there really is cooperation with the Moon God Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, the ten suns left the young woman's sight, moving in another direction.</p><p></p><p>But the sunlight that had inadvertently fallen into the young woman's hand was still cupped there.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, perhaps it was the cool breeze, or perhaps it was the momentary sunlight, she suddenly remembered the second sentence that Qi Yuan had once had the red-armored wedding dress bring to her.</p><p></p><p>"If I see you..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a look of joy flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes, mixed with a hint of loss.</p><p></p><p>"Don't linger. She still can't... be too close to me now."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't... ascended yet!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

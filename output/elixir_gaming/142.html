        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A glint of murderous intent flashed in the depths of the red-bearded elder's eyes: "Very good, very good. The Hundred Countries have produced a Purple Mansion cultivator. This is truly a momentous event."</p><p></p><p>Inside the jade-white palace, murderous intent also welled up in the eyes of the three Purple Mansion cultivators and dozens of Divine Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The tiny Hundred Countries region luckily produced one Purple Mansion cultivator and now doesn't know its place, daring to declare war on our Radiant Palace. What an enormous joke!" The Purple Mansion powerhouse Black Rope had always been hot-tempered.</p><p></p><p>This time, the three of them were in charge of overseeing the great war against the Hundred Countries. </p><p></p><p>How could they not be angry now that they were being provoked by a small country cultivator who had luckily broken through to the Purple Mansion realm? The Radiant Palace had dozens of Purple Mansion powerhouses, as well as incomplete Yin Spirit magical artifacts like the Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that as long as no Yin Spirits appeared, who could oppose them? A mere Purple Mansion cultivator daring to challenge the Radiant Palace single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>He was courting death!</p><p></p><p>"This Blood-Robed Sword Saint is truly arrogant. His clansmen should be in Chen Country. Should we send people to capture them and force him to show himself?" At this point, a Divine Infant cultivator spoke up, offering a strategy.</p><p></p><p>"That would be inappropriate. After all, our Radiant Palace is the leader of the righteous path in the Emerald Cloud Continent. How could we do such a thing? It would be disgraceful.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, that Earth Sword Marquis's clansmen are all long gone." Another Divine Infant cultivator spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators present all fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>They had already torn off all pretenses and started the Hundred Countries bloodbath, yet still talked about saving face.</p><p></p><p>"It's just one Purple Mansion cultivator, not worth making a big fuss over. </p><p></p><p>In a few days, if he dares to come, we'll make sure he never leaves." The leading Purple Mansion powerhouse Qian Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>He was a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, with a high status even within the Radiant Palace. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, his disciple was extremely talented, ranked among the top of the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings, and had a very high chance of also entering the Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>His overseeing of the Hundred Countries bloodbath this time was just to add to his prestige.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if the Radiant Palace were to add another Palace Master, his name would definitely be on the list.</p><p></p><p>Once he spoke, the others present stopped discussing.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint was a huge threat to these Divine Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even for ordinary Purple Mansion powerhouses, he needed to be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>But for someone like Qian Yuan at the Purple Mansion level, he wasn't worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>"This lord has another guest to meet. Everyone, attend to your duties." Qian Yuan waved his hand, and the Purple Mansion and Divine Infant cultivators present all departed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the great hall, an elder in purple robes looked worried, his eyes filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The elder's name was Xu Yeli, the Supreme Elder of the Seven Words Sect and their only Purple Mansion powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the eyes of outsiders, Purple Mansion powerhouses were lofty beings who looked down upon the world.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yeli lived a particularly stifled life.</p><p></p><p>Because of... the Radiant Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xu, Elder Qian Yuan is waiting for you in the great hall." At this moment, a Divine Infant cultivator walked out from the great hall.</p><p></p><p>As a Purple Mansion powerhouse, Xu Yeli's expression changed, transforming into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"This old man will go see Brother Qian Yuan right away."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli said as he walked towards the palace ahead.</p><p></p><p>A few breaths of time passed, and Xu Yeli entered the palace. He looked at the imposing man seated high up and spoke with a hint of respect: "I wonder why Brother Qian Yuan has summoned this old man?"</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan sat on a white jade chair, with dignified features and eyes as deep as the stars: "It's been some time since I've seen you, friend. I was idle and thought we could gather for a chat."</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan's so-called "gathering for a chat" was actually an official decree, forcing Xu Yeli to leave his closed-door cultivation and travel thousands of miles to the Radiant Palace.</p><p></p><p>What kind of gathering was this?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli was displeased in his heart but dared not show it: "Indeed, it has been some time."</p><p></p><p>After briefly exchanging pleasantries, Qian Yuan got to the point.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle has been moved up this time?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a little about it." Hearing this, Xu Yeli had an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Words Sect was small in both family and business, with only one Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, the Seven Words Sect's holy son, Xu Yeli's disciple Xu Tongchen, was ranked in the top 30 of the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was extremely talented. When he formed his Golden Core, he had awakened the True Solar Fire!</p><p></p><p>When he manifested his Golden Core, the True Solar Fire incinerated everything, and no one could oppose him.</p><p></p><p>Even Divine Infant level divine abilities couldn't block the True Solar Fire.</p><p></p><p>In the Emerald Cloud Continent, there was always such talk:</p><p></p><p>The Seven Words Sect was limiting Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Tongchen had been born in the Radiant Palace, how could he merely be ranked in the top 30 of the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings? He could have been ranked in the top 10!</p><p></p><p>Once, a Palace Master of the Radiant Palace personally came to the Seven Words Sect, wanting to take Xu Tongchen as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen, remembering his master's kindness, refused that Radiant Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Seven Words Sect formed a grudge with the Radiant Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Tongchen's talent is truly enviable." Qian Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli's heart tightened, and he quickly said: "Huang Tu is ranked 27th on the Prodigy Rankings, while Tongchen is ranked 29th, still a bit behind your disciple."</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Qian Yuan had designs on his disciple again.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu was Qian Yuan's disciple, and also the highest-ranked cultivator from the Emerald Cloud Continent on the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings.</p><p></p><p>"Only 27th, incomparable to your disciple's terrifying talent." Qian Yuan said, lowering his voice, "You should know that with the Eastern Lands Prodigy Rankings being moved up this time, entering the top 20 will bring great opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli's ominous feeling grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Qian Yuan say: "The Seven Words Sect and Radiant Palace both come from the Emerald Cloud Continent, we should support each other.</p><p></p><p>This time, for the top 20 spots, our Radiant Palace must have one.</p><p></p><p>I'll have to trouble you to speak to your disciple Xu Tongchen. During the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle, considering we're from the same continent, he should provide much support to Huang Tu."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qian Yuan revealed his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli's expression became somewhat ugly.</p><p></p><p>Support?</p><p></p><p>That was just a polite way of putting it.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan's meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>When the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle begins, your disciple shouldn't compete for rankings, but assist Huang Tu in entering the top 20 of the Prodigy Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Not assisting? That would be disregarding our relationship.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, I know this matter seems somewhat unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>But I, Qian Yuan, am not an unreasonable person. After our Radiant Palace completes the Hundred Countries bloodbath, we'll gift the Hundred Countries territory to your Seven Words Sect. What do you think?</p><p></p><p>Don't look down on the Hundred Countries territory for seeming poor. It's vast in area, and who knows, there might be some hidden abode left behind by an ancient powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Hundred Countries even produced a Purple Mansion level Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Countries are not bad at all." As Qian Yuan spoke, he casually awarded the Hundred Countries territory to Xu Yeli.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli's expression was solemn. Finally, he said helplessly: "This matter... shall be as you say, Brother."</p><p></p><p>A satisfied smile appeared in Qian Yuan's eyes: "Young people can sometimes be headstrong and like to act on impulse. I hope you can advise your disciple well."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Xu Yeli suppressed the anger in his heart and bid farewell to Qian Yuan, leaving this place.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At this time, on Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu finally snuck out of her wooden hut and knocked on the door of Qi Yuan's brick house.</p><p></p><p>She looked guilty, as if she were having an affair.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, what brings you here?" Qi Yuan was in the middle of perfecting his plan to destroy the Radiant Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint identity had already made an appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was time for the Mad Daoist, Seven Desires Demon Lord, and other alternate identities to make their moves as well.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan played multiple roles himself, planning out his scheme.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, is the Blood-Robed Sword Saint... your alternate identity?" Jiang Lingsu asked in a lowered voice.</p><p></p><p>From Sister Ya Ya, she had already learned about the Blood-Robed Sword Saint using origin divine abilities to slaughter Radiant Palace Divine Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>She had seen the posts made by the Blood-Robed Sword Saint early on.</p><p></p><p>That writing style, that temperament, was exactly the same as her Senior Brother's.</p><p></p><p>Last time, Senior Brother had even borrowed her alternate identity.</p><p></p><p>"No." Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let this disguise be exposed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a small Primordial Core cultivator, how could I be a Purple Mansion powerhouse?" Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Actually, when she first had this guess, she was quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>How could Senior Brother already be at the Purple Mansion realm?</p><p></p><p>Even if Senior Brother was a reincarnated Yin Spirit, it shouldn't be possible for him to return to the Purple Mansion realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Lingsu's suspicious look, Qi Yuan said proudly: "Your wooden hut is small and shabby, with only one room.</p><p></p><p>As it happens, my brick house is now complete, with several side rooms to spare.</p><p></p><p>That sister of yours has nowhere to go at night, so why not come to my brick house? Though small and undecorated, it still has a few benches.</p><p></p><p>If she needs to sleep, we can just tie up some ropes."</p><p></p><p>After becoming a Primordial Core cultivator, Qi Yuan found his thoughts becoming increasingly nimble.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, he was being helpful.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was showing off his brick house to his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>"That won't be necessary." Jiang Lingsu's suspicions completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>According to what Sister Ya Ya said, that senior expert should be a true demonic cultivator, having slaughtered no less than a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>How was Senior Brother's appearance anything like the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Mad Daoist was actually Senior Brother's alternate identity?</p><p></p><p>"What a shame about my newly built house." Qi Yuan sighed. Something occurred to him, and he couldn't help but ask, "Is Jiang Ya really your sister?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course she is." Jiang Lingsu didn't understand why Senior Brother would ask this.</p><p></p><p>"Then why are you as thin as a rail while she's so plump and well-rounded?</p><p></p><p>She looks like she's suffering from malnutrition, while you seem to be over-nourished." Qi Yuan voiced his doubts. As he spoke, he</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, he glanced at the fullness barely concealed by Jiang Lingsu's loose dress.</p><p></p><p>"..." Jiang Lingsu glared at Qi Yuan. A young girl's thought process was sometimes hard to understand. "Are you saying I'm fat?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the girl in front of him and said seriously, "No."</p><p></p><p>His junior sister's figure was just right. </p><p></p><p>The parts that should have flesh had it, and the parts that shouldn't were appropriately slim.</p><p></p><p>If she wasn't wearing a loose dress and went hula hooping instead, she would definitely attract many viewers.</p><p></p><p>"Is that sister of yours very poor?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu glared at Qi Yuan again. "Poor? She's much richer than me. Her master is Old Man Wutian, the head of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>"Does she have a lot of spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>"Spirit stones... those are nothing," Jiang Lingsu said proudly. "The Ascending Heaven Pavilion collects techniques from all over the world. Among the Thirteen Provinces of the Eastern Lands, almost all renowned techniques have been collected by the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Even our Divine Light Sect's 'Seven-Colored Flame Refining Technique' is included in the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>You must know about the Soaring Sky Pavilion, right? They have a close relationship with the Ascending Heaven Pavilion and have been helping them collect techniques from the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's breathing quickened and his eyes lit up. "So rich?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Seeing her senior brother's expression, Jiang Lingsu felt more familiar.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to marry into their family as a son-in-law, would I be able to see those techniques from the Ascending Heaven Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"...Senior Brother, what are you thinking?" Jiang Lingsu turned her head away. "If you need techniques, ask me. I still have... some."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He already had a brick house. Although he lacked a car, he didn't need to marry into a family, right? "Thank you, Junior Sister. It's just that receiving favors for no reason makes me feel..."</p><p></p><p>"Here are quite a few techniques, take them and study them." Jiang Lingsu waved her jade-like hand, and several jade slips fell into Qi Yuan's hands. "I just extorted these from Sister Yaya, don't expose me."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Jiang Lingsu returned to her wooden house without looking back.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the jade slips, feeling moved.</p><p></p><p>He returned to his room and logged into his alternate account.</p><p></p><p>Recalling his junior sister's questions today, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Blood-Robed Sword Immortal' account still fits my cold personality too well. Junior Sister became suspicious immediately.</p><p></p><p>The 'Crazy Daoist' account that has nothing to do with me is better. She would never think of me."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the two suns in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's time for Crazy Daoist and Seven Desires Demon Lord to make their appearance!"</p><p></p><p>In the Hundred Countries region, there were still many strongholds of the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>He had to eliminate them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"After all, they were once my first love. I'll send them to reunite with their ancestors."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Cloud Fungus Mountain, True Lord Wind Fury and True Lord Strong Flood arrived together.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the great formation in the mountain, True Lord Wind Fury's eyes were filled with anger: "This Six Zithers True Lord is quite leisurely, coming here to seclude himself for cultivation? I think he's not secluding himself for cultivation, but fooling around with some female cultivators from Great Shang!"</p><p></p><p>He felt dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>His disciple Breaking Wolf was suspected to have died at the hands of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Instead of pressuring the Divine Light Sect, this Six Zithers True Lord was here secluding himself for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, True Lord Wind Fury was displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Six Zithers True Lord may have reached a critical point in his cultivation," True Lord Strong Flood acted as a peacemaker.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Wind Fury suppressed his anger and shouted at the formation ahead: "Six Zithers True Lord, come see me at once!"</p><p></p><p>He was at the late stage of Divine Infant realm, and his father was a Purple Palace powerhouse. He had the capital to be arrogant and domineering.</p><p></p><p>But after shouting, it was completely silent here, with no response at all.</p><p></p><p>Confusion appeared in the eyes of the two.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... something unexpected happened?</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a loud laugh rang out from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The world laughs at me for being too crazy, I laugh at the world for not seeing through."</p><p></p><p>Only to see a middle-aged man with a crazy expression, wearing a tattered Daoist robe, appear in front of True Lord Wind Fury and True Lord Strong Flood.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" True Lord Wind Fury looked at the man in front of him with wariness.</p><p></p><p>The man held a kitchen knife in his hand and looked at True Lord Wind Fury: "I am... Crazy Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"Crazy Daoist?" True Lord Wind Fury was stunned, and then an ominous premonition came.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society's Crazy Daoist?</p><p></p><p>"Why did you suddenly appear here!" True Lord Strong Flood was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Crazy Daoist held a kitchen knife, with a mocking smile in his eyes: "Why I appeared here, shouldn't I ask you? Not staying properly at your stronghold, running around aimlessly, wasting my time."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he charged towards True Lord Wind Fury and True Lord Strong Flood with his kitchen knife, like a madman.</p><p></p><p>The two late-stage Divine Infant realm cultivators didn't have any intention of fighting back at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This matter was too strange.</p><p></p><p>The two wanted to leave and reconsider.</p><p></p><p>But the crazy voice followed like a shadow: "People can leave, but corpses must stay here."</p><p></p><p>As the crazy words fell, that kitchen knife left an arc in the air, falling on True Lord Wind Fury and True Lord Strong Flood.</p><p></p><p>The two True Lords used their divine abilities to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, that kitchen knife seemed to be invincible, impossible to resist.</p><p></p><p>"You will die for opposing the Light Palace!" True Lord Wind Fury shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>His body could no longer withstand it and was cut in half by that kitchen knife, his soul scattering.</p><p></p><p>The same happened to True Lord Strong Flood. Facing Qi Yuan, late-stage Divine Infant realm cultivators were like chickens. In fact, even without using his origin divine ability, they had no chance to fight back.</p><p></p><p>After slaughtering the two Divine Infant realm cultivators, Qi Yuan waved his hand lightly, and their storage bags fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Only this Wind Fury barely counts as a first love. This Strong Flood True Lord is too poor! With just this... he dares to come to Great Shang?</p><p></p><p>If there was internet here, I'd have to hang him on the web and mock him severely." After saying this, Qi Yuan's figure dissipated.</p><p></p><p>His other alternate identities were also about to take action.</p><p></p><p>In the Wei Kingdom's imperial palace, the harem had already become the backyard of the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>Several Divine Infant realm cultivators were spending the night in the dragon bed, having a great time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an extremely miserable voice rang out in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Where's my chicken?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did my chicken go?"</p><p></p><p>Above the harem's sky, a man in black robes with disheveled hair appeared. An extremely dangerous aura emanated from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" A Divine Infant realm cultivator rose into the air from the harem. "This is a Light Palace stronghold. There's no chicken of yours here!"</p><p></p><p>"Chicken... it was you who stole my chicken!" The disheveled man's eyes revealed anger, his voice trembling. "You damned bastards, that was my family member, and you stole it to eat!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Seven Desires Demon Lord?" That Divine Infant realm cultivator immediately understood that the person before him should be the Seven Desires Demon Lord from the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>"You heartless monsters, even stealing and eating cute chickens, you'll be struck by lightning!" The disheveled man pointed his finger, seemingly condemning that Divine Infant realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>That Divine Infant realm cultivator's eyes held a hint of mockery: "Crazy fool, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't sense any powerful aura from the cultivator before him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were over ten Divine Infant realm cultivators in the Wei imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>This Seven Desires Demon Lord coming here was seeking death.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the imperial palace, some Divine Infant realm cultivators of Wei Kingdom saw that figure in the sky, their eyes revealing helpless expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Hope this fellow Daoist... can be safe and sound."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes were angry: "Do too many bad things, and you'll suffer heavenly punishment!</p><p></p><p>Since I was born, I've been helping others every day, not even killing chickens or stepping on ants.</p><p></p><p>You will be struck by heavenly lightning!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly lightning? There hasn't been heavenly lightning in this world for a long time. Where did this madman come from!" That Divine Infant realm cultivator was furious and charged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a golden bun suddenly condensed in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the bun formed, a terrifying aura spread.</p><p></p><p>The bun was thrown, landing in front of that Divine Infant realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>That Divine Infant realm cultivator had just sensed the rich metal attribute aura.</p><p></p><p>A bolt of heavenly lightning appeared out of nowhere, striking directly on him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to resist, but couldn't at all.</p><p></p><p>"No!" He didn't understand, couldn't comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Why did heavenly lightning suddenly appear? Why would heavenly lightning destroy him? Of course, he didn't know that this was a secret technique Qi Yuan had created before.</p><p></p><p>Using the power of gold essence to condense into a sword.</p><p></p><p>Where the sword was thrown, lightning would strike.</p><p></p><p>"Buns are falling."</p><p></p><p>"Chicken-filled buns."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was like the Dragon King in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Countless buns fell from the sky like hail.</p><p></p><p>Above the entire Wei imperial palace, dark clouds gathered, as if the gods were angry.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators in the imperial capital couldn't help but look up at the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the dense heavenly lightning, fear and awe appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Countless bolts of heavenly lightning also washed over the Wei imperial palace at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the Divine Infant realm cultivators of the Light Palace inevitably had a bun stuffed into their mouths, then welcomed the baptism of heavenly lightning.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Nine Heavens' mystic killing intent transformed into divine lightning, the majestic heavenly might, drawn by buns.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: There's one more chapter, read it tomorrow morning.

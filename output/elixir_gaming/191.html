        <h1>Chapter 191</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"You must be joking, I am not of the dragon race," Ye Liuyun said calmly.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with curiosity, and a trace of wariness. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had used a treasure to conceal his aura, so how did the other party discover it?</p><p></p><p>"Without five claws, not an azure dragon, nor a torch dragon, indeed not of the dragon race, can only be considered half-dragon," Qi Yuan casually commented.</p><p></p><p>Just now, his eyes had seen this Ye Liuyun's information.</p><p></p><p>It showed that the other party was of the dragon race, which is why he made that remark.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Ye Liuyun put away his previous disdain, while also feeling other emotions.</p><p></p><p>He was a pure-blooded dragon, with rich bloodline. If he wasn't a true dragon, who else could be?</p><p></p><p>As for five claws, torch dragons, azure dragons, he had never even heard of them, probably some mixed-blood dragons.</p><p></p><p>Though thinking this, he didn't say it out loud. This time he had come here trying not to expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>He carefully sized up Qi Yuan: "And you are?"</p><p></p><p>"Guardian deity of Qingshui Village, Origin Venerable," Qi Yuan truthfully reported.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun had a strange look on his face.</p><p></p><p>The young attendant and maid behind him also had the same expression.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Liuyun's view, Qi Yuan's strength indeed matched the status of a village guardian deity. </p><p></p><p>But those maids and guards didn't look the part at all.</p><p></p><p>Six True Gods serving him, treating Origin Venerable like a revered grandfather.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In his clan, his status was very precious, and some uncles stronger than him would respect him.</p><p></p><p>But they certainly couldn't do what these True Gods were doing - holding umbrellas, feeding fruits.</p><p></p><p>If he asked the elders in his clan to feed him fruits, his legs would probably be broken.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't because those people didn't care for him, but rather... they couldn't bring themselves to do it.</p><p></p><p>"Are you also here to participate in the Hundred Flowers Gathering?" Ye Liuyun asked.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we travel together?" Ye Liuyun extended an invitation, very curious about Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>The group set off together towards the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun said: "That evil dragon causing trouble here had weak strength, but truly strong innate talents, hailed as the hope of the North Sea dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was killed with one sword strike by the Third Miss Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>The North Sea dragon clan thus became enemies with the phoenix clan."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ye Liuyun glanced at Qi Qi and advised: "If this young lady is going to the North Sea Divine Eye, it's best to conceal your aura. Otherwise, if sensed by the North Sea dragon clan, there may be trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the reminder," Qi Qi said.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Wang Wenqi looked at Qi Qi and cast a spell.</p><p></p><p>This spell could block the phoenix clan aura on Qi Qi's body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if a True God came into close contact, they could still smell the scent of the phoenix clan.</p><p></p><p>Unless, like Ye Liuyun, one used precious treasures to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan didn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, do you have any preparations for this trip to the North Sea Divine Eye?" Ye Liuyun asked.</p><p></p><p>"I am preparing at all times," Qi Yuan replied. He was always preparing to kill evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn't encountered any evil gods on this journey.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have lofty ambitions. You will surely make a name for yourself at this North Sea Divine Eye event," Ye Liuyun said, constantly trying to figure out Qi Yuan's identity in his words.</p><p></p><p>"Are there many treasures at the Hundred Flowers Gathering?" Qi Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>After all, Thunder Lord was not from the northern lands and wasn't very familiar with the Hundred Flowers Gathering.</p><p></p><p>His subordinates had just broken through to True God and hadn't come into contact with the Hundred Flowers Gathering.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that at the last Hundred Flowers Gathering, a prodigy won seven supreme treasures that could help one break through to True God," Ye Liuyun said, his words filled with endless envy.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "So many? How did they win them?"</p><p></p><p>What he lacked most right now were exactly these kinds of treasures.</p><p></p><p>With more of these treasures, he could continuously produce True Gods.</p><p></p><p>And his subordinate forces would grow even larger.</p><p></p><p>"Well... it's actually quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>In the North Sea Divine Eye sleeps a great venerable, named Qionghua Venerable.</p><p></p><p>She is undoubtedly the number one among the North Sea aquatic races.</p><p></p><p>The original intention of the aquatic races holding the Hundred Flowers Gathering was to make the hundred flowers bloom and awaken Qionghua Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun explained at length.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he had already determined that this Origin Venerable was either from out of town, or a local without strong backing. Otherwise, he wouldn't be unaware of even these basic facts.</p><p></p><p>"To make flowers bloom, can't you just add some fertilizer? </p><p></p><p>If that doesn't work, couldn't you find a dwarf to kiss Qionghua Venerable awake?" Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun couldn't keep a straight face.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi said from the side: "My godfather always talks like this, please forgive him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Qi's form of address for Qi Yuan, Ye Liuyun was even more unable to keep his composure.</p><p></p><p>This person... really played it wild.</p><p></p><p>Taking someone with phoenix clan bloodline as a goddaughter! Such boldness!</p><p></p><p>If the Third Miss Phoenix were still here, wouldn't she split him in half with one sword?</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun continued to explain: "The True Gods who come to the North Sea Divine Eye will all visualize. If they visualize True Gods related to Qionghua Venerable, they use the method of observing gods to awaken Qionghua Venerable's past memories. In the hundred flower garden, flowers will bloom.</p><p></p><p>Depending on how many memories are awakened, the flowers that bloom will be different, and the treasures bestowed will also be completely different."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned: "What if I don't know Qionghua Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't know Qionghua Venerable at all, and couldn't visualize any True Gods related to her.</p><p></p><p>How could he awaken Qionghua Venerable?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Liuyun said softly: "You only need to visualize True Gods, even if they have been visualized before, it's fine.</p><p></p><p>You haven't seen Qionghua Venerable, but the True Gods you visualize may have seen her to some extent.</p><p></p><p>As long as you can describe Qionghua Venerable from other people's memories, she may awaken."</p><p></p><p>"That's quite interesting," Qi Yuan felt the setup of this game was interesting.</p><p></p><p>It was probably like implanting memories into Qionghua Venerable based on other True Gods' descriptions, ultimately awakening her? This could be called memory implantation, or perhaps... redrawing Qionghua Venerable based on others' memories, then awakening her.</p><p></p><p>Would this awakened Qionghua Venerable still be called Qionghua Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I haven't seen her and can't visualize any True Gods related to her," Qi Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>Did this mean he and Qionghua Venerable's treasures were fated to miss each other?</p><p></p><p>"But since we've come, let's take a look," Qi Yuan displayed the excellent traditional virtues of his countrymen.</p><p></p><p>Since we've come, how can we go back?</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed, and Qi Yuan and Ye Liuyun's group arrived at the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>There was a palace here, filled with powerful figures, mostly True Gods.</p><p></p><p>The True Gods gathered here, creating quite a lively scene.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze around, lacking interest.</p><p></p><p>They were all ancient gods, no evil gods, not interesting.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's arrival also attracted the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>After all, when other True Gods arrived, they had at most one or two young attendants and maids.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan arrived with a security team of over twenty people.</p><p></p><p>Among them were six True Gods, particularly eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this... from which family?"</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of him."</p><p></p><p>"What a grand display!"</p><p></p><p>"Four True Gods as maids, tsk tsk... must be the beloved son of a Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods here all looked at Qi Yuan, some with envy.</p><p></p><p>Others glanced once and looked away, seemingly disliking such a prodigal attitude.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Ye Liuyun entered the palace, the two of them...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He sat down casually in a spot.</p><p></p><p>Once everyone had arrived, the North Sea God's Eye would open, and they would enter together.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I want to eat those things. Bring them over here for me," Qi Yuan ordered the Four Heavenly Kings, feeling hungry after walking for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Four Heavenly Kings were already quite good-looking originally, but after becoming true gods, their beauty had increased even more. </p><p></p><p>In the great hall, they could be considered to outshine all the other beauties.</p><p></p><p>The other true gods had relied on their innate talents to become true gods, but these Four Heavenly Kings had relied on their looks.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's order, the Four Heavenly Kings didn't hesitate and went directly to fetch the food he had requested.</p><p></p><p>The sight of four celestial maidens raiding the tables was indeed somewhat bewildering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Ye Liuyun couldn't help but chuckle: "Qi Yuan, you really are an interesting fellow."</p><p></p><p>On the way here, he had already learned Qi Yuan's name.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't make a hundred flowers bloom or win a supreme treasure, I can't come here for nothing, right? I have to eat a lot," Qi Yuan reasoned logically.</p><p></p><p>The Four Heavenly Kings brought over some food.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said to the Eighteen Arhats:</p><p></p><p>"You all eat too."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Origin Venerable from Qingshui Village?" An old man wearing a yellow Taoist robe appeared.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from him was clearly that of someone who had reached the second step of Treading the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Among the true gods present, he was considered one of the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, the six true gods around Qi Yuan all looked at the old man warily.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, are you... here to beg for food?" Qi Yuan glanced at him casually.</p><p></p><p>"This old one is Venerable Dusk, from the Ancient God Alliance. </p><p>Recently, someone from our alliance offended the Origin Venerable, so I've come specially to apologize," Venerable Dusk said, looking at Qi Yuan with sincere eyes.</p><p></p><p>The sight of someone at the second step of Treading the Heavens taking such an attitude towards someone who wasn't even a true god surprised all the gods present.</p><p></p><p>"The one who offended me was killed by my sword. The matter is settled.</p><p>Sigh, I thought you had killed the small fry and the big fish had come.</p><p>Now that you've come to apologize to me, I feel quite uncomfortable," Qi Yuan replied casually.</p><p></p><p>"We are all ancient gods, we should watch out for and help each other. How can we kill each other?" Venerable Dusk said. He glanced at the people around Qi Yuan and transmitted: "Are these... the newest divine laws you've contemplated?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Dusk had heard about the Origin Venerable before and knew that he had once contemplated several powerful divine laws.</p><p></p><p>Later, when Feihuang City survived its crisis, Venerable Dusk also received news that it seemed to be because the Origin Venerable had contemplated another powerful divine law, creating a true god, which helped them overcome the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Dusk knew the strength of Qingshui Village very well.</p><p></p><p>Now, so many true gods had suddenly appeared?</p><p></p><p>What was the reason? Simple! Divine laws! He suddenly remembered that recently, there had been a great flash of golden light on Contemplation Mountain, and twenty-one legendary divine laws had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with the powerful beings around the Origin Venerable, he boldly guessed that the legendary figure was none other than the village-level guardian god, the Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly offend such a figure? He had to try hard to win him over!</p><p></p><p>While others still didn't know that the Origin Venerable was the prodigy who had shocked Contemplation Mountain, he wanted to establish a good connection first.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Dusk's friendly gesture also gave other true gods the wrong impression, all thinking that this must be the offspring of a great venerable.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could someone like Venerable Dusk, who had reached the second step of Treading the Heavens, lower himself to curry favor?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, they are my contemplations," Qi Yuan replied to Venerable Dusk's transmission.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Venerable Dusk became even more excited.</p><p></p><p>"Would you be willing to sell some of these divine laws to me? This old one will pay a high price!" Venerable Dusk's eyes were filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>Divine laws were not only for use by subjects.</p><p></p><p>Even some true gods would use them.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Venerable Dusk who had reached the second step of Treading the Heavens, it was very difficult to increase his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And powerful divine laws were just what he needed.</p><p></p><p>However, there were restrictions. The divine law had to be from a true god whose path was very similar to Venerable Dusk's.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be almost useless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "Divine laws are not for sale. I only give them to my subjects.</p><p>If you come to my Qingshui Village, I could bestow some upon you."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Dusk was a bit disappointed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to buy divine laws to see if there were any paths he could learn from.</p><p></p><p>If not, it wouldn't be a loss, as he could give them to his subjects.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was in water control techniques, which was very popular.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to find suitable divine laws for this, but it was worth a try, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Venerable Dusk couldn't bring himself to become a subject of the Origin Venerable just for a divine law that couldn't improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"I hope we'll have opportunities to cooperate in the future." Even so, Venerable Dusk remained very friendly.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable had boundless potential, and such a prodigy was worth befriending.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a female voice rang out: "Now that everyone has arrived, please follow me into the North Sea God's Eye!"</p><p></p><p>An elegant and noble woman appeared, and everyone present nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate a grape and followed all the true gods towards the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>The North Sea God's Eye had a very peculiar appearance, like a downward-spiraling vortex.</p><p></p><p>However, terrifying spatial fluctuations emanated from outside the vortex.</p><p></p><p>The vortex seemed to be spinning space itself, rather than water.</p><p></p><p>The woman took out a token and shone it on all the true gods. After confirming there were no new gods in disguise and that all invitations were valid, everyone entered in single file.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the scene before them changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>What appeared before Qi Yuan was like an underwater dragon palace.</p><p></p><p>Buds about to bloom came into view.</p><p></p><p>Many emerald green plants were lush and vibrant.</p><p></p><p>Various shells, crabs, squids... were constantly swimming in the water.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a Golden Cudgel here?" Qi Yuan suddenly thought and blurted out.</p><p></p><p>The people nearby looked at Qi Yuan, all a bit puzzled, having never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun asked, "What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a monkey's weapon, quite powerful, can stabilize the sea," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>According to the description in Journey to the West, the Golden Cudgel was actually quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But in Qi Yuan's memory, it was a great treasure.</p><p></p><p>What man wouldn't want a treasure like the Golden Cudgel that could grow or shrink at will? Subduing demons and monsters, no demon would dare disobey.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his evil god spiritual power was too little now, and there were too few supreme treasures available for breaking through to the realm of true god. Otherwise, if he could contemplate Sun Wukong into existence, that would certainly be very interesting.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the woman in fine clothes spoke, her face expectant: "The Hundred Flowers Gathering has begun. I invite you all to... awaken the flowers of the sea!"</p><p></p><p>Over several Hundred Flowers Gatherings, two-thirds of the sea flowers had already bloomed.</p><p></p><p>One-third remained yet to bloom.</p><p></p><p>Once they fully bloomed, the Jade Flower Great Venerable would awaken.</p><p></p><p>The North Sea marine race would have their own pillar of support and would no longer fear the intrusion of the dragon race.</p><p></p><p>The assembled gods looked at these buds about to bloom thoughtfully, eager to try.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were many supreme treasures in the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>If one could obtain one, it could create a true god.</p><p></p><p>Having a true god-level combat power emerge from among one's subjects would provide an extra measure of survival assurance in these chaotic times.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Liuyun spoke up: "Brother Qi, I'll go give it a try."</p><p></p><p>He was also eager to try, clearly having looked forward to the blooming of a hundred flowers for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to [Not Becoming a Marquis] for the 5000 reward; thanks again to God's Tearless← for the 1000 reward; thanks to Book Friend 001 for the 1000 reward; thanks to Fighting 6 Yong Shi, Tomorrow Will Be Better, Long Night Many Dreams_Ee, Shennong Valley Inheritance Walker, Chen Yiyun for their rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

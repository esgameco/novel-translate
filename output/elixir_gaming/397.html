        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Flowing Wind.</p><p></p><p>The forest was infused with green, the world a sea of emerald.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday was still autumn with red maple leaves, today it was spring.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood on a small mountain path, her eyes filled with reminiscence: "This used to be a lone peak, with many caves. When I was young, I hid here for a year."</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch chimed in at the right moment, her eyes gleaming: "I remember there was a kind of red fruit that was especially delicious, but sadly I've never had it again."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the caves, Qi Yuan gripped Goldfinch and Ning Tao's small hands tighter.</p><p></p><p>In the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, he had inscribed the primal divine ability and experienced the reincarnation of the great demon.</p><p></p><p>The demoness who should have schemed and plotted against him was replaced by Goldfinch who suddenly barged in.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch had always followed him foolishly, playing an unconventional demoness role, and had once brought him to hide in a cave.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to go back in time and find that fruit again?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's divine realm was related to time and space.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't reverse time or resurrect the dead.</p><p></p><p>But going back in time to recreate a tree from before and produce a similar fruit was something she could do.</p><p></p><p>"No need. It may have only tasted good in memory. If we eat it again, it might be quite ordinary," Ning Tao said open-mindedly.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>There stood a Buddhist pagoda, solemn and majestic, with copper bells hanging from its ancient eaves.</p><p></p><p>When the bell tolled, it set off the copper bells.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the Realm of Flowing Wind would now revere ten thousand Buddhas," Ning Tao said, a hint of disappointment in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace had once been at its zenith, the number one power in the Realm of Flowing Wind.</p><p></p><p>Her Qi Yuan had been the great enemy who destroyed the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, slaying demonesses and leaving with the source of sun-extinguishing power.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after the Blood Lord disappeared, the former Blood Palace only lasted a hundred years before disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Lord's achievements, no one sang of them anymore.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew what Ning Tao was thinking. He smiled and said, "Why care about some unimportant opinions?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao nodded and said softly, "The Realm of Flowing Wind is now full of Buddhist temples and monasteries everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In another month, the Assembly of Ten Thousand Buddhas will be held. Those Buddhist disciples from the upper realms should all attend."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, "Do you think, given the nature of the Gate of Ten Thousand Transformations, it might appear when the Assembly of Ten Thousand Buddhas is held?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a guess about the timing of the Gate of Ten Thousand Transformations' appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was when major events occurred and the power of a realm converged.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible," Ning Tao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Goldfinch suddenly chirped excitedly, "Hehe, this broken gate will finally become my family door!"</p><p></p><p>It was clear she had some resentment towards the Gate of Ten Thousand Transformations.</p><p></p><p>After all, that Blood Pearl guy used to stare at the gate all day! Goldfinch couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>Was the Gate of Ten Thousand Transformations prettier than her? Now that it was about to become their family door, she was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddhist teachings here are interesting, coming from the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean these bald monks are all my... pure loves?" Qi Yuan thought randomly.</p><p></p><p>People from the upper realms must have many divine laws from there.</p><p></p><p>To Qi Yuan, all divine laws from the upper realms were nourishment for the "Qi Yuan Sutra".</p><p></p><p>"Shall we tour the Realm of Flowing Wind and beg for alms along the way?" Qi Yuan looked at the temple on the mountain, "It seems I have a karmic connection with Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>This was truly a karmic connection!</p><p></p><p>After all, the techniques from the upper realms all had deep ties to him.</p><p></p><p>And these monks who could impart Buddhist teachings were all pure loves.</p><p></p><p>Although "pure love monks" didn't sound very nice, true love doesn't care about worldly opinions.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch's eyes sparkled with anticipation: "Let's go, I've never begged for alms before!"</p><p></p><p>However, just then, a sudden urgent cry for help rang out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw an old woman hanging in midair at the bottom of a cliff by the mountain path, tightly grasping a pine root.</p><p></p><p>Her face was filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The pine root showed signs of strain, as if it would snap under the weight at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a young girl saw this scene and was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Someone come quickly, save her!"</p><p></p><p>This girl was named Bai Baixiang, sweet and lovable, with formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she had caused too much trouble, and her master had sealed away all her powers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the current situation, she could only feel anxious without any way to help.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly a gentle voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Let today's good deed start with you."</p><p></p><p>A streak of blood-red light flashed by, landing on the old woman.</p><p></p><p>The old woman immediately rose from the bottom of the cliff, landing on the road.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Bai Baixiang breathed a sigh of relief. She quickly looked at the man who had saved the woman, her gaze slightly stunned as she blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>In this world... there were still admirers of the Blood Lord? This blood robe was almost identical to the one her master had made, and even met the standard.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, an admirer of the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, admiring the Blood Lord was now just a "niche culture", not on the same level as worshipping bald monks.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the rescuer's appearance clearly, she was even more delighted.</p><p></p><p>As expected, those who admired the Blood Lord were handsome men and beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>However, when she saw the two women beside the handsome man, her gaze shrank, feeling ashamed and inferior.</p><p></p><p>How could they embody such heavenly beauty and peerless grace? To obtain one such woman would leave one with no regrets even in death. To have both, one should keep living, or it would be too much of a pity to die.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, she hurried over to greet them, as it was rare to meet like-minded people on the road.</p><p></p><p>But she saw the man in the blood robe looking at the old woman, his expression kind: "Hey, according to how things usually go, you should say thank you to me."</p><p></p><p>Doing a good deed and receiving a thank you was only right and proper.</p><p></p><p>The dazed old woman finally came to her senses. Hearing Qi Yuan's words, her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Say thank you? The old woman seemed to think of something, turned around to look at the Buddhist pagoda on the mountaintop, her expression devout.</p><p></p><p>"Thank Buddha for displaying divine powers and saving this believer from peril.</p><p></p><p>This believer will surely eat vegetarian food, chant sutras, and worship Buddha sincerely!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she kowtowed several times, her attitude very sincere.</p><p></p><p>This left Qi Yuan stunned. He was a bit unhappy: "You thanked Buddha, shouldn't you thank me too?"</p><p></p><p>But the old woman said: "You coming to save me was all arranged by Buddha. Of course this believer should thank Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>She showed no gratitude towards Qi Yuan who had saved her life in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, she didn't want to be grateful. If she was grateful, wouldn't she have to give a reward?</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, when she was in danger earlier, she had prayed in her heart to the Buddha of this pagoda for help.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this was the Buddha's compassion, sending down divine powers to randomly find someone to save her.</p><p></p><p>Gratitude, of course, should be given to Buddha.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bai Baixiang ran over, her face also showing anger: "Some of these monks' followers are the most disgusting."</p><p></p><p>She used "some", clearly not condemning all followers.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Many followers of deities had this kind of nature.</p><p></p><p>You help them, and they not only won't thank you, but will think it was guidance from their deity.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure this was guidance from your Buddha?" Qi Yuan looked at the old woman, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>The old woman looked at Qi Yuan, and even though she knew Qi Yuan was an immortal master, she was not afraid, clearly a fanatic believer.</p><p></p><p>"There is a true Buddha presiding in the temple here, of course it was guidance from the true Buddha!" the old woman said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>She truly didn't have a shred of gratitude towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young girl beside them seemed to notice something unusual in Qi Yuan's eyes and quickly warned: "There is a sixth-stage half-Buddha presiding in this pagoda, don't do anything rash!"</p><p></p><p>Sixth-stage half-Buddha</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...was the realm of Yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>Bai Baixiang felt that Qi Yuan was about to make a move against this old woman, and hurriedly tried to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled. He looked at the Buddhist pagoda on the high peak and stretched out his finger.</p><p></p><p>"You half-Buddha in seclusion, come here! I have something to ask you!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was vast, like the voice of a god, completely resounding throughout the entire mountain peak at this moment. Inside the pagoda, the ancient bell rang loudly, and Buddhist light suddenly spread everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Bai Baixiang was stunned and covered her mouth: "That's a sixth-level half-Buddha, how dare you!"</p><p></p><p>Her master was a great figure from ten thousand years ago, considered an overlord even in the Flowing Wind Realm. </p><p></p><p>After ten thousand years, her master had also entered the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>However, she still avoided these Buddhas from the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, these Buddhas were not only powerful, but also had deep backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>They simply couldn't be provoked.</p><p></p><p>Even the peak Blood Palace could not compare to these Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this man in the blood robe directly shouted out... what did he mean?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice resounded, echoing throughout the entire pagoda. Over a hundred monks were enraged.</p><p></p><p>"What petty villain dares to make a scene in front of the pagoda!"</p><p></p><p>"Why do you not bow when seeing a half-Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>These monks were used to throwing their weight around, so they were naturally angry when someone shouted.</p><p></p><p>However, deep in the pagoda, the half-Buddha emanating golden light was startled awake at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat broke out on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>This kind of... realm?</p><p></p><p>Only to see golden light suddenly appear in the pagoda, and the tall figure of that half-Buddha appeared.</p><p></p><p>Countless monks and devotees knelt down devoutly.</p><p></p><p>A voice imbued with Buddha-nature rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"What brings this benefactor to our humble temple?"</p><p></p><p>There was a wary look deep in the half-Buddha's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was curious about Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>However, he had the holy land of the Buddha country behind him, so he was not afraid of ordinary Yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Come here, you!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the half-Buddha still wasting words, Qi Yuan crooked his finger.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the elemental energy between heaven and earth was locked down.</p><p></p><p>A look of terror appeared on the half-Buddha's face.</p><p></p><p>Even with Buddhist light shining everywhere and divine power surging through his body, he was completely unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>A look of shock appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was... a mythical being? And not an ordinary mythical being!</p><p></p><p>The high and mighty half-Buddha was directly pulled down by Qi Yuan like a little chicken.</p><p></p><p>All the monks had shocked expressions, as if something had shattered in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>And that old woman also turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Because the majestic and solemn half-Buddha, who was usually rarely seen, was now hunched over like a lackey, smiling ingratiatingly at the man in the blood robe: "Senior, how have I offended you?"</p><p></p><p>The other party was a mythical powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>In the upper realm, below the Yang spirits, mythical beings were also big shots.</p><p></p><p>He was just a small half-Buddha, what did he count for!</p><p></p><p>As for that old woman, the illusions in her heart collapsed even more, and her face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Just now I saved her, and she said it was you who guided me to save her. Was it really you who guided me?" Qi Yuan asked, pointing at the old woman.</p><p></p><p>Didn't you just say it was the Buddha's guidance that saved you?</p><p></p><p>Now I've called the Buddha over, let's confront him face to face!</p><p></p><p>Let's see what you have to say!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very particular.</p><p></p><p>He was also very meticulous in doing things.</p><p></p><p>If a stray dog on the road barked at him once, he would sit down and lecture the dog for half an hour until the dog apologized.</p><p></p><p>After all, living in this world, wasn't cultivation for the sake of being carefree and unrestrained?</p><p></p><p>The half-Buddha's expression changed several times. He looked at the old woman, then glanced at Qi Yuan, wanting to cry but having no tears.</p><p></p><p>Just this?</p><p></p><p>Just for this small matter? Pulling him over like a little chicken.</p><p></p><p>His face, all lost!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how could this mythical being act so... strangely!</p><p></p><p>"How would this humble monk dare to guide you? It is you who should guide this humble monk!" This half-Buddha hated the old woman to death.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan beamed with joy: "See? Your Buddha said that me saving you was not his guidance. Now, do you want to say thank you to me?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman's face turned pale, her faith collapsing in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She stammered, but couldn't manage to say a word of thanks.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao's eyes flashed with a hint of coldness from not far away: "Since it was the Buddha's guidance, now that the Buddha is here, let's see if he guides or not."</p><p></p><p>She glanced at the old woman, only to see the old woman's body floating on the cliff again, her hand still grasping that tree root.</p><p></p><p>"Help!"</p><p></p><p>She let out a shrill scream, but unfortunately this time, the real Buddha did not guide.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior, these are all of this humble monk's divine methods!"</p><p></p><p>In the pagoda, the half-Buddha's attitude was extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan as if looking at a plague god.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the divine methods with a beaming smile: "How many big bald heads do you have coming down to the lower realm? Are they all as rich as you?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the half-Buddha was somewhat confused, while also curious about Qi Yuan's background.</p><p></p><p>"There are two thousand half-Buddhas who have come down to the lower realm," the half-Buddha replied.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "I just love you hairless ones."</p><p></p><p>If he caught all these monks, how many divine methods would they give? One divine method was equivalent to advancing the Stellar Golden Core chapter of the Qi Yuan Scripture as much as a new stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>One divine method, one stellar golden core! Qi Yuan was naturally overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The half-Buddha smiled awkwardly, not daring to respond.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan asked: "Help me find some people, as compensation for making me misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"Who?" The half-Buddha asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, Baize, and also Foolish Daoist, Ling Yayi..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to search himself.</p><p></p><p>If he searched for people, he might end up destroying the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>So it was better to let this half-Buddha search.</p><p></p><p>"Baize? Could you be referring to the disciple of the Great Sun Bright Buddha?" The half-Buddha's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Bai Baixiang's expression also changed when she heard this. She looked at Qi Yuan with a suspicious expression.</p><p></p><p>Her master was White Crane, and the person she followed was the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And the people this man in the blood robe mentioned later, weren't they all... the former Northern Demon Thirteen Monsters?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her gaze fell on Ning Tao, full of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... Her heart started racing.</p><p></p><p>Godfather?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't notice Bai Baixiang. He nodded: "Yes, what about it? Do you have news of him? He barely counts as half a disciple of mine, there's some karmic connection. Judging by your expression, could it be that he's not doing well?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The half-Buddha was shaken.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't quite figure out who this mythical being... really was.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that Baize was the disciple of the Great Sun Bright Buddha, and barring accidents, would unify the Buddha country and become the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>This person actually dared to say Baize was half his disciple. Was he really not afraid of being entangled in such great karma? Or was it that... he wasn't a mythical being?!</p><p></p><p>PS: Recommending a good new book, there's a link below. Those who like it can bookmark it.</p><p></p><p>The book title is "Burning Paper Every Day, I Became the Ancestor of the Dao"</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Wang Hun woke up to find himself standing in a mass grave, realizing he had become a ghost...</p><p></p><p>Burning "three wild chicken feathers", receive one stick of [White Phoenix Fragrant Incense]</p><p></p><p>Burning "half a scroll of tattered scriptures", receive one stick of [Ten Thousand Buddhas Pilgrimage Incense]</p><p></p><p>Burning "one flirtatious fox tail", receive one stick of [Blissful Joy Incense]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"In this life, one should burn some treasures for oneself!"</p><p></p><p>In a world where gods and Buddhas fill the sky, and demons and monsters are seen everywhere, Wang Hun looked at the blazing fire in the brazier and enshrined himself as the Ancestor of the Dao!!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

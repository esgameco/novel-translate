        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Small Town in July.</p><p></p><p>Jinli turned around and saw a young lady in green clothes.</p><p></p><p>The young lady did not look very old, with the appearance of a budding beauty. Her long black hair was tied up in a high bun on top of her head, with golden ornaments that made it look like the hairstyle of an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Her height was not tall either, and with the immortal-like bun on top, she was just about 160 centimeters tall.</p><p></p><p>The green-clad young lady looked at Jinli and slowly spoke: "I am the Sacrificial Priestess of the Moon Emperor Nation, July."</p><p></p><p>Jinli was somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>She had come here discreetly, but she was still discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sacrificial Priestess July," Jinli said.</p><p></p><p>However, the next sentence from this young Sacrificial Priestess made her heart suddenly jump.</p><p></p><p>"Qingluo is my sister."</p><p></p><p>Jinli's expression flashed with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Because Qingluo was the name of her own mother.</p><p></p><p>Was this young loli Sacrificial Priestess talking about the same Qingluo? "She is my mother, and also the Holy Maiden of our Moon Emperor Nation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jinli looked at Qin Aunt.</p><p></p><p>Qin Aunt did not speak, seemingly acknowledging it.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Jinli responded, not showing much reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, may I invite you to visit the ancestral land of the Moon Emperor Clan?" the Sacrificial Priestess July invited.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I don't have the time," Jinli directly refused, looking at the lake water, for some unknown reason feeling a sense of inexplicable worry in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She could not contact Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>She also did not wait for Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is waiting for someone?" the Sacrificial Priestess July asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Jinli did not speak, tacitly acknowledging it.</p><p></p><p>"The person Your Majesty is waiting for has not come."</p><p></p><p>A flash of excitement passed through Jinli's eyes, then disappeared immediately. She coldly said, "You know?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," July shook her head. She looked up at the towering ancient Qichu tree, "In this world, there are too many unknowns, and too many puzzles that cannot be solved.</p><p></p><p>Some are covered by history, washed away by time; some are just without an audience, the solitary self-appreciation of one person.</p><p></p><p>However, when the Qichu tree spreads to the moon, all the mysteries will be revealed."</p><p></p><p>She finished speaking, without lowering her head, still looking up at Jinli: "There are rumors that the first Princess Bride waited here for the celestial gods but never met them; there is also a faceless Sword God who waited here for someone, but the beloved did not arrive; and there is also a Heavenly Guest who lingered here for a long time before finally disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Everything in this world has its cause and effect, its predestined fate, and no one can break it. Your Majesty, why be obsessed with it for a moment?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jinli's cold face revealed a stubborn expression: "I don't believe in cause and effect, nor in predestined fate. Ten years is not enough, then a hundred years, a hundred years is not enough, then a thousand years, ten thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was firm.</p><p></p><p>It's just that she can't contact him for now, but one day they will meet.</p><p></p><p>"If I see him... Sigh." July sighed, "If Your Majesty keeps waiting and can't find that person, you can go take a look at the temple of the Faceless Sword God."</p><p></p><p>July said and walked away leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's heart suddenly jumped, inexplicably recalling some of the content in the second sentence that Qiyuan had asked her to pass on the bridal armor.</p><p></p><p>She murmured, "Not seeing you... not seeing you..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she turned to Qin Aunt and asked, "Qin Aunt, do you know of a second forbidden land besides Tianjue?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Aunt shook her head, "This old servant does not know."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Jinli inexplicably recalled that half a month ago, she had sent the Qilin Guard to return to the Yiguan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>In the Yiguan Forbidden Land, as usual, there were only some strange bridal creatures living.</p><p></p><p>In the depths, there were no other bridal creatures, nor any traces of battle.</p><p></p><p>She stood by the lakeside, looking at the shimmering lake water, her expression as cold as the moon.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the ancient Qichu tree.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the elegantly dressed young lady, his expression complex: "Have you found Jinli?"</p><p></p><p>The young lady in the long dress shook her head, "I have not."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the young Sacrificial Priestess, hesitated for a moment, and moved his lips, his voice a little hoarse: "Do you know about the Southern Qian Nation?"</p><p></p><p>"I have never heard of it," July Sacrificial Priestess shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan paused for a moment, then asked again, "What about the Southern Feng Nation?"</p><p></p><p>"...What about the Tianrun Holy Gate?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianrun Holy Gate, the mightiest sect of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan did not originally want to ask about this.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know about that either," the Sacrificial Priestess July shook her head again.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Qiyuan's expression of frustration dissipated, appearing unusually calm, or even overly cold.</p><p></p><p>"Our Moon Emperor Clan will definitely do our best to find the person you are looking for!" the Sacrificial Priestess July apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qiyuan did not continue that topic, but instead looked up at the ancient Qichu tree, seeing the ominous corpses on it, "What's going on here?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the Hundred Cities Alliance, the people hanging up there are those who did not respect the Filial Piety Edict and those who obstructed the promulgation of the Filial Piety Law," July said coldly, with obvious anger in her eyes, "The Hundred Cities Alliance also wants to include our Moon Emperor Clan in this, and anyone who makes a mistake will be hung on the ancient Qichu tree!"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan was silent: "This violates the Heavenly Harmony, like pulling out the firewood from under the cauldron."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the next generation is the future of a country and a race.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, it won't be long before the human race on the Wangyue Continent will gradually wither away.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Cities Alliance promulgated the Filial Piety Edict, which caused dissatisfaction in many countries, and they all opposed it. Even within the Hundred Cities Alliance itself, there was much discontent.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts resisted, and rivers of blood flowed."</p><p></p><p>The Sacrificial Priestess of the Moon Emperor Clan, July, said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"In such a scenario, the Hundred Cities Alliance should have been on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>But..."</p><p></p><p>The Sacrificial Priestess July said with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Black-Robed Guards!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this term, the Sacrificial Priestess July was clearly very excited, her body even slightly trembling, as if she was extremely fearful.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan heard this term again.</p><p></p><p>The last time was outside Kunwu City, when he heard this name.</p><p></p><p>"Are they very strong?" Qiyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"They... are monsters, they are ghosts!" The Sacrificial Priestess July seemed to be thinking of some terrifying thing, her eyes full of fear.</p><p></p><p>"They are not many in number, each one wearing a black robe, so you can't even see their faces.</p><p></p><p>They don't eat, they don't drink, they don't speak, they seem to have no emotions, only the desire to kill! Their strength... is too powerful.</p><p></p><p>No one is a match for them, the mightiest warriors, in front of them, are as fragile as chicks and are slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>They appear and disappear mysteriously, and wherever they appear, rivers of blood must flow! Once, the Great Jing Empire boasted that they would send troops to the Hundred Cities Alliance!</p><p></p><p>But the next day, the Great Jing Imperial City... was empty.</p><p></p><p>Seventy million people... all hung here!"</p><p></p><p>"They don't care about any great cause, they don't care about any future.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Black-Robed Guards are here, they are unrestrained."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Demonic Cultivators from the Outer Realm.</p><p></p><p>Are the Black-Robed Guards the work of the Demonic Cultivators from the Outer Realm? Just how powerful are the Demonic Cultivators from the Outer Realm? Why are they ravaging the mortal world like this?</p><p></p><p>He did not know.</p><p></p><p>"However, no matter how powerful the Black-Robed Guards are, our Moon Emperor Clan will not submit!</p><p></p><p>This world cannot be allowed to be ravaged by these demonic evils! This is the origin land and foundation of our Moon Emperor Clan, the Wangyue Continent!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Sacrificial Priestess July regained their confidence, "This world was originally called the Baiyi Continent, and is now called the Wangyue Continent!"</p><p></p><p>"Baiyi?" Qiyuan heard this, his heart suddenly jumping.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had heard of this.</p><p></p><p>Even in the memories of the powerful experts from the Four Great Forbidden Lands, there was no such information.</p><p></p><p>And the term "Baiyi" also gave him some associations.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Ascension Platform, and the words spoken by that Golden-Armored Divine General... the reversal of day and night.</p><p></p><p>"You should be an Exalted Emperor, am I right?" the Sacrificial Priestess July asked, looking at Qiyuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, upon hearing from her disciple that a mysterious Exalted Emperor had come to the clan, she had prepared to meet him.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing about that person's story and seeing the corpses of the Hundred Cities Alliance people, she changed her mind.</p><p></p><p>She came out to search directly.</p><p></p><p>The other party is an Exalted Emperor, and not just a simple Exalted Emperor.</p><p></p><p>She hoped her guess was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Sacrificial Priestess July's question, Qiyuan did not answer.</p><p></p><p>In the mortal world, he could not display power beyond the Heavenly Realm, or else he would immediately face the Demonic Cultivators from the Outer Realm.</p><p></p><p>There are still many things he has not figured out, and he does not want to go to the Forbidden Lands immediately.</p><p></p><p>So for now, he can only display the strength of an Exalted Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But... after constantly killing and killing on the Ascension Platform, even if he only displays the power of an Exalted Emperor, he is still very fearful.</p><p></p><p>"Can Your Excellency do us a favor?" July looked at Qiyuan and expressed the purpose of her coming here.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan stood in place, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He did not immediately answer.</p><p></p><p>He was recalling all the events that had happened since leaving the Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>All the events, one by one, surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He saw the human hell, and he also saw the terrifying scene of the countless corpses hanging on the ancient Qichu tree.</p><p></p><p>His emotions had experienced quite a few ups and downs.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is also a normal person.</p><p></p><p>He just killed and killed, killing for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly receiving so much information, his brain was a bit confused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit neurotic.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his eyes closed, when he opens them again, his gaze becomes clearer.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu.</p><p></p><p>The muddled state had also been dispelled to a large extent.</p><p></p><p>He adjusted very quickly.</p><p></p><p>He became himself again, the normal him. "I was just playing a game, how could the game play me?" Qi Yuan's previous emotions dissipated, and he muttered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The grim corpses overhead no longer felt so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"You speak." Qi Yuan looked at the woman in the long dress, was this NPC going to give him a quest?</p><p></p><p>"Now, the Hundred Cities Alliance is coming in force, and they may destroy my Moon Emperor clan.</p><p></p><p>I hope you can protect the safety of our clan's Holy Maiden!" Seventh Month Sacrificer stated her purpose.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was delighted.</p><p></p><p>He would become the strongest bodyguard, protecting the cold and elegant white silk campus belle?</p><p></p><p>"How old is your Holy Maiden? Is she fair and beautiful? Does she have long legs, is she an art student?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer was stunned.</p><p></p><p>A dazed expression flashed across her face.</p><p></p><p>She was very suspicious, wondering if the person behind the mask had changed.</p><p></p><p>Where was the aura of the peerless swordsman, the one who embraced the moon?</p><p></p><p>However, she quickly reacted, and with difficulty said, "The Holy Maiden is only seven years old this year."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yuan was momentarily stunned, "Protecting a child, no problem.</p><p></p><p>But..." </p><p></p><p>"Whatever request you have, please feel free to make it.</p><p></p><p>My Moon Emperor clan is willing to open our treasury, you may choose as you please.</p><p></p><p>Even, if you fancy, the unmarried women of our Moon Emperor clan are yours to take."</p><p></p><p>"No need, the Holy Maiden is enough." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hurriedly said, "Don't misunderstand, I'm not interested in those material things."</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month then calmed down, feeling that she had misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>"I hope..." Qi Yuan hesitated for a moment, looking at the starry sky and then at the ancient Qi Chun tree, "You build a country, call it the Moon Emperor Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>I hope, near the Seven Month Lake, there is a town called Seven Month Town, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer was a bit dazed.</p><p> </p><p>She didn't know Qi Yuan's intention.</p><p></p><p>But she still sincerely said, "If we get through this calamity, even if only a village of people remains, our Moon Emperor clan will establish the Moon Emperor Dynasty as you said!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>A village establishing itself as an emperor, why did it feel so familiar?</p><p></p><p>"I have some other requests, I'll tell you when I leave.</p><p></p><p>Oh, I'll only protect your Holy Maiden for 26 days."</p><p></p><p>"Good." Seventh Month Sacrificer agreed, and thought of something, gritting her teeth she said, "If the Black-Robed Guards appear, you can just leave, you don't have to worry about us and the Holy Maiden."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Seventh Month Sacrificer in surprise: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>The next day, by the Seven Month Lake, a simple bamboo hut was built.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still sitting on the blue stone by the lake, as usual, not knowing what he was thinking or doing.</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer came again, leading a little girl.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, she is our clan's Holy Maiden, please take care of her."</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer let go, and the short little girl behind her peeked out, looking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked at the little girl.</p><p></p><p>The little girl looked timid and shy, but the most eye-catching thing about her was her eyes, her eyelashes were very long, fluttering like a fan, and in her pupils, there seemed to be a crescent moon.</p><p></p><p>"What's her name?"</p><p></p><p>"You can call her Moon Maiden."</p><p></p><p>"Moon Maiden?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer handed the Holy Maiden to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She said, "Sir, I will have to go on a long journey during this period, please trouble you."</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer then took out a jade-quality round jade from her pocket.</p><p></p><p>"This is called the Linglong Jade Tide, a natural pair, ordinary people can communicate through this treasure.</p><p></p><p>I'm giving this one to you, the other one is with me.</p><p> </p><p>If there's an emergency, you can contact me through the Linglong Jade Tide."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the warm Linglong Jade Tide.</p><p></p><p>He found it was a bit like the communication jade slips in the Cyan Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>He held the Linglong Jade Tide and tentatively sent a message: "Are you there?"</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month saw the message transmitted by the Linglong Jade Tide, looked at Qi Yuan and said, "Yes, that's how it works."</p><p></p><p>She then squatted down and said to the Holy Maiden, "Moon Maiden, remember during this period, follow this senior, he will protect you, be obedient."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden secretly glanced at Qi Yuan and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'm counting on you." Seventh Month bowed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan suddenly spoke: "Why do you trust me so much?"</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month's face showed a devout expression: "It is all the guidance of fate."</p><p></p><p>"Superstitious nonsense." Qi Yuan mocked.</p><p></p><p>He didn't like communicating with religious fanatics, all this mystical talk.</p><p></p><p>Seventh Month Sacrificer bid farewell to Qi Yuan and left the Seven Month Lake.</p><p></p><p>On the emerald green lakeside, only Qi Yuan and the Holy Maiden of the Moon Emperor clan remained.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Moon Maiden: "Go play in the mud over there, as long as you don't leave my sight."</p><p></p><p>The little girl didn't react, just sat next to Qi Yuan, staring blankly at the lake water with him.</p><p></p><p>Big and small, quite poetic.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, a cold wind blew.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sky and saw the scattered specks of snow.</p><p></p><p>"It's snowing."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll be fishing alone in the icy river tonight."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Holy Maiden next to him, tightly clutching his sleeve: "If you're cold, go back to the hut."</p><p></p><p>The little girl's hands were a bit reddened from the cold, she looked at Qi Yuan and obediently left.</p><p></p><p>"My enthusiasm is still not hot enough, I even froze the little girl." Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>He sat alone by the lake, the vast heavens and earth, only him.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Qi Yuan's shoulders were piled with snow.</p><p></p><p>The branches by the lake had also accumulated snow, and when the wind blew, the snow fluttered down.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the lake seemed to have a thin layer of ice.</p><p></p><p>He sighed: "It's better to feel the cold wind, it makes my mind clearer."</p><p></p><p>The previous constant killing, the murderous intent in his heart, had also dissipated with the accumulating snow.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a creaking sound came, and the little Moon Maiden pushed open the wooden door, carrying a large bowl in her hands, steadily walking towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The bowl was very large, emitting a hot fragrant aroma, full of fish soup.</p><p></p><p>The little girl placed the fish soup in front of Qi Yuan, her star-like eyes looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"For me?" Qi Yuan sniffed the fish soup, "Unexpectedly, coming here, I didn't get to eat crispy sweet duck, but drank a bowl of fish soup, it's worth it."</p><p></p><p>The little girl stood beside him, silent, as if remembering Qi Yuan's words in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up the fish soup, about to drink it all in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he frowned and looked ahead: "The NPCs in this game really have no manners, don't they know not to disturb the player while eating?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, seven figures slowly approached Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They were wearing cloaks, their feet leaving no trace in the snow.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the young lady Cold Moon saw this scene, her pupils constricting.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Emperors!"</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be seven emperors coming at the same time, and judging from their strength, they were not ordinary emperors.</p><p></p><p>She was a bit anxious in her heart, and also worried for the Faceless Man.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Moon Emperor clan had all their experts out, not within the clan.</p><p></p><p>Could that Faceless Man stop those seven emperors? And at this moment, those seven emperors were less than a hundred meters away from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke again: "The transmission speed of the bloody smell in the air is 50 centimeters per second, it will take me 200 seconds to finish this bowl of soup.</p><p></p><p>You are now 100 meters away from me, dying here would be most appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was just talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Those seven people heard this, their eyes flashing with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you are too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"I am Zhou Cong, the Iron Fist of the Hundred Cities Alliance, you must be an emperor above all, over fifty years old.</p><p></p><p>Join our Hundred Cities Alliance, and you can enjoy your later years in peace.</p><p></p><p>To choose to oppose us, the Hundred Cities Alliance, is unwise."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Cong said, emanating a powerful and vigorous aura.</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes falling from the sky melted instantly on his body.</p><p></p><p>The seven of them stepped forward at the same time, towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced sideways at those people: "You've crossed the line."</p><p></p><p>If they were 99 meters away, dying there, the bloody smell would ruin his fish soup.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just go forward, let's see what you can do!" Someone shouted.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the NPC dare to disobey, a cold light flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all so useless, can't you even give me some experience when you die?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in Qi Yuan's hand suddenly flew out, heading straight for the seven people.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, in the snowy night, a sword light flashed.</p><p></p><p>The seven people just stood there, eyes wide open, motionless.</p><p></p><p>The snowflakes fell on their shoulders, as if the snow was too heavy, and the seven people fell to the ground one after another.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 307</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the saying goes, there are hidden talents among the common people.</p><p></p><p>What if there were tigers and dragons among the martial artists?</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of ordinary tigers and dragons, but if a dragon comparable to a deity showed up, he'd be done for.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man glanced at狂欢 (Kuanghuang), feeling puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Qi Yuan's single sword strike that killed that terrifying beast was already comparable to a deity.</p><p></p><p>For a deity to participate in a mortal martial arts competition, this was... toying with the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the military camp reduced to ruins, the bearded man felt a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>This camp had been guarded by over 3,000 soldiers.</p><p></p><p>It was equipped with all kinds of weapons.</p><p></p><p>There were even fighter jets.</p><p></p><p>But now, everything had been reduced to fragments.</p><p></p><p>This could truly be called an unrivaled force from mythical legends.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a phone suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the silent ruins, the ringtone sounded particularly jarring.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, is this Qi Yuan? The martial arts competition has started, why haven't you come? Where are you now?"</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the phone, Xu Tiehua's voice sounded anxious.</p><p></p><p>Besides Xu Tiehua's voice, there was also thunderous cheering in the background, clearly they were at the venue for the city-level competition.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, some disgruntled voices could also be heard.</p><p></p><p>"It's already so late, and he still hasn't come to participate. Brother Xu even has to call him. What a young master indeed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I don't need to participate in the city-level martial arts competition. I've already passed that and only need to participate at the national level," Qi Yuan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>He had gone through the back door via Yang Shan, so he didn't need to participate in the city-level competition and could go straight to the national one.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to pass one test.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Xu Tiehua on the other end was stunned, not expecting this result. "You're... participating at the national level?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua knew Qi Yuan's background as an orphan of a martyr.</p><p></p><p>Apart from having a celebrity girlfriend who was somewhat impressive, the rest of Qi Yuan's family circumstances were just ordinary.</p><p></p><p>How did he manage to go through the back door?</p><p></p><p>"How... did you manage that?" Xu Tiehua couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, because I'm very strong," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan had agreed to Qi Yuan's request to go through the back door also because Qi Yuan was strong enough, having already reached the limit of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Those who had reached the martial arts limit could participate in the martial arts competition through other channels.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, I have a certificate of mental illness. Participating in a national martial arts competition... that's not too much, right?" Qi Yuan said frankly.</p><p></p><p>He was lawful good after all, and never went through the back door.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence on Xu Tiehua's end, then he said: "If that's the case, then... see you at the national competition!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua was skeptical of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe Qi Yuan could skip the city level and participate directly at the national level.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had only been learning martial arts at Mingwu Martial Arts Hall for three months and didn't even have a martial artist certificate. How could he participate in a national level martial arts competition? The call ended.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua looked at the remaining two people and slowly said: "Junior Brother Qi Yuan won't be participating. This time it's just the three of us."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he was unwilling when we kept asking him to practice for the team competition before.</p><p></p><p>It turns out he was scared and didn't dare to participate."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. With his strength, not even having a martial artist certificate, he'd probably get seriously injured just meeting any random competitor and have to lie in bed for half a month. Not coming is a wise choice."</p><p></p><p>The remaining two competitors spoke, their words revealing a hint of disdain for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Deserting before battle was most despicable.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan's phone received another message from Wang Shiqiao.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, you dare to stand up Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>You should know, he's a man who can attend the funeral of Earl Black Crystal.</p><p></p><p>And you... where have you run off to now? You're not really so cowardly that you don't dare participate in the martial arts competition, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm... taking a trip abroad."</p><p></p><p>"Abroad? With your female driver girlfriend? Don't tell me you two are on your honeymoon?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop talking nonsense. I'm in Wugui now."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you really can make things up. If you don't want to say, then don't. Wugui, seriously."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao clearly didn't believe him.</p><p></p><p>War had broken out between Wugui and Yuelang. How could an ordinary person like Qi Yuan go to a war zone?</p><p></p><p>That would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, Wugui was hostile to Qinyuan.</p><p></p><p>For him, a person from Qinyuan, to go to Wugui would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly for a few sentences, Qi Yuan stopped talking. He looked at Kuanghuang and the bearded man and said: "Wenmin is waiting for me up ahead. Let's leave by car."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuang felt a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the ruins here, he nodded firmly: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>The bearded man's face showed a worried expression: "If the people of Wugui find out what happened here, they definitely won't let it go.</p><p></p><p>Especially the laboratory under the dungeon, it's clearly the work of the Wu Religion.</p><p></p><p>It's possible the experiments were conducted with the support of Canxing."</p><p></p><p>Canxing had deep ties with Wugui, this was no longer a secret.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying beast they had just seen, that kind of technology and methods, seemed very much in Canxing's style.</p><p></p><p>Now that the military camp had been destroyed and their experiments exposed,</p><p></p><p>Wugui would definitely not let them off.</p><p></p><p>As for the mysterious Canxing, the bearded man felt even more terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with me here, how could they capture you?" Qi Yuan said casually. "If I didn't have too many things to do, I might even want to pay a visit to the Wu Religion headquarters right now."</p><p></p><p>"Sir must be very careful. Behind Wugui is not only the Ancient Witch Country, but even Canxing. We must not act rashly," the bearded man hurriedly advised.</p><p></p><p>Although Wugui's military strength wasn't strong, they did have some cutting-edge weapons.</p><p></p><p>Near-light-speed photon guns, and missiles that could destroy a large mountain.</p><p></p><p>Any one of these weapons was not something human power could resist.</p><p></p><p>They were even said to be capable of slaying gods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced sideways at the bearded man: "Mm, I'm always very careful and cautious. I don't do things I'm not sure about."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked up at the stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The day for him to form his golden core was also approaching.</p><p></p><p>After forming the golden core, his strength would greatly increase, and he should have some more ability to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>He led the two of them towards the distant town.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Priest... something terrible has happened. Our Force God No. 1 in the experimental area suddenly went berserk, and then... fell silent!"</p><p></p><p>In the Wu Religion, a follower's face was full of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Force God No. 1 was a divine weapon they had created.</p><p></p><p>This kind of weapon was invincible.</p><p></p><p>It had always been developed in secret.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Force God No. 1 suddenly went berserk.</p><p></p><p>And it happened in the military camp. One can imagine what kind of turmoil this would cause.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly contact Guo Tanran and ask what's going on. We must suppress Force God No. 1!" The priest's expression was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Force God No. 1 had actually gone berserk.</p><p></p><p>The follower heard this and his expression became extremely difficult: "We can't contact them. None of the officers in the camp... can be reached.</p><p></p><p>Our squad has already headed to that military camp."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the priest was slightly stunned: "Can't contact them, could it be that... Force God No. 1 has..."</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought arose in the priest's mind, but he quickly suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>Although Force God No. 1 was strong, it was still in its infancy. How could it be compared to an entire military regiment?</p><p></p><p>"The military's people are also rushing there. It shouldn't be long... before we get results."</p><p></p><p>The follower said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, it should just be an accident." The priest breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He guessed that Force God No. 1 must have suddenly awakened and gone berserk, affecting the local communication equipment, which was why everything seemed strange.</p><p></p><p>As long as the squad arrived at the camp, everything would be resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Keep an eye on these matters. Notify me as soon as there's any intelligence. I'm going to see the Holy Child." The Sealing Priest spoke, mentioning the Holy Child with admiration in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Child of the Wu Religion was the most noble person in the religion after the leader.</p><p></p><p>Even they, the twelve priests, were not his equal.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Holy Child had married the daughter of a Canxing general, and his status in the Wu Religion had risen, even surpassing the leader.</p><p></p><p>The priest left the manor and took a special car to another manor.</p><p></p><p>Inside the manor, there was a martial arts training ground.</p><p></p><p>When the Sealing Priest arrived, he looked at the Holy Child in the center of the training ground, and a shocked expression flashed in his eyes: "The Holy Child's strength... has become even more terrifying."</p><p></p><p>The old man beside him said with a smile: "With the gene drugs from Canxing, it won't be long before the Holy Child is on par with deities."</p><p></p><p>In the center of the training ground, the Holy Child let out a great shout.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his eyes turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>He picked up an iron rod, his arms</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He suddenly exerted force.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A loud noise rang out, and the iron rod snapped in response.</p><p></p><p>He had actually crushed the iron rod with his bare hands.</p><p></p><p>This kind of immense strength was simply not humanly possible. Even warriors who had taken high-grade genetic enhancement drugs could not achieve this.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Son's power has grown even more formidable. It won't be long before he can rival the Crow God!" At this moment, the Vessel Priest couldn't help but flatter him.</p><p></p><p>The Crow God was the deity worshipped by the Crow Religion. </p><p></p><p>According to legend, the Crow God could walk while carrying mountains on his back.</p><p></p><p>A trace of pride flashed in the Holy Son's eyes: "Give me enough time, and I will surely surpass the Crow God!"</p><p></p><p>He was full of vigor, but deep in his gaze, there was still a hint of hidden worry.</p><p></p><p>"How is the God Creation Project progressing?" A flash of tension appeared in the Holy Son's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The God Creation Project aimed to create various terrifying giant beasts.</p><p></p><p>These fearsome monsters were not meant to be used as weapons of war, but rather... as nutrients.</p><p></p><p>Nutrients for him.</p><p></p><p>After devouring them, they could greatly enhance his power.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is progressing steadily and well. </p><p></p><p>This war has actually accelerated our progress," the old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In peacetime, doing these things required great caution.</p><p></p><p>But during wartime, the disappearance of a few thousand people was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Vessel also smiled, choosing to conceal the matter of Force God No. 1: "Everything is normal. All the drug slaves have been captured now. We only lack time."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son nodded: "Speed up the progress. After the world resets, in another ten years, spiritual energy will resurge. Cultivators rivaling gods may appear. I must have the power to match them!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this made the Holy Son feel a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>The resurgence of spiritual energy would bring massive changes to the world.</p><p></p><p>According to the Crow God's guidance, at that time, a huge treasure vault would be revealed to the world across the entire Arch Star.</p><p></p><p>Only by mastering power could one control this astonishing treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>"Rivaling gods..." Vessel mused, "The Holy Son will surely surpass the gods!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, these gods are not the weaklings from myths and legends.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary missiles and photon bombs are useless against them.</p><p></p><p>Only the Eye of the Sky and the most advanced weapons from Dazzling Star can deal with them.</p><p></p><p>After all, we're talking about gods among cultivators - Nascent Soul realm powerhouses!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son's face was filled with awe as he mentioned this.</p><p></p><p>He was not a Restarter.</p><p></p><p>But he had Restarters under his control.</p><p></p><p>He knew that in ten years, spatial rifts would open wide, and a large number of cultivators would descend upon the world.</p><p></p><p>Among them would be Nascent Soul powerhouses known as gods.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of missiles striking them would not cause the slightest harm to a Nascent Soul powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Only weapons on the level of the Eye of the Sky could precisely eliminate a Nascent Soul powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son had lofty ambitions. He wanted to rival the gods and surpass the Crow God within ten years!</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Vessel Priest's expression suddenly turned grim.</p><p></p><p>His communicator had sounded, with the highest priority alert.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son glanced at it and said casually, "Go ahead and answer it."</p><p></p><p>The Vessel Priest hurriedly opened the communicator and said in a heavy voice, "What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Priest, something terrible has happened. Force God No. 1... is gone!"</p><p></p><p>"What?!" The Vessel Priest's face changed drastically. He secretly glanced at the Holy Son, a flash of fear in his eyes. His voice suddenly became shrill, "What exactly happened?!</p><p></p><p>Did the people at Xiaohuangtan Military Camp kill Force God No. 1? Where is Guo Tanran? Tell him to come see me!"</p><p></p><p>The Vessel Priest was furious.</p><p></p><p>Force God No. 1 was a treasure, something the Holy Son wanted. It was more precious than all 3,000 soldiers in the entire camp.</p><p></p><p>Even if 3,000 soldiers died, nothing could happen to Force God No. 1!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Priest... Guo Tanran... and everyone at Xiaohuangtan Military Camp... are all dead."</p><p></p><p>"What?!" The Vessel Priest was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>All dead?</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qin Yuan Country recklessly launched an Eye of the Sky attack on Xiaohuangtan Military Camp?</p><p></p><p>"Priest, this is video footage taken by military personnel. I'm sending it to you.</p><p></p><p>I'm also sending you recordings from people in nearby towns..."</p><p></p><p>The Vessel Priest's heart pounded, filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son's gaze also grew profound, mixed with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>That was Xiaohuangtan Military Camp, guarded by over 3,000 soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Even a god-level Nascent Soul powerhouse would have to pay a considerable price to annihilate a military camp of that caliber.</p><p></p><p>Yet Xiaohuangtan Military Camp had been completely wiped out?</p><p></p><p>The Vessel Priest nervously opened the video. The Holy Son immediately leaned in to watch, and the other old man also looked on with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The video showed what was once an iron fortress, now reduced to ruins.</p><p></p><p>Corpses, broken walls, shattered armored vehicles and cannons were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The entire military base had become a land of death.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son's pupils constricted: "This wasn't done by carpet bombing or the Eye of the Sky. What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>The old man was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the video was too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>A military camp guarded by 3,000 soldiers had just... vanished, without a sound.</p><p></p><p>"There's also video recorded by people in nearby towns. Let's take a look," the old man suggested, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>The three immediately turned their attention to the communicator.</p><p></p><p>On the screen of the communicator, everything was bathed in a blood-red light.</p><p></p><p>A sword as huge as a small mountain suddenly slammed into the ground!</p><p></p><p>The entire military base instantly became a blood-red sphere, then... returned to normal in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son's eyes narrowed, revealing a shocked expression: "This is... a god!"</p><p></p><p>This must be the work of a god!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Holy Son felt an intense sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>How could a god-level powerhouse arrive on Arch Star ten years early?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Holy Son felt unsafe and wanted to go to Dazzling Star.</p><p></p><p>After all, only Dazzling Star could truly contend with gods, and even suppress their power!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The car sped along, then suddenly came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>After about a few minutes, Qi Yuan put the severed head into a bag and tossed it to Yaji.</p><p></p><p>"Pack it up properly. This head is worth a million yuan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected this unexpected windfall.</p><p></p><p>They had killed everyone and fled, driving away from Wu Gui Country.</p><p></p><p>There were no pursuers behind them yet.</p><p></p><p>But they encountered some Wu Gui soldiers looking for easy prey up ahead.</p><p></p><p>Those soldiers had stopped Qi Yuan's group's car.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought they could just pay some money and leave.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Qi Yuan discovered that among these soldiers was the guy who had been arguing online with Wang Shiqiao for a month.</p><p></p><p>So he casually took care of that person, even cutting off his head.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao had said that if someone helped her kill that person, she would be willing to pay a million yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now... wasn't that million yuan as good as in hand?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very happy. He hadn't expected that rescuing someone could also earn him extra money.</p><p></p><p>Yaji held the bloodless head, his heart racing, but he just clutched it tightly.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard, meanwhile, was speechless.</p><p></p><p>This head was worth a million yuan?</p><p></p><p>Was it really that valuable? In the military base, there were so many officers. If you just cut off a few of their heads, it would probably be worth more than a few million.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while he found it ridiculous, he still had enough sense not to question Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"These people are truly brazen, daring to rob us," Big Beard couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan suddenly thought of something and said worriedly, "This is bad. I've discovered a fatal flaw. We're in trouble."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Big Beard's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan felt the same. It was rare to see such an expression on Mr. Qi's face.</p><p></p><p>Could there be something that even Mr. Qi couldn't handle?</p><p></p><p>That would be a big problem!</p><p></p><p>"If I'm carrying this head, won't I be unable to pass through security checks? How can I get back to the country?</p><p></p><p>I'm a law-abiding citizen. I can't do anything illegal.</p><p></p><p>But this is worth a million yuan. Do you know how many bowls of beef noodles that could buy?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very reluctant to give it up.</p><p></p><p>He wavered back and forth between morality and profit.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was stunned, then said, "Don't worry, Mr. Qi. I'll help you get this head through security. It won't be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>"You can do it?" Qi Yuan seemed somewhat happy, "Then I'll leave it to you. Remember, don't do anything illegal."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, I'll definitely follow the rules!" Kuanghuan nodded. Having spent so much time with Qi Yuan, he was already familiar with Qi Yuan's style of doing things.</p><p></p><p>Big Beard, on the other hand, was completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>Illegal activities?</p><p></p><p>You've already killed thousands of people... and you're still talking about following the law?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

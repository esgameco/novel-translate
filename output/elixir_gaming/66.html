        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's innate golden energy was already abundant, and he possessed a vigorous golden qi within his body.</p><p></p><p>The golden qi and spiritual power could be interchanged.</p><p></p><p>With a single finger gesture, golden radiance appeared.</p><p></p><p>A golden sword suddenly materialized in his hand! The golden sword was formed from the qi of the five elements of metal.</p><p></p><p>Its edge was incredibly sharp.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Dong Xian saw this scene and widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>What was this? Did Senior Brother Qi Yuan truly transform his qi into a sword? How did he do it?</p><p></p><p>The Vessel Elder in the depths of his soul seemed to ponder something.</p><p></p><p>"This seems to be akin to a martial dao divine technique."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, wielding the qi-transformed sword, slowly said, "Watch as I cleave the flying bird in the sky with a single stroke!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he raised the golden sword towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, a sudden bolt of lightning descended from the clear sky, directly striking towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>On a sunny day, how could there suddenly be lightning? And it was striking at him?</p><p></p><p>This startled Qi Yuan: "Oh no, by raising it high, I've attracted the lightning down."</p><p></p><p>He hastily waved his hand, throwing the golden sword away, letting it fall into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The lightning bolt then struck the golden sword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sword shattered, transforming back into golden qi that dissipated into the air.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly lightning also vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Dong Xian was completely dumbfounded by this sight.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? At this moment, the voice of the Vessel Elder echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Qi Yuan has cultivated some strange forbidden technique, which is why he could transform his qi into a sword, but he was struck by heavenly retribution in the form of lightning.</p><p></p><p>This technique of transforming qi into a sword should never be learned."  The Vessel Elder warned.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian immediately understood. He had once read records in the imperial archives about heavenly lightning.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, heavenly lightning rarely manifested in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But if one cultivated some strange forbidden techniques, it would draw out the appearance of heavenly lightning.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Dong Xian quickly said, "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, you must not continue practicing this qi-transformation sword technique, for it is a forbidden method that the heavens do not permit."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Dong Xian was still trembling in fear, worried that Qi Yuan might be struck dead by the lightning.</p><p></p><p>The Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak, would he still tolerate him? And the Vessel Elder in his mind felt extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>Logically, the heavenly retribution should have struck the one who cultivated the forbidden technique.</p><p></p><p>Yet the lightning only struck the sword that Qi Yuan had thrown away, and not Qi Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Dong Xian's words, Qi Yuan had a peculiar expression: "Shouldn't it be because I raised the sword high, and the sword being a conductor, that it attracted the heavenly lightning down? Could it be that this is truly a forbidden technique?"</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Dong Xian did not understand the first half of Qi Yuan's words, but he understood the latter half, and he emphasized, "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, you should refrain from practicing this technique in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian felt relieved that he had made Qi Yuan demonstrate it first. If Qi Yuan had taught him the cultivation method of this technique, and he had cultivated it blindly, he might have been struck by lightning before even transforming the qi into a sword!</p><p></p><p>The "qi-transformation horse" that Qi Yuan mentioned was probably... the idea of being struck by lightning while riding a horse and not being able to escape easily. "Senior, I shall take my leave now." Dong Xian bid farewell to Qi Yuan and quickly flew away.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, madmen were not only dangerous to provoke, but also unsafe to be around for too long.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan sat on the ground, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Transforming qi into a sword!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he stood up, transforming qi into a sword!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly lightning descended once again without any warning.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hastily threw the sword away, and the lightning instantly shattered the sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan witnessed this scene: "It seems this is truly a forbidden technique!"</p><p></p><p>However, there was no sense of disappointment in his eyes, but rather an intense excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I am truly a genius, for I have created a divine technique!"</p><p></p><p>"This technique shall be called, 'I am the Father of Heavenly Lightning, I strike wherever I point!'"</p><p></p><p>He condensed another golden sword, and the heavenly lightning descended from the sky once more.</p><p></p><p>"Strike there!"</p><p></p><p>He threw the sword, and the lightning swiftly struck, destroying the indestructible golden sword.</p><p></p><p>"No, I need to change the name. This heavenly lightning is like a dog, I can't call myself its father."</p><p></p><p>His swords were like bones, and the heavenly lightning was like a dog.</p><p>He would throw the sword, and the lightning would pounce on it.</p><p></p><p>How intriguing.</p><p></p><p>"I am truly a genius, for I have created a secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the heavenly lightning was far greater than the power of his qi-transformation sword.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was that this secret technique could not be used in the game.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have given the primordial humans and the Extradimensional Heavenly Demons a little shock.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yin-Yang Forbidden.</p><p></p><p>Ying looked at Qi Yuan and slowly said, "The Yin-Yang Boundary Stone is now in your possession.</p><p></p><p>With the Yin-Yang Boundary Stone, and by comprehending life and death, seeing the great terror between life and death, you can truly master the Yin-Yang Forbidden."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held a common-looking stone in his hand, with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>[The Yin-Yang Boundary Stone, a peculiar stone within the Yin-Yang Forbidden.]</p><p></p><p>"How do I comprehend life and death, and see through life and death?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I do not know." Ying shook her head. "That depends on your own comprehension."</p><p></p><p>Ying finished speaking and retreated into the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Yin-Yang Boundary Stone, led by Little Bride, and left the place.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending life and death, could this mean that I have to die?" </p><p></p><p>He held the Yin-Yang Boundary Stone and thought for a moment, then picked up the great treasure sword and stabbed himself, creating a hole in his body.</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Little Bride immediately revealed an expression of apparent anxiety.</p><p></p><p>She instantly covered Qi Yuan's body with her red armor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's wound also disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride had actively merged with him, entering a defensive stance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan felt a pain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His wound had been healed by the armor...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jia was replaced.</p><p></p><p>"Little Jia, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have hurt myself."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that upon hearing Qi Yuan's words, Little Jia released the fusion. She clung tightly to Qi Yuan, silently nestling against him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embraced Little Jia, and when he saw that she was unharmed, he said, "It was my fault, I didn't consider it thoroughly enough. Now that I have a wife, I can't just do things based on my own preferences."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he started to laugh.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia didn't know why he was laughing, she just clung to him.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan was lost in thought: "How exactly should I control the Yin-Yang Prohibition?"</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean I have to grasp the true essence of Yin and Yang, and speak in a Yin-Yang manner?"</p><p></p><p>As a person of positive energy, how could he speak in a Yin-Yang manner?</p><p>He couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, something unexpected happened to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I've changed maps?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly appeared in the teleportation array, and the destination was the forbidden land of the Four Prohibitions and Two Absolutes... the Heavenly Absolute! "I haven't fully mastered the Yin-Yang Prohibition yet, but I've already gone to a new map. Does that mean I've completed this instance?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very confused.</p><p></p><p>"Or does that mean, as long as I've grasped the Yin-Yang Talisman, I've broken through the Yin-Yang Prohibition?</p><p>But I haven't received the reward of the Heavenly Dao Fragment yet."</p><p></p><p>"Trash game, it's bugged, isn't it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the game must have a bug.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and sent a message to Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"Jinli, you need to be careful, this game has a lot of bugs. I haven't even broken through the Yin-Yang Prohibition yet, but I've been teleported to a new map, the Heavenly Absolute."</p><p></p><p>After sending the message, Qi Yuan embraced Little Jia.</p><p>After all, he had been teleported to the Heavenly Absolute, and there was still some time.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Jinli's reply came: "The Heavenly Absolute? You must be careful. Do you want me to send the Imperial Guards to the Heavenly Absolute to help you!"</p><p></p><p>She didn't use the word "dispatch", but "send", because she always remembered that the Imperial Guards originally belonged to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No need, they're too weak." Qi Yuan decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>The strongest in the Imperial Guards was only at the Supremacy Monarch level, and they didn't even have a Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After accepting the level classification of the NPCs, Qi Yuan gradually became accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, seeing Qi Yuan's message, Jinli fell silent for a moment, then said, "In the Heavenly Absolute, it's extremely dangerous. There is a Transcendence Platform there, and you must never step onto it. </p><p>If you step onto it... it is rumored that you will transcend and leave this world. </p><p>As for the specifics of the transcendence, no one knows."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this and replied, "I understand, don't worry, we haven't even met in person yet, how could I possibly transcend and leave."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the constantly busy and warring Jinli, whose heart had been calm, rippled again.</p><p>She looked out the window, and the ancient Qi Chun trees seemed to cover the entire Wangyue Continent, the trees were dotted with stars, like a giant Christmas tree covered in lights, very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, we'll meet under the ancient Qi Chun trees... The scenery there is especially beautiful, the most beautiful place in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Really? I'm really looking forward to it." Qi Yuan also wanted to know how beautiful the scenery under the ancient Qi Chun trees was, and what the Jinli he had never met before looked like.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted, and time flew by quickly.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Absolute is almost here, bye, talk to you later."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed the chat interface, and with Little Jia by his side, his gaze became more alert.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifted, and he appeared in an endless desert.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Heavenly Absolute?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sky, and saw a huge floating platform in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>No, calling it a city would not be accurate, it was a gigantic suspended platform.</p><p></p><p>The platform was jet-black, but this kind of black had an eerie quality, as if it had been stained with blood.</p><p>How much blood would it take to dye such a platform completely red?</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Transcendence Platform?" Qi Yuan looked at the platform, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a majestic voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Halt, visitor!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw a golden-armored man appear not far from him.</p><p></p><p>The man was tall and imposing, clad in golden armor, exuding an aura of great dignity, but he only had one arm, the other arm seemed to have been severed by someone.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Gatekeeper of the White Day Transcendence Platform, a general under the Great Sun!" The golden-armored man spoke in a thunderous voice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the golden-armored man, his heart on alert.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun?</p><p>The White Day Phantasm Incantation he had obtained was from the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>But from the memories of Long Pan and Sang Hua and others, the Ten Great Generals of the Heavenly Deities did not include this one.</p><p>This general seemed to be in a state of remnant consciousness, similar to Jin Zu, not a living being.</p><p></p><p>"To ascend the White Day Transcendence Platform, one must endure 12,960 battles and emerge victorious in each! </p><p>If you succeed, you may ascend the platform! Are you willing to challenge it? Once you ascend, life and death will no longer matter!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no interest in ascending the Transcendence Platform.</p><p>Jinli had also told him that the Transcendence Platform might be dangerous.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "I want to control the Heavenly Absolute, not ascend the Transcendence Platform. How can I control the Heavenly Absolute?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored general replied mechanically, as if without true sentience, "Ascend the White Day Transcendence Platform, defeat me, and you shall become the lord of the Heavenly Absolute!"</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Qi Yuan stared at the golden-armored general.</p><p></p><p>It seems he had no choice but to ascend the Transcendence Platform.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, the NPCs shouldn't be lying, right? The game's designers wouldn't be that cruel to the players, would they?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the game's graphics and the predictable plot, Qi Yuan couldn't help but think that the game's artists must all be riding the designers to work.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 564</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The irritable big-bearded man also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He was already very irritable, with a bad temper, and had never thought that in this situation, he would attack the Black Sky Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, in this kind of battle in the void sea, the Shenmu Universe would avoid it if possible.</p><p></p><p>There had been hardly any initiative to take action.</p><p></p><p>"If the Realm Lord can act on his own initiative while ensuring his own safety, he can do so freely." Finally, Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The irritable big-bearded man also added, "Realm Lord, be very careful, the void sea is complex, and the slightest carelessness will lead to being crushed to pieces."</p><p></p><p>This irritable big-bearded man had also started to advise Qi Yuan to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, okay, I'll go take a look at the so-called Black Sky Black Earth army."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not speak further, and walked alone in the void sea.</p><p></p><p>In the void sea, it was chaotic, with all kinds of luminous spots, colorful and dazzling.</p><p></p><p>These luminous spots seemed to be fragments of broken rules, or the primordial matter before the opening of chaos, full of danger.</p><p></p><p>They could even corrode the body of a Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed quickly, and Qi Yuan's figure stopped.</p><p></p><p>The seven Ren Qi Guang were emitting a terrifying aura, like a scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked ahead and saw a huge battleship traversing the cold void sea.</p><p></p><p>That battleship was huge, even larger than the Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky Black Earth is indeed formidable, such a massive battleship... If it were to fall from the sky, wouldn't it crush ten thousand ants?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Holding the seven Ren Qi Guang, the void sea environment around Qi Yuan changed, and he seemed like the moon surrounded by stars.</p><p></p><p>The scorching light, contrasting with him, made him appear like a war god.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord, just confront them, blocking the battleship's advance will do!" Yuan reminded.</p><p></p><p>The irritable big-bearded man also hurriedly said, "Realm Lord, you must remain calm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the ominous battleship, his gaze deep: "I want to confront them, but they have to agree, don't they?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that there is an unexpected situation?</p><p></p><p>The other ancestral gods' thoughts were also quickly turning, seemingly realizing something.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice fell.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a towering figure flew out from the battleship.</p><p></p><p>Eternal burning flames, cracking and popping, the colorful luminous spots in the void sea were all blown away.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying flame giant roared: "Qi Yuan, die!"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord furiously attacked.</p><p></p><p>This kind of supremely powerful being attacking, domineering and extraordinary, without any reason.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, the surrounding space turned into a sea of flames.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Realm Lord realm, one can already influence the environment and rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Flame Realm Lord were to sneeze, it could turn a cultivation world the size of the Qinglan Realm into a realm of flames that would burn for billions of years without extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>This is just a casual sneeze, if he were to attack, the might of his flames would be able to devour everything.</p><p></p><p>A strong scorching sensation came, and even with Qi Yuan's strength, he could feel the heat.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Fire, able to burn through heaven and earth, Qi Yuan... where can you run, obediently be burned by my flames!"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord let out a loud roar, and flames were everywhere in the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan unleashed the rules he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he also transformed into a man of fire.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'm indeed being burned, and have become a man of fire." Qi Yuan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>He did not use the Ren Qi Guang, but only Absolute Adaptation, fighting fire with fire.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord was stunned, his expression furious: "Die!"</p><p></p><p>The flames became even more vigorous, ten times, a hundred times more powerful than before! Qi Yuan's kind of rule, the Flame Realm Lord had seen similar ones before.</p><p></p><p>However, most were just crude imitations.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged, his gaze shifting: "You're a bit hard to kill, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see a lot.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Realm Lord realm, they were not that easy to kill.</p><p></p><p>Unless the power gap between them was too great.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan had just advanced to the Wanwu Realm, to kill the Flame Realm Lord of the Rule Realm, it would take at least a day.</p><p></p><p>This was too slow for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're hard to kill too." The Flame Realm Lord said seriously.</p><p></p><p>What he understood as hard to kill was different from Qi Yuan's understanding.</p><p></p><p>What he understood was that with his strength, even if he stood at the edge of the universe, it would be difficult to defeat each other.</p><p></p><p>"But... even if you're hard to kill, I, the Sovereign, will kill you!" The Flame Realm Lord's eyes burned even more fiercely, with a sinister expression, "I have the Deviant Source, I do not fear death, what do you have?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the void sea, Yuan and Sheng Nü and the other ancestral gods' expressions suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, this Flame Realm Lord has gone mad, he's going to exchange his life for yours!"</p><p></p><p>"How could this be, is the one revived by the Deviant Source him? How could he be so unwise?"</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord, retreat quickly, don't fight him, stay away from the Flame Realm Lord!" Yuan hurriedly reminded.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral gods present were on edge.</p><p></p><p>Between Realm Lords, no one can really harm the other, but if one side doesn't care about their life and consumes their source rules in a self-destructive manner, then one time would be enough to severely injure an opponent of the same level, twice... would definitely lead to mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Black Sky Black Earth had not used this method, because no one knew whether the one revived by the Deviant Source was still themselves.</p><p></p><p>But the Flame Realm Lord didn't care about that.</p><p></p><p>"Wukong, lend me the Deviant Source to block this person's retreat!" The Flame Realm Lord roared.</p><p></p><p>The Wukong Realm Lord, with an expression devoid of joy or sorrow, sent the Deviant Source into the Flame Realm Lord's hand, and his towering figure just happened to block Qi Yuan's path.</p><p></p><p>"With me here, he won't be able to escape." Wukong Realm Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do?" Qi Yuan had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, don't you know?" The Flame Realm Lord's expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>"This is too unwise of you." Qi Yuan pretended to be frightened.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was about to bloom with joy.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, this is my uncle Qiaohuang, or rather, Qiaohuang's main body, just as foolish as Qiaohuang.</p><p></p><p>To actually self-destruct, not knowing... do I have a blood-locking pendant?</p><p></p><p>The more severe the injury, the more terrifying the Absolute Adaptation empowered by the Death Brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"The seven Ren Qi Guang can help you block seven times of my rule dissolution, but what about after the seventh time?"</p><p></p><p>Rule dissolution, that is, the Realm Lord self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>Realm Lord self-destruction is not an explosion of the body, but a dissolution of the rules.</p><p></p><p>The power released by the dissolution of the rules is no less than a great earthquake in the dimensions of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"To kill you, I specifically borrowed the Deviant Source from the Wukong Realm Lord, enough to support my rule dissolution thirty times... how will you survive?"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord roared, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression became serious: "No, don't!"</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to act a bit more real, saying something like "Is the one revived by the Deviant Source still you?", but was afraid that the words would be too harsh and scare the Flame Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>So he could only keep saying "No, don't!" Inwardly, he was thinking, "Come on, self-destruct! After all, it would take a day to kill me, but self-destruction only takes an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The Flame Realm Lord let out a roar.</p><p></p><p>Endless and boundless flame rules were dissolved at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The void sea seemed to sway.</p><p></p><p>The majestic battleship also seemed to be shaken by this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this and held the Ren Qi Guang.</p><p></p><p>"Block for me!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, all the rule dissolutions were blocked by his own body.</p><p></p><p>Death.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dazzling light and absolute adaptation, what he fears the least is someone weaker than him self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if someone ten times stronger than him self-destructs, this blood probably can't be contained.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a massive amount of experience poured in.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>This was even more refreshing than killing the Qihuang people for several years.</p><p></p><p>They are indeed family, equally stupid.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the figure of the Flame Realm Lord appeared again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was no different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan's eyes could only detect a slight subtle difference between this person and the previous Flame Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord looked at the dimly lit Qi Yuan with a surprised expression and then said, "The person who ignites the light is a bit stronger than I imagined. It seems that the mysterious source in my hands is not enough."</p><p></p><p>He was not in a hurry at all.</p><p></p><p>There was plenty of mysterious source on the battleship.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he could borrow from other Yang gods.</p><p></p><p>He could just exhaust Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Come again!" The Flame Realm Lord roared loudly, like a brilliant and shattered firework.</p><p></p><p>"Block for me!" Qi Yuan roared again, but in his heart, he really wanted to say to the Flame Realm Lord, "Don't say anything before you self-destruct? If you think it's not cool, can I dub for you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the virtual sea, the usually calm Yuan was also a bit unstable.</p><p></p><p>"The person who ignites the light can only block... Estimated 15 rule dissolutions, the remaining... It will be difficult for the Realm Lord to block!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this Black Sky Black Earth has no sense of honor!"</p><p></p><p>"The Void Realm Lord has also blocked Qi Yuan Master's retreat route, the Realm Lord can't escape at all!"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's mood was very heavy.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, the determination of Black Sky Black Earth was great, with the intention of completely slaying Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a woman's voice suddenly sounded in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... This matter can seek the help of the Radiant Dao Master. Only the Radiant Dao Master can save Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods immediately looked into the void, and saw a woman who resembled Yuan to some extent standing in the void.</p><p></p><p>She was dressed in a bloody robe, looking charming and alluring.</p><p></p><p>"Wan!"</p><p></p><p>The ancestral gods present were moved.</p><p></p><p>This person was surprisingly the leader of the Radiant Society, "Wan", Yuan's sister.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Society and the Qi Huan Society have always been in opposition.</p><p></p><p>Although these people were surprised to see Wan appear, they were not terrified.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>As for the mighty existence of the Radiant Dao Master, Yuan could not fathom his mentality at all.</p><p></p><p>However, since he wanted to see him, he must have to give up something.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would the Radiant Dao Master intervene?</p><p></p><p>Now, the Flame Realm Lord was self-destructing, and the time left for him was not much.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hesitate any longer.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Yuan agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, he also understood that this was just Wan's suggestion, and the Radiant Dao Master might not necessarily lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Light Void Symbol." Wan looked at Yuan and threw a symbol.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Yuan used the Light Void Symbol.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the environment around him changed.</p><p></p><p>When he appeared again, it was as if he had appeared in a world of dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>This world seemed to be entirely constructed of light.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant and beautiful, unlike the light of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"Leader of the Radiant Society, I request an audience with the Unilluminated Lord!" Wan said softly.</p><p></p><p>As her words fell, a child of about six or seven years old walked over.</p><p></p><p>Rosy lips and white teeth, fine hair, not black, but all white.</p><p></p><p>The child's body seemed untouched by any light.</p><p></p><p>The Unilluminated Realm Lord, the child of the Radiant Dao Master, was an Yang god at the Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>He smiled gently, "I already know the purpose of your visit."</p><p></p><p>"Please, Unilluminated Lord..."</p><p></p><p>"Stop." The Unilluminated Realm Lord raised his short, chubby, and white finger, and the smile on his face did not fade, "I will not intervene."</p><p></p><p>Wan's expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>She did not expect the result to be like this.</p><p></p><p>Yuan gritted his teeth and said, "The Divine Wood Universe is willing to pay the price that pleases the Lord!"</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Unilluminated Realm Lord was bargaining.</p><p></p><p>Now time was running out, no matter how reluctant, he had to make sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, the Unilluminated Realm Lord shook his head, "It's not a matter of price."</p><p></p><p>Yuan and Wan were both stunned, not understanding the meaning of the Unilluminated Realm Lord's words.</p><p></p><p>"You follow me and see." The Unilluminated Realm Lord waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the scene in front of the three of them changed.</p><p></p><p>"Look... The line drawn by the Patriarch before."</p><p></p><p>The Unilluminated Realm Lord's chubby white finger pointed in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Yuan and Wan looked over, and their expressions froze, revealing horror and despair.</p><p></p><p>Even the usually calm Yuan now looked as pale as death.</p><p></p><p>"The line... is gone... How is this possible, didn't it have more than ten thousand years left?" Wan exclaimed anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Patriarch had drawn a line.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch had once said that the line was slowly disappearing, and when the line completely disappeared, that would be the time when the Black Sky "awakened" and truly devoured the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Black Earth was just a parasite on the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky was the true terror, and even the Radiant Dao Master was unwilling to confront it directly.</p><p></p><p>According to the speed of the line's disappearance, the Divine Wood Universe should have had at least ten thousand years left.</p><p></p><p>But now... Only a trace remained, which meant that the Black Sky could "awaken" at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, in the next breath.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle in the virtual sea was no longer important.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that the Black Sky was about to awaken... How would the Divine Wood Universe cope?</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Wan murmured to herself, "The Patriarch is omniscient and omnipotent, how could the judgment be wrong?"</p><p></p><p>She was in despair.</p><p></p><p>In Wan's eyes, the Patriarch was an omniscient and omnipotent existence.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch could restart the universe with a word, and reverse the rules with a word.</p><p></p><p>But now, the line drawn by the Patriarch had not followed the original trajectory, how could she not be shocked, only hoping that everything was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The Unilluminated Realm Lord shook his head, "The Patriarch's omniscience and omnipotence are limited to the Radiant Universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the Black Sky... It's very special, even the Patriarch can easily misjudge it."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuan's expression changed from numb to calm, and he looked at Wan seriously, "Please send me back to the Taixing Domain."</p><p></p><p>Now that the line drawn by the Patriarch had disappeared, he needed to tell the Qi Huan Society about this.</p><p></p><p>The time left for them was not much, perhaps... less than a day.</p><p></p><p>Yuan also didn't expect that a normal confrontation would evolve into a great battle, and then evolve into an apocalypse.</p><p></p><p>"This Light Void Symbol is for you." Wan gritted her teeth and handed the symbol to Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Yuan thanked him and his figure dissipated at that moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his mood was very complicated.</p><p></p><p>The remaining time for the Divine Wood Universe was too short, only one day... How should they break the deadlock?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough... I almost died just now, Flame Realm Lord, you are so mighty!" Qi Yuan said, with fresh blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord's face was solemn, and there was an angry expression in his eyes, "You're tricking me!"</p><p></p><p>He had self-destructed 23 times, but each time Qi Yuan seemed to be on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Although his rationality and the insight of a Realm Lord level told him that Qi Yuan was really about to die, he still felt that the other party was tricking him!</p><p></p><p>How could he block his several rule dissolutions while being half-dead?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

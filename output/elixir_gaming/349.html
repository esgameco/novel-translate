        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang's gaze suddenly fell upon a young boy and girl.</p><p></p><p>There was a trace of excitement in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xuantian Sect had declined for too long.</p><p></p><p>They were unable to recruit many good prospects in the Fire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>So they had placed their hopes on this new world.</p><p></p><p>Having Wang Zhiqi was already an unexpected delight.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing two more with even higher talent than Wang Zhiqi, how could she not be excited?</p><p></p><p>Especially since these two were in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>Tianyue City was the source of recruits for the Xuantian Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Principal, you mean those two?" Wang Zhiqi's eyes showed a look of pleasant surprise. "What a coincidence, I know those two people. They're refugees that Brother Qi Yuan brought back from Wugui Country!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, who is Qi Yuan?" Xie Tang asked casually, her gaze still fixed on those two.</p><p></p><p>"He's my neighbor, my dad's good friend, and also the owner of that internet-famous cat. He's... super handsome! Last time my best friend saw him, she even said she wanted to confess to him! But hehe, when Brother Qi Yuan came back last time, he had married an extremely beautiful wife. My best friend cried her eyes out!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi spoke animatedly about this.</p><p></p><p>That best friend of hers had a romance-obsessed brain.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, in middle school she liked street punks who rode modified scooters; in high school she liked the biology teacher.</p><p></p><p>Probably in college, she'll fall for the military training instructor.</p><p></p><p>"Oh really? He's quite lucky to have picked up these two good prospects!" Xie Tang wasn't interested in Qi Yuan. The only thing she cared about were those two ordinary people with exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"People from the Fighting God Sect, hm? And the Carefree Wanderer!"</p><p></p><p>She suddenly discovered that next to the young boy and girl was a nemesis she greatly disliked.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Jiang Qingjiao of the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>The other was a famous independent cultivator known as the Carefree Wanderer.</p><p></p><p>This independent cultivator was extremely powerful, a Divine Infant stage expert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Carefree Wanderer was performing a magic technique. A small bird appeared out of thin air in his hand, with a flower in its beak, looking quite adorable.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how did friends from the Fighting God Sect come to my Tianyue City?"</p><p></p><p>After watching for a while, Xie Tang directly led Wang Zhiqi over.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Jiang Qingjiao with an unfriendly expression, her tone full of displeasure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xie Tang, Jiang Qingjiao raised his head. His expression showed surprise, then became composed: "So it's the Second Immortal Lady Gui Xing of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Senior Carefree Wanderer happened to encounter these two and wants to take them as disciples, so this poor Daoist came along to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Oh, as for Tianyue... your junior brother lost to my junior brother, so why can't I come to Tianyue?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao's words were full of aggression.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, hearing Jiang Qingjiao's words, Xie Tang became furious: "Our Xuantian Sect didn't lose Tianyue!"</p><p></p><p>The smile in Jiang Qingjiao's eyes grew even more pronounced: "Since Immortal Lady Xing is here, why don't we seize the day and have a match? Perhaps... Tianyue will fall into our Fighting God Sect's hands!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xie Tang's face turned ashen.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao was the holy son of the Fighting God Sect, the strongest of the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>And she, Xie Tang, was far inferior to Jiang Qingjiao.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuantian Sect, only her senior sister Xie Xinsu could suppress Jiang Qingjiao.</p><p></p><p>After her senior sister went missing, there was a gap in the strongest of the younger generation of the Xuantian Sect, naturally unable to compare with the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>So if Xie Tang acted rashly now and was provoked by Jiang Qingjiao into a duel, it would be asking for humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, faced with this kind of insult, she could only grit her teeth and swallow it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the smile in Jiang Qingjiao's eyes grew even more pronounced: "As for these two, if Senior Carefree Wanderer loses interest and is unwilling to take them as disciples, then... it should be our Fighting God Sect's turn.</p><p></p><p>Unless our Fighting God Sect doesn't want them, only then would you have a chance."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao was full of confidence and extremely domineering, his tone as if he had Xie Tang completely figured out.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang was speechless, so angry she wanted to attack.</p><p></p><p>But she understood that Jiang Qingjiao was deliberately provoking her, forcing her to make a move.</p><p></p><p>If she was defeated, she would at most suffer some humiliation, but causing her sect to lose its source of recruits was something she could not accept.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yaji, who had been silent all along, held his sister's hand and looked at Jiang Qingjiao, his tone firm: "I've said before, I won't take him as my master, and I definitely won't join any Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Don't waste any more time on me, it's not worth it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao was slightly taken aback, not expecting an ordinary person to dare speak to him like this.</p><p></p><p>He felt displeased.</p><p></p><p>However, he still concealed it well: "Join us, and you'll have unimaginable benefits.</p><p></p><p>Power, wealth, beauty, as long as you want it, it will all be within your grasp!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't need any of that. My life was saved by the master, it belongs to the master!" Yaji's voice was firm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the master's kindness, just the master's strength was far beyond what these few magicians could compare to.</p><p></p><p>The master had said he wanted his blood.</p><p></p><p>So his blood would flow for the master.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, if you take me as your master, you can better repay that master of yours." The Carefree Wanderer's expression was kindly. "However, in this life, one should live for oneself. Being carefree and unfettered is most important.</p><p></p><p>Your master saved your life, his kindness is as heavy as a mountain, that's true.</p><p></p><p>But you can follow me and learn martial arts. In a few decades, what difficulty would there be in repaying him with a mountain of gold?"</p><p></p><p>Yaji still firmly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Without Qi Yuan's consent, even if the Jade Emperor came, it wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, disappointment flashed in the Carefree Wanderer's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His patience was exhausted, and he also somewhat disliked Yaji's blindly loyal personality, which was unsuitable for his great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, it seems you and I... truly have some fate but no destiny." The Carefree Wanderer sighed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Jiang Qingjiao was delighted.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in a few days, the Carefree Wanderer would completely extinguish the idea of taking disciples.</p><p></p><p>At that time, wouldn't these two obediently join their Fighting God Sect?</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't be as conciliatory as the Carefree Wanderer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the Fighting God Sect couldn't get them, then... other sects shouldn't expect to get them either.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>White clouds rolled, fine rain fell gently, spring scenery was endless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan savored the young girl's lips, occasionally brushing aside the waterfall-like black hair on her chest and leaning in. At these times, the golden canary pretending to be Ning Tao seemed unable to resist, sitting on Qi Yuan's lap as if wanting to push him away yet also wanting to hold him tighter.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, the lovemaking ended. The young girl's lingering affection had not yet dissipated. She curled up in Qi Yuan's arms like a little cat, listening to Qi Yuan's stories of what happened in the world of death energy.</p><p></p><p>"You should have spared the life of the Xijiang fish woman."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, why?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say you wanted to introduce a very wow wife to Han Xianyun? This young lady thinks she was quite wow."</p><p></p><p>"...You have a point!" Qi Yuan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>A fish head woman, with a pair of jade feet, was indeed very wow.</p><p></p><p>"Next time I enter a mission world, I'll pay attention and see if I can find a wife for Han Xianyun." Qi Yuan was always very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered someone suitable in the mission world, he would play matchmaker for Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>Although the two might be separated by space and time, that wasn't something Qi Yuan needed to worry about.</p><p></p><p>If their love was strong enough, they could meet even if separated by the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Appearing at the end of the earth was fine, but appearing at the corner of the sea was somewhat</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan acting as matchmaker, Han Xianyun and Wasa's wife had never met, so how strong their feelings were wasn't something for him to consider.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I brought out some stones and wood from the stronghold, take a look." Qi Yuan embraced Goldfinch and casually waved his hand, tossing out the scraps he had picked up from the stronghold. He wanted Goldfinch to research these things.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if Goldfinch could use them to enter the Death Qi World.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch's expression also changed from her previous relaxed coyness to seriousness, with a unique quality reminiscent of a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>After about a dozen breaths, a look of surprise appeared in Goldfinch's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of ages!"</p><p></p><p>"Time?" Qi Yuan was also slightly stunned. </p><p></p><p>Anything involving time and space was generally not easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch's divine domain involved time.</p><p></p><p>So, Goldfinch, now a great venerable, already stood in a very high position among Yin Gods based on her divine domain alone.</p><p></p><p>As long as no myths appeared, she stood undefeated.</p><p></p><p>"A very rich aura of ages, this young lady... is far inferior!" Mentioning this, Goldfinch's voice became somewhat disheartened and dejected, with a hint of hidden worry.</p><p></p><p>She was concerned that there might be terrifying existences in the Death Qi World that could be unfavorable to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan not see Goldfinch's worry? He stroked her nose: "It's just a game, nothing to it."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's still a bit annoying. This young lady wants to become stronger and stronger. Ah, why can't this young lady just swallow a sun in one gulp!"</p><p></p><p>"Trying to compete with my business, are you?" Qi Yuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"No, this young lady must study hard, must crack it soon and enter the Death Qi World."</p><p></p><p>As Goldfinch spoke, she struggled to get up and then put on her school uniform.</p><p></p><p>She looked full of energy and passion.</p><p></p><p>She stood in front of the mirror, examining herself, and also looking at Qi Yuan through the mirror: "Blood Pearl, this young lady is... going to school!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't go." Qi Yuan smiled, knowing full well Goldfinch's little thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Sure enough, hearing this, a joyful expression appeared on Goldfinch's face.</p><p></p><p>"The school was blown up by Little Bird with explosives, don't go." Qi Yuan casually made up an excuse.</p><p></p><p>"You said it." In the end, Goldfinch didn't go to school.</p><p></p><p>After nearly a year apart, with Qi Yuan's return, how could she bear to leave him alone to go to school?</p><p></p><p>In this world, nothing was more important than Blood Pearl.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted, talking about everything under the sun.</p><p></p><p>Around nightfall, Qi Yuan took out his phone.</p><p></p><p>"I've been gone for nearly a year, I wonder if anyone has tried to contact me."</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch was lying in Qi Yuan's arms at this time, eyes closed in sleep, her long eyelashes looking quite beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan knew she was pretending to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scrolled through his phone.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, although he had been gone for nearly a year, the messages he received could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>One was asking him to endorse clothing, a women's clothing brand called Chelsea preparing to enter the men's market. Seeing that he had won the martial arts competition championship and had a good image, they wanted him to be their spokesperson.</p><p></p><p>The last message was from six months ago.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to reply and simply deleted it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the brand name was too weird; he had thought it was selling shoes.</p><p></p><p>There was one wishing him happy birthday, from an unknown number.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned. He called out.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One."</p><p></p><p>"Master, Zero One is here to serve you."</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, Zero One stopped her hand holding the cat teaser, standing respectfully outside.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu, seeing the cat teaser fall to the ground, quickly bit the red feather in her mouth, very urgently, as if afraid someone would snatch it away.</p><p></p><p>"Who sent me this text message? The number is 456..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan told Zero One the phone number.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, Master. Zero One will serve you."</p><p></p><p>Zero One operated at full capacity, starting to collect various information based on this phone number.</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes, Zero One's voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have packaged the information about the owner of this phone number and sent it to you. Please check."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly opened the data.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch, who had been pretending to sleep, also leaned her head over, seemingly curious about the person who had wished Qi Yuan a happy birthday.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the photo, Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this my blind date, Xiao Mei?"</p><p></p><p>In the photo was a tall woman with quite high looks.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately remembered who she was.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had arranged to meet his blind date Xiao Mei at Qin Deji. He had even borrowed 300,000 from Xiao Mei.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Mei was very nice, not only lending him the money but also paying for the meal.</p><p></p><p>"She's not wishing me a happy birthday on the surface but actually reminding me to pay her back, is she?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a bit embarrassed. He hadn't initially planned to pay back the borrowed money.</p><p></p><p>Now that she had hinted at it, it would be quite socially embarrassing if he didn't repay it.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, it's so unfair. Why do even mentally ill people have to repay borrowed money?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan complained, continuing to look at the woman's information.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder she lent you money, she's the sister of your innate seed." Ning Tao tilted her head and said.</p><p></p><p>The data showed that this woman was from the military, always engaged in infiltration and undercover work against Canxing, as well as taking on some military missions.</p><p></p><p>And she had another identity, which was that she was the disciple of the deceased parents of Qi Yuan's innate seed body.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, she had already been transferred from undercover work before I won the championship." Qi Yuan continued reading the data.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Seven Martial Star families knew about the tall woman's relationship with Qi Yuan and had transferred her from dangerous work to a department with more money, ease, and real power.</p><p></p><p>"She's even been to the Death Qi World and has now... become a cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the information, Qi Yuan felt that this sister's experiences were quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Before the blind date, she was already a member of the Death Qi World.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, unlike others in the Death Qi World, she, like Qi Yuan, often lived in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Recently, when the cultivation world descended, she even joined a cultivation sect with her impressive talent, becoming a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This sister's background could be considered quite colorful.</p><p></p><p>"Is she currently on a mission in the Death Qi World?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put down the information, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"She's learned cultivation methods, her skills are diverse, she should have no problem completing the mission," Ning Tao said beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I hope this mission of hers takes a while. The 300,000 in the bank account, the interest is not small," Qi Yuan was still a bit reluctant about the money.</p><p></p><p>The later she returned, the later he would have to repay, and he could eat more interest.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch smiled gently: "I hope she encounters a red-staff demon slayer who takes away her mission target!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned, his expression solemn: "In that case, if I take away the mission target, wouldn't I become a great villain?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"They've been in the mission world for a year, what if their Alipay loans default? If those people call their parents, wouldn't they be socially dead?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was deeply worried. He always considered many aspects when doing things.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 530</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The carriage traveled along the wide street.</p><p></p><p>The young man had a gentle smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Of the thirteen states under heaven, Dingbo State has the most upright administration, and the people live in peace and prosperity."</p><p></p><p>Chichangle was slender, with sunken eyes, and his long robe hung on him like a clothes rack.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked out the window, and although the various peddlers on the streets were in coarse linen clothes, there were few who looked sallow and emaciated.</p><p></p><p>If he were to take off his clothes, judging by his physique alone, Chichangle would appear to be the poorest.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed much better than other places," Qiyuan commented.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Ninghe County, Fengshan Prefecture, or Yeshan Lake, they did not seem as good as this prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Dingbo State, also known as Liuzhou," Chichangle said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>This "Liu" was naturally the Liu surname.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, the many policies left behind by the Adjudicating Deity were all overturned by the imperial court, only Liuzhou retained some of them," Chichangle sighed, "But ever since the Prince of Zhenyuan took charge of Dingbo State, I don't know how long this kind of life will last."</p><p></p><p>He spoke with a worried expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Prince of Zhenyuan very powerful?" Qiyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Chichangle paused, not expecting someone to not know about the Prince of Zhenyuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Deities of the world, the Prince of Zhenyuan is one of them," Chichangle lowered his voice, "And Lord Liu is also one of the Seven Deities."</p><p></p><p>Lord Liu, the strongest person in Dingbo State, the only divine-level military commander.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Prince of Zhenyuan has trained hard," Qiyuan gave his assessment.</p><p></p><p>Chichangle smiled: "You should mention the Prince of Zhenyuan's name less in the future, in this Dingbo State, there are spies of the Prince of Zhenyuan everywhere, they are also called the Bloodhands, wherever they appear, there is bloodshed!"</p><p></p><p>"What is their strength?" Qiyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The four Supervisors are all peak divine-level military commanders, and the Captains under them are all divine-level..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems they are not trying hard enough."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, be careful with your words, if you offend the Bloodhands, even the government cannot save you!" Chichangle said urgently.</p><p></p><p>"What's there to be afraid of? We are already walking fifty thousand strong, and still afraid of offending the Bloodhands?" Qiyuan felt Chichangle lacked self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>They had already joined the Adjudication, and were directly confronting the court, and still afraid of this?</p><p></p><p>Chichangle paused, feeling that Qiyuan had a point.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Adjudication, they could be directly executed if discovered by the court officials, and still afraid of offending the Bloodhands, the lackeys of the Prince of Zhenyuan?</p><p></p><p>"You're right," Chichangle nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>The carriage weaved through the streets, moving at a slow pace.</p><p></p><p>Peddlers' cries rang out continuously.</p><p></p><p>"Ice sugar hawthorn..."</p><p>"Steamed buns, steamed buns..."</p><p>"Golden plums... fresh golden plums..."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's gaze lingered, looking at the overly vibrant fruit.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" </p><p></p><p>Chichangle's eyes lit up with a smile: "This is the Hare Fruit, you're from out of town, so you must be seeing it for the first time!"</p><p></p><p>"Why is it called Hare Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, it's just called Hare Fruit."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>Did Hare really buy the Hare Fruit? Indeed, this world was deeply influenced by him.</p><p></p><p>Even the Hare Fruit existed.</p><p></p><p>He had once told the Voiceless Voice the story of the Hare Fruit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After settling down at the Adjudication's base, Qiyuan's life entered a period of calm.</p><p></p><p>Though calm, there was much to do.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he had to strive to improve the realm of the Artifact Master, striving to reach the divine-level Artifact Master realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>But it was too difficult, even with the innate talent of the Blind Artifact Master, his progress was still very slow.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, he was also preparing to play the role of the Deity Descendent, slowly seeking out the believers of the Deity Descendent.</p><p></p><p>The last aspect was that he was waiting for news from the Adjudication, seeking out the Devilish Spirits and evildoers, and then upholding justice.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, there's a job!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a rough voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>A gleam of joy flashed in Qiyuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was something to do.</p><p></p><p>"Wang An, just come in, the door is not locked."</p><p></p><p>Outside the room, a short and thin man with dark skin, sweating profusely, hesitated a bit, but still pushed the door and entered.</p><p></p><p>"I just unloaded some cargo at the docks, I'm all sweaty and stinky," Wang An awkwardly touched his shaved head, standing in the room without sitting down, perhaps afraid of dirtying the chair.</p><p></p><p>"You must be tired after a day's work, have a seat," Qiyuan poured water for Wang An.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang An finally sat down, but only half-sitting on the chair.</p><p></p><p>Wang An was also a member of the Adjudication.</p><p></p><p>His experience could also be considered somewhat extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>He came from a family of laborers, specializing in unloading cargo at the docks.</p><p></p><p>The son of a tiger is still a tiger; the son of a laborer is still a laborer.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, his grandfather was also a laborer, but not an ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>In the era of the Deity Descendent, the Luo Sha Kingdom had many strange and special regulations.</p><p></p><p>One of the regulations was that everyone was equal, and there was no distinction between occupations.</p><p></p><p>Even as a laborer, as long as one did well, one would still enjoy "rights" and have various "speaking rights", ranking above the nobles.</p><p></p><p>In addition to laborers, incense burners, and weavers, etc., they were all equal.</p><p></p><p>Wang An's grandfather was such a laborer, ranking above the nobles.</p><p></p><p>The real hard workers.</p><p></p><p>Although these people had uneven "qualities", and their frequent opinions might cause chaotic governance.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, there was the intelligent AI-like Deity Descendent, and the Luo Sha Kingdom did not encounter any chaos, and could even be considered "fair" and "just".</p><p></p><p>At least, wherever the Deity Descendent looked, the darkness was swept away.</p><p></p><p>Even the story of a brothel girl assassinating the Third Prince could be widely circulated.</p><p></p><p>However, after the Deity Descendent's demise, all the regulations of the Deity Descendent era were abolished.</p><p></p><p>According to the imperial court's explanation, Wang An's grandfather was just a laborer, and his contribution was merely carrying goods, how could it be as great as the contributions of the nobles in the court, so these rights were abolished.</p><p></p><p>"Today at the docks, I got news that the Blood Cloud Bandits... are going to attack Zhao family's caravan!" Wang An gulped down some water.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, a group of bandits suddenly appeared in Dingbo State, known as the Blood Cloud Bandits.</p><p></p><p>They burned, killed, and plundered, committing all kinds of evil.</p><p></p><p>The Liu family sent troops to eliminate them once, but they quickly revived.</p><p></p><p>The court, blaming the Liu family for their failure to eliminate the bandits, sent the Prince of Zhenyuan to take charge of Dingbo State.</p><p></p><p>In these past few years, the power of the Blood Cloud Bandits had grown larger and larger, and the Prince of Zhenyuan, due to the "bandit suppression", could be considered to have taken root in Dingbo State.</p><p></p><p>"Is this news reliable?" Qiyuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely reliable!" Wang An nodded, "Among the Blood Cloud Bandits, there are brothers from our Adjudication! The others may not believe it, but the brothers of the Adjudication are all trustworthy!"</p><p></p><p>"So this time we'll go and kill the Blood Cloud Bandits?" Qiyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"With the Adjudicators taking action, you and I... will get to see the world," Wang An said, "Sister Liu said you are too kind-hearted, you don't even dare to kill ants, so you need to go see the world."</p><p></p><p>Wang An revealed a mouthful of big yellow teeth.</p><p></p><p>The "Sister Liu" he referred to was naturally Liu Chun'winter.</p><p></p><p>Sister Liu had said before that this Qiyuan was too kind-hearted, he didn't even dare to kill fish.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had to let him see blood, understand...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This world is full of wickedness and evil. "Oh right, Sister Liu is also participating in this operation," Wang Ke continued to supplement.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go join the fun." Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking whether he should take this opportunity to find the lair of the Blood Cloud Bandits. </p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't bear to kill fish, he had no psychological burden in killing some thieves and bandits.</p><p></p><p>If he could exterminate the Blood Cloud Bandits and leave a sentence "Holding the light, driving away the darkness; if there is any injustice, call me the divine," then the name "Divine" would probably be known throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by slaying the Blood Cloud Bandits, he could also gain a lot of experience. This is definitely a profitable deal.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, on the mountain road.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter was wearing a tight-fitting outfit, looking like a minor, cute and charming. When she saw Qi Yuan, her face broke into a radiant smile.</p><p></p><p>"You've finally come, Big Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Next to Liu Chuwinter, there were two people wearing black robes and masks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>These two were the Judgment Executors of the Judgment Organization. The Judgment Organization is divided into two parts, the formal members like Liu Chuwinter, and the Judgment Executors responsible for combat.</p><p></p><p>When they are on a mission, they wear black robes and masks, making their faces unrecognizable.</p><p></p><p>The main combat force for this mission is these two Judgment Executors.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze slid over these two Judgment Executors, his face revealing an interested expression.</p><p></p><p>These two Judgment Executors both surnamed Liu, one called Liu Twenty-two and the other Liu Twenty-three.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Big Brother Qi, this time you just stand aside and watch how I uphold justice!" Liu Chuwinter smiled slyly, "Don't be afraid when you see blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, although I'm kind, I don't faint at the sight of blood," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, we're here to carry out the mission," Liu Chuwinter quickly got serious, her small face resolute. "The Blood Cloud Bandits have been lawless and inhuman, this time we must make them come out alive, and not let them return alive!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Blood Cloud Bandits, Liu Chuwinter's face was filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>Those corrupt officials at least pretended to do something on the surface in Dingbo Prefecture, but the bandits didn't, they were just openly bad.</p><p></p><p>"According to the intel, the Zhao family's people should be passing by in a moment, strange... where are the Blood Cloud Bandits?" Liu Chuwinter mentioned this with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Logically, the Blood Cloud Bandits should have laid an ambush in advance.</p><p></p><p>But now, where are the Blood Cloud Bandits around here?</p><p></p><p>"Could the information be wrong?" Chen Kangbao, Qi Yuan's strategist, hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"No, unless... the plan has changed, or something else has happened," Liu Chuwinter answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer, or maybe we should scatter and look around?" Chen Kangbao suggested again.</p><p></p><p>"No." Liu Chuwinter shook her head, "Except for the Judgment Executors, the rest of us are too weak, we might be in danger if we encounter the Blood Cloud Bandits."</p><p></p><p>Those two Judgment Executors also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan felt more and more that the Judgment Organization was an amateurish group.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, this world is already a huge amateurish group, so it's quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, he turned the drone into a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, there's a mosquito biting me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slapped his face, and suddenly a few mosquitoes appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He opened his hand and let the mosquitoes fly away.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter saw this scene: "Big Brother Qi, you're too kind! Those mosquitoes can suck your blood!"</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Wang Ke also looked at Qi Yuan a little more.</p><p></p><p>Even mosquitoes he doesn't kill, too kind.</p><p></p><p>"No, they don't suck blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't suck blood?"</p><p></p><p>"They are male mosquitoes."</p><p></p><p>While they were waiting, more than an hour passed, but not only did they not see the Blood Cloud Bandits, they didn't even see the Zhao family's convoy.</p><p></p><p>The people present also felt that something might have happened.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Everyone, follow me, I have good hearing and I think I heard the sound of a fight in a certain direction."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Liu Chuwinter blinked, "Where?"</p><p></p><p>Those two Judgment Executors swept their gaze over Qi Yuan, their eyes filled with doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan mounted his horse.</p><p></p><p>The rest thought about it for a moment without any hesitation, and they also mounted their horses one after another.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on a secluded road, dozens of bandits had surrounded the Zhao family's convoy.</p><p></p><p>In this convoy, there were only ten people, except for the old man in charge and a young woman, the rest were burly men.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Zhao, your guts are really thick, Miss Zhao is the godson of Supervisor Liu who specifically requested her.</p><p></p><p>What, now that you've hooked up with General Li, you don't recognize Supervisor Liu anymore?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Cloud Bandits was a one-armed swordsman, his face full of fierce and evil aura.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Zhao's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>As a wealthy man in Dingbo Prefecture, since the Prince of Jinghe was stationed in Dingbo Prefecture, his mind had become more active. He knew that the situation in Dingbo Prefecture was about to change.</p><p></p><p>His daughter was beautiful and charming, ranking among the beauties of Dingbo Prefecture, a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had finally found an opportunity to offer his daughter to General Li under the Prince of Jinghe.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that the godson of Supervisor Liu, a man of terrifying power, also had his eyes on his daughter.</p><p></p><p>For Old Man Zhao, the godson was not as good as giving his daughter to General Li, who had a promising future.</p><p></p><p>So he secretly brought his daughter to Nanshan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Blood Cloud Bandits had intercepted them.</p><p></p><p>Now, dozens of fierce Blood Cloud Bandits were blocking their way, and Old Man Zhao was filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it was a momentary lapse of judgment on this old man's part, I will immediately offer my daughter to the Colonel!" Old Man Zhao changed his attitude quickly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to life and death, his future prospects were nothing.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed bandit leader's face twisted into a ferocious expression: "Too late, the Colonel said he's no longer interested in Miss Zhao."</p><p></p><p>He said, eyeing Miss Zhao lustfully.</p><p></p><p>"Before you die, you can have a passionate time with me, that's your blessing!"</p><p></p><p>Miss Zhao's beautiful face instantly turned deathly pale, her body collapsing like a rose petal battered by wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Zhao was terrified to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's over!" </p><p></p><p>How could they possibly be a match for these Blood Cloud Bandits? Just then, the sound of hooves suddenly rang out, and a group of people on horseback came rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>Miss Zhao's originally pale face lit up with hope.</p><p></p><p>"Come quickly and save me, they are the Blood Cloud Bandits, the subordinates of Supervisor Liu!" </p><p></p><p>She shouted frantically, hysterical.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Old Man Zhao also gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed bandit leader in charge knew very well Miss Zhao's thoughts. A ruthless gleam flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Zhao, it seems you feel lonely on the way to the underworld and want to find more companions?"</p><p></p><p>He held a large sword in his single hand, fierce and evil.</p><p></p><p>"I'll satisfy you."</p><p></p><p>"Kill everyone except the woman!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

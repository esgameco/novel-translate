        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wolf Breaker looked at the five Foundation Establishment cultivators in front of him with a trace of disdain in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the extent of your combined strength?"</p><p></p><p>Just moments ago, he had encountered and engaged members from the Divine Light Sect, the Floating Mountain, and other sects.</p><p></p><p>Five late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, united together, would normally cause even Elixir Dao cultivators to be wary.</p><p></p><p>However, Wolf Breaker wielded the dazzling Radiant Sword and easily repelled the five of them.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulou's mouth was bleeding, his eyes filled with fear: "You truly are from the Hall of Light!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen and Miao Li also sustained serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivators of the Floating Mountain were renowned for their unparalleled offensive prowess, but in the face of Wolf Breaker's Radiant Sword, they appeared utterly powerless.</p><p></p><p>"You white-haired fellow, didn't you spout nonsense in the main hall, making me remember you? Where is your junior brother? Has he dug a hole and buried himself like a quail, only daring to provoke me in the main hall but hiding in the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm?" Wolf Breaker held the flowing sword, his body shining as if wrapped in sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Miao Li gritted his teeth, his eyes cold as he glared at Wolf Breaker.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Wolf Breaker's lips: "It seems you are truly afraid."</p><p></p><p>Since he dares not come out, then I shall kill you all first!</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulou waved his feather duster: "I am the son-in-law of the Divine Light Sect Master and the peak lord disciple of the Five Light Peak. Do you really think you can kill me?"</p><p></p><p>The white hair on his head was undergoing subtle changes, gradually turning black.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hint of seriousness appeared in Wolf Breaker's eyes: "Hmph, it seems you're lucky this time."</p><p></p><p>Wolf Breaker swiftly transformed into a beam of light and disappeared from their sight.</p><p></p><p>Miao Li was puzzled: "What's going on? Why did he suddenly leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen glanced at Kong Fulou, his eyes filled with deep apprehension.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kong Fulou turned around, his face expressing surprise: "Senior Uncle Li Xiao, Senior Uncle Pang Long, why have you come?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, several large white lights were rapidly approaching. In just a moment, dozens of Divine Light Sect cultivators descended upon the scene.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was a middle-aged man with a greenish complexion - Li Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Kong Fulou, Li Xiao felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"You're still alive, that's good."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Uncle, how did you enter the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm? Has something happened?" Kong Fulou quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>If the senior uncles suddenly arrived, there must be a grave matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiao truthfully told the gathered group about the situation outside.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone's expressions became grave.</p><p></p><p>"The old Emperor faked his death and secretly colluded with the Crimson Sword Gate?" Kong Fulou realized the implications, "So the one who killed the Five Princes was not the Second Prince, but the old Emperor himself!"</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulou immediately led Li Xiao and the others to see the bodies slain by the Regret Dragon Hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiao's face darkened upon seeing them.</p><p></p><p>The low-key Pang Long spoke: "I can sense the aura of a Divine Infant."</p><p></p><p>"What, the old Emperor has become a Divine Infant?" Kong Fulou's expression was unsettled.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Infant lurking in the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm, the horror of such a being was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are still alive, it's good. Let us quickly leave the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm," Li Xiao quickly decided.</p><p></p><p>But then Pang Long spoke again: "Where is Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was nowhere to be found among them.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan must have gone to find the old Emperor's accomplices. My mistake, I underestimated the dangers of the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm," Kong Fulou said. When Qi Yuan mentioned the Soul Remembrance Flower, Kong Fulou knew it was a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>As a senior, Kong Fulou did not try to snatch the treasure from his junior disciple.</p><p></p><p>"What, he went to find the old Emperor's accomplices?" Li Xiao became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Uncle Li Xiao, please take the others and leave the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm. As the son-in-law of the Sect Master and a peak lord disciple, I must go and bring my junior disciple back!" Kong Fulou said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiao stood in contemplation: "Pang Long, you take them back. I will go with Kong Fulou to find Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sunken Coffin Grounds, the purple-robed elder was emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a mouthful of fresh blood spurted out.</p><p></p><p>He gazed deeply at something behind him, his eyes bulging with fury.</p><p></p><p>On a crystal coffin, the spiritual energy had liquefied and was coiling around the coffin like vines, binding the crystal coffin.</p><p></p><p>Just now, an inexplicable force had been pulling, seemingly trying to draw the crystal coffin out.</p><p></p><p>But the mysterious force had suddenly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" </p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder erupted in rage. He had been trying for several days, but could not succeed in his task.</p><p></p><p>He realized that the method given to him by that great cultivator was actually useless.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was useless, he had still been trying, and the sudden disappearance of the external force had completely ruined his chance.</p><p></p><p>His furious anger had no outlet, and he could only blame it on the situation above.</p><p></p><p>Unable to pull the crystal coffin out, he had no choice but to leave the place.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan standing outside the stronghold raised his head, a light smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The big guys still love me, specially sending me an alternative Divine Infant. Is this to test my strength?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan also knew that the big guys' love for him was not much.</p><p></p><p>If given the chance, they would definitely drive him out of the cottage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held a kitchen knife, standing on the grass, his sleeves fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, the purple-robed figure rapidly approached, stopping about a mile away from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So it's you, Qi Yuan?!" The purple-robed elder's face showed disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He could smell the strong scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the three hundred elite guards had all been killed! He could not understand.</p><p></p><p>Why would Qi Yuan appear here?</p><p></p><p>Even if he was Ruan Yixiao's son, he should not have reached this level.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Ruan Yixiao's cultivation...</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder's heart was filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered that this was the Celestial Dragon Immortal Realm, where those over a hundred years old could not enter.</p><p></p><p>He regained his confidence.</p><p></p><p>Now he was a Divine Infant!</p><p></p><p>"You killed them all?" The purple-robed elder examined Qi Yuan, his tone one of control.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they are all at my feet," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid of me?" The purple-robed elder had some worries, but then he remembered he was a Divine Infant, and his fears dissipated. "May I ask how you were able to kill them all?"</p><p></p><p>"Because I... have reached the Dao Foundation Establishment!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Foundation Establishment?" The purple-robed elder's eyes showed astonishment, followed by endless despair.</p><p></p><p>He believed Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could not explain how the three hundred elite guards were all killed.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how powerful Dao Foundation Establishment was, but even the geniuses of the Eastern Lands at the Foundation Establishment stage could kill those at the Elixir Dao stage.</p><p></p><p>Dao Foundation Establishment would not find it difficult to slay Elixir Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Foundation Establishment, Dao Foundation Establishment..." The purple-robed elder muttered, his face showing a look of relief. "It seems all my calculations have been in vain."</p><p></p><p>Dao Foundation Establishment meant that behind Qi Yuan, or rather Ruan Yixiao, there was at least a terrifying existence at the Yin Shen level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be impossible to capture the Heavenly Dao Qi.</p><p></p><p>With an Yin Shen level expert backing him, all his meticulous plans had been for naught.</p><p></p><p>However, his eyes then revealed a ferocious look: "As a Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator, to perish for my Great Liang is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and his expression remained calm: "You're thinking too much.</p><p></p><p>First, I won't perish with you.</p><p></p><p>Second, Great Liang won't be destroyed either. Why does it need to perish? You've been the Emperor for too long, your feudal thinking has become ingrained."</p><p></p><p>That stubborn old Emperor still thought too highly of himself.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine abilities of the Divine Infant erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Great Liang belongs to me!"</p><p></p><p>With this furious roar, a law force over ten times stronger than Elixir Dao surged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder unleashed his mightiest divine art, the Regret Dragon Hand! The difference between a Divine Infant cultivator and other lower-level cultivators was the ability to manifest divine arts.</p><p></p><p>Divine arts were the pinnacle of spells.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Infant elder could unleash a divine art capable of instantly annihilating the ordinary people of a small county.</p><p></p><p>A massive dragon claw coalesced above Qi Yuan's head, emanating an aura far exceeding Elixir Dao. </p><p></p><p>The sharp and keen dragon claw could easily crush the bodies of Elixir Dao cultivators, causing their Golden Core to explode.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also sensed the grave threat.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my Dao Foundation Establishment is not strong enough to defeat that big guy. Even a Divine Infant elder can threaten me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not hesitate, directly facing the incoming attack.</p><p></p><p>The power of Dao Foundation Establishment seemed to be constrained.</p><p></p><p>But the part that was revealed still caused this place to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The Regret Dragon Hand clashed with Qi Yuan's...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cleavers collided violently.</p><p></p><p>However, the surrounding environment did not suffer much damage.</p><p></p><p>Because, upon reaching the divine infant realm, one can fully control the magical powers, and with a single strike, there would be no waste of magical power, nor would the surrounding environment be destroyed. All the magical power is focused on the enemy.</p><p></p><p>The cleaver and the Regretful Dragon Palm collided, evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the purple robe revealed a horrified expression on his face: "What kind of monster are you?"</p><p></p><p>Even if the Heavenly Dao Foundation is strong, it cannot withstand a divine infant, can it? His divine infant, though water-attributed, is a genuine divine infant.</p><p></p><p>Two divine infants from the clan spent their lifespan to pass on the techniques to him, and a great cultivator from the Purple Palace sent him a talisman to assist him.</p><p></p><p>As a result, his seemingly full-powered grand divine technique was actually blocked by the other party? "You truly are a divine infant monster!" Qi Yuan let out a loud roar, "A single Regretful Dragon Palm actually burst my blood vessels!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Qi Yuan was injured since arriving in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He also recognized the power of the divine infant.</p><p></p><p>The old emperor looked at Qi Yuan with a suspicious expression, feeling like he didn't actually injure Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What ruptured blood vessels? He didn't see any.</p><p></p><p>"My capillaries, how tragic." Qi Yuan waved his hand, showing it to the old emperor, as if accusing him of his evil deeds.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't complain, the capillaries would have healed.</p><p></p><p>"Thief, how dare you insult me!" The old emperor was furious.</p><p></p><p>He thought about his humiliating life.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme ruler, he had no real power at all!</p><p></p><p>The Great Merchant Nation was completely controlled by the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>He endured the humiliation and suffered endless disgrace.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was being mocked by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He was broken.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hold back anymore, roaring as he charged towards Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, seeing this, was not very surprised.</p><p></p><p>After suppressing it for a lifetime, going crazy before death, what's the problem? "I have already tested out my approximate strength, so... you have completed your task, and it's time for you to leave the stage."</p><p></p><p>After a single strike to test the strength of the divine infant monster, Qi Yuan was not at all flustered.</p><p></p><p>He could completely annihilate him!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, then opened the small tune in the jade slip again.</p><p></p><p>As the Merchant Emperor heads to the Yellow Springs, let this tune accompany him.</p><p></p><p>He held the cleaver and charged towards the old emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Witness my Brilliant Brilliant Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chose the most moderate of the many secret techniques, the Brilliant Brilliant Sword, to send the old emperor on his way.</p><p></p><p>The sacred Brilliant Brilliant Sword, disguised by endless blood qi, emanated endless brilliance.</p><p></p><p>This sword, emanating from the cleaver, directly fell upon the old emperor's body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The old emperor directly fell from the sky, and his aura began to continuously decline.</p><p></p><p>From the early divine infant realm, to the late Primal Dantian realm, to the middle Primal Dantian realm, and finally to the late Foundation Establishment realm, he remained there.</p><p></p><p>On his aged and wrinkled face, there was only the aura of death. He looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with resentment: "If I had your background, why would I have fallen to this? This world, why is it so unfair!</p><p></p><p>You, this young brat, living in luxury and enjoying glory and wealth, with teachers and guardians protecting your path, your life has been smooth sailing, even a dissolute young master can reach the Heavenly Dao Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Why, why!"</p><p></p><p>He endured endless humiliation and never gave up, yet ended up with such a fate.</p><p></p><p>He was resentful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the old emperor and calmly said, "I don't know your past, I won't judge you, I'm just sending you to the Yellow Springs!"</p><p></p><p>The old emperor coughed, and murky blood flowed from the corners of his mouth: "You also want to scheme for the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, don't you? Haha, I have failed, and in another hour, that crystal coffin will be teleported away!</p><p></p><p>If I can't get it, you won't be able to get it either!"</p><p></p><p>The old emperor said, his neck tilting, and he finally died here, his face filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>The emperor of a vast empire, dying silently here.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood beside the old emperor, holding the cleaver, not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, he didn't have anything good on him, not even a cultivation method to enhance the spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Wasting so much effort to kill this old emperor, he actually gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>The only gain was understanding his own approximate strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Chicken Old Monster is at the divine infant late realm, huh? It's still a bit difficult to deal with!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Black Chicken Old Monster was still a huge obstacle, hanging over his head.</p><p></p><p>It's all because of that big guy, preventing him from fully establishing the Heavenly Dao Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if it was as the Ice Maiden said, truly establishing the Heavenly Dao Foundation, he would be able to command the laws at will.</p><p></p><p>Killing a Black Chicken Old Monster, wouldn't it be as simple as killing a chicken?</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and a beam of light fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A man in white robes, Broken Wolf, appeared not far from Qi Yuan, his face filled with delight: "From afar, I could sense the aura of the Brilliant Brilliant Sword, so you are from the Divine Flower Association."</p><p></p><p>The originally lost and dejected Qi Yuan, seeing Broken Wolf arrive, his eyes lit up: "White Moonlight, you've finally come."</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf glanced at the corpse next to Qi Yuan, a mocking smile appearing on his lips: "To slay a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, you had to use the Brilliant Brilliant Sword, your strength is just that."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will show you what the true Brilliant Brilliant Sword is!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's clash with the old emperor did not waste a single bit of magical power, and the battle traces here were only the remnants of Qi Yuan's previous purge of the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf naturally didn't know that the corpse was that of a divine infant.</p><p></p><p>"To die by the Brilliant Brilliant Sword is your honor!" </p><p></p><p>As one of the top seven hundred talents in the Eastern Lands, the version of the Brilliant Brilliant Sword he cultivated was higher than Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Broken Wolf, his eyes shining even brighter: "So this is the higher version of the Brilliant Brilliant Sword, it will be mine in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"As Lu Fei said, your brain has some problems.</p><p></p><p>Do you think I'm as stupid as Zhu Lian Hua?" On his way here, Broken Wolf encountered two people from the Magic Desire Gate, and he casually slaughtered them.</p><p></p><p>He also learned from the Lu Fei among them how to enter the Sunken Coffin Land, as well as other information.</p><p></p><p>For example, the crazy and eccentric Qi Yuan was in the Sunken Coffin Land.</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf naturally didn't know that Lu Fei had caused trouble before his death, and even if he knew, he wouldn't care.</p><p></p><p>The arrogance and prejudice of a genius made him completely disdainful of the so-called talents of the Great Merchant Nation.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant Brilliant Sword, manifest!</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf's entire body emanated a sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>"My sword can slay Primal Dantian!" </p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf said, and a sword strike came forth.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to show the people of this small place what a true genius is.</p><p></p><p>A huge sword of light fell from the sky, directly towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "Using the Brilliant Brilliant Sword to kill Primal Dantian is too wasteful.</p><p></p><p>To kill you, I don't need a knife, I don't need a sword, a finger flick will suffice."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, pinching his thumb and middle finger.</p><p></p><p>Snap! He flicked his middle finger, colliding with the terrifying sword of light.</p><p></p><p>Crack! The powerful sword capable of slaying Primal Dantian instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The gathered magical power from that single finger flick also landed on Broken Wolf's head.</p><p></p><p>Pop! Broken Wolf's heart meridian also shattered along with the sword of light, his face revealing an expression of disbelief, hearing the young man's murmur.</p><p></p><p>"Beneath your feet, there are over a hundred Primal Dantian."</p><p></p><p>"The one just killed by my Brilliant Brilliant Sword was a divine infant."</p><p></p><p>"You are my White Moonlight, I can't bear to kill you with a knife or sword, I can only give you a gentle... brain explosion."</p><p></p><p>"Am I gentle enough today?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, too much force, the brain explosion killed my White Moonlight."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan approached Broken Wolf with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf's face showed an expression of disbelief, he wanted to speak but couldn't.</p><p></p><p>He could only whisper in his heart: Madman.</p><p></p><p>His aura instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan bent down and began to harvest his spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, lots of spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Slaying those subordinates, and even the old emperor.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Soul Flower, Qi Yuan actually gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>Now, from White Moonlight, he finally has something to show for it.</p><p></p><p>"White Moonlight is just too kind to me, coming to see me and even giving me so many gifts, how can I not feel grateful?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rummaged through Broken Wolf's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>He found seven Jade-grade cultivation techniques, two Mysterious-grade cultivation techniques, and an advanced version of the Brilliant Brilliant Sword.</p><p></p><p>"I've hit the jackpot!" Qi Yuan felt that this trip to the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm was truly worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>With so many cultivation techniques, if he could fully comprehend them, the information he could see in cultivation methods would increase.</p><p></p><p>His "Qi Yuan Sutra" could also continue to progress.</p><p></p><p>"Add in the Soul Flower, I can say that good things have come in pairs!"</p><p></p><p>The Soul Flower could enhance the spiritual sense, not only increasing Qi Yuan's combat power, but also increasing the probability of him entering the second game.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've thoroughly cleared the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, it's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>"No, the old emperor was plotting that crystal coffin, I should go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"What if it's filled with Soul Flowers, wouldn't that be even better?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

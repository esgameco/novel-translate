        <h1>Chapter 312</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A commotion arose within the branch of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's martial prowess was extraordinary even among those at the peak of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, he was still so young.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, many martial artists from the Martial Arts Alliance came forward, wanting to befriend Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan wasn't interested in these things.</p><p></p><p>He casually said: "The water in my hotel room has boiled, I need to hurry back to make some instant noodles."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he turned and left the Martial Arts Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists who witnessed this looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Many who had seen Qi Yuan outside earlier also revealed strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This martial artist... is a bit odd."</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, he seems to have a certificate for mental illness."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Judging by his behavior, he does seem mentally ill?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that practicing martial arts damaged his brain?"</p><p></p><p>"God opened a window for him, but closed his door."</p><p></p><p>The gazes of these martial artists towards Qi Yuan changed from admiration to pity.</p><p></p><p>Having high martial arts talent is enviable.</p><p></p><p>But... if one has a mental illness, what use is high martial arts talent? Being strong is good, but without one's own consciousness, at most one becomes a puppet in others' hands, a money-making tool.</p><p></p><p>So having a good brain is still most useful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left the Martial Arts Alliance branch, with Bei He Han Xian Yun following him out.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan stayed behind at the branch since he had acquaintances there, to chat with old friends for a while.</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xian Yun walked alongside Qi Yuan as the two left together.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bei He Han Xian Yun still had countless doubts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Your martial arts talent is even stronger than mine, could you be the second Luo Bu Fan?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun walked side by side with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, for hundreds of years, no one in the martial arts world had broken through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan broke through the martial arts limit, it would definitely be a major event that would shake the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>"My talent is actually very ordinary. I'm this strong now entirely due to my own efforts!" Qi Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>His martial arts talent was indeed only average originally.</p><p></p><p>He became so formidable because he grinded very hard in the game.</p><p></p><p>"You're being modest. In ordinary circles, effort certainly works, but in martial arts circles, it's all about talent. The gap between people is even bigger than the gap between humans and dogs," Han Xian Yun said.</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun also came from an old noble family.</p><p></p><p>However, he had an older brother.</p><p></p><p>The "throne" belonged to his elder brother, so he... couldn't actively enter his brother's circle, and instead came to mix in niche circles like the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>This was also a form of self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>After all, his elder brother was thirteen years older than him and currently in his prime. If he harbored thoughts of competing, how could he possibly win?</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan before him gave him a very special feeling, as if there was something mysterious about him.</p><p></p><p>And that fortune teller from before was also acting strangely.</p><p></p><p>At first, he thought this was a scheme targeting him.</p><p></p><p>But now it didn't seem that way.</p><p></p><p>"There's still some time before the martial arts tournament. Will you be staying in Long Tai during this period? Would you like me to be your guide and show you around Long Tai? Long Tai has many martial arts holy sites, it's considered a good place for us martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Even though you're very strong now, it's hard to say if you'll win the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>This period of time is perfect for us to go see what the ancients left behind. It may help advance your martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xian Yun was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to use this time to figure out Qi Yuan's background.</p><p></p><p>"That sounds good. When I get married, I'll definitely need to go on a honeymoon trip," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>However, his response had absolutely nothing to do with what Han Xian Yun was saying.</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun was stunned for a moment, and couldn't help but recall the mental illness certificate Qi Yuan had shown earlier, as well as the discussions at the Martial Arts Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan... really was mentally ill?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise why was communication so difficult.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Han Xian Yun quickly asked: "What kind of person needs to go to the hospital every day?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, and looked at Han Xian Yun as if he was an idiot: "Have you been watching too many videos? My mental illness is fake, not real."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Xian Yun breathed a sigh of relief. A mentally ill person couldn't say something like that.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"As for who needs to go to the hospital every day... there probably isn't anyone, not even Pangu," Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>Time is so long.</p><p></p><p>And hospitals haven't always existed.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone go to the hospital every day?</p><p></p><p>For example, before heaven and earth were formed, who had ever been to a hospital?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Xian Yun was confused again.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the mental illness fake?</p><p></p><p>Why was his speech so incoherent?</p><p></p><p>He must be ill, definitely ill! However, just at this moment, Han Xian Yun suddenly paused: "Did you hear a strange sound?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun said, looking towards the alley ahead.</p><p></p><p>The alley was empty and silent.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, he felt like he had just heard a peculiar sound coming from there.</p><p></p><p>"A sound?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze also turned towards that alley, his eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't hear anything, but... we can go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really hadn't heard any strange sounds.</p><p></p><p>But when he looked in the direction Han Xian Yun was pointing, he sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun thought for a moment, then without hesitation headed towards the small alley with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The alley wasn't very wide and was a bit dirty. Near a flower pot not far away, there was a dried dog turd on the ground. Judging by its moisture and color, it had been there for some time.</p><p></p><p>Bei He Han Xian Yun scanned the surroundings and smiled: "It seems it was just an illusion. I... often have auditory hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes I frequently hear strange sounds, but when I go to check... there's nothing there."</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun had suffered from auditory hallucinations since childhood.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought he might be some chosen one who could hear things ordinary people couldn't.</p><p></p><p>But when he went to the hospital for a checkup, well... there were some minor issues with his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that it's not a hallucination, but rather that your bloodline concentration is... quite high?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Han Xian Yun didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"You've opened your celestial eye!" Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You're really talking nonsense. If I had opened my celestial eye, where are the ghosts?</p><p></p><p>Where are the ghosts? I'm not married yet and need a wife. Quick, let a ghost come so I can take her as my bride!" Han Xian Yun said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"Would one with two big horns and three meters tall... be okay?" Qi Yuan stared ahead, his eyes filled with a strange look.</p><p></p><p>"Forget two big horns, even if she was covered in chest hair, I'd be willing! That's a ghost, a rare thing. Marrying a ghost as a wife, what a wonderful thing!" Han Xian Yun got more and more excited as he spoke, seeming to be speaking from his heart.</p><p></p><p>But as he was talking, he suddenly sensed something strange.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if his body had touched some sticky liquid, making it difficult to move.</p><p></p><p>He was confused, and suddenly felt a chill on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>He wiped his forehead with his hand, then looked at his palm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a look of horror appeared on his face: "Blood!"</p><p></p><p>In his hand was blood, dense and numerous droplets of blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was standing next to Han Xian Yun, a curious expression on his face: "So this game really does have hidden maps. No... this probably isn't a hidden map yet..."</p><p></p><p>"What are you talking about?" Han Xian Yun was extremely anxious now.</p><p></p><p>Because he felt his body becoming stiff and numb.</p><p></p><p>His forehead was wet, as if blood was continuously dripping down.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look up and see the ghost bride you wanted to marry.</p><p></p><p>Though... it doesn't seem to be a ghost."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice came, and Han Xian Yun instinctively looked up.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, his eyes widened and he swallowed hard: "What... is that? If that became my wife, wouldn't my asshole be..."</p><p></p><p>They saw a terrifying black and red giant beast standing up high.</p><p></p><p>It had two bull horns on its head, and its black body was covered in lumps of flesh, with red flesh buds inside.</p><p></p><p>In its hand it held a giant axe, dripping with blood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Han Xian Yun: "You're being a bit vulgar. In this situation, to use such disgusting words, is there something wrong with your head?"</p><p></p><p>"You're the one with something wrong with your head! This is a normal reaction!" Han Xian Yun looked at the terrifying giant beast, his legs trembling. "What kind of monster is this, and... where are we?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a weak voice came: "How did you appear here? I understand now. Your bloodline concentration is high enough, and this place is too close to reality. You accidentally brought him in when you stumbled in."</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun looked over and saw the fortune teller from before.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller now looked extremely miserable.</p><p></p><p>Blood was flowing from the corners of his mouth, and there was a bloody gash on his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>... faintly visible intestines could be seen on top.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller Yu Xiu said weakly: "This is Xing Wei Fumos, the curse on me hasn't dissipated, it's here to execute me. It possesses terrifying divine power, able to split a small mountain with one axe strike. It's a horrifying giant beast from mythology!"</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun blinked, looking at the wound on the fortune teller's abdomen. </p><p></p><p>If it's so powerful that it can split a small mountain with one axe strike, how come it only left such a wound on your lower abdomen? Are you also quite formidable?</p><p></p><p>Seeming to understand Han Xianyun's gaze, Yu Xiu felt extremely complicated inside. This Han Xianyun's brain seemed to have issues.</p><p></p><p>"I am the condemned, destined to suffer 37 axe strikes, each inflicting the same damage, with only the final strike being fatal. But you... have accidentally intruded into the execution grounds. We're doomed, this will enrage Fumos. It will kill us all!"</p><p></p><p>During an execution, generally speaking, the condemned has a 30% chance of dying. But... those who accidentally intrude will certainly die. Therefore, many people take advantage of this rule to lure their enemies into the execution space, using the executioner.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Xianyun's expression changed drastically. He looked at the terrifying giant beast with two horns on its head, his face full of fear: "We're finished, I haven't even gotten married yet, I don't want to die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan beside him smiled and pointed at Fumos, saying softly: "Isn't this the wife you've been longing for? Just now outside, you said you wanted to marry it and take it home!"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Han Xianyun swallowed, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu, who was not far away, heard this and if he wasn't injured, he really wanted to give Han Xianyun a thumbs up and say: "You must be really hungry!"</p><p></p><p>That's the executioner Fumos!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fumos seemed to understand their conversation.</p><p></p><p>A sky-shaking roar suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Powerful sound waves exploded and swept out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The entire space was completely filled with these sound waves, constantly echoing.</p><p></p><p>Excitement flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "This is... martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, he could tell at a glance that the other's technique came from the same origin as martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This kind of attack was clearly a sound wave attack.</p><p></p><p>An attack of this level was naturally useless against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, Han Xianyun beside him and Yu Xiu not far away were stunned by the sound waves and fell unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Fumos, holding its giant axe and with a body like a small mountain, moved towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Thudding sounds echoed non-stop throughout the entire space.</p><p></p><p>Fumos was like a cold and ruthless warrior, without any emotional color, only wanting to destroy all enemies in sight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the terrifying giant beast over 3 meters tall, a smile appearing in his eyes: "You want to fight me one-on-one?"</p><p></p><p>Fumos ignored him and continued walking towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan reached out his hand: "Stop, let's fight later!"</p><p></p><p>Fumos turned a deaf ear and continued approaching Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan looked at Han Xianyun on the ground and the unconscious Yu Xiu, saying reluctantly: "This is too unfair, why am I fighting for my life here while they're sleeping soundly? </p><p></p><p>Don't tell me they'll only wake up leisurely after I've killed sister-in-law you? Where in the world is there such a good deal!</p><p></p><p>After waking up, they'll even suspect if I was the one who killed the monster!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was facing danger.</p><p></p><p>But the weaklings had fainted from the sound wave attack, leaving him to face it alone.</p><p></p><p>This was too unfair.</p><p></p><p>"Wake up!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it was as if a thunderclap resounded through the space.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun's eyes were still closed and his head still groggy, but his body was jolted upright by this sound, his hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu not far away was in the same state.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice kept impacting these two people's ears.</p><p></p><p>This attack was even several times stronger than Fumos' attack on the two.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after about two breaths of time, Yu Xiu and Han Xianyun opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What happened, did I faint?" Han Xianyun was a bit dazed, as long-lost memories came flooding back. He widened his eyes and looked at Qi Yuan in the distance, "I just had a dream that I had an awesome wife!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu also felt like he had been sleeping for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He was very confused at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fumos' sound wave attack was enough to make people sleep for a day and night, unable to wake up.</p><p></p><p>Even high-level tools couldn't wake them up, so how did he wake up?</p><p></p><p>"Your awesome wife is still here," Qi Yuan pointed ahead.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun looked over, his previously groggy head suddenly clearing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes: "The dream was real!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked towards Fumos and continued: "Alright, we can continue fighting now, I've woken up my helpers."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Three against one would be more interesting.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to fight alone while his teammates slept soundly.</p><p></p><p>"Han Xianyun, hurry up and fight your awesome wife," Qi Yuan said from the side.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun's legs trembled, seemingly remembering how this terrifying monster had knocked him out with just one sound wave earlier.</p><p></p><p>How could he fight now?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu had also lost all his fighting spirit at this point, feeling that today's events were just too strange.</p><p></p><p>"You two are too useless," Qi Yuan sighed. "Seeing you both knocked out by its roar, I had to fight this thing alone. </p><p></p><p>I felt unbalanced, why should I fight for my life while you two sleep soundly.</p><p></p><p>So I woke you up, but... is this all you've got?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun: "???"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu was also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This was too bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it seems you don't want to be a strong husband, you don't like beating your wife.</p><p></p><p>How about this, I'll help you beat your wife, and you cheer for me from the side? Today, I'll lower myself a bit and use you as my cheerleader."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he looked towards Fumos and took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>A sharp light flashed in Yu Xiu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the shattering of the blood compass.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Han Xianyun beside him was trembling and dazed. He could only force himself to say: "I'm no good at fighting, but I'm good at cheering!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare face that terrifying giant beast at all.</p><p></p><p>Too many strange things had happened today, his brain had short-circuited.</p><p></p><p>He could only speak instinctively, following his gut.</p><p></p><p>He was also puzzled in his heart about how Qi Yuan, who was merely at the limit of martial arts, could fight this terrifying giant beast.</p><p></p><p>"I have a sword, kill!"</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the entire space was filled with a red light.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red long sword seemed to come from the depths of the starry sky, landing in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the blood-colored long sword, like a peerless sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>"This... this... this..."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun widened his eyes, shocked and delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The video was real, you destroyed three thousand military camps?"</p><p></p><p>This familiar sword, familiar sword light, wasn't it from the video? It was actually real! And... its owner was the familiar Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Bro... how did you secretly cultivate immortality?</p><p></p><p>An immortal cultivator... coming to participate in a martial arts competition?</p><p></p><p>This is...</p><p></p><p>Before he could think further, suddenly, a red light flashed through the entire space again.</p><p></p><p>A huge long sword slashed diagonally towards Fumos.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Fumos suddenly leaped, jumping over a hundred meters high, its giant axe also chopping down.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful axe strike was enough to split a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>Terror flashed in Yu Xiu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Who could block such an axe strike?</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a blood-red light flash, Qi Yuan's sword colliding with Fumos' axe at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu originally thought Fumos would have the upper hand, but things didn't develop according to his expectations at all.</p><p></p><p>Only to see Fumos in the sky suddenly split into two halves, then four halves, eight halves... more and more pieces, smaller and smaller, more and more fragmented...</p><p></p><p>Blood mist began to rain down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This was... Qi Yuan's one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Facing his one sword strike, Fumos had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu was incredibly shocked: "This is... a deity!"</p><p></p><p>Who else but a deity could kill the condemned with such a sword strike? Only a deity would have such majestic power.</p><p></p><p>He understood now. No wonder the blood compass shattered.</p><p></p><p>Because he was divining about a deity.</p><p></p><p>He was just confused about why there would be a deity... stranded in reality.</p><p></p><p>His mind was in chaos, along with deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan sheathed his sword, his clothes fluttering like an immortal descending to the mortal world. He looked at the man not far away and spoke, his voice ethereal like a secluded orchid.</p><p></p><p>"Han Xianyun, your wife is bleeding."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun: "..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 343</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Mere humans, you dare to be so reckless! You're nothing but food for us!"</p><p></p><p>Over three hundred demon soldiers charged forward.</p><p></p><p>What greeted them was a brutal strike from a staff.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical power! </p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving Sword Technique! Death's Radiant Light! As he activated his three great skills, Qi Yuan became ruthless, transforming into a grim reaper emerging from hell.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red clothes, paired with a blood-red staff.</p><p></p><p>With a single strike, four or five demon soldiers were instantly sent flying, their bodies shattering, dead beyond dead.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's combat skills and battle awareness were extremely terrifying. Or rather... fighting had become his instinct.</p><p></p><p>He charged into the midst of the three hundred demon soldiers as if entering unoccupied territory. </p><p></p><p>With each fall of his staff, demon soldiers would die.</p><p></p><p>"He's too strong!" Zhou Yuan trembled all over.</p><p></p><p>An unusual look also appeared in the Military Advisor's eyes: "If he enters the Martial Hero realm, who could stop him!"</p><p></p><p>The Peacock was now soaring in the air, her body emitting a green light. She was extremely enraged.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the ability, take one of my attacks!"</p><p></p><p>She was furious and humiliated.</p><p></p><p>Because this was the first time she had encountered such an enemy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan moved among the demon soldiers, extremely slippery.</p><p></p><p>Her attacks simply could not hit Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She also couldn't attack recklessly, because she might not only miss Qi Yuan, but end up killing her own demon soldiers!</p><p></p><p>She had strength but was unable to use it!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with her power at the Demon Hero level, she was confident she could cut that hateful person below into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she couldn't take it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Powerful blood martial energy erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The feathers on her back transformed into a curtain of green swords, frantically shooting towards Qi Yuan's position.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, moving like a dragon on the battlefield, glanced lightly at the Peacock. His form turned, and like a azure dragon he leapt across the battlefield, charging towards another position.</p><p></p><p>The green sword curtain went "whoosh whoosh" as it fell to the ground, directly killing five pitiful demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Peacock's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the guts, don't dodge, fight me head on!" the Peacock screamed.</p><p></p><p>She was very angry, and also very regretful.</p><p></p><p>Originally worried that Qi Yuan had other trump cards, she had sent demon soldiers to surround and attack him, intending to take the opportunity to kill him herself.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, Qi Yuan's speed was too fast, too agile.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was instead restricted.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, they might be able to wear Qi Yuan down in the end, but her subordinate demon soldiers would also suffer heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Now, she couldn't even order the demon soldiers to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Yuan was like a persistent disease, sticking close to the demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>As for threatening him with the suona player? She didn't even consider it.</p><p></p><p>How could this kind of powerful expert be threatened by such means? Of course, even if she fled the battlefield to find Huo Mushi, she wouldn't succeed.</p><p></p><p>Because, from the moment Qi Yuan stepped into this place,</p><p></p><p>This patch of heaven and earth, with him at the center, became a cage that was impossible to leave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form paused for a moment on the battlefield, his blood-colored wooden staff smashing an old ape demon to death.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Peacock in the sky, his eyes carrying a smile: "If it were an ordinary person, they wouldn't fall for your provocation.</p><p></p><p>But I'm different. My favorite thing to do is to give the enemy hope, and then... crush that hope."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice sounded, he stepped on a wild boar demon's tusk, directly shattering the tusk.</p><p></p><p>Using the rebound force, he leapt directly towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared on the Peacock's face: "Today, I'll let you see the difference between the Demon Hero realm and the Jade Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Peacock roared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her ultimate move was rapidly brewing.</p><p></p><p>As long as it finished brewing and hit Qi Yuan, he would surely die! This was her thought.</p><p></p><p>However, the smile on her face froze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an extremely fast flash of light passed by.</p><p></p><p>She had no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of fullness and tearing suddenly came from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Before she could realize what it was, a voice entered her ears.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, don't open your mouth so wide when you speak... Look, even such a thick staff can fit in!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the wooden staff and jabbed fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The staff went down her throat, directly piercing into the Peacock's stomach.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The Peacock screamed, but couldn't make a clear sound.</p><p></p><p>She was extremely angry in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Her ultimate move hadn't finished brewing! If it had finished brewing, the opponent would surely have died.</p><p></p><p>But now, she was impaled by the staff, completely losing the ability to resist, like a small yellow croaker on a bamboo skewer.</p><p></p><p>She was very angry, and also very regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Too weak... In my eyes, you're no different from those demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>No, there is a difference - you have more demon blood."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and the demon blood in the Peacock's body slowly began to separate.</p><p></p><p>The Peacock widened her eyes, her spirit scattering: "If you hadn't sneak attacked me, you... today... would surely have died!"</p><p></p><p>"How ridiculous." Qi Yuan smiled, "Considering you've provided me with so much demon blood, I won't break your illusion. I'll let you die with your regrets."</p><p></p><p>Even if the Peacock had used her ultimate move, Qi Yuan could have easily suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>He pressed down with his hand, and one of the three great generals of this demon camp thus perished.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the demon soldiers on the field showed expressions of either terror or fear.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan also felt a chill in his heart for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these demon soldiers, Qi Yuan in the sky sighed: "If only I had an emotion value system, I could earn a lot from their constant shock!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Qi Yuan landed on the ground, his wooden staff smashing down fiercely, causing another seven or eight demons to perish.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Military Advisor finally couldn't sit still: "Let's go, we need to leave quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Military Advisor shouted loudly, hurriedly fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou Yuan also didn't hesitate, running outwards.</p><p></p><p>As for those demon soldiers, they had long since been scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>Even a great general like the Peacock had died, what could they use to resist? But very quickly, the expression on the Military Advisor's face froze.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly discovered that a barrier had appeared in front, blocking him from leaving.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly exerted all his strength, attacking that barrier, but the barrier remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the fleeing demon soldiers, his expression calm: "When I stepped into the valley, it was already destined that you would only serve as substitutes for my true love!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, my heart is very cruel. I won't pray to the heavens: 'Revive, my true love!'"</p><p></p><p>As his voice fell, Qi Yuan once again charged into the midst of the demon soldiers like a demon god.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of killing, crying, and begging for mercy blended together.</p><p></p><p>Not a single demon was a match for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan roared as he charged towards Qi Yuan, the soul in his body surging, suddenly entering the Martial Hero realm.</p><p></p><p>"I've already given you my body, help me survive this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah, can we not fight, let's beg for mercy, this guy looks quite strong."</p><p></p><p>"We can't, it must be you die or I live!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he completely handed over control of his physical body to the remnant soul residing in it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that remnant soul which had originally been so eager to gain control of this body now became afraid and terrified. It just let out a ghostly wail before being forced to reincarnate to the underworld like a duck pushed onto a perch.</p><p></p><p>Today's suona was especially cheerful.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred demon soldiers all became ghosts under the staff.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Military Advisor looked at the blood-clothed Qi Yuan in the distance, Qi Yuan who was like a demon god, his expression desolate: "If the imperial court had heroes like you earlier, how could it have fallen to the point of migrating south."</p><p></p><p>After the Military Advisor finished speaking, he stretched out his neck and died.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gripped his staff, looking at this corpse: "Your courage is too small. With me here, why migrate south? You should be considering ascending to immortality."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the valley that had become a wasteland, his expression calm, without much joy.</p><p></p><p>After all, this level of monster killing really wasn't anything special.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, games where you kill monsters are still the best. Things like solving cases and investigating the truth are too boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and nearly three thousand units of demon blood were added to his account.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Huo Mushi</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His face was flushed red, breathing heavily. Hmm, he was playing the suona.</p><p></p><p>Someone who didn't know what was happening might think he was slaying demons, while Qi Yuan was playing the suona.</p><p></p><p>"Sir... you truly are a war god!" Huo Mushi couldn't help exclaiming. </p><p></p><p>These 300 demon soldiers, plus the great general Peacock, would have been enough to slaughter Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was both excited and worried.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Doing such a big thing this time.</p><p></p><p>The demon leader of Shu Demon Mountain would surely not sit idly by, and would definitely send all his demon troops, personally leading them to eliminate Lord Qi.</p><p></p><p>What awaited them was likely to be a great escape!</p><p></p><p>His heart felt both thrilled and excited, all jumbled up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Huo Mushi, his expression calm: "Can you still play?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Huo Mushi was stunned, not knowing what Lord Qi meant.</p><p></p><p>This "play", did he mean play the suona, or something else?</p><p></p><p>"I feel this dream stick has a good feel to it, so... no time like the present, let's go slaughter the demon camp."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"What??" Huo Mushi's eyes widened, thinking he had misheard, "Go slaughter the demon camp... now?"</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't they run away first, engage in a great escape? Charge straight in to kill?</p><p></p><p>He must be joking, right?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, though it might be a bit tricky. Can you still play the suona or not? What if I'm in the middle of happily killing and you can't play anymore?" Qi Yuan looked at Huo Mushi with a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi's heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan in his blood-red clothes, and finally nodded firmly: "I can still play!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's go... wipe out Shu Demon Mountain... the whole clan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gripped the wooden stick, a slight smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Huo Mushi's expression was resolute.</p><p></p><p>No matter the outcome, he had to go along for this battle.</p><p></p><p>As moonlight fell, two figures - one large and one small - cast long shadows among the mountains.</p><p></p><p>The wind made the blood-red clothes flutter noisily.</p><p></p><p>From within the demon camp came a loud shout: "Who goes there!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huo Mushi raised his suona with a solemn expression, ready to face death.</p><p></p><p>Today... even if he died in battle here, he would likely go down in history.</p><p></p><p>And in front, that blood-red figure had a cold expression, but his voice was extremely gentle: "My bride, let us fight side by side!"</p><p></p><p>The figure ahead, like a war god, suddenly grew taller at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red armor covered his tall, straight body completely, with blood-red spikes on the shoulders that seemed to be dripping blood, especially eerie.</p><p></p><p>He was like a demon god walking out of the underworld, advancing silently.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers also shook at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Those blood-red eyes emitted an otherworldly light.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Tonight was destined to be a night of bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, many demons were destined to never see tomorrow's sun.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand demon soldiers... is that a lot?</p><p></p><p>The massive blood-red figure crashed into the demon camp.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter... had begun.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Yang Guang's face showed a worried expression: "Zhou Yuan is missing."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" An Qiao was stunned for a moment, then also sensed the smell of conspiracy, "He wouldn't go cause trouble for Mr. Qi, would he?"</p><p></p><p>The worry on Yang Guang's face deepened: "If I remember correctly, he has an item that can check the exact location of people nearby. If..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was most unpredictable, capable of doing anything.</p><p></p><p>It was even possible he would cooperate with the demon race.</p><p></p><p>"With Mr. Qi's strength, if he doesn't linger to fight and keeps fleeing, unless all 3000 demon troops come out, they simply can't catch him. We need to hurry and complete the mission, and take Mr. Qi away!" An Qiao said seriously.</p><p></p><p>As long as the mission was completed and they saw Qi Yuan, they could leave at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for the demon troops in the camp, even if they were surrounded, they could easily escape.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang nodded, agreeing with An Qiao's words, but looking at the child soldiers and old soldiers on the city wall, his expression was somewhat desolate: "It's a pity, even if we complete the mission, it won't do any good for the people of Zhenyang City. Those demon troops..."</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang's words were bleak, his voice helpless.</p><p></p><p>After they left, the people of Zhenyang City would still suffer the ravages of the demon troops.</p><p></p><p>The people in this city were like pigs for slaughter.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was moved.</p><p></p><p>This time, when they returned with the demon beast corpses, the reactions of those soldiers made her quite sad.</p><p></p><p>Especially that county magistrate, who personally came forward to apologize.</p><p></p><p>She knew that magistrate still hadn't given up hope of getting help from the Demon Suppression Department of the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>But... they weren't actually from the imperial court's Demon Suppression Department, and had no way to help the humans of this world.</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave at dawn tomorrow, complete the mission... and go," Yang Guang said. "Before we go, let's kill a few more demons, consider it doing something for them."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My lord, Wind Flower Cave is just ahead!" Huo Mushi looked cautiously at the man in front of him, his eyes full of awe.</p><p></p><p>The scene from last night was still deeply etched in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This man was like a god descending from heaven.</p><p></p><p>One man charging straight into the military camp.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the attacks of 3000 demon troops, he grew stronger the more he killed, like an invincible god of death.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand demon troops, all died at his hands.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even escape.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's combat techniques were too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The three great skills of Tyrannical Power, Heaven-Cleaving Sword Draw, and Death's Radiance were simply too overpowered.</p><p></p><p>Especially Death's Radiance, which was equivalent to infinite health recovery, and the lower his health, the stronger he became.</p><p></p><p>Among these 3000 demon troops, there was no one even one level stronger than Qi Yuan, so he just needed to kill, kill, kill.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Primal Body of the Foodless Holy Mother also allowed Qi Yuan to constantly improve himself in battle.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he grew stronger the more he killed.</p><p></p><p>In the slaughter, Qi Yuan also understood the correct way to play this game.</p><p></p><p>The truth... what was that? He should just kill, kill, kill.</p><p></p><p>So, he came to Wind Flower Cave not to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>But to... take away the mission target.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise... if others completed the mission, wouldn't that mean he had to go back? So, the best method was to not complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>Take the mission target... and go kill, kill, kill!</p><p></p><p>The world was so vast, how many demons were there?</p><p></p><p>Especially the demons of the North, numbering at least tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>If he obtained the essence blood of all demons.</p><p></p><p>His strength... would likely skyrocket!</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was happy about this, but those who came to participate in the mission together would probably curse him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Wind Flower Cave ahead, his eyes revealing an excited smile: "Close for me! Cover for me!"</p><p></p><p>He instantly used his techniques to restrain the two auras he sensed in Wind Flower Cave.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, mouths closed, people covered up.</p><p></p><p>Can't hear sounds, can't see people...</p><p></p><p>That shouldn't count as knowing the truth or finding the target, right? Immediately, the human and demon in Wind Flower Cave revealed fearful and shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>They struggled constantly, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps were heard at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it's indeed these two. Alright, I'm going to take them wandering the world. Little Mushi, are you going back to Zhenyang City, or following me to play the suona for me? I'll be frank, I'm short on money now and won't be able to pay you a salary." The information his eyes received was that these two wrapped in black cloth were indeed who he was looking for.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also stopped thinking.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he figured out the truth, the mission would be completed, and that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Huo Mushi's eyes revealed a delighted expression: "I am willing to follow my lord!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

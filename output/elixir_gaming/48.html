        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Second Day.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial court, dark clouds gathered.</p><p></p><p>Minster of Rites Kong Qi, tall and handsome in his deep robes, was filled with anger: "Prime Minister, for three consecutive days, the Dragon Battle Army, the Black Flag Army, and the Liaodong Army have brazenly entered the imperial capital. Are you... planning a rebellion?"</p><p></p><p>A hush fell over the court.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that, except for a few officials, the vast majority of officials were completely obedient to Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>Now, the arrival of the three armies in the capital was exactly what they had been hoping for.</p><p></p><p>It was time for the Southern Qin Dynasty to change.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they did not know that the entry of these armies was not a rebellion, but rather... just some sacrificial lambs.</p><p></p><p>And they themselves were also sacrificial lambs, no different from those soldiers and common people.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting strode forward majestically and said to the Minister of Rites: "The three armies have entered the capital according to the orders of the Ministry of War, in compliance with the laws of Southern Qin."</p><p></p><p>The other officials all burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>The esteemed Kong Qi, known for his gentle nature and upright character, was now enraged by Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>"Sima Ting's intentions are known to all!" Kong Qi said, suddenly bursting into tears, "Among all the civil and military officials, not a single one... Southern Qin... is doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The other officials looked at Kong Qi with mocking expressions. </p><p></p><p>Kong Qi was a qualified esteemed scholar, but certainly not a mature official.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the previously silent Duke of Yu spoke up: "Prime Minister, the purpose of mobilizing the three armies into the city, does His Majesty know of it?"</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting glanced at the Duke of Yu, surprised that this old turtle would also speak up for Jinli.</p><p></p><p>But none of this mattered anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't His Majesty already aware of it now?" Sima Ting looked at Jinli, seated on the throne, with a smile, showing no respect at all.</p><p></p><p>The late emperor was a puppet in his hands.</p><p>Jinli was also placed on the throne by him.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that all the civil and military officials were his people.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Recently, there have been demonic forces troubling the imperial capital. I have mobilized the three armies to ensure His Majesty's safety. </p><p>During this period, an edict will be issued prohibiting anyone from leaving the capital. After half a month, when the demonic forces are eliminated, the three armies will withdraw. There is no need for you all to be anxious!"</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting then turned and left abruptly, without even a glance.</p><p></p><p>The other officials also quickly departed one by one.</p><p></p><p>Some even secretly paid their respects to Jinli before hurriedly leaving.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the vast palace was left with only a few officials and the troubled Jinli.</p><p></p><p>When Jinli wearily returned to her sleeping quarters, she looked at the Linglong Jade Pendant in her hand.</p><p></p><p>If the country fell and she died, could the promise made back then still be fulfilled?</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the towering ancient Qi tree, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qin Aunt entered, her face heavy with fatigue and a hint of anger: "Your Majesty, the three armies have all entered, and the city gates are sealed. </p><p>If Sima Ting resorts to desperate measures, this old servant will risk her life to take Your Majesty away!"</p><p></p><p>The commander of the imperial guards, Hua Xian, also knelt on one knee: "I am willing to die for Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at these loyal subjects and slowly said, "I'm sorry... for all of you."</p><p></p><p>She had never been a capable empress.</p><p></p><p>Even her cultivation had been secretly sabotaged by Sima Ting's people, progressing slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Sima Ting is extremely ambitious and will likely make his move within half a month.</p><p>I... will not be able to leave the imperial city.</p><p>As for you all, there is still a chance.</p><p>Leave the capital and go to the XuanYuan Forbidden Land, you may escape this calamity."</p><p>Jinli arranged a way out for Qin Aunt and her other trusted aides.</p><p>And at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Aunt Qin's gaze became profound: "Your Majesty, that old scoundrel Sima Ting may not have simply usurped the throne. In the Prime Minister's mansion, I sensed several extremely obscure and powerful auras, including those of the Demon Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Clan?" Jinli was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"And the auras of the Demon Clan outside the city seem even stronger, with Imperial-level powerhouses... no less than three of them!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Jinli was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know what Sima Ting was planning to do...</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, Qi Yuan was clad in a blood-red battle armor, unleashing his combat prowess to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>He charged forward like a giant, rampaging dinosaur, slaying numerous Robe Monsters with each impact.</p><p></p><p>His experience bar surged upwards! Suddenly, Qi Yuan let out a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>"I'm level 90 now!"</p><p></p><p>He had finally reached level 90! At level 90, according to the division of the Wangyue Continent, he had reached the realm above the Celestial Domain, the God Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was a qualitative difference from level 89!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could feel his strength, speed, and physique all surging across the board.</p><p></p><p>If previously he had been afraid of the Robe Monsters' attacks and only dared to venture out at night, now he was fearless.</p><p></p><p>He could grind monsters during the day, no matter how many Robe Monsters came, he would slay them all!</p><p></p><p>"Two new skills!"</p><p></p><p>Upon breaking through to level 90, he had gained two additional skills.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he felt that Little Marry was truly the best Robe Monster in the world.</p><p></p><p>Wearing her not only increased his level by 5, but also allowed him to freeload two new skills.</p><p></p><p>He began to examine his skills.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Stabilization?"</p><p></p><p>The first minor skill, called Spirit Stabilization, could stabilize the soul, allowing him to remain steadfast in the face of illusions and phantasms.</p><p></p><p>"Death Radiance?"</p><p></p><p>The major skill was called Death Radiance.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this major skill, Qi Yuan couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>This skill was about dancing on the tightrope of death.</p><p></p><p>Only when life was on the brink, when treading the critical line of death, could one unleash the most dazzling brilliance and the mightiest combat power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was not only a powerful offensive skill, but also a self-healing skill.</p><p></p><p>Damaging the enemy would allow him to absorb their life force to heal his own injuries.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the lower his health, the stronger he would become, and it also had the ability to drain the enemy's health and mana.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't they give me the legendary sword Siming? Then I would be truly invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that this skill was a bit dangerous and would need to be combined with the legendary sword Siming.</p><p></p><p>That way, he might even be able to steal the enemy's crystal.</p><p></p><p>"But it's still very good. When at full health, using Death Radiance can double my combat power."</p><p></p><p>Gripping the blood-red greatsword, Qi Yuan's gaze, through the Robe Prohibition, looked towards the deepest part.</p><p></p><p>"The Ugly Monster..."</p><p></p><p>"No, the Ugly Robe Monster King, I'm coming for you."</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Robe Prohibition, the Ugly Robe Monster King, who had been staring at Qi Yuan all along, also swiftly approached Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The two rushed towards each other in an instant, and then the most intense collision occurred!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red aura on Qi Yuan's armor seemed to be about to overflow. He raised his sword, and the sword, which was originally only a few meters long, had now grown to over a thousand meters in length, fueled by the red blood aura.</p><p></p><p>"Eat my sword!"</p><p></p><p>With Death Radiance, Qi Yuan's fighting style had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>He pursued the strongest attack power and the widest range of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Although the aftershock couldn't harm the Ugly Robe Monster King, it could slay the other Robe Monsters.</p><p></p><p>This provided experience points and enemy loot for blood absorption.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, he no longer had to worry about running out of mana, as he could unleash his skills without restraint!</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will slay you!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

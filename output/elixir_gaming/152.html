        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If any yin spirits move against me, I will invoke Lord Feng's name."</p><p></p><p>His group chat friends were truly good.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was still too weak now. He could only cling to the big shots' coattails, unable to help them solve problems.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his chat with the Great Sun Flame Emperor, Qi Yuan switched to the Blood Robe Sword God account.</p><p></p><p>This account indeed had many new friend requests.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Eastern Land leader of the Divine Flower Society? </p><p></p><p>As expected of a big shot, not even changing their ID."</p><p></p><p>He approved the friend request from the ID "Divine Flower Society Eastern Land Leader".</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a message came through.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God friend, do you have time?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"I never expected our Divine Flower Society Eastern Branch would gain such a powerful expert as the Blood Robe Sword God." The Eastern Land leader started with flattery.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel a bit embarrassed, so he asked directly: "What matter does the leader seek me for?"</p><p></p><p>"Can your conflict with the Palace of Light be resolved peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was displeased.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light and I have a deep blood feud, it cannot be resolved!"</p><p></p><p>Was this Divine Flower Society Eastern Land leader here to mediate?</p><p></p><p>"It's just some minor grievances, why can't you let it go, friend?</p><p></p><p>You are strong, but two fists can't beat four hands. The Palace of Light has gathered dozens of Purple Mansion cultivators, led by three late-stage Purple Mansion experts. If you go there, you'll just be going to your death."</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Land leader was speaking the truth, which was also the understanding of almost all Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Now, regarding the feud between Blood Robe Sword God and the Palace of Light, almost all powerful experts believed it would come to nothing until one side produced a yin spirit.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Blood Robe Sword God was too strong and had no attachments. The Palace of Light couldn't deal with such a lone cultivator for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Palace of Light was too powerful. If they retreated now and Blood Robe Sword God went to provoke them, it would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>"I've already posted that I'm going to exterminate the entire Palace of Light. If I don't go now, wouldn't that make me lose face?" Qi Yuan replied matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>This answer stumped the Eastern Land leader.</p><p></p><p>"If you're willing to reconcile, the three Palace Masters of Light will personally apologize to you. </p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light will also offer... a number of techniques and treasures." The Eastern Land leader continued, "The specific compensation details would need to be discussed between you and the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, at the Flying Immortal Tower, the Palace of Light will hold a Hundred Immortals Banquet to apologize to you. At that time, you can send a split body to meet with the Palace Masters of Light to discuss the specific details of compensation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was amused.</p><p></p><p>Was this still the arrogant Palace of Light he once knew?</p><p></p><p>"I still prefer their initial arrogant appearance."</p><p></p><p>Wasn't an arrogant, cold and noble, lofty white moonlight more desirable to conquer?</p><p></p><p>"If they want to talk, first stop the Hundred Nations Blood War, then have every Purple Mansion cultivator commit suicide." Qi Yuan directly made an outrageous demand.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Land leader fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Was this negotiation? "Blood Robe Sword God, do you really not want to meet and talk?" The Eastern Land leader's tone was somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Is my request too much? </p><p></p><p>They're not even willing to commit suicide, showing no sincerity at all. What reconciliation is there to talk about!"</p><p></p><p>"Meet? Forget about the Flying Immortal Tower.</p><p></p><p>Seven days from now, I'll personally go to the Palace of Light headquarters. Tell them to wash their necks and wait."  Qi Yuan said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he went to the Divine Flower Society forum and made a post.</p><p></p><p>《Seven days from now, I, Blood Robe Sword God, representing justice, will raze the Palace of Light!》</p><p></p><p>This time, his plan to destroy the Palace of Light received a lot of support.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally issued a death notice.</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan felt refreshed and invigorated.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Palace of Light should all be holed up in their headquarters, perfect for striking them down in one fell swoop."</p><p></p><p>Soon after this post was made, many people commented.</p><p></p><p>"Is the senior for real?"</p><p></p><p>"Witnessing history!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior is mighty, I've long disliked the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, maybe you should reconsider?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the comments below, Qi Yuan's fighting spirit soared.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the people's hearts are with me, justice is on my side."</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw some pessimistic replies below, listing the Palace of Light's strength and saying Blood Robe Sword God couldn't possibly destroy them, Qi Yuan's expression turned unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I mute them?"</p><p></p><p>"Although what they're saying makes some sense, it just feels very annoying to look at."</p><p></p><p>At this moment Qi Yuan understood - fortunately he wasn't an emperor. If he were emperor, he would definitely be a tyrannical one, unable to listen to any long-winded loyal advice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then replied to his die-hard fan Fox Den Little Li:</p><p></p><p>"For this destruction of the Palace of Light, I'll count you as contributing."</p><p></p><p>Far away, Fox Den Little Li was bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, I just came to cheer you on, don't drag me into this!"</p><p></p><p>Although she was very far from the Palace of Light, gaining an enemy for no reason was still not good.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With one post, all of Emerald Cloud Continent was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Now in Emerald Cloud Continent, in all the taverns, inns, brothels and pleasure boats, the most discussed topic was the final battle between the Palace of Light and Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Because Blood Robe Sword God had declared he would raze the Palace of Light in seven days, which was beyond many people's expectations.</p><p></p><p>These people didn't understand why Blood Robe Sword God dared to do this. Even the number one expert below yin spirit level in the Eastern Lands, Ascension Pavilion Master Old Man Wutian, wouldn't dare say he could destroy the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>How did Blood Robe Sword God dare?</p><p></p><p>Most low-level cultivators verbally supported Blood Robe Sword God, but no one actually believed he would win.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if Blood Robe Sword God killed nine Purple Mansion experts of the Palace of Light, they still had over fifty Purple Mansion cultivators, including three late-stage Purple Mansion experts.</p><p></p><p>Plus their foundation built over tens of thousands of years, how could Blood Robe Sword God fight against that?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan came out of his cave dwelling, intending to bask in the sun.</p><p></p><p>A voice immediately reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe Sword God and junior brother Qi Yuan must both be cultivators of the Path of Folly, otherwise how can you explain a Purple Mansion powerhouse declaring he'll personally go to the Palace of Light and raze it to the ground!" The speaker was Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya stood nearby, her brows furrowed as if also pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Kang Fulu's words, Qi Yuan was immediately displeased: "Senior brother, is it not possible that Blood Robe Sword God could display great divine might and destroy the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Kang Fulu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya then spoke up: "Master once said the Palace of Light has yin spirit level foundations... even he couldn't do anything to the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>For Blood Robe Sword God... it would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>The waters here run deep, I don't know what the final outcome will be either.</p><p></p><p>But the result of this matter is irrelevant to us, we should focus on preparing for the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kang Fulu's expression also turned serious.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Lands Genius Rankings opening in half a month was of utmost importance.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to work hard on the task entrusted by the Divine Light Sect Leader, his father-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued basking in the sun, muttering: "No wonder the Palace of Light has been tyrannical for so many years and remains evergreen, because everyone in the world fears yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>But I'm not afraid. I have Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, Star Gold Core, and Lord Feng. What's a mere yin spirit to worry about?"</p><p></p><p>After sunbathing for a while, Qi Yuan felt bored. It was time to go back and continue revising techniques.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" needed to be pushed forward.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Little Jia obediently eating blood crystals beside him, Qi Yuan couldn't help asking: "Do you think I can destroy the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>Little Jia paused, her sleeves tugging Qi Yuan's hand as she nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>A smile immediately appeared on Qi Yuan's face as he embraced Little Jia's slender waist.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, you have the keenest eye, Little Jia!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's previous slight irritation disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the endless mountains, Qi Yuan wore a blood-colored robe with a sword on his back.</p><p></p><p>Endless blood energy swirled around the sword.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli wore a black robe and held a suona horn, his face bearing an uneasy expression.</p><p></p><p>When he first heard Blood Robe Sword God declare he would destroy the Palace of Light, he was also very shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although he had heard Blood Robe Sword God vow to destroy the Palace of Light before, he never took it seriously.</p><p></p><p>But this time... was it for real?</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, for the destruction of the Palace of Light, only you are here to play music for me." Qi Yuan looked at Xu Yeli and said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Without three hundred supreme beings playing music, he felt something was missing.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yeli felt uneasy inside.</p><p></p><p>Still thinking about music at a time like this, this Blood Robe Sword God was truly otherworldly!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, when do we depart?" Xu Yeli's heart was conflicted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he felt some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>This time was different from before, they were heading to the Palace of Light headquarters.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Robe Sword God fell, he would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>"With the two of us assembled, we depart now."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli gritted his teeth and hurriedly followed, flying towards the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>At this time, countless gazes from various immortal mountains and great cities were fixed on the Palace of Light headquarters.</p><p></p><p>When they saw that blood-energy rainbow in the sky, everyone was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God has come."</p><p></p><p>"He really dared to go!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, no matter the outcome of this battle, it will surely go down in history."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Blood-Robed Sword God kills more Purple Palace cultivators from the Palace of Light before he dies."</p><p></p><p>"Don't get too close, to avoid being caught in the crossfire."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, who was in the sky above, stopped in his tracks. </p><p></p><p>Because right in front of him, a celestial carriage was blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>The carriage was drawn by six Divine Infant realm Purple Lightning Mad Lions, looking extremely majestic.</p><p></p><p>An arrogant voice came from inside the carriage:</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Qi Yuan's expression was cold. Having his path blocked put him in a bad mood.</p><p></p><p>"By order of the Yin God, the grudge between the Palace of Light and the Blood-Robed Sword God ends here." The curtain of the carriage was pulled back, and a snow-white arm extended out, holding a golden decree that appeared before Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>On the decree was engraved a large character for "God", emanating a terrifying aura. </p><p></p><p>Anyone who saw that "God" character, whether Divine Infant or Purple Palace cultivator, would feel an overwhelming sense of awe in their mind.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately laughed: "Which Yin God?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, the palace-robed woman frowned slightly, displeased with Qi Yuan's tone: "The Venerable Yejong of the Heaven and Earth Cave!"</p><p></p><p>Before returning to the Palace of Light, the Grand Palace Master of the Palace of Light had visited this Yin God at the Heaven and Earth Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Don't know him," Qi Yuan said lazily. "He's not the police, nor a judge. He has no right to manage me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli, who was behind Qi Yuan, broke out in a cold sweat upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword God was too bold. That was a Yin God after all.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the palace-robed woman finally couldn't help but walk out of the carriage. With phoenix eyes, she looked arrogant: "You dare to defy the Venerable's decree? </p><p></p><p>You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The palace-robed woman had served the Venerable Yejong for thousands of years. Any Purple Palace cultivator who saw her would be extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>When facing a Yin God, those Purple Palace cultivators would be even more humble.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attitude made her very displeased.</p><p></p><p>"I'm courting death?" Killing intent flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes. "I think you're the one courting death!"</p><p></p><p>He had been flying smoothly, with an imposing momentum, ready to destroy the Palace of Light in one fell swoop, but was suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>An imperious old woman came to lecture him. How could he not be angry?</p><p></p><p>Now she even dared to threaten him?</p><p></p><p>The palace-robed woman was stunned. She looked at Qi Yuan in disbelief: "The Venerable originally thought you had some talent and wanted to resolve the grudge to save your life. It seems you are truly foolish and unaware!</p><p></p><p>Very well, Blood-Robed Sword God. I will report everything you said today to the Venerable Yejong!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the palace-robed woman waved her sleeve and entered the celestial carriage.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was filled with killing intent, but unfortunately she was no match for the Blood-Robed Sword God. Otherwise, with her temperament, she would have attacked directly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when she returned, she would certainly embellish this matter when reporting to the Venerable Yejong.</p><p></p><p>By then, the Blood-Robed Sword God would be a dead man.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Purple Palace and Divine Infant cultivators who witnessed this scene were very shocked and discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God is truly too fierce. That was an envoy of a Yin God, yet he offended her without hesitation!"</p><p></p><p>"If he wasn't so bold, would he dare to go to the Palace of Light headquarters?"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. Having offended the Venerable Yejong, even if he survives this trip to the Palace of Light by luck, there will be no place for him in the Eastern Lands."</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the shock on their faces grew even greater.</p><p></p><p>They heard a voice full of killing intent from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"Did I say you could leave?"</p><p></p><p>"People can go, but the corpse must stay here!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan spoke, he attacked.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword unsheathed, with a surging bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>The innate divine ability of the Heart Demon Attractor of the Void Realm Overlord transformed into a blood-colored beam of light along with that blood-colored long sword, directly piercing the chest of the palace-robed woman.</p><p></p><p>The palace-robed woman had a look of disbelief on her face, like a female "sea emperor" seeing a simp not simping for her: "You... you're mad..."</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>How dare the Blood-Robed Sword God!</p><p></p><p>She was an envoy of a Yin God!</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Qi Yuan struck with his sword again.</p><p></p><p>One big move, one normal attack, and the small Purple Palace mid-stage cultivator died at Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and the palace-robed woman's storage bag fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a look and immediately smiled with joy, the anger in his heart completely disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Killed well, killed wonderfully, killed perfectly!"</p><p></p><p>This palace-robed woman was too rich! There were actually two heaven-grade secret techniques in her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the shattered corpse of the palace-robed woman with a guilty expression: "I'm sorry, if I had known you were so rich, I shouldn't have raised my voice at you earlier."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to squeeze out some small pearls, but unfortunately he couldn't.</p><p></p><p>He could only attribute it to this moonlight not being worth his deep feelings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators who witnessed this scene fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God had killed an envoy of a Yin God? The Blood-Robed Sword God was not leaving himself any way out! No matter the outcome of today's battle with the Palace of Light, the Blood-Robed Sword God would have no place to stay in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally didn't know what everyone was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew, he wouldn't care.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the celestial carriage, remembering what the Great Sun Flame Emperor had said before.</p><p></p><p>When facing a crisis involving a Yin God, he could mention Wind Lord's name.</p><p></p><p>So he calmly said two words to the carriage: "Wind Lord."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan turned into a blood-red rainbow and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Palace of Light, fifty-six Purple Palace cultivators gathered.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expression was very solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Palace Master bathed in radiance, his eyes showing a look of surprise: "The Blood-Robed Sword God... killed the Venerable Yejong's envoy."</p><p></p><p>"What?" The Third Palace Master Zi Kui's face changed drastically, then he became delighted. "He's seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Palace Master's voice was gentle and refined: "No wonder he dared to come to our Palace of Light headquarters. He's not pretending to be crazy, he's truly insane."</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't truly insane, how would he dare to do such a thing? Even the Old Man of No Heaven probably wouldn't dare to directly charge into the Palace of Light headquarters, and kill a Yin God's envoy on the way.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's really unlucky to offend such a madman." The Second Palace Master sighed, seemingly lamenting the nine Purple Palace cultivators who had died.</p><p></p><p>"After killing the Blood-Robed Sword God this time, I will personally bring his corpse to pay respects to the Venerable Yejong," the Grand Palace Master said.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God had offended the Venerable Yejong. After eliminating him, he naturally wanted to make good use of this relationship.</p><p></p><p>Among the Purple Palace cultivators present, some were excited, while others were worried.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Palace Master's eyes were deep.</p><p></p><p>In his sleeve, the Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown was still dormant.</p><p></p><p>This was also his greatest reliance.</p><p></p><p>This was also the foundation that allowed the Palace of Light to stand for ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Even a Yin God would not easily make an enemy of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>However, this Yin God artifact was still incomplete. It needed to be perfected through the blood battles of a hundred countries before it could be used normally like a true Yin God artifact.</p><p></p><p>Before that, it was best not to use it if possible.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Grand Palace Master did not want to use it.</p><p></p><p>"We gave him a chance to reconcile. Since he didn't agree and came to seek death, we can only fulfill his wish," the Third Palace Master Zi Kui spoke, his voice resentful.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light had already shown great sincerity, even apologizing, but the Blood-Robed Sword God not only didn't accept it, he even came to seek death!</p><p></p><p>This was also the thought of all the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>"He's here."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an urgent voice came.</p><p></p><p>The more than fifty Purple Palace cultivators on the scene all looked up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Red entered their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Where the blood-colored rainbow passed, a murderous aura filled the sky.</p><p></p><p>This murderous aura seemed too intense, dyeing even the sky red.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red sky was eerie and ghostly. Anyone who saw it would inexplicably feel a sense of fear in their heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wore a blood-colored robe, standing in mid-air, extremely handsome.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword on his back seemed to be trembling, eager to unsheathe and drink the blood of the world.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze over the majestic Palace of Light in front, his tone lazy: "Those who leave the Palace of Light now, I will not kill today."</p><p></p><p>There were no weaklings at the Palace of Light headquarters now. The weakest who came were all Divine Infant realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Third Palace Master Zi Kui's face showed disdain: "Such big words!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Zi Kui sideways: "I brush my teeth every day, I don't have bad breath.</p><p></p><p>As for you, you probably haven't brushed your teeth in hundreds of years. You're choking me.</p><p></p><p>Is bad breath your innate divine ability?</p><p></p><p>Your innate divine ability is truly strong, it has injured me."</p><p></p><p>Zi Kui's face turned from green to red, he could only say: "Sharp-tongued!"</p><p></p><p>The many Purple Palace and Divine Infant cultivators below looked at Qi Yuan with solemn expressions. They didn't feel as relaxed and carefree as Qi Yuan in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This battle seemed unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Blood clouds pressed down on the palace. Over fifty Purple Palace cultivators plus a thousand Divine Infant cultivators were arrayed in formation, their expressions inevitably somewhat nervous.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze swept over the more than a thousand cultivators present. Seeing a sea of white, he showed a satisfied expression: "The Palace of Light truly deserves to be the number one power in Cuiyun Continent. They're all old men I like."</p><p></p><p>Qualified old men, qualified moonlight.</p><p></p><p>He snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Xu Yeli tremblingly picked up the suona. This was his first time facing so many Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The desolate sound of the suona rose at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The solemn atmosphere also condensed to the extreme at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Begin the killing!" A cruel smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>PS: New chapters can only be released at 6 o'clock. Don't scold me, I reminded you in the title.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

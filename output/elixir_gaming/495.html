        <h1>Chapter 495</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This gun?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao looked at the thick and long gun, and the goatee man shuddered.</p><p></p><p>The cold gun barrel, the chilling aura, the gun was covered in special patterns.</p><p></p><p>Sunlight streamed in from the window, spilling onto the cold gun, faintly exuding a frigid air.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the long gun, his expression calm: "Unfortunately, this gun can't be fired, the ones that can be fired are the impressive ones!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He could turn Zhishuang into a powerful sniper, what's a Barrett.</p><p></p><p>But, no bullets! If he pulled the trigger on Zhishuang, would she be able to shoot out bullets? At most it would just be a water gun, too weak in power.</p><p></p><p>The long gun is more suitable.</p><p></p><p>"How's Red Cloud Stronghold?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, let's talk as we walk."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Bang! Qi Yuan was abruptly blocked by the door.</p><p></p><p>The long gun was held horizontally, colliding with the wall, unable to get through.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Kangbao quickly said, "Young master, why don't you walk with the gun vertically? The door is narrower but taller."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'll just wrap it around my waist."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao: "???"</p><p></p><p>Of course, after wrapping it around his waist, Qi Yuan's belly looked very large. Before going out, he also used his shapeshifting abilities to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would cause a commotion when he went out.</p><p></p><p>He's always low-key.</p><p></p><p>But the gun is too big to hide.</p><p></p><p>Just like how an excessive bust size inevitably attracts attention, when Qi Yuan went out, many wandering cultivators' gazes fell on him.</p><p></p><p>"What is he... wrapping around himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Strange."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Downstairs at the inn, many diners were discussing in hushed tones.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Kangbao puffed out his chest and said, "My young master has a long gun wrapped around his waist!"</p><p></p><p>"Long gun?" An middle-aged female cultivator covered her mouth in disbelief, her ears turning red as she stole glances at Qi Yuan, her gaze shimmering.</p><p></p><p>"It's so big, umm!"</p><p></p><p>Under the amazed gazes of the onlookers, Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao walked out of the inn.</p><p></p><p>"In this period, there have been consecutive deaths in Red Cloud Stronghold, suspected to be related to a malicious spirit." Chen Kangbao told Qi Yuan the information he had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Bai Yueguang?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Although, in the immortal realm, these malicious spirits did not conform to Bai Yueguang's principles.</p><p></p><p>But this is the game world, so Qi Yuan didn't mind that much.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Bai Yueguang!" Chen Kangbao nodded, "I secretly bribed an official in the yamen and looked through the case files of Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>I found... the victims all died at night, and there was a common point - the neighbors heard the sound of flowing water before the victims died."</p><p></p><p>"Get to the point." Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>He has always treated people equally, never minding Bai Yueguang's background or qualifications.</p><p></p><p>Some otakus might even restrict Bai Yueguang by gender, but Qi Yuan is not picky, both men and women are fine.</p><p>Even if she has a gambling father, a cancer-stricken mother, and a hoodlum brother, as long as she is Qi Yuan's Bai Yueguang, he will not hesitate to send her to the Pure Land.</p><p></p><p>"...the strength is unknown." Chen Kangbao said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Eat two less buns tonight!" Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>This strategist is not qualified at all.</p><p></p><p>He just knows how to eat every day, not doing his duties.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, can I have one?" Chen Kangbao asked dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao hung his head. Eating one less bun at night, wouldn't that be... starving to death?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, can malicious spirits be eaten?" Chen Kangbao asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>He had to find a way to get an extra meal.</p><p></p><p>"Anything that exists in this world can be eaten, the only question is... whether you can eat them to death or not." Qi Yuan expressed his "profound" opinion.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Chen Kangbao was somewhat worried, "How can I eat them without dying?"</p><p></p><p>"Deep fry them? Sun-dried?" Qi Yuan speculated, "At such high temperatures, any poison would be killed, right?" Of course, he was just thinking out loud.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Yuan suddenly had a brainwave.</p><p></p><p>If there's the sun, that means there's fire.</p><p>If there are kitchen knives, that means there are cooking utensils.</p><p>If there are Bai Yueguang's malicious spirits, that means there are dishes.</p><p></p><p>In the future, can he do catering? After all, for small businesses, the first thing they usually do is start a catering business, right?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess had an icy expression, a red light flickering in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She stood on high ground, overlooking Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The silver firs stood tall, scattered among the buildings, with wisps of smoke rising, the entire sky was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the woman dressed as a Taoist priestess, in the distance of Red Cloud Stronghold, there were densely packed black dots.</p><p></p><p>These black dots, some were big, some were small.</p><p>The small ones were only as big as mosquitoes.</p><p>The large ones were as big as eggs.</p><p></p><p>"They're getting bigger and bigger, when they reach the size of a fist, the malicious spirits will take that person's life!" </p><p></p><p>Her gaze shifted to an ancient well, her expression complex: "Very troublesome."</p><p></p><p>She vaguely sensed the existence of a powerful malicious spirit there.</p><p>Just by sensing it, she felt a chill down her spine, as if countless eyes were staring at her.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how is it?" Zhou Hu saw the Taoist priestess finish her observation, and quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priestess-dressed woman did not immediately answer, but asked, "How is the investigation going?"</p><p></p><p>To deal with malicious spirits, the Exorcist Soldiers in this world have already summarized some experience and have a complete method.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of malicious spirits is often not out of thin air, but is related to some tragic past events.</p><p></p><p>For example, it could be a brutally murdered child, or an entire ant colony that was exterminated.</p><p></p><p>Polluted and transformed into malicious spirits.</p><p></p><p>Malicious spirits are extremely powerful and often kill indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>The best way to deal with them is to find out the original cause of the malicious spirit, and then formulate a corresponding strategy.</p><p></p><p>For example, if a mouse that died screaming "Mom, I'm not coming home tonight" became a malicious spirit.</p><p>If you find out its true form is a mouse, having a cat around might be very useful, preferably a wild cat.</p><p></p><p>Pollution turns these dead things into malicious spirits, but in reality, they still have some innate instincts that cannot be changed.</p><p>These instincts are their weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>So to deal with malicious spirits, you first need to find out their background and settings.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is a long story, I've investigated, and this well has had about three cases in the past few hundred years..." </p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu rambled on, and the Taoist priestess-dressed woman listened with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Suddenly, the Taoist priestess-dressed woman was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what's wrong?" Zhou Hu asked.</p><p></p><p>"There are two strange people who have entered Red Cloud Stronghold."</p><p></p><p>"Are they enemies, friends, or just passing through?" Zhou Hu quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>Since the senior said they were strange, it must mean they have some abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priestess-dressed woman shook her head: "I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Any Exorcist Soldiers with a bit of ability have probably already noticed the abnormality in Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p>The thick black mist shrouding the area, it has essentially become a dead zone. Those Exorcist Soldiers wouldn't come in.</p><p>Even if they don't die, they might easily get contaminated by the evil aura.</p><p></p><p>Exorcist Soldiers slaying malicious spirits is to protect the Dao and subdue demons.</p><p>But... it's not that the more malicious spirits they kill, the better.</p><p>Even if the protective measures are done well, constant slaughter of malicious spirits will also lead to pollution in the process.</p><p></p><p>In this world, many powerful malicious spirits are originally Exorcist Soldiers themselves.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan stepped on the muddy road, his gaze falling on a simple house.</p><p>In his perception, there were two people inside the house.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were two people - a young man and a girl of around six or seven years old. </p><p></p><p>The young man was somewhat thin and dark, and the girl was the same.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a knocking sound came at the door.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan, who was inside the room, gave a start, and his voice was a bit weak: "Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>He dragged his heavy body, placed his hand on the door latch, and peered out through the crack to observe the person outside.</p><p></p><p>It was a fresh and handsome man, with a majestic and elegant bearing, clearly not an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"I have come to settle the karmic debts." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan was a bit confused and did not understand.</p><p></p><p>"The statue in your room... may I ask about its origins? Don't worry, I am a good person." Qi Yuan smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan was a bit wary, but still told the truth: "It's called Shenlin, and it's a deity from the Luosha Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan truthfully told Qi Yuan the information he had obtained from the Taoist nun-disguised woman, without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>After all, the man in front of him was clearly extraordinary, and it was not wise to offend him.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it the same on the Blue Star? A man on the street asked a young woman riding an electric bike for her socks, and the woman could only take off her two socks and give them to the man.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xiaodan's mood was the same as that woman's.</p><p></p><p>"A divine artifact?" Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the role he was playing, Shenlin, was actually a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>And not just any ordinary divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>"If it is a divine artifact, wouldn't I have to pretend to be a deity?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He was now the Purple Palace, how could he be considered a deity?</p><p></p><p>Pretending to be a deity would be quite challenging.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the ancient era, should he try to produce some explosives and pretend to be a deity? He looked at Li Xiaodan and said calmly, "Child, do you recognize me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan frowned, racking his brain, and finally shook his head apprehensively.</p><p></p><p>"Then do you see me as a person or a deity?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stared at Li Xiaodan, afraid he would blurt out an English sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Can you speak English?"</p><p></p><p>He was not a clever yellow-skinned person, not keeping up with the times, and could not speak English either.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan felt bewildered, thinking he had encountered a madman.</p><p></p><p>But he dared not retreat, after all, a madman could do anything.</p><p></p><p>"Like... a deity?" He dared not defy Qi Yuan, and answered tentatively.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan felt that the progress bar of his acting as Shenlin had advanced a bit.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that at the beginning, the progress bars of Knife and Son-in-law Qi Yuan were always advancing, but only Shenlin's progress bar was at 0. Now it had finally made some progress.</p><p></p><p>Acting as Knife could even enhance his physical strength and increase the sharpness attribute, so he couldn't imagine the rewards of acting as Shenlin.</p><p></p><p>"As a deity, I shall heed the will of the heavens.</p><p>I already know your wish." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to say "As one who is a deity", but felt that "one who is" did not match the grandeur of a deity, so he changed it to "As a deity".</p><p></p><p>Now, an aura of profound vastness emanated from him, as if a touch of divinity was flowing through him.</p><p></p><p>If a great Dao Sovereign were to appear, they would discover Qi Yuan's extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xiaodan blinked his eyes, unable to perceive it.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted this madman to leave as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh softly, "It is not your fault, but the vision of the world is not good."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan realized that the other party did not trust him.</p><p></p><p>But he did not blame him.</p><p></p><p>"Go." He waved his sleeve and left with Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the mortals are ignorant and do not recognize the true deity!" Chen Kangbao hurriedly said behind him.</p><p></p><p>"I know, because they cannot see my divine generals, my angels!" Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Qi Yuan wouldn't care about these things.</p><p></p><p>But now that he had to play the role of a deity, without these things, the trust of others would be very low.</p><p></p><p>"Divine generals? Angels?" Chen Kangbao's mouth trembled, as if he had thought of something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I don't have a teleportation ability, so I can't buy DJI drones to pretend to be my angels. It seems I can only do it myself, to be well-fed and clothed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Buying some DJI drones to fly around him, that would be his "angels" in the ancient era, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>"Young master intends to?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's go to a place with lots of mosquitoes!" Qi Yuan had already made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>For him to climb technology and make drones, that would be too difficult, it's better to be lazy.</p><p></p><p>He was quite lazy when he didn't feel like working hard, and even on the bed, Niuniu would get so angry that she wanted to break his waist.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the Taoist nun-disguised woman appeared.</p><p></p><p>"What did those two people just come to you for?" </p><p></p><p>She asked Li Xiaodan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan frowned, not daring to offend anyone.</p><p></p><p>"The man just now seemed to have a problem with his head. He asked me about the statue."</p><p></p><p>"The statue?" The Taoist nun-disguised woman was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Shenlin statue had lost its divinity, it could still attract the attention of the Yibing Shi.</p><p></p><p>"He even asked me if he was a person or a deity! He's really not well."</p><p></p><p>"He said he would fulfill my wish, he's really sick."</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan's face was pale, and he was still terrified.</p><p></p><p>After all, being cornered by two madmen at his doorstep, he felt very unsafe, especially with his dilapidated house and door that could be easily kicked down.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the Taoist nun-disguised woman also felt somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>After all, which proper Yibing Shi would behave like this?</p><p></p><p>She frowned, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Xiaodan suddenly thought of something and whispered, "Senior, the statue seemed to have manifested its divine power yesterday."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist nun-disguised woman's brow raised, her expression unchanged: "The deity is dead, it cannot manifest. It must be your illusion."</p><p></p><p>"But I... clearly heard the deity speak a sentence!"</p><p></p><p>"The deity spoke?" The Taoist nun-disguised woman scrutinized Li Xiaodan, as if trying to see if he was lying. She said solemnly, "What did it say?"</p><p></p><p>"The deity said... It is not a deity!" Li Xiaodan said.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist nun-disguised woman frowned, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan's words did not seem to be false.</p><p></p><p>Could it be an illusion, or some unexpected incident?</p><p></p><p>The deity was dead, this was an indisputable fact.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Li Xiaodan suddenly widened his eyes, staring into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>A buzzing sound came from afar, covering the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist nun-disguised woman also quickly turned to look.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a handsome man with a sacred expression was seated in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist nun-disguised woman's eyes suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Soaring through the clouds, this was a skill only a high-level Yibing Shi could master! No, wait!</p><p></p><p>She immediately rejected her own conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Because she saw that under that handsome man, there were many strange, bird-like special creatures.</p><p></p><p>These creatures, seemingly made of steel, numbered in the hundreds, carrying the handsome man in flight.</p><p></p><p>These mysterious creatures, numerous and densely packed, flew like a flock of birds.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist nun-disguised woman racked her brain, but could not figure out what they were.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"What are those flying in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Father, what am I seeing!" A villager knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>They had lived in Ninghe County their entire lives, and had never seen such a grand sight before.</p><p></p><p>A majestic and powerful voice resounded throughout the Red Cloud Village at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I am the deity, come to cleanse the demons!"</p><p></p><p>"You need not kneel before me!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A group of people returned to the village, passing by the dilapidated temple.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a strong man said: "Since the Foxtail Grass God is gone, why don't we... sell his statue? We might be able to exchange it for some food."</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people looked at the broken statue, their eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>"The statue of the Foxtail Grass God, I reckon it could be exchanged for a few hundred steamed buns?" The fat man's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu immediately became anxious: "The deity has protected our Qingshui Village for so long, how can we smash his statue!"</p><p></p><p>If the statue was destroyed, he as the priest would have no status left.</p><p></p><p>"The Foxtail Grass God blessed us when he was alive, and after his fall, he surely wouldn't want to see us starve. He'd be willing to sacrifice himself for us," said the fat man.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers also looked at the statue, their eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Since the Foxtail Grass God was born from the statue, he actually hadn't provided much protection for Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qingshui Village had no food or offerings at that time.</p><p></p><p>The Foxtail Grass God may have run away long ago, or starved to death.</p><p></p><p>"If we smash the statue, our Qingshui Village will suffer divine wrath. In the future, no deity will protect us!" Shen Tu said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>As long as the statue remained, it meant the legacy continued.</p><p></p><p>If they prayed and worshipped devoutly, offering sacrifices, perhaps a new deity would emerge from the statue.</p><p></p><p>"This statue is too low-level. We can't even feed ourselves, how can we make offerings and think about the future?</p><p></p><p>I think it's better to sell it for money and enjoy ourselves before we die!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, most of the surrounding villages worship new gods.</p><p></p><p>Those of us who don't believe in new gods will be killed sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>We might as well exchange the statue for some money.</p><p></p><p>I heard that in the Fairy Temple on Old Immortal Mountain, there are some beautiful female demons, each one like a celestial maiden descended to earth.</p><p></p><p>For just a few coins, you can spend a night with those female demons, as happy as an immortal." The fat man's eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>The temple on Old Immortal Mountain had many beautiful female demons who specialized in absorbing human essence, engaging in euthanasia business.</p><p></p><p>However, before death, those female demons would serve to their utmost, allowing those who wanted to die to experience the ultimate gentleness of the world before passing.</p><p></p><p>In the surrounding villages, people who couldn't go on living often saved money to go for euthanasia.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the Fairy Temple on Old Immortal Mountain was always busy.</p><p></p><p>For decades, they never raised their prices, truly a good place in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Qingshui Village, trapped in the village, lacking food and drink, lived without hope.</p><p></p><p>If they died in the Fairy Temple, it would actually be a good thing for them.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Shen Tu blocked the temple entrance, "Recently, I heard the statue showed signs of divinity, it seems a new deity may have been born inside!"</p><p></p><p>"Shen Tu, stop making things up. We haven't been making any offerings, how could there be a new deity?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that someone has been worshipping in secret?"</p><p></p><p>"What if what Shen Tu says is true? After all, it's a newborn deity, also a life. If we sell the statue, it will die prematurely!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers argued among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Some wanted to sell the statue, while others were hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"I think Shen Tu is just making things up because he doesn't want to lose his position as priest," an old man said weakly, just wanting to be euthanized quickly.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred villagers, considered the young and strong of Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Every time the village needed to fight for water or go hunting, it was them who went out.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, most of them were emaciated from hunger.</p><p></p><p>Village chief Yu Lu watched this scene, the gaze of this small old man cloudy, without speaking.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Qingshui Village, to perish under his leadership, was truly... shameful.</p><p></p><p>He would also become a sinner.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a gust of wind swept through.</p><p></p><p>The villagers present were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>They saw the dilapidated statue suddenly explode.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"The statue exploded?"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, no more money!"</p><p></p><p>These villagers all regretted it extremely.</p><p></p><p>The statue was money!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a light voice sounded: "A new game? My people?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but look over, only to see an extraordinarily handsome man standing in the dilapidated temple.</p><p></p><p>The man had a sword on his back, his whole person looking extraordinarily graceful.</p><p></p><p>"A deity?"</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because they clearly sensed that this person was their deity.</p><p></p><p>They felt puzzled by the sudden appearance of the deity.</p><p></p><p>After all, since the Foxtail Grass God had not appeared, it was strange that a god would be born in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>They had not made offerings, nor had they prayed devoutly.</p><p></p><p>The deity that appeared... was probably one of the weakest, right?</p><p></p><p>And the shattering of the statue also meant that this was the last deity of their Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>The people's thoughts were active, all somewhat saddened by the shattering of the statue.</p><p></p><p>They could no longer be euthanized.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone go home."</p><p></p><p>These villagers were not as respectful to the deity as legend had it.</p><p></p><p>However, most of the villagers stayed behind, watching the newborn deity.</p><p></p><p>An old man even boldly asked: "Lord Deity, are you hungry? I have half a steamed bun at home, would you like to eat?"</p><p></p><p>This deity was, of course, Qi Yuan who had entered the game.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, he felt somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>"I am a deity, or rather a player, how could I possibly be hungry?" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a rumbling sound was heard.</p><p></p><p>The villagers present all looked at Qi Yuan with interest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because this rumbling sound came from his stomach.</p><p></p><p>He was actually... so hungry his stomach was growling!</p><p></p><p>This was incomprehensible. Anyone who had reached Foundation Establishment could abstain from food.</p><p></p><p>He was now an Yuan Dan True Person, how could he be hungry?</p><p></p><p>"Lord Deity, you should rest quickly, don't starve to death," the villagers here said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Tu gritted his teeth and ran to the back of the temple, taking out half a flatbread and handing it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw the teeth marks still left on the flatbread and turned his head away: "Is this what you feed your deity?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the villagers present all burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Deity, it's not bad to have something to eat!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be picky, if you don't eat it now, there won't be any left!"</p><p></p><p>These villagers seemed very familiar with the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these villagers, his eyes also showing some surprise.</p><p></p><p>He saw three Divine Infant stage cultivators, and the rest were all Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>With this level of strength, they could form a large cultivation sect in the capital of the Great Shang and dominate.</p><p></p><p>In this world... they were living so miserably?</p><p></p><p>It was too bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, why were the cultivators here, including himself, hungry?</p><p></p><p>"You, as my people, have truly disappointed me!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>After coming to this world, the first task he received was to become the deity of Qingshui Village and protect it.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Deity, why don't you bless us, and we'll go wipe out those bastards in Stone Village!" said the fat man from earlier.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe this newborn deity had any extra divine power to bestow upon them.</p><p></p><p>Starving like this, this deity was probably just a second Foxtail Grass God.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He saw countless stars densely packed in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The brightest was a blood-red star.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon of the Cang Lan Realm, however, were hard to find.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the stars in the sky, and at a glance saw the Golden Core that belonged to him among the stars.</p><p></p><p>"Why bless you? I'll go kill them myself!" When accepting the mission, Qi Yuan had also received many memories left in the statue.</p><p></p><p>This world was called the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Humans worshipped deities and received blessings or protection from them.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, these humans had to make offerings to the deities, providing sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>Deities and humans were mutually beneficial.</p><p></p><p>If a deity was powerful, the humans under its protection would also become stronger.</p><p></p><p>They would then be able to provide more offerings and food to the deity, helping it grow.</p><p></p><p>However, thousands of years ago, new gods suddenly descended, changing the structure of this world.</p><p></p><p>More and more villages, and even cities and countries, chose to worship the new gods.</p><p></p><p>The new gods were more powerful and more evil.</p><p></p><p>And the people who worshipped the new gods were inevitably influenced in their will and spirit, becoming more prone to killing and often invading other villages.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village originally bordered Stone Village, each controlling a river, coexisting peacefully.</p><p></p><p>But when Stone Village suddenly started worshipping a new god, everything changed.</p><p></p><p>Stone Village began to attack Qingshui Village, wanting to seize Qingshui Village's other stream.</p><p></p><p>In several village battles, Qingshui Village was always defeated.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qingshui Village had no deity's blessing, so their combat power couldn't be enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"Some people lead the way, I'll go kill Stone Village's new god!" said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The villagers present looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They had lived most of their lives, but it was the first time they had heard of a deity personally going to fight other deities in the neighboring village.</p><p></p><p>This situation...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, are you serious?" The fat man from before was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Once a deity leaves their temple, they are no longer a deity. </p><p></p><p>So even if terrifying battles occurred in other villages, there was no reason for deities to personally go fight.</p><p></p><p>At most they would bestow blessings.</p><p></p><p>The deity before them opened by saying he would personally go kill people.</p><p></p><p>It sounded... strange somehow.</p><p></p><p>Where was there a deity who would do such an undignified thing?</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and lead the way, I'm hungry and waiting to feast!" Qi Yuan said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>These villagers in tattered clothes, how could they look like cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps every morning when they woke up, they still had to personally empty their chamber pots.</p><p></p><p>"Feast?" The fat man swallowed and seemed confused.</p><p></p><p>"If we kill their god, won't they hold a feast? We can eat for free while we're at it." Qi Yuan praised himself for his clever idea.</p><p></p><p>Was there any better way to get a free meal?</p><p></p><p>"That seems to make some sense." The divine official Shen Tu pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>The village chief then said: "Divine Lord, you have just been newly born and your power is weak. Rashly going to Stone Family Village could be dangerous."</p><p></p><p>The fat man also said: "After leaving the temple, a deity's divine radiance will diminish. Divine Lord, you will become even weaker and easier to be eaten."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan's idea of killing a god for a feast sounded interesting, it wasn't... feasible in practice.</p><p></p><p>"What danger? My left eyebrow keeps twitching, which means there's great fortune ahead!" The more Qi Yuan spoke, the hungrier he felt. "You're the divine official, let's go, hurry up and take me there, stop wasting time!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu's expression changed several times: "Is the Divine Lord really not going to reconsider?"</p><p></p><p>The others could refuse the deity, but as the divine official he could not.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Qi Yuan was waiting for the feast.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu's expression was helpless, but he finally said: "I will escort the Divine Lord there!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he pushed through the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed behind Shen Tu, walking towards the village outskirts.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers who saw this scene all felt it was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Is something wrong with this new deity's head?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's our fault for not offering good sacrifices, the deity is malnourished and his brain didn't develop fully!"</p><p></p><p>"Village Chief, the deity going like this is suicide, what should we do?" the fat man asked Village Chief Yu Lu.</p><p></p><p>"This deity was just newly born, how could he be a match for Stone Family Village's evil god?" Some villagers also lamented.</p><p></p><p>And they were going to the other side's home turf! This was completely suicidal.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu's expression changed several times, but he finally said: "Let's go, we'll follow them!"</p><p></p><p>About two-thirds of the villagers present chose to go with the village chief.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, they couldn't be bothered to watch the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>After all, that deity's fate was already sealed, so they might as well go back and eat some steamed corn bread.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, are you the Primordial Heavenly Lord?" Shen Tu couldn't help but ask on the way.</p><p></p><p>Last time in his dream, he seemed to have heard the title Primordial Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan looked at Shen Tu. "You're a divine embryo cultivator, how did you end up in such a miserable state?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"No reliable patron, no money, no food." Shen Tu said weakly.</p><p></p><p>The unreliable patron naturally referred to the god worshipped by Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, once you reach the Foundation Establishment stage, you don't need to eat anymore, right?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was also hungry now, which he found strange.</p><p></p><p>"Not eat? Wouldn't you die if you don't eat?" Shen Tu also looked at Qi Yuan strangely.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Qi Yuan could only attribute this to differences between worlds and customs.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The flatbread I gave you earlier, are you sure you won't eat it?" Shen Tu clutched tightly to the flatbread with teeth marks, stealing glances at Qi Yuan, as if afraid Qi Yuan would eat his bread.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was speechless: "I won't eat it!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Tu's face lit up with joy: "That's good, I can fill my stomach before dying. Even if I die, at least I won't be a hungry ghost."</p><p></p><p>"Having a follower like you is truly my... blessing." Qi Yuan said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>This Qingshui Village was dirt poor, probably didn't even have a suona horn.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have Shen Tu help him form a music ensemble.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu ignored Qi Yuan's words, quickly eating the flatbread as if afraid Qi Yuan would snatch it from him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>The sound of gongs and drums rose from the village ahead.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite lively over there." Qi Yuan remarked.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu looked at the village of about a hundred households ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Today is the sacrificial day. They are going to sacrifice three young boys for the new god to eat." Shen Tu's expression became solemn. "These damn new gods are all evil gods. Where are there deities that eat people!"</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the ancient races, deities were powerful humans, heroic spirits who died fighting for mankind.</p><p></p><p>These heroic spirits protected humans, in a mutually beneficial relationship.</p><p></p><p>The new gods, that is, the evil gods, fed on humans instead.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze penetrated through the village. He saw weeping women and men being pinned to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, Little Qian, Little Qian..." A woman wept and struggled.</p><p></p><p>Because one of the sacrificial offerings this time was her young child.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Li, offering sacrifices to the deity is our honor!" A burly man said. One of his eyeballs flashed with a bloody light.</p><p></p><p>This indicated he had already been influenced by the new god and was gradually being assimilated. Before long, he would become the new god's most loyal guardian.</p><p></p><p>Another man sighed: "Over a dozen young children every year in exchange for good weather and harvests in our Stone Family Village. This deal is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"Sister Li, look at Qingshui Village next door. They're unwilling to believe in the new god, and now look at their situation. In another month, the people there... will probably all die." A fat-headed man said, his hand still stroking the woman's chin.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui! Evil god!" The woman spat a mouthful of saliva onto the fat-headed man's body.</p><p></p><p>The man's face instantly darkened: "Sister Li, I tried to reason with you nicely but you won't listen. It seems you are unfaithful to the deity. Send her to the red pen!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman struggled even more fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Tears flowed from the tiger-like eyes of the man pinned to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the new gods appeared, a new term emerged in the world.</p><p></p><p>Red pen.</p><p></p><p>The new gods loved to eat young children.</p><p></p><p>But what if there weren't enough children? Well then, they would specially raise some women, confine them in red pens, specifically for... breeding.</p><p></p><p>This behavior treated people like pigs.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered utterly inhumane.</p><p></p><p>"This Stone Family Village is our Stone family's domain. You Wangs should just behave yourselves. If you anger me, I'll send you all to the red pens!" The fat-headed man said.</p><p></p><p>Stone Family Village wasn't just people surnamed Stone, there were other surnames too.</p><p></p><p>However, it was the largest Stone family that planned to summon the new god.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, that family truly gained complete control over Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>As for the other families, they were angry but didn't dare speak out.</p><p></p><p>If you offended the Stone family, they might offer your children as sacrifices to the new god!</p><p></p><p>"The heavens are blind to let you evil gods descend..." The woman wailed.</p><p></p><p>The fat-headed man laughed loudly: "What evil gods? These are true gods, the future rulers of the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Who didn't know that the new gods were now slowly devouring the old gods' territories.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Mortal Heart Realm, two-thirds of the regions worshipped the new gods.</p><p></p><p>The old gods were struggling to hold on, and before long would be completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"Evil god, come out and die!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm hungry, still waiting for you to die so we can feast!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear voice rang out from the sky. Two figures appeared in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>One was Shen Tu, and the other was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The people of Stone Family Village looked up at the two in the sky with surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Qingshui Village's deity?"</p><p></p><p>"A new ancient god?"</p><p></p><p>"Coming to our Stone Family Village to die?"</p><p></p><p>Many villagers surnamed Stone had red light glowing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this was in Qingshui Village or in the temple, they might still be afraid.</p><p></p><p>But this was Stone Family Village, their home turf.</p><p></p><p>They were puzzled yet surprised in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Was something wrong with this ancient god's head? Why did he dare to leave his temple to come here? Generally speaking, deities rarely left their own temples or domains.</p><p></p><p>The woman on the ground looked up at Qi Yuan in the sky with devout eyes. She kept kowtowing, her forehead covered in blood: "God, please save my son."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a coquettish voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, a newly born little cutie has come to my place. Do you want to merge with big sister?"</p><p></p><p>A wolf-dog in a blood-red dress appeared, looking particularly strange.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their deity manifest, the villagers of Stone Family Village all knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the deity!"</p><p></p><p>The new gods were the real gods, they were their heaven.</p><p></p><p>The fat-headed man looked at the wolf-dog woman with a fanatical expression.</p><p></p><p>As for that newly born ancient god from Qingshui Village, what did he amount to?</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu stood beside Qi Yuan, his body trembling. But thinking that he had eaten some flatbread, he felt it wasn't a total loss and became bolder.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent evil god, bringing calamity to the world! Our Qingshui Village's deity will execute you!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

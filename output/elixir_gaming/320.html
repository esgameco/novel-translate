        <h1>Chapter 320</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the rooster spirit running quickly inside, Qi Yuan wanted to call out to stop it.</p><p></p><p>If other demon species were merely substitutes for the white moonlight, the rooster spirit could be considered half a white moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, upon hearing Qi Yuan's words, the rooster spirit ran even faster, not stopping at all, heading towards the abandoned courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held onto Little Jia's cold sleeve, lost in thought: "Could it be that he guessed I wanted him to help me repay the star loan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan planned to purchase an arched star, and the rooster spirit was very suitable for repaying the loan.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia nodded, extremely obedient, seeming to agree with Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan laughed heartily, holding Little Jia's waist even tighter.</p><p></p><p>From Little Jia's sleeve, a wooden sign with the expression "happy" fell out.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear if she was amused by Qi Yuan's words, or because she heard Qi Yuan say she was the bride he married with an eight-bearer sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>The abandoned courtyard was especially deep and secluded, but with Little Jia there, everything seemed warm and gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Come, Little Jia, shall we go meet my white moonlight together?" Qi Yuan held Little Jia's cold sleeve, but thought to himself, what if Little Jia got jealous and wanted to kill these white moonlights?</p><p></p><p>Should he help?</p><p></p><p>After all, wives and white moonlights were inherently contradictory.</p><p></p><p>With these strange thoughts, Qi Yuan and Little Jia walked towards the depths of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Qi Yuan saw many hunched figures. These figures had blank expressions, some sweeping the ground, some serving tea.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they would find that these people's throats and ears had been damaged by poison, turning them into deaf-mute servants.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan and Little Jia arrived, a deaf-mute servant came to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Little Jia walked towards the dilapidated hall ahead. Before they reached it, Qi Yuan smelled a pickled stench.</p><p></p><p>From within the hall came a refined and amiable voice:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivators invited here, I am unable to provide you with fresh food. </p><p></p><p>Old Sheep feels deeply indebted, and can only offer these pickled and dried foods. Please make do with them."</p><p></p><p>The old sheep with three horns on his head had a beard reaching his waist, worthy of being called long-haired to the waist.</p><p></p><p>If he met a Blue Star person, they might recite a poem: "When my hair grows to my waist, will you marry me?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Sheep Head, this jerky should be added with some preserved fruits. I like to eat sweet things, not salty ones," said a wild wolf spirit wearing a tattered cassock, grabbing jerky and stuffing it into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"I like to eat spicy food, otherwise it can't cover up the stink of human flesh," the rooster spirit spoke up, expressing his opinion.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of demons discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Old Sheep Head spoke: "I heard that today, there is a special fellow cultivator joining our gathering. I wonder if they have arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard it's a wedding dress that gained sentience. It's truly rare. I've lived for 300 years, considered long-lived, but I've never seen a wedding dress gain sentience before."</p><p></p><p>"Now... you've seen one."</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan's cheerful voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>He entered the hall with Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>"This is my wife Little Jia. I'm Qi Yuan, a good person."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan entered the hall, his eyes swept over the more than ten demons present, with barely suppressed joy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had finally fulfilled his wish to see a long-lost white moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The demons in the hall were confused by Qi Yuan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>However, more of their gazes fell on Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>Strange creatures always attract attention.</p><p></p><p>"A wedding dress gaining sentience, I've never heard of it before, and I can't smell any demonic aura... Could it be someone from the Demon Suppression Department infiltrating?" A 200-year-old elder expressed his doubts.</p><p></p><p>The other demons also nodded in agreement, especially since this wedding dress demon had brought a human man with her.</p><p></p><p>"Old Locust dared to let her in, so she must undoubtedly be one of us. Do you all dare to doubt Old Locust?" Old Sheep Head's words silenced any further doubts.</p><p></p><p>Old Locust's strength was profound and unfathomable, and he had lived for an excessively long time. This 200-year-old elder's grandfather had once met Old Locust.</p><p></p><p>Now hundreds of years had passed, and Old Locust was still rooted here.</p><p></p><p>Even Old Yellow and that one from the water tribe deeply respected Old Locust.</p><p></p><p>These demons nodded, acknowledging Old Sheep Head's words.</p><p></p><p>"Fairy... please be seated," Old Sheep Head made a welcoming gesture.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, holding Little Jia's hand, was about to take a seat.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a shrill voice rang out: "This is a gathering of demons. Humans are not allowed to be seated."</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was the rooster spirit.</p><p></p><p>Although he feared the wedding dress demon,</p><p></p><p>With so many demons here, he felt a bit bolder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression changed several times, looking dejected: "It's over, you've seen through my lie.</p><p></p><p>Alas, Little Jia isn't the bride I married with an eight-bearer sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>She's the one who married me with an eight-bearer sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>I know, a live-in son-in-law has no rights, can't sit at the table.</p><p></p><p>I won't sit at the table, just don't make me drink foot-washing water."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a strong sense of morality and always followed the rules.</p><p></p><p>A live-in son-in-law couldn't sit at the table. This humiliation, he could only swallow.</p><p></p><p>When Ning Tao comes next time, if they get a marriage certificate, he'll take the chance to swap it out and get one with Little Jia too, escaping the identity of a live-in son-in-law! Led by Qi Yuan, Little Jia didn't say anything at his indication, but happily took a seat.</p><p></p><p>On the reddish-brown table were some tea and pickled human jerky.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the rooster spirit spoke: "Old Sheep Head, why exactly did you invite us here this time?"</p><p></p><p>The rooster spirit's words also attracted the attention of all the demons present.</p><p></p><p>This time, the demons of Yunyun County were holding demon ascension meetings at several locations.</p><p></p><p>These ordinary demons had all received invitations to come.</p><p></p><p>But they weren't very clear about the purpose of the demon ascension meeting.</p><p></p><p>Old Sheep Head smiled and said: "I invited you fellow cultivators here for two things.</p><p></p><p>The first thing, well... will start soon; as for the second, it concerns the future of all demons in Yunyun County, so we have to wait for Old Yellow to come and announce it."</p><p></p><p>Old Sheep Head was being mysterious.</p><p></p><p>His words caused a stir among those present.</p><p></p><p>"Concerning our future? Old Sheep Head, aren't you exaggerating?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Demon Suppression Department is preparing to come and exterminate us?"</p><p></p><p>The demons present were anxious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone please calm down. I can only say it's not a bad thing. For all of you, it's all good news.</p><p></p><p>Now, let me announce the first thing."</p><p></p><p>As Old Sheep Head spoke, his gaze turned stern.</p><p></p><p>"Bring Yang Fan over!"</p><p></p><p>At Old Sheep Head's voice, deaf-mute servants came in from outside, bringing in a disheveled sheep demon.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they didn't receive Old Sheep Head's order through their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, please spare me... I'll change!" Yang Fan was brought in, crying and sniveling, looking utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sheep demon, the demons present all changed expression slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this Old Sheep Head's most beloved nephew? What crime did he commit?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Sheep Head looks like he's serious this time!"</p><p></p><p>Old Sheep Head's face was cold, his voice icy: "Is the oil cauldron ready?"</p><p></p><p>The deaf-mute servants busied themselves, and soon a large oil cauldron was set up in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Below the cauldron burned blazing firewood, above it was boiling oil.</p><p></p><p>Murderous intent flashed in Old Sheep Head's eyes: "This good-for-nothing nephew of mine actually colluded with humans and became a traitor to demonkind!</p><p></p><p>He actually leaked information about the demon ascension meeting to the Demon Suppression Department for just a bit of silver.</p><p></p><p>So, he must die today, suffering the punishment of being fried in oil."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, I didn't mean to, wuwu... spare me..." Yang Fan cried hysterically.</p><p></p><p>He regretted it extremely.</p><p></p><p>Because he had his eye on the delicious tender flesh of a beautiful courtesan, but it cost money to buy.</p><p></p><p>Not enough money, what to do? So he sold information.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that this time... he was caught, and his uncle was going to fry him in oil.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be terrified and afraid? Tears flowed freely, even hoping the tears would become a vast ocean to dilute the boiling oil in the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Into the oil cauldron!" Old Sheep Head's tone brooked no argument.</p><p></p><p>Cries, curses, and pleas for mercy mingled together, sounding utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan, standing to the side, unable to bear it, his sympathy overflowing.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you see how pitiful he is, crying so miserably. Putting him in..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Deep frying? I can't bear it! How about I buy it from you, so you don't have to deep fry it? Deep frying is not good..."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was his first time seeing a whole lamb being deep fried.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it usually roasted whole?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, how much is the esteemed guest willing to pay?" The old ram head asked Qi Yuan calmly, without anger.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached into his pocket at this point, stammering as he took out some silver: "Oh no, I don't have enough silver, only about ten or so taels. Not enough to buy your nephew... How about... selling me a dozen catties of your nephew? I want the parts with more blood. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was becoming smarter and smarter. </p><p></p><p>He was handling things with high emotional intelligence, achieving a win-win situation.</p><p></p><p>One win was satisfying his moral sense, putting the true goodness and beauty of humanity into practice. Anyone who saw this act would say "There are still many good people in this world." The second win was that he wanted the demonic blood of the lamb demon. If he succeeded in purchasing it, the blood wouldn't go to waste.</p><p></p><p>This was what he called a win-win.</p><p></p><p>The corners of the old ram head's mouth twitched. Finally, he glanced thoughtfully at Little Jia behind Qi Yuan and said: "Deep fry it first, then give it to the guest."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful when deep frying, don't fry all the blood out of them!" Qi Yuan hurriedly urged anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The old ram head didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>The lamb demon, whose eyes had previously shown hope, now glared viciously at Qi Yuan, as if wanting to devour him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh: "Is this the farmer and the snake? I try so hard to save him, yet he resents me in return. Great kindness treated as great enmity - I finally understand the meaning of this ancient saying!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, truth is hidden everywhere in life. </p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, Qi Yuan had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>Under everyone's gaze, the lamb demon was sent into the oil pot to be deep fried.</p><p></p><p>Miserable screams echoed throughout the gloomy mansion.</p><p></p><p>When the frying was done, a strong stench permeated the hall.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the demons in the hall instantly became solemn, with some showing reverence.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a demonic wind flashed by, and a burly old man appeared in the center of the hall.</p><p></p><p>This old man was leaning on a bone-white cane, with snow-white crew cut hair standing on end like broken thorns. His eyes were piercing, and his body emanated a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, the old ram head's expression immediately became respectful: "Greetings, Uncle Huang!"</p><p></p><p>The other demons present also stood up, showing respect: "Greetings, Uncle Huang!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than Uncle Huang, who had reached the peak of the Blood Qi realm and was nominally the leader of this stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Is everyone here?" Uncle Huang swept his gaze over everyone present, his eyes full of oppressive force, like poisonous thorns approaching everyone's skin.</p><p></p><p>"Without further ado, I'll talk about the Demon Ascension Assembly!" Uncle Huang's voice was rough, like that of a brute.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from the refined demeanor of his younger brother, Fourth Uncle Huang.</p><p></p><p>The demons present became tense, wanting to know exactly what this was about, as it concerned the future of all demons in Yunyan County.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month ago, Boss Kun encountered a demon in the sea.</p><p></p><p>That demon had three feet, three eyes, two fins, a peculiar appearance, and no intelligence whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>So, Boss Kun brought this demon back to Yunyan County for us to investigate its identity.</p><p></p><p>After consulting ancient texts, we discovered that this demon is... a Child of Spirit Blood!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a Child of Spirit Blood!"</p><p></p><p>"A Child of Spirit Blood without any intelligence!"</p><p></p><p>The demons present all started breathing rapidly, their eyes becoming frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't this mean that if we control it, in the future... we'll gain a Demon Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a Demon Spirit! Even in ancient times, it would be a great demon capable of establishing a demon court!"</p><p></p><p>Among demons, their power levels are divided into Blood Qi Demons, Jade Blood Demons, Demon Elites, Demon Spirits, and Demon Kings.</p><p></p><p>A Child of Spirit Blood is a demon carrying the bloodline of a Demon Spirit. Moreover, it's not just simply carrying the bloodline, but... having no bottlenecks, able to directly reach the realm of Demon Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Such a great demon at the Demon Spirit level is comparable to a human martial artist at the Martial Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the cultivation world, it would be equivalent to a giant demon at the Divine Infant level.</p><p></p><p>Overthrowing a country and causing havoc would be effortless for such a being.</p><p></p><p>Especially since... this Child of Spirit Blood had no intelligence, doesn't that mean... they could manipulate it as they pleased?</p><p></p><p>So how could the demons present not be excited?</p><p></p><p>However, some demons became cautious.</p><p></p><p>"If Boss Kun discovered a Child of Spirit Blood, why would he share it with us?"</p><p></p><p>"If this old one obtained something as precious as a Child of Spirit Blood, I certainly wouldn't share it with other demons."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Uncle Huang's expression didn't change at all. Instead, he slowly said: "The current situation with this Child of Spirit Blood is very special.</p><p></p><p>For it to grow, it needs to be fed with the essence blood of all of you.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Boss Kun and I discussed it and decided to invite all of you to participate in nurturing the Child of Spirit Blood together.</p><p></p><p>Once the Child of Spirit Blood grows up, won't it be under our control?</p><p></p><p>Hehe, once it reaches the Demon Spirit realm, forget about Yunyan County, even Fenglei State and the Tianxu Empire will be at our mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Huang's words were quite inflammatory. The demons present were all tempted, but some remained vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"We feed the Child of Spirit Blood, but who can guarantee that we'll have control over it?" asked the 200-year-old elder.</p><p></p><p>After all, what if Boss Kun was just using them as laborers, only needing their blood, and once the Child of Spirit Blood grew up, it wouldn't listen to them? What then?</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, everyone. When feeding it, you can all sign a Heart-Linking Spell with the Child of Spirit Blood," Uncle Huang replied, his voice neither cold nor warm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the demons present were extremely tempted.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that among demons, there were none who didn't know about the Heart-Linking Spell.</p><p></p><p>Once they signed a Heart-Linking Spell with the Child of Spirit Blood, their essence blood would be more effective for it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Child of Spirit Blood would also consider them as its own kind and protect them.</p><p></p><p>"Boss Kun is so kind-hearted?"</p><p></p><p>"This... this old one is somewhat tempted."</p><p></p><p>The demons present had no objections.</p><p></p><p>If they could sign a Heart-Linking Spell with the Child of Spirit Blood, they would soar to great heights in this life.</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone have any objections?" Seeing everyone's interest, Uncle Huang confidently spoke up, scanning the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The demons present remained silent, perhaps pondering something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, who had been quiet all along, spoke up: "I have an objection!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Uncle Huang's sharp gaze fell on Qi Yuan, carrying a threat. He wanted to see through Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, he had never seen Qi Er before, so he couldn't recognize Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I think this is too unfair for all you demons.</p><p></p><p>Extracting essence blood every so often, how bad is that for your bodies?</p><p></p><p>You don't even have any supplements. Extracting their blood every day, it hurts them, and it hurts my heart too!</p><p></p><p>That's demon essence blood, just extracting it for the Child of Spirit Blood like that, it's such a waste, such a waste. It's so painful, so wasteful."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the rooster demon's expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>The demons present, hearing this, felt something was odd, and for some reason, they even felt a bit touched.</p><p></p><p>Look, even this human cares about our health.</p><p></p><p>What a good person.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you have no idea what that Child of Spirit Blood means to us!" Uncle Huang's voice was cold and domineering.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be angry. Actually, I have a good solution that can perfectly solve this problem," Qi Yuan activated his clever brain again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What solution?" Those demons looked at Qi Yuan with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>They didn't want to donate blood either.</p><p></p><p>It really wasn't good for their health.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. Instead of giving the blood to the Child of Spirit Blood, you can give it to me. I'll take you to the hospital every day for glucose drips. Isn't that good for you?" Qi Yuan didn't know if glucose drips could replenish blood, but he figured he could fool these uneducated beings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words left the demons present dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>So... you want our blood?</p><p></p><p>"Are you mocking us?"</p><p></p><p>"You... are seeking death!" Uncle Huang was enraged, emanating a strong killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan quickly waved his hands: "Don't get angry, it's not good for your health. What if your blood pressure and blood sugar rise? What I'm saying is absolutely true, I'm not deceiving you.</p><p></p><p>You just need to let me eat the Child of Spirit Blood. I have a special constitution, I'll become the new Child of Spirit Blood.</p><p></p><p>That way, you only need to donate blood to me.</p><p></p><p>I'll give you a bottle of glucose every day. That's glucose that costs ten yuan a bottle, ten yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>For this world, he had sacrificed too much, far too much.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

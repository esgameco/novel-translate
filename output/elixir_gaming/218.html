        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone's here."</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Deity stood atop the mountain, his voice still carrying a slight tremor.</p><p></p><p>The other three Ancient Gods beside him had bewildered expressions.</p><p></p><p>These three Ancient Gods originally belonged to the Ancient God Alliance and were quite familiar with the area around Sunset Slope, so they were called by the Great Thunder Deity to guide the way.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were filled with confusion, not knowing why they had been watching this place for so long.</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Fire Venerable looked at Qi Yuan lying on the tree, and inexplicably felt a sense of admiration in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Because facing the army of evil gods at Sunset Slope, she could not remain as calm and relaxed as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood up with a faint smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Since everyone's here, then... let's all lie down together."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Deity's breathing quickened as his eyes fixed on Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>Several question marks appeared above the heads of the Lotus Fire Venerable and other Ancient Gods.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Appear, my sun!"</p><p></p><p>"My moonlights, enjoy my passion to your heart's content!"</p><p></p><p>As his voice fell, time seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was covered in a layer of faint red light due to the blood-colored stars.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood-red light suddenly underwent a subtle change.</p><p></p><p>All the Great Deities, and even the Ancient Gods, were momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"How did... the sunlight change color?"</p><p></p><p>This thought arose in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>In Sunset Slope, the Three Flame Great Deity and many other evil god deities were also momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Venerable hurriedly said: "The changing colors of heaven and earth is a great omen. It foretells that the Three Flame Great Deity will surely sweep across the Qing Heng Continent!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Three Flame Great Deity squeezed out a smile: "A great omen, good, good."</p><p></p><p>The other new gods also smiled.</p><p></p><p>Some Ancient Gods secretly despised the Mountain Venerable for being so spineless.</p><p></p><p>Such nonsensical flattery.</p><p></p><p>If they had known earlier, they would have done the flattering themselves.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a Great Deity showed a surprised expression: "Look at the sky, there seems to be a star falling."</p><p></p><p>The true gods at Sunset Slope all looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw countless stars densely packed in the heavens, with one sun rapidly moving through space, its destination unknown.</p><p></p><p>The sun's speed grew faster and faster, its light becoming brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>"It won't... fall into the Mortal Heart Realm, will it?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a Great Deity murmured.</p><p></p><p>All the true gods were startled.</p><p></p><p>Because from the looks of it, it really was going to fall into the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing. Even if it falls into the Mortal Heart Realm, it has nothing to do with us," said the Three Flame Great Deity, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>This level of battle was not something a Great Deity like him could interfere with.</p><p></p><p>There was a Yang God lying dormant within the World Pillar.</p><p></p><p>There was also a Yang God on the barrier of the world.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying strike was definitely aimed at a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>It was also destined to come to nothing.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could the projection of a star contend with a true Yang God?</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Venerable seized the opportunity to flatter: "The stars of the heavens fall because of the Great Deity."</p><p></p><p>The Three Flame Great Deity smiled: "My mere five steps towards heaven are not worthy of falling stars."</p><p></p><p>This star was no ordinary star.</p><p></p><p>It was a self-luminous star.</p><p></p><p>All the stars in the heavens were reflections of the gods.</p><p></p><p>And these stars were divided into two types.</p><p></p><p>One type was luminous, the other was non-luminous.</p><p></p><p>The luminous ones represented Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>The non-luminous ones were ordinary Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not all Yin Gods had the opportunity to be reflected in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity to be reflected in the heavens was bestowed by the Yang God they served as master.</p><p></p><p>The light of these stars reflected in the heavens was borrowed from the radiance of the Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>The Army Lord of Qing Heng Continent, the superior of the Three Flame Great Deity, had obtained such an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Among the stars reflected in the heavens, one belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>Extinguishing these thoughts, the Three Flame Great Deity looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In a fraction of an instant.</p><p></p><p>The entire Mortal Heart Realm suddenly burst into brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's vision became blurred at that moment.</p><p></p><p>They saw the illusory image of a sun suspended in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Everyone instinctively looked up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"It really did fall into the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Which Yang God made a move?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this a warning?" a Great Deity pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, mere foreign Yang Gods, crossing countless spaces, wanting to interfere in the affairs of the Mortal Heart Realm, this is seeking death!" a Mythical Being coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>All the true gods looked up at the sky, their expressions varied.</p><p></p><p>The fall of a sun's projection was truly a terrifying event.</p><p></p><p>All the true gods sensed the scent of danger.</p><p></p><p>However, they all chose to remain silent and not take action.</p><p></p><p>Something worthy of a Yang God's cross-realm intervention must naturally involve another Yang God.</p><p></p><p>The target of this illusory sun must be the Blood Sun Great Saint within the World Pillar.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next breath, everyone's gaze changed.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, it's falling towards the Northern Lands!"</p><p></p><p>"Not good, its target isn't the Blood Sun Great Saint!"</p><p></p><p>All the Great Deities and true gods felt anxious.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the falling sun grew faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>It fell carrying an aura that could destroy everything.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Great Deities of the Northern Lands had no time to act together to block this terrifying sun projection.</p><p></p><p>The smile on the Three Flame Great Deity's face froze.</p><p></p><p>Something was wrong! Something was a bit off! Something was very wrong! All the Great Deities and true gods were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This sun... seemed to be coming towards them?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the name Sunset Slope was wrong? They had no time to react before the huge illusory sun suddenly plunged into Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>A voice that seemed to come from ancient times echoed in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"The great sun shines brilliantly, illuminating all directions!"</p><p></p><p>"I wear dark robes, commanding the nine chapters of law!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sun's illusion suddenly expanded and exploded.</p><p></p><p>Endless heat, endless light, concentrated in the small area of Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>What kind of power could be unleashed when the might of a sun's projection was focused on such a narrow location? It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand true gods had no time to react before being engulfed by endless scorching heat and overwhelming aura.</p><p></p><p>In that terrifying flame that could incinerate everything, all the true gods completely melted away in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Atop the high mountain, the Great Thunder Deity looked at Sunset Slope as if gazing at a small sun.</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Fire Venerable's heart trembled, the extreme light shining on her face made it appear even more flushed. Her expression froze as she suddenly turned to look at Qi Yuan behind her, her phoenix eyes filled with shock and complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancient Gods also looked towards Qi Yuan at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"My lord... was that sun yours?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged, his gaze filled with mixed emotions: "It was too far away, the power was insufficient."</p><p></p><p>This time, he had summoned the second sun core, which he had just recently condensed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because it was too far away, to Qi Yuan, its power was only average.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>How could this be insufficient power?</p><p></p><p>This was far too powerful! Over thirty Great Deities and more than a thousand Venerables left nothing behind under the sun's projection.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Sunset Slope in the distance, where the light was dissipating like a fading star.</p><p></p><p>Just now, under this single strike, over a thousand powerful beings had perished.</p><p></p><p>Under the terrifying sun, life became fragile.</p><p></p><p>In the face of nature, humans appeared especially vulnerable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan inexplicably...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sorrow came from within: "Some people die, and it's as heavy as Mount Tai; some people are alive, but they're actually dead.</p><p></p><p>My white moonlights, you have died, but left me with vast experience and countless evil god powers. </p><p></p><p>Your deaths are as heavy as Mount Tai.</p><p></p><p>Don't worry about me, I won't be sad.</p><p></p><p>I will turn grief into appetite, and enjoy the feast well.</p><p></p><p>White moonlights, farewell!"</p><p></p><p>After all, it was the fall of the white moonlights, so Qi Yuan still expressed some sentiments.</p><p></p><p>Lest others see and think he was ungrateful, eating the last of a family line.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable listened to Qi Yuan's words with a bewildered look.</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, the unusual light in her eyes fading by half.</p><p></p><p>The grand image of Qi Yuan she had built up in her heart collapsed in this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back... and feast!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sun fell, landing on Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>On Sunset Slope, over thirty Venerables and thousands of True Gods, all perished.</p><p></p><p>To outsiders, their deaths were just a number.</p><p></p><p>But to themselves, it was unbearable pain.</p><p></p><p>Of course, now they could no longer feel this pain.</p><p></p><p>In Qingheng Continent, the Evil God Army Commander's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed to cross space and time, landing on Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>The current Sunset Slope had already been flattened by the sun's shadow.</p><p></p><p>All the armies had perished under a single strike from the sun.</p><p></p><p>"Did an otherworldly Yang God intervene?" the Evil God Army Commander spoke, his eyes moved.</p><p></p><p>"Should we report this to the Blood Sun Great Saint?" a voice sounded by the Evil God Army Commander's ear.</p><p></p><p>This was also an Army Commander.</p><p></p><p>Now, the five Army Commanders of the Northern Lands were gathered.</p><p></p><p>This was also the strongest force of the Evil Gods in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>The five Army Commanders were all Myths.</p><p></p><p>Each of them had many Myths under them.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Saint is at a critical moment, we must not disturb him," the Liyang Army Commander spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sun Great Saint was devouring the Heavenly Dao in the Sky Pillar, and had reached the most crucial point.</p><p></p><p>The Army Commanders present all guessed.</p><p></p><p>That otherworldly Yang God's intervention was to stop the Great Saint from devouring the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was an innate world, even Yang Gods coveted it greatly.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of this sun projection?" an Army Commander asked.</p><p></p><p>A trace of killing intent surged in the Liyang Army Commander's eyes: "It seems the eight Myths in the Contemplation Grounds back then were no coincidence.</p><p></p><p>A Yang God's chess piece has landed in the Mortal Heart Realm."</p><p></p><p>The other Army Commanders heard this and felt somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately this strike hadn't fallen on their heads alone.</p><p></p><p>But on Sunset Slope instead.</p><p></p><p>This was a lucky thing.</p><p></p><p>"Qingshui Village... Origin Venerable... is it?" There was killing intent in the Liyang Army Commander's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What, you want to move against the otherworldly Yang God's chess piece?" an Army Commander asked.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Army Commander shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Of course he wouldn't.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, what if today's events repeated?</p><p></p><p>"I wish to report the situation in this realm to the Lord, and let the Lord decide!" the Liyang Army Commander replied.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Lord intervened and sealed off the Mortal Heart Realm again, preventing that Yang God's chess piece from borrowing outside power again.</p><p></p><p>The Qingshui Village Origin Venerable, he could suppress with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Venerables gathered, their gazes moved.</p><p></p><p>"What do you all think of today's events?" an old man spoke, his voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>"This is an unprecedented change in the Mortal Heart Realm in ten thousand years. If we seize it, we may even give the Mortal Heart Realm a chance at survival!" a Venerable spoke, his voice excited.</p><p></p><p>"Yang God... hope!"</p><p></p><p>"If he's willing to help us, we have a chance to contend with the Evil Gods!"</p><p></p><p>"But who knows if he isn't the next Evil God?" an old man questioned.</p><p></p><p>The excited Venerables fell silent.</p><p></p><p>True.</p><p></p><p>An innate world attracts Yang Gods' covetousness.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if this newcomer isn't the next Yang God, also wanting to devour the Mortal Heart Realm's Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>"The Myth Plan must continue!</p><p></p><p>We cannot pin our hopes on others.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this being above True God level doesn't seem to have descended in true form.</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid he also dares not offend two beings above True God level." An old man spoke, defining the matter.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful being, if he helped them, might allow the Myth Plan to succeed.</p><p></p><p>But he absolutely could not contend with the two Yang Gods coveting the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could Yang Gods fight to the death amongst themselves?</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Bell Venerable, what do you think of this?" At this point, the old man looked towards a headless Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancient Gods all looked towards the Spirit Bell Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Bell Venerable had no head on his shoulders, sitting quietly to one side, his body emanating a thick killing aura.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone looking at the Spirit Bell Venerable had admiration in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This one was a tough guy who had survived the battlefield of the Great Deluge War, and even had a not-so-shallow relationship with the No Food Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>His opinion was very important to the Ancient Gods present.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the pillars of the Southern Lands.</p><p></p><p>"I wish to go to the Northern Lands."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Bell Venerable's voice was brief, just a few words.</p><p></p><p>The many Venerables present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>An Ancient God of the Spirit Bell Venerable's level entering the fallen Northern Lands had a high probability... of not being able to come out again.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Bell Venerable was risking his life to seek a glimmer of hope for the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Flying Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished his feast and stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>"The key to playing games is that troops value speed. The three-step plan to destroy the Evil Gods has taken half of the first step, next is the remaining half."</p><p></p><p>Without a plan, one would be like a headless fly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always liked to make plans when doing things.</p><p></p><p>Now, clearing the Mortal Heart Realm was progressing rapidly according to his plan.</p><p></p><p>"Is everyone here?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Because the last time he heard this sentence, the Origin Venerable directly summoned a sun shadow and killed all the Evil Gods on Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>Hearing it again now, he almost had a conditioned response.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancient Gods all looked at Qi Yuan, their expressions somewhat expectant.</p><p></p><p>Was this the distribution of divine realm nectar and primordial essence of divine apertures? They had been looking forward to these benefits for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Today was truly a double celebration.</p><p></p><p>First the Evil God army on Sunset Slope was eliminated by the sun shadow.</p><p></p><p>Now the Origin Venerable was about to distribute benefits.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Venerable also looked expectant. He glanced at the Lotus Venerable beside him with surprise in his eyes: "Lotus Venerable, you don't seem very happy?"</p><p></p><p>Since returning from outside with the Origin Venerable, the Lotus Venerable had been somewhat absent-minded, her gaze blank, pupils dilated.</p><p></p><p>Even when Qi Yuan gathered these people, seemingly to distribute benefits, the Lotus Venerable still had this expression, showing no sign of happiness.</p><p></p><p>This made the Twilight Venerable puzzled about what the Lotus Venerable had done following the Origin Venerable outside, to return in this state.</p><p></p><p>"It's... nothing..." the Lotus Venerable snapped out of her daze.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable is probably going to give us divine realm nectar. I never thought this old man would have a chance to awaken a divine realm seed," the Twilight Venerable said with a smile. "Although it won't affect the big picture, being able to kill a few more Evil Gods is worth it!"</p><p></p><p>Many of the Ancient Gods present had the same thoughts as the Twilight Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Lotus Venerable seemed not to have heard the Twilight Venerable's words. She looked at Qi Yuan in the distance and said inexplicably: "Our Mortal Heart Realm... may truly have hope."</p><p></p><p>PS: There's one more chapter, it'll be about two hours late, sorry sorry!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

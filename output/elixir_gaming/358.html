        <h1>Chapter 358</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu wore a black sack on her head as she looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes showing a hint of admiration and respect.</p><p></p><p>This bloodline bearer seemed a bit crazy, saying shocking things, but many of his words resonated deeply with her.</p><p></p><p>For example: "Why fear death when there are familiar faces on both sides?"</p><p></p><p>"Sunlight also dies, shadows are its corpse."</p><p></p><p>"I don't like girls who are easy on the eyes, because I don't have the patience to look."</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, regarding truth and illusion, and attitudes towards this mortal world, she felt a lot.</p><p></p><p>So, who cares about Tu Kongming! Let him roll away!</p><p></p><p>The memories she cared about were the real memories.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think Ma Longhun hasn't come because he can't afford the cemetery entrance fee?" Suddenly, Qi Yuan turned to look at Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"I should have known not to charge an entrance fee for this cemetery. Originally I was afraid of others disturbing it, so I treated the Ma family cemetery as a tourist attraction and charged a fee to set a threshold. </p><p></p><p>I forgot that Ma Longhun might not have money."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a sudden realization, as if he had discovered the key to the issue.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Yuanyu didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She somewhat doubted if she had been infected with madness for believing some of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, you're overthinking it," Wang Yuanyu said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was also very curious in her heart. Even for some of Qi Yuan's absurd statements, even if they were nonsense, she would believe them to some extent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an old woman with a troubled expression walked over.</p><p></p><p>This old woman was Madam Wang.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Wang Yuanyu and said softly, "Miss, this old servant has something to discuss with Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>The implication was that Wang Yuanyu should leave.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Yuanyu was puzzled, but she tactfully left.</p><p></p><p>Now only Qi Yuan and Madam Wang remained in the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>Before Madam Wang could speak, Qi Yuan took the initiative: "Hmm, pay the entrance fee. I get up early and work late, diligently guarding the cemetery, I deserve some ticket money!"</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang had clearly heard such words from Qi Yuan many times before, evidently he had asked her for entrance fees in the past.</p><p></p><p>"Here are ten drops of demon clan blood essence."</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang tossed the demon blood essence to Qi Yuan, who happily accepted it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ma Longhun's parents and clan members were all minor demons, not famous great demons.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, charging fees here could make big money.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, this old servant has an unreasonable request, I'm not sure if I should speak of it." Madam Wang thought it best to be polite first before using force.</p><p></p><p>After all, to some extent, bloodline bearers were considered their subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"1...2...3 no's, is this an affirmative or negative sentence?" Qi Yuan's focus was always strange.</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang coughed, her expression melancholy, then said: "Wang Yuanyu and Tu Kongming were destined lovers across three lifetimes..."</p><p></p><p>"Why not bitter enemies across seven lifetimes?" Qi Yuan interrupted Madam Wang.</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang paused, then continued: "Wang Yuanyu was of noble birth, while Tu Kongming was just a poor boy, but he worked very hard to improve himself.</p><p></p><p>They studied together, and over time developed feelings for each other, gradually falling in love.</p><p></p><p>But then Ma Longhun appeared. He coveted Wang Yuanyu's beauty and secretly poisoned her.</p><p></p><p>To save the young miss, Tu Kongming ventured deep into the icy pond of Glacier Valley to seek the mystical turtle.</p><p></p><p>The ice of the pond not only froze his body, but also his soul.</p><p></p><p>At the cost of one arm, Tu Kongming finally lured out the mystical turtle, stripped its shell to refine a great medicine that saved the young miss's life."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Madam Wang seemed very moved, touched by Tu Kongming's actions.</p><p></p><p>If there were a man in the world who would do this for her, she feared she would also be moved.</p><p></p><p>"Poor little turtle, robbed of its home at such a young age," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Madam Wang was quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't the focus be on the touching love story?</p><p></p><p>"When the young miss woke up and learned of Tu Kongming's actions, she was deeply moved. The two confirmed their relationship and fell in love, swimming in the river of love every day. The days were so joyful, but happy times are always short."</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang continued reminiscing, with a bit of a romantic mindset.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because someone peed in the river of love?" Qi Yuan felt he was very clever, seeing through to the truth of the matter at a glance.</p><p></p><p>If happy times were short, wasn't it because someone peed in the river of love and stunk up the place for the two of them?</p><p></p><p>"..." Madam Wang looked at Qi Yuan, her mouth twitching. She took a deep breath to calm herself before continuing, "Because... Ma Longhun appeared.</p><p></p><p>No one expected that he would dare to collude with foreign races in defiance of heaven's will.</p><p></p><p>On the day of the young miss and Tu Kongming's wedding, Ma Longhun brought three thousand foreign race members to forcibly take the bride.</p><p></p><p>The young miss naturally refused, but who knew Ma Longhun would become enraged. If he couldn't have her, no one else could either. He struck at the young miss, but Tu Kongming blocked the blow. The already injured Tu Kongming fell because of this strike, and the young miss also committed suicide in grief."</p><p></p><p>"That's it?" Qi Yuan was stunned. "How boring, isn't there a twist? According to modern screenwriters' imagination, shouldn't they kidnap the man instead? Or is there more to come - Ma Longhun digs up Tu Kongming's remains, refines them into a zombie, and the two engage in forced love?"</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang held her forehead and took another deep breath: "Now, in this realm, the events of the past are being reenacted. </p><p></p><p>Only in this way can the young miss truly be resurrected and this realm avoid collapse. The details are too complex, even this old servant doesn't fully understand.</p><p></p><p>But... the world line must be reenacted.</p><p></p><p>However, a small problem has arisen.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, the young miss has not fallen in love with Tu Kongming.</p><p></p><p>This is extremely dangerous. There is not much time left for the young miss, for this world.</p><p></p><p>I beg the sir to consider the bigger picture, to put the world first, and temporarily... refrain from meeting with the young miss!"</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang bowed solemnly, her voice earnest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was surprised: "What does this have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>"The young miss has spent much time with you, sir. I fear she may develop feelings for you," Madam Wang said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that Qi Yuan's appearance was indeed exceptionally handsome. Although his speech was chaotic and detracted from his beauty when he spoke, he would make a fine ornament if silent.</p><p></p><p>To put it dramatically, just being with Qi Yuan for this short while made Madam Wang, who had been in menopause for thousands of years, feel like her period was about to return.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, being handsome comes with too many troubles. Actually, I don't think I'm that handsome, just ordinary." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan imitated a certain Mr. East who didn't recognize his wife's beauty - in Qi Yuan's case, he was a certain Mr. Yuan who didn't recognize his own handsomeness.</p><p></p><p>"However, this isn't my fault to begin with, and also... Wang Yuanyu doesn't seem to have developed feelings for me, right?" Qi Yuan stretched lazily, his demeanor indolent.</p><p></p><p>He truly hadn't sensed any love from Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>At most, there was some admiration and a sense of getting along well.</p><p></p><p>If there were love, Qi Yuan would have sensed it long ago.</p><p></p><p>And if he had sensed it, Qi Yuan definitely wouldn't "not take initiative," "not take responsibility," or "string her along."</p><p></p><p>"So telling me this is useless. Wang Yuanyu not loving Tu Kongming isn't because she's fallen for me, it may simply be that she doesn't like him.</p><p></p><p>Also, don't bother me with such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>It's not intriguing at all, and there's no twist. How boring." Qi Yuan shook his head, completely uninterested in the story of lovers across three lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't even as good as the TV show about bitter enemies across seven lifetimes he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Madam Wang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>She said in a deep voice: "This old servant speaks the truth. This concerns the survival of the world.</p><p></p><p>Not even the slightest error can be allowed. It's better to err on the side of caution than to let things slip.</p><p></p><p>Please, sir, leave the young miss and let her and Tu Kongming return to their destined path!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "What does your return to your destined path have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>"This concerns the survival of the world!"</p><p></p><p>"I thought it was something major, but isn't it just the game server crashing?</p><p></p><p>You should sacrifice a programmer to the heavens. Look at my hair volume..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you a programmer? Oh, I forgot, you're an NPC. Programmers can't be killed." Qi Yuan waved his hand dismissively. Then, as if suddenly remembering something, his expression became extremely gentle. "Oh right, Lady Wang, are you married? I have a friend who's been wanting to find an awesome wife, and I think you'd be perfect for him. </p><p></p><p>Even if you're already married, it's fine. You can just get divorced. My friend isn't picky."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of Bei He Han Xianyun. He still cared about this friend and worried about his single status.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old woman Lady Wang felt confused, her thoughts in disarray. She felt she couldn't keep up with Qi Yuan's train of thought. What was he even talking about?</p><p></p><p>"This old woman has dedicated her entire life to the world, with no time for petty love affairs," Lady Wang refused.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt somewhat disappointed. </p><p></p><p>It would be difficult for Han Xianyun to find a partner.</p><p></p><p>"You won't get married? Fine then, I won't waste any more words with you. Don't disturb me while I'm roleplaying as the system. I'm going to start cultivating now." Qi Yuan's mood changed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang heard this and felt even more confused.</p><p></p><p>She could only understand about half of what Qi Yuan was saying.</p><p></p><p>She gave Qi Yuan a long, deep look, then finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the cemetery, Qi Yuan looked at the tombstone in front of him, many images flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing so many scenarios, he seemed to have caught a whiff of something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, I can't think about it anymore or my head will grow bigger. I don't want to be a big head."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was too lazy to think or to figure out the truth and reality behind everything.</p><p></p><p>Only strength was the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>Conspiracies, truth, schemes... were they useful?</p><p></p><p>They were.</p><p></p><p>But as long as Qi Yuan was powerful enough, all conspiracies and schemes... could be destroyed with one punch.</p><p></p><p>"You have consumed 100 demon race blood essences and gained 100 days of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"You have consumed 100 demon race blood essences. The Explosive Bird-Killing Punch has finally advanced.</p><p></p><p>50% bonus damage against flying creatures.</p><p></p><p>50% armor penetration against birds."</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, Qi Yuan's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't this mean all the men in the world will fear me now?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why don't girls have birds? If they did, wouldn't I be invincible?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right. Girls can't be defined. Who knows if they have birds or not? What if they're hiding them in their pants? I've never seen, so how would I know they don't have any?"</p><p></p><p>Stopping his wild thoughts, Qi Yuan closed his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an ancient voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Qi... I never thought this old man would still be alive."</p><p></p><p>This voice came from within Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Old Thunder God, you're finally awake."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this long-lost voice, Qi Yuan felt quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>However, this reunion of old acquaintances was as calm as still water.</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, the Thunder God's eyes flickered with infinite melancholy: "Originally, this old man had resigned himself to certain death, falling along with the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>You, young man, are impressive. You actually slaughtered the Yang Gods."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God felt both respect and gratitude towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Mortal Heart Realm was his home, the primordial world where countless living beings multiplied.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Gods were incredibly powerful and unbeatable.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan had turned the tide, displaying extraordinary combat power.</p><p></p><p>But with two Yang Gods as enemies, he hadn't expected to win.</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention past events anymore. Old Thunder God, hurry up and cultivate, give me some gold coins to use." Qi Yuan urged.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God and other great lords who had left the Mortal Heart Realm were now truly in their element.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the infinitely potential visualization method, the Thunder God's cultivation had no bottlenecks. Reaching the Yang God realm was merely a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if the Thunder God who had entered the mythical realm in the Mortal Heart Realm appeared here, he could probably break through to Yang God in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This was related to the visualization method provided by Qi Yuan, the special nature of primordial divine spirits, and the ancestral land of the ancient race.</p><p></p><p>"Stop rushing me, young man. This old man is cultivating. I'm striving to have reached the Yang God realm by the time I see you." The Thunder God's words were filled with emotion, radiating light.</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, the seemingly unattainable Yang God realm was now within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan's divine embryos, those primordial divine spirits, were much like him.</p><p></p><p>As they awakened and broke free from the shackles of the primordial world, they were like fish back in water. Breaking through to Yang God was as simple as drinking water.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, my enemies are too strong. One Yang God probably won't be enough.</p><p></p><p>There are others in your world too. Look after them and help them awaken and grow stronger." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although his divine embryos had sprouted in the Origin Land, they were all moving by instinct. None had fully awakened like the Thunder God.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, this old man will go find the others right away." The Thunder God complained, "So many things to do right after waking up. If I had known, I wouldn't have woken up."</p><p></p><p>Despite his complaints, his tone carried joy and pride.</p><p></p><p>"I have a plan!" Qi Yuan exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder God couldn't help but hold his head: "What plan is it this time?"</p><p></p><p>He had already experienced Qi Yuan's plans before - simple and crude, they couldn't even be called plans, just nonsense.</p><p></p><p>But it was these rough plans that always managed to succeed.</p><p></p><p>This left the Thunder God speechless.</p><p></p><p>"I want to acquire this game, but I don't have money.</p><p></p><p>How about this: we'll use force to plunder! The plan has three steps.</p><p></p><p>First step, you unite with the other subjects, increase your strength, and occupy the world below for me!</p><p></p><p>Second step, as your strength increases, it will benefit me in return, and I'll occupy the Arch Star and Brilliant Star.</p><p></p><p>Third step, with all worlds under our control, I can work hard to complete tasks and advance to become the Human Dao Martial Lord, Spirit Dao Martial Lord, and even the Myriad Dao Martial God.</p><p></p><p>It's such a perfect plan, simply invincible, awesome!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan formulated the plan, he became excited and felt his mind clear.</p><p></p><p>If this were on Blue Star, he would definitely be too excited to sleep over this plan and would need to take some melatonin.</p><p></p><p>For some people, they might even need to masturbate.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, your plan's quality has decreased this time. It's not detailed enough."</p><p></p><p>"You've reminded me. I actually made a big mistake this time by not specifying the time.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, your time flows faster there. Forty years there is equivalent to one year for us.</p><p></p><p>So for the first step of the plan, you should aim for everyone to become Yang Gods within 3000 years.</p><p></p><p>For the second step, I'll strive to unify Arch Star within 100 years!" Qi Yuan felt somewhat afraid.</p><p></p><p>Even the wisest make mistakes.</p><p></p><p>The ancients did not deceive me!</p><p></p><p>Even someone as incredibly smart as him could have such an oversight, let alone others.</p><p></p><p>"The lower realm is called the Origin Land, and the strongest force there is called the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Alliance has quite a few Martial Lords, their strength is barely passable.</p><p></p><p>But... behind them is a mysterious powerful figure called the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>This powerful figure might be a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his abilities... might even be stronger than ordinary Yang Gods."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God looked wary as he truthfully told Qi Yuan the information he had gathered in the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Land? Creating countless mountain and sea scrolls with the brush of mountains, seas, and society? Is this guy really a programmer?" Qi Yuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>He knew about the Heavenly Realm and Ultimate Principle Realm of the Yang God level.</p><p></p><p>What realm would it be to create worlds like mountain and sea scrolls, just like a programmer?</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter how strong he is. I have my Explosive Bird-Killing Punch. I'm not afraid of him!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 205</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two of them carefully made their way through the ancestral land, communicating telepathically from time to time.</p><p></p><p>"Mere trash at the first or second step of Sky Treading, yet we're sent to capture them!" Feng Kui's eyes were full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Who told Aoshi to recruit a bunch of useless ancient gods who can't even handle these tasks properly." Tan Zui's words about Exalted Lord Aoshi were quite sarcastic.</p><p></p><p>Although Aoshi was an Exalted Lord with extraordinary talent, in the eyes of these new gods, a dog was still a dog, and a servant was still a servant. </p><p></p><p>They were currently working under Exalted Lord Aoshi, but they didn't have much respect for him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's hurry up and capture that group of ancient gods to complete the mission. This ancestral land is so gloomy, I don't want to stay here a moment longer," said Feng Kui.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the sooner we finish, the sooner we can leave," Tan Zui agreed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the seventh layer, Exalted Lord Aoshi looked at the tall tower before him with a complex expression: "What secrets exist within this tower?"</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had entered the ancestral land alone, somehow entered the tower, and inexplicably broke through to become a True God.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was just one step away from uncovering the truth.</p><p></p><p>The new gods didn't care much about this truth. After all, they didn't need to break through in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Exalted Lord Aoshi cared a great deal, as it was related to his advancement.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that his actions in the ancestral land had already caused dissatisfaction among many new gods.</p><p></p><p>The output was too little compared to the input.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice suddenly sounded in Exalted Lord Aoshi's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, three ancient god Exalted Lords descended upon South-Facing City."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Exalted Lord Aoshi's expression changed slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps they've come for you," the elderly voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the warning, Exalted Lord Feng Bo," Exalted Lord Aoshi's expression fluctuated, constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing worth researching in this ancestral land. We can study it after taking over the Mortal Heart Realm. This time, we can't help you. You'd better retreat, otherwise you risk perishing." Exalted Lord Feng Bo's voice was calm as still water.</p><p></p><p>His words, however, showed he didn't support Exalted Lord Aoshi wasting time in the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Exalted Lord Aoshi's expression was somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the tower ahead, his eyes full of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Give him another year, no, three months, and he could enter the core of the tower.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the secret from back then could be revealed to the world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the ancient gods wouldn't give him time, and the new gods wouldn't give him a chance.</p><p></p><p>He took one last deep look at the tower, and finally gave the order: "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>If those three Exalted Lords had come for him, it would be extremely dangerous for him to stay.</p><p></p><p>So, he chose to leave, waiting for a future opportunity to enter the ancestral land again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir." The other new gods received the order and gathered towards Exalted Lord Aoshi.</p><p></p><p>At this time, one new god spoke up: "Exalted Lord Aoshi, Sister Feng Kui and Tan Zui haven't returned yet."</p><p></p><p>Exalted Lord Aoshi narrowed his eyes: "I've already notified those two. However, they said they've encountered enemies and will leave after slaying them. We'll go first."</p><p></p><p>Exalted Lord Aoshi's words were indisputable. Even if the new gods present had objections in their hearts, they dared not express them.</p><p></p><p>When Exalted Lord Aoshi wasn't around, they dared to speak ill of him, but if they dared to badmouth him while he was present, that would be courting death.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me."</p><p></p><p>Inside the tower, Qi Yuan opened another warehouse.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been frantically looting the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't encountered another big haul like the He Yao Six Factory, his gains were still considerable.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods following him were all smiling with joy.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister had directly stepped into the third step of Sky Treading, becoming the strongest among them.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister was not to be outdone, already at the late stage of the second step of Sky Treading, just one step away from the third step.</p><p></p><p>Happy Arhat and Long-Browed Arhat had both entered the second step of Sky Treading.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present had improved greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yuan Dan, God Embryo, and Purple Palace cultivators had improved much less.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to Qi Yuan's understanding, these cultivators were too weak, not even comparable to babies.</p><p></p><p>This ancestral land didn't have many good things suitable for them.</p><p></p><p>"Hope there's something good this time," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was full of expectations for this warehouse.</p><p></p><p>The door was opened.</p><p></p><p>Disappointment appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This warehouse seemed to have suffered great damage, with various strange alloys scattered about in a mess.</p><p></p><p>"There's an intact box over there!" The twin sister had good eyes and immediately spotted an intact glass box.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan approached the glass box and opened it. Suddenly, hundreds of test tubes appeared in his vision.</p><p></p><p>When the ancient gods present saw those test tubes, their eyes lit up and their bodies trembled!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Realm Immortal Liquid!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually Divine Realm Immortal Liquid!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were no longer as calm as before, now looking at the Divine Realm Immortal Liquid with rapid breathing.</p><p></p><p>Divine Realm Immortal Liquid was something that, when consumed, could condense Divine Realm seeds.</p><p></p><p>The reason Exalted Lords could easily erase Venerable Ones was because of the existence of Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Within the Divine Realm, Exalted Lords could easily slay Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>For those at the third step of Sky Treading to become Exalted Lords, they needed to perfect their divine apertures and then condense Divine Realm seeds, which would then transform into Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>If someone at the first step of Sky Treading had a Divine Realm seed, they could even challenge those at the second or even third step of Sky Treading.</p><p></p><p>However, out of 100,000 Yin Gods at the first step of Sky Treading, not even one might awaken a Divine Realm seed.</p><p></p><p>Before perfecting the divine apertures, it was completely unrealistic for those at the Venerable One realm to produce Divine Realm seeds.</p><p></p><p>Even the number one person in the Mortal Heart Realm, the Holy Mother of No Food, hadn't achieved this.</p><p></p><p>Among the Yin Gods Qi Yuan had seen, only Ning Tao had accomplished this.</p><p></p><p>The last time Qi Yuan summoned Ning Tao, she displayed strength at the second step of Sky Treading and unfurled her Divine Realm seed, easily slaying the Yin Gods surrounding Qi Yuan at the time.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's ability to produce a Divine Realm seed was largely due to the strange environment she was in, constantly in a state between forgetting and remembering.</p><p></p><p>In her memory, time seemed to stand still, with only Qi Yuan's appearance being her memory.</p><p></p><p>Now, the legendary Divine Realm Liquid had appeared here.</p><p></p><p>How could the ancient gods present not be moved?</p><p></p><p>In all these years in the Mortal Heart Realm, only one person had produced a Divine Realm seed before perfecting their divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>That person had obtained Divine Realm Immortal Liquid.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the Divine Realm Immortal Liquid, how could these ancient gods not be excited? If they consumed it and condensed Divine Realm seeds,</p><p></p><p>They would be unrivaled below the Exalted Lord realm!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan now looked at these hundreds of test tubes.</p><p></p><p>[Divine Realm Immortal Liquid, also known as Thriving Oral Gentle Liquid.</p><p></p><p>What to do if children have developmental issues? Take Thriving Oral Gentle Liquid to help children grow healthily.</p><p></p><p>This type of medicine has several loopholes.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could see hidden information, and the hidden information he saw this time made him feel a bit ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Realm Immortal Liquid, viewed as a treasure by the ancient gods, was actually... for children with developmental issues to consume.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but speculate in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The children of that unknown race in the ancestral land would become Exalted Lords upon reaching adulthood.</p><p></p><p>But there would always be some with developmental issues, or poor nutrition, unable to break through to Exalted Lord, stopping at the third step of Sky Treading.</p><p></p><p>So, the Divine Realm Immortal Liquid came out, helping those children grow into adults.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over the villagers and ancient gods present: "It seems everyone here has developmental issues."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, among those present, except for him, who wasn't of advanced age?</p><p></p><p>Take those twin sisters for example, they looked young and beautiful, but in reality, they were several thousand or even over ten thousand years old.</p><p></p><p>The gods present looked at each other, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister unwillingly raised her chest, her bosom prominent: "Divine Lord, where do I have developmental issues?"</p><p></p><p>The twin sister was more reserved, her figure even more explosive than her sister's, and she didn't speak at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Not becoming an Exalted Lord after reaching adulthood, isn't that developmental issues?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"What does that have to do with anything?" The twin sister was always talkative, a chatterbox, "I may not be an Exalted Lord, but I became a True God at a young age!"</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Realm Immortal Liquid is for those with developmental issues to drink." Qi Yuan looked at the ancient gods present, "Who among you... has developmental issues?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan said this, everyone present was once again confused.</p><p></p><p>They didn't quite understand the true meaning of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>The ancient god Wang Song revealed an expectant expression: "Divine Lord, I have developmental issues."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed you do, this Divine Realm Immortal Liquid is for you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually tossed a bottle of Divine Realm Immortal Liquid into Wang Song's hands.</p><p></p><p>Wang Song's face was excited, his breathing became rapid, looking at the Divine Realm Immortal Liquid as if he was looking at a peerless beauty.</p><p></p><p>"My Lord, you're really giving this to me?" Wang Song tightly grasped the Divine Realm Immortal Liquid, somewhat in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This was Divine Realm Immortal Liquid after all...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Since you're underdeveloped, I'll give this to you. Don't dawdle, drink it quickly," Qi Yuan said, not caring much about it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the ancient god Wang Song didn't hesitate at all and directly swallowed the glass bottle containing the divine realm elixir into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>He was in such a hurry that he even swallowed the bottle.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were dumbfounded seeing this, but still hurriedly said: "Great deity, I'm underdeveloped too!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm also underdeveloped!"</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining ancient gods rushed to speak, afraid of falling behind, all claiming to be underdeveloped.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the elder twin sister also put aside her reserve. Despite her explosive figure, she covered her ample bosom with her hand and whispered: "My lord, I'm not fully developed either."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you are all very honest and able to accept your shortcomings. These growth tonics are for you then." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually tossed them out. Everyone who had just claimed to be underdeveloped received a divine realm elixir.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It was too easy to obtain the divine realm elixir. </p><p></p><p>They could get it just by saying they were underdeveloped. Were there such good things in the world?</p><p></p><p>Let alone saying they were underdeveloped, they would even claim to be brain-damaged if needed.</p><p></p><p>Great deity, how could he have such a fetish? They couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The younger twin sister watching this scene had reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>Especially since her sister, who was even more developed than her, had gotten a divine realm elixir.</p><p></p><p>She gritted her teeth, her face a bit red, and looked at Qi Yuan, weakly saying: "Great deity, I'm actually a bit underdeveloped too."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the younger twin sister: "Didn't you say you were well-developed?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan deliberately glanced at the younger twin sister's chest that she had purposely pushed out earlier.</p><p></p><p>This person has no morals or backbone, bowing for five pecks of rice!</p><p></p><p>"I was actually just pretending," the younger twin sister said softly. "Because of my self-esteem, I couldn't accept the fact that I was underdeveloped."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I'm not pretending anymore," the younger twin sister said with resignation.</p><p></p><p>Her form suddenly changed, her appearance becoming like that of a 12 or 13 year old, her chest now flat as a board.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan widened his eyes: "You... are too shameless!"</p><p></p><p>How could she do this!</p><p></p><p>This was no longer bowing for five pecks of rice, this was...</p><p></p><p>"My lord, am I underdeveloped?" The younger twin sister's voice was soft and sweet.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Qi Yuan looked at these ancient gods and couldn't help sighing, "Why is it that I, being so normal and intelligent, have subjects who all have problems with their heads?"</p><p></p><p>He reluctantly gave the divine realm elixir to the younger twin sister with a look of disgust.</p><p></p><p>He was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>The officials of this game were not good, setting the NPCs' intelligence too low and their thought processes abnormal.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods drank the divine realm elixir with smiles.</p><p></p><p>They inwardly scorned Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>If the item wasn't so enticing,</p><p></p><p>Given their personalities, they would definitely retort:</p><p></p><p>Great deity, why don't you reflect on who really has an abnormal mind?</p><p></p><p>The true gods on the scene drank the divine realm elixir, even the Happy Arhat and Long-browed Arhat received one.</p><p></p><p>As for those below true god level, they weren't fortunate enough to drink it.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Qi Yuan's eyes, these people weren't underdeveloped, they were simply still zygotes.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, outside the tower, Feng Kui and Tan Zui's eyes surged with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"These ancient gods actually managed to enter the tower!"</p><p></p><p>"Good luck?"</p><p></p><p>Due to their special clothes, Feng Kui and Tan Zui's safety in the ancestral land had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>But even so, they still didn't dare to recklessly enter the tower.</p><p></p><p>Even great lords could die in there, let alone them.</p><p></p><p>"But their good luck is about to run out," Feng Kui's eyes were full of greed.</p><p></p><p>Tan Zui nodded: "They must have obtained many treasures in the tower, and are probably laughing right now.</p><p></p><p>The laughter won't disappear, it will just transfer to our faces soon."</p><p></p><p>The two lay in wait quietly, feeling anticipation.</p><p></p><p>There really were treasures in these towers, and those treasures might even be very useful for great lords.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Feng Kui thought of something: "This seems to be the fifth floor, how did they enter?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't smell the aura of any great lords. Could it be they also obtained some special clothes?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be so." Feng Kui extinguished his earlier worries.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a group of people walked out of the tower one after another.</p><p></p><p>A full ten ancient gods and eleven ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>These twenty-some people all had bright smiles on their faces, looking very happy, presumably having gained a lot in the tower.</p><p></p><p>Feng Kui's eyes showed surprise: "One of them has reached the third step of heaven-treading!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tan Zui's eyes grew even greedier: "Actually at the third step of heaven-treading, what did they obtain inside!"</p><p></p><p>He was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Even among those at the third step of heaven-treading, there were strong and weak ones.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were both at the late stage of the third step of heaven-treading. One of them acting alone would be enough to kill all the true gods before them.</p><p></p><p>So, they were very confident.</p><p></p><p>"For such treasures to be consumed by them is a waste!" Feng Kui couldn't sit still either, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The two suddenly appeared, blocking Qi Yuan and the others' path.</p><p></p><p>Feng Kui's eyes were full of greed as she licked her lips: "It seems your gains inside were quite bountiful. Soon... they will be mine."</p><p></p><p>"Evil gods?"</p><p></p><p>"Third step of heaven-treading!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene were startled, sensing danger.</p><p></p><p>After all, at the realm of true gods, the gap of even one divine aperture was extremely large.</p><p></p><p>Before these eight people entered the ancestral land, an ordinary person at the third step of heaven-treading could have taken them all down.</p><p></p><p>Now, with two evil gods at the third step of heaven-treading appearing, it truly frightened them.</p><p></p><p>Feng Kui was very satisfied with these ancient gods' reactions: "Hand over what you obtained in the tower, and I'll let you die less painfully!"</p><p></p><p>At this, the previously worried ancient gods all revealed strange expressions, or looks of sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>What were they afraid of?</p><p></p><p>They had just drunk the divine realm elixir and awakened the divine realm seed. They were true gods now.</p><p></p><p>It could be said they were pseudo great lords.</p><p></p><p>Their courage grew again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at these two new gods with curiosity: "Your clothes are quite interesting. Who sent you two here?"</p><p></p><p>"A mere mortal dares to interrupt!" Tan Zui couldn't help cursing when he saw Qi Yuan speak.</p><p></p><p>True gods conversing, and an ordinary mortal dared to interject. He who had always been arrogant looked down on mortals the most.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>"Show some respect!"</p><p></p><p>"You dare speak to the great deity like that, you're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods all stood in front of Qi Yuan, their divine apertures constantly rotating, emitting terrifying auras.</p><p></p><p>Feng Kui was somewhat surprised at this: "You regard a mortal as your leader? It seems you were able to enter the tower because of him?"</p><p></p><p>Tan Zui also squinted at Qi Yuan: "Don't worry, there won't be a complete corpse left of you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan yawned: "A little underdeveloped monster dares to verbally attack me?</p><p></p><p>Kill them, I'm short on evil god spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>These two evil gods, at their age, still not great lords - weren't they just underdeveloped?</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, the ten ancient gods on the scene attacked simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Feng Kui's eyes held a disdainful smile: "Trash will always be trash!"</p><p></p><p>Tan Zui looked at Qi Yuan: "You're going to die very miserably next."</p><p></p><p>A few at the second and third steps of heaven-treading, facing the two of them, actually dared to counterattack instead of fleeing. They expressed contempt.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, Feng Kui's expression froze.</p><p></p><p>Because she felt the surrounding air become solid, and the rotation of her divine aperture became obscure.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a divine realm seed!"</p><p></p><p>Her eyes widened, her gums trembling.</p><p></p><p>What had she seen - a divine realm seed?</p><p></p><p>How could there be such great talent here! It should be known that among all the new gods, only one had awakened a divine realm seed.</p><p></p><p>There was actually one here, and she had encountered it. How could she not be shocked and terrified?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, how can they all be!" Tan Zui was more clearheaded than Feng Kui.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was not just one divine realm seed, but a full ten divine realm seeds.</p><p></p><p>This was simply like being in a dream.</p><p></p><p>They had encountered ten deities, and all ten of these deities had awakened divine realm seeds.</p><p></p><p>The probability of this... was virtually impossible.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they had encountered it.</p><p></p><p>Two powerful evil gods, among ten divine realm embryos, were completely suppressed and unable to move. Where was their earlier arrogance now?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "The growth tonic works amazingly well. You two underdeveloped ones are no match when facing the fully developed, right?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

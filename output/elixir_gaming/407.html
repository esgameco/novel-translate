        <h1>Chapter 407</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No words could adequately describe this battle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who had entered the Purple Palace realm, displayed combat prowess at the pinnacle of the Great Celestial Yang Spirit level, regardless of his actual cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>When he ascended to the stars, he had merged with 4,000 divine infants and slain the East Lord who was half a step into the Ultimate Principle realm. </p><p></p><p>Of course, this was related to the fact that the East Lord's trump cards were completely useless against him.</p><p></p><p>In terms of divine power alone and physical manifestation, he was even stronger than Yang Spirits at the minor Ultimate Principle level.</p><p></p><p>Now, he charged ahead of gods and Buddhas, straight into the Three Thousand Great Calamities.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter continued!</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed! Chaos was torn apart! As far as the eye could see, there were only enemies, enemies everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Since becoming an Elemental Core, Qi Yuan had never experienced such an intense battle.</p><p></p><p>The demons in the Mountain and Sea Scroll could be dealt with in one sword strike? The fiends outside the City of No Return could block one sword? Now, facing the Three Thousand Great Calamity Elemental Bodies, he fought to the ends of time.</p><p></p><p>There were no instant kills, no slaying with a single sword!</p><p></p><p>It was all about the collision and competition of divine power! Qi Yuan, who had not been injured for a long time, was also wounded in this battle.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic fragments of the Calamity Elemental Bodies continuously fell into the underworld, forming a special area.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's 4,000 divine infants, once primordial gods, were also surrounded and bloodied by the Calamity Elemental Bodies, falling into the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes had long been dyed red with blood. Clad in blood-red armor, he charged into the Calamity Elemental Bodies, killing gods who blocked his way, slaying Buddhas who stood in his path! Sky-Cleaving Sword Technique! Death's Radiant Light! Tyrannical Power!</p><p></p><p>He used these three great skills in rotation.</p><p></p><p>He held nothing back! This battle was extremely brutal.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of the chaotic nature of the Great Calamity, there was no fear of retreat.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan's side held an absolute advantage, with many fighting against many, the strong defeating the weak.</p><p></p><p>However... not a single Calamity Elemental Body retreated, panicked, or fled.</p><p></p><p>They were like emotionless war machines, giving their all.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, even though they were at a disadvantage, the Great Calamity showed no signs of collapse, still facing the primordial gods of all heavens with their strongest stance.</p><p></p><p>This battle lasted a full ten days.</p><p></p><p>For ten days, the fighting in heaven and earth did not cease.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators and mortals could not see even a corner of the battle, only able to judge by the blood color and formless chaos.</p><p></p><p>The blood color grew more intense, while the chaos diminished.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators breathed a sigh of relief, while mortals were shocked in their hearts, numb yet accustomed.</p><p></p><p>In the void, the blood armor on Qi Yuan's body had long since faded away. Clad in a long robe, his entire body was dyed red with blood.</p><p></p><p>This blood came from both himself and the divine infants.</p><p></p><p>In front, only the strongest few of the chaotic Great Calamity remained.</p><p></p><p>There was no fear or despair in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any last words to say?" Killing intent surged from Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>This battle was so intense that even the suona band and the mourners had to take up arms and join the fight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine infants had also burned out.</p><p></p><p>The Six Emperors stood behind Qi Yuan, majestic and noble, displaying infinite bodies.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic Great Calamity finally spoke, their voices in perfect unison.</p><p></p><p>"Power is calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Heavens have no true future!"</p><p></p><p>"You... can you really eliminate the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of gloom in the voices of the chaotic Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit speechless: "I shouldn't have let you speak at all, still trying to be all mysterious with me?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the chaotic Great Calamity remained unchanged, showing no fear of death.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan said: "Hehe, if it were someone else, they might be stunned by your riddles, troubled to no end.</p><p></p><p>But I'm sorry, I was born... not fond of using my brain.</p><p></p><p>I've long since stored my brain away! What's the point of thinking so much? As long as I'm strong enough, even the Great Calamity will have to bow at my feet!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Countless divine powers erupted at this moment. The slaughter began again, and ended in half a quarter hour.</p><p></p><p>The entire sky turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>This blood red was Qi Yuan's long robe, and also the blood of countless divine infants.</p><p></p><p>The sky became a single red, and chaos finally disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators and mortal commoners looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of killing and roaring suddenly stopped, all divine power vanished, leaving silence.</p><p></p><p>The sky seemed to have become an ancient battlefield. The previous slaughter seemed like just a projection of history, a fleeting dream.</p><p></p><p>"Is it over?"</p><p></p><p>"Did we... win?"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators and mortals looked up at the sky, some weeping with joy.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the Great Calamity swallowing other worlds, they had actually become somewhat fearful.</p><p></p><p>It's not that having more people... means disaster won't befall individuals.</p><p></p><p>Many mountains crumbled, many cities shattered.</p><p></p><p>The false sense of security was brutally torn apart, and now, it was held up again by that blood-colored figure!</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators celebrated wildly, shouting.</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, Eliminator of the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>But there were also great venerable ones and yin spirits whose expressions were shocked, then changed to worry.</p><p></p><p>Does this Canglang Realm... belong to Qi from now on?</p><p></p><p>A look of wisdom flashed in the eyes of Great Wisdom True Lord: "People love to worry about the world, not knowing that worldly worries are endless.</p><p></p><p>We're cultivating immortality, it's better not to worry than to worry."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the sky, Qi Yuan in his blood-colored robe showed weariness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, 327 divine infant cores were shattered, with over 3,700 wounded.</p><p></p><p>Now, all the divine infants returned to their original bodies.</p><p></p><p>As for the Canglang Realm, billions of lives were also lost due to the impact of this battle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards the underworld and sighed softly: "Fortunately, marks were left beforehand. Given enough time, the divine infants can be revived, and the dead... can reappear."</p><p></p><p>Before battling the Great Calamity, Qi Yuan had slowly toured the Canglang Realm, dyeing its sky red.</p><p></p><p>He had also seen mountains, waters, and insects, leaving marks on all living beings.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if the living beings of the Canglang Realm were killed by the shockwaves of the great battle, they would be revived.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of revival could not remove the marks of the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Even if revived, the marks would still be there.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if they died because of the marks, the underworld could not revive them.</p><p></p><p>So now, the Canglang Realm could only reside within his Purple Palace, separated from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"So tired."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan felt endless, boundless fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Four thousand divine infants had fought with all their might.</p><p></p><p>All the mental consumption was concentrated in his body.</p><p></p><p>All beings are me, primordial gods transformed into divine infants. In a sense, these divine infants were also him.</p><p></p><p>So the fatigue from this battle was the combination of all divine infants.</p><p></p><p>The injuries from this battle were also the combination of all divine infants.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was more exhausted than ever before, even more tired than when he fought the old man in the Ground of Extinction.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go back... and take a nap."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze around.</p><p></p><p>The fragments of the chaotic Great Calamity had transformed into a strange land.</p><p></p><p>If it were the past him, he would definitely have rushed over to see what was inside.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was too tired, too sleepy, he needed to go sleep for a while.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light disappeared at this moment, and the red color in the sky of the Canglang Realm also vanished.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon illuminating all heavens, like countless stars flowing on the blood-colored armor, also disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the sky of the Canglang Realm, only ten suns could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu in the tower seemed to sense something. She lifted her skirt and flew towards that blood-red figure.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shadow.</p><p></p><p>The thick smell of blood was almost undisguised. In the blood-red figure's eyes, there was a hint of weariness and confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!" Jiang Lingsu looked at him covered in blood, her eyes filled with joy and concern.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so tired, I need to rest for a while," Qi Yuan murmured, his voice very soft, as if he could fall asleep at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He was exhausted to the extreme, and his tense spirit also relaxed a bit at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep then," Jiang Lingsu said, looking at her senior brother, her hand unconsciously grasping Qi Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>She also adjusted her position, sitting on the doorstep, leaning against the doorframe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, his body naturally assuming a sleeping posture, resting his head on Jiang Lingsu's lap.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he closed his eyes, he fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu held Qi Yuan, shifting her body slightly to make him more comfortable, letting him rest against something softer.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head to look at Qi Yuan's handsome face, still covered in blood, watching intently without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan kept his eyes closed, sleeping soundly, with only the faint sound of his breathing.</p><p></p><p>Sunlight slanted in from under the eaves, falling on Qi Yuan and Jiang Lingsu's bodies, casting beautiful patterns of light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>The world around them became peaceful and silent.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, suddenly, a sound like a thunderclap rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Where's that kid Qi Yuan hiding? This old man is here!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua had finally arrived at Phoenix Sky Domain, flying up to the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and saw the young man and woman sitting on the doorstep.</p><p></p><p>The young man was wearing a blood-stained robe, covered in blood, lying in the young woman's embrace, sound asleep.</p><p></p><p>He became anxious and was about to say something when he heard Jiang Lingsu's soft, ethereal voice tinged with reproach.</p><p></p><p>"Keep your voice down, Senior Brother is sleeping, Father."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the anger that had arisen in Jiang Ruhua disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>He sighed, and his figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>His daughter had spoken to him in that tone, even putting "Father" at the end - how could he play the villain now? When that kid wakes up, he must give him a good punch in the nose!</p><p></p><p>Don't think that just because you share a name with that Blood-robed Sword Immortal, or because you're injured, you can do whatever you want!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua left grumbling, quietly sitting in the tavern hall below.</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, this kid has quite a deep connection with the Blood-robed Sword Immortal - they're both called Qi Yuan, both wearing blood-red robes," Jiang Ruhua muttered, sipping his wine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't think that Qi Yuan was actually that Blood-robed Sword Immortal who had survived the great calamity, nor had he ever associated the two.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the Blood-robed Sword Immortal was too far beyond him; secondly, such an existence wouldn't have listened to his boasting on the flying ship back then.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Jiang Ruhua's imagination, such an existence would spend tens of thousands of years in cultivation, dwelling in immortal realms, drinking immortal elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The seven emotions and six desires? They would have long since been severed.</p><p></p><p>What virtue or ability did his daughter have to catch the eye of the Blood-robed Sword Immortal? "Ah, daughters grow up and leave," Jiang Ruhua drank alone, brooding.</p><p></p><p>But as he drank, he felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>Because, for some reason, more and more cultivators were appearing in this tavern.</p><p></p><p>Why cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Because these people appeared without making a sound, without drawing any attention.</p><p></p><p>After arriving, these cultivators didn't engage in any conversation, but instead took out their own wine and slowly drank it here.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these cultivators went unnoticed even by him, a Divine Infant True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua couldn't help but sigh: "Phoenix Sky Domain truly deserves its reputation as a great domain, you can casually encounter powerful experts."</p><p></p><p>He drank, not even daring to make the smacking sounds he used to make.</p><p></p><p>Because all the cultivators in the tavern were drinking silently, without making any noise.</p><p></p><p>This made Jiang Ruhua feel somewhat embarrassed and ashamed.</p><p></p><p>He decided that when he returned, he must write a book called "Jiang Ruhua's Travelogue of Phoenix Sky Domain", recording the high quality of Phoenix Sky Domain's cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Yes, there were no waiters in the tavern, many high-level cultivators came to drink, and they didn't make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Such high quality.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two male cultivators and one female cultivator came to Jiang Ruhua's side.</p><p></p><p>The leader transmitted: "Brother, may we sit beside you?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked towards the other seats.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua also looked around and was suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, all the seats had been filled?</p><p></p><p>Business in Phoenix Sky Domain was too good, should he expand the Jiang family's business here? "Of course," Jiang Ruhua quickly transmitted back.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators here were too well-mannered, he didn't dare to speak loudly either, and could only use voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong, hearing this reply, sat down with Wang Lingshan and the others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was some anxiety in the expressions of the three.</p><p></p><p>"You cultivators from big places really have manners," Jiang Ruhua transmitted, his voice filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Lingtong's eyes showed a worried look, then he said: "Brother, you are so carefree, living such a leisurely life."</p><p></p><p>"Leisurely my ass!" Jiang Ruhua got angry hearing this, "Do you know? My daughter was taken away by some kid! Today, she even got angry at me because of that kid, it really infuriates me!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Lingtong was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Weren't all the cultivators here to pay respects to the Blood-robed Sword Immortal? Why was this one still grumbling about such things?</p><p></p><p>"A married daughter is like spilt water," he could only casually comfort him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I traveled thousands of miles from the Eastern Lands to get here, wanting to marry off my daughter. When that kid wakes up, I must give him a punch in the nose to settle this matter!" Jiang Ruhua was full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>A great battle had occurred in the heavens, all cultivators were in fear for their lives, he thought of his daughter and wanted to return home.</p><p></p><p>But having already traveled halfway, he still came to Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong felt somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, brother, we've all come to pay respects to the Blood-robed Sword Immortal, don't think about those personal matters now.</p><p></p><p>"Hit him, he deserves it!" Wang Lingtong still tried to comfort him.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's a pity that kid is quite strong, a realm higher than me. If he hits me back, it would be quite embarrassing," Jiang Ruhua said, his tone changing from resentment to boasting.</p><p></p><p>As if saying, see, my son-in-law is quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Realms don't mean everything. How could there be any reason in this world for a son-in-law to raise his hand against his father-in-law? If he dares to hit you, brother, I will stand up for you!" Wang Lingtong said casually.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. Ah, people from big places really understand reason. If this were near our family clan, with so many great cultivators gathered together, they would probably have started arguing and fighting by now," Jiang Ruhua said, scanning the group of well-mannered great cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Brother, are you pretending to understand when you don't?</p><p></p><p>That person is right upstairs, how dare any of these great lords speak loudly?</p><p></p><p>Haven't you seen those two great lords over there? They've been mortal enemies for a hundred thousand years, but coming here, they had to put aside their old grudges.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong didn't say anything more, but waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, suddenly, Jiang Ruhua's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, my son-in-law is coming down. I'm going to teach him a good lesson now. If he hits me, you must back me up!" Jiang Ruhua had drunk some wine and was a bit tipsy.</p><p></p><p>Punching him in the nose was, of course, just talk.</p><p></p><p>How could he embarrass his family in public?</p><p></p><p>But he still had to say something.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong was stunned, a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>What did he mean...</p><p></p><p>Your son-in-law is upstairs?</p><p></p><p>"Bro... Senior, what's your son-in-law's name?" Wang Lingtong's heart was stirred up like stormy waves.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I feel that the strange events that happened today, I should vent to Jinli about them.</p><p></p><p>'Jinli, I have some good news and bad news to tell you. Which one do you want to hear first?'</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace, Jinli, who was troubled by handling memorials, saw the flickering light of Linglongyu Xiong.</p><p></p><p>Her mouth couldn't help but curl up.</p><p></p><p>The troubles of the Southern Qian Kingdom seemed to have dissipated.</p><p></p><p>'Hear the good news first.'</p><p></p><p>'The good news is that I got married.'</p><p></p><p>'Married??? '</p><p></p><p>'The bad news is that the one I married is a wedding dress!'</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan roughly told Jinli about the events that happened today.</p><p></p><p>After hearing it, Jinli, for some reason, heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>'With the little bride, my monster-killing speed will definitely increase. I estimate that it won't be long before I can break through the Yiguan Ban.</p><p></p><p>How about your side? How's the situation?'</p><p></p><p>Jinli frowned as she read Qi Yuan's message.</p><p></p><p>After the previous emperor's passing, all the imperial descendants were massacred, leaving only Jinli as the sole survivor.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the entire Southern Qian Kingdom is the domain of the Sima Clan.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sima Clan, in order to maintain legitimacy and respectability, and also out of consideration for the General of the Heavenly Mandate stationed outside, as well as the Holy Gate of the Heavenly Yun, has not directly usurped the throne.</p><p></p><p>But the recent challenge from the National Master of the Southern Feng Kingdom was the Sima Clan's plot.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the XuanYuan Ban, Qin Niang's breakthrough to the Imperial Realm, she defeated the National Master of the Southern Feng Kingdom during the challenge, thwarting the Sima Clan's plot.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the power Jinli possesses is far inferior to that of the Sima Clan.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that even when the previous emperor was still alive, she had already been marginalized.</p><p></p><p>Her ascension to the throne was only nominal, without any real power.</p><p></p><p>Of the Six Ministries, except for the Grand Sage Kongqi of the Ministry of Rites, the rest are all under the control of the Sima Clan.</p><p></p><p>The real power she holds is only Qin Niang, a single Imperial Realm expert, and two thousand Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even if they lure the Sima Clan into the palace and Qin Niang cooperates with the Imperial Guards, it would still be difficult to eliminate the Sima Clan.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Sima Riyue, the eldest son of the Sima Clan, is even more ruthless and ambitious than the Sima Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Sima Clan still maintains a sense of propriety, but Sima Riyue does not.</p><p></p><p>'My side is still quite difficult. The power I possess is too little.' Jinli sighed.</p><p></p><p>The XuanYuan Ban can indeed enhance the strength of her subordinates.</p><p></p><p>The speed of improvement is also very fast.</p><p></p><p>But it is not enough to allow Jinli to turn the situation around quickly.</p><p></p><p>Unless she is given a few years or even a decade or more of stable development time to allow more Imperial Realm experts under her command.</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Qian Kingdom, apart from Qin Niang, the openly Imperial Realm experts are only three people.</p><p></p><p>Under the Sima Clan, the openly Imperial Realm experts alone are two people, and how many are hidden is unknown.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she dares not dispatch her trusted aides to the XuanYuan Ban in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>That would definitely attract the attention of the Sima Clan.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Sima Clan is so overwhelming that it has become extremely inflated, so Jinli was able to leave the capital and go to the Xuanyuan Ban last time.</p><p></p><p>But with Qin Niang's display of Imperial Realm strength, the Sima Clan will certainly be wary, and it will be much more difficult for Jinli to leave the palace again.</p><p></p><p>'Your predicament is even more difficult than that of Emperor Xian of Han.' Qi Yuan couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>At least during the time of Emperor Xian of Han, the various warlords and the common people still nominally recognized the Liu imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>But Jinli? She is now just a mascot.</p><p></p><p>If she truly displays the power to threaten the Sima Clan, the Sima Clan will likely tear off its mask and not care about any legitimacy or face, and directly use ruthless means to eliminate Jinli.</p><p></p><p>'How about your side? How's the task going?' Jinli could gradually communicate on the same wavelength as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>'I also encountered a big boss, a bit strong, it seems even the celestial gods are not his match.'"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A god?" Jinli couldn't help but exclaim, "Is it the god from the mythological legends?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Qi Yuan had only seen records of the god in the underground palace of the Yiguan Prohibition, but he was unsure if it was the same as the one from the legends.</p><p></p><p>"Then you... be careful, don't forget, you still need to meet me!" Jinli said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "Unfortunately, I can't leave the prohibited area right now, otherwise I would just go and chop down Sima Ting for you, and be done with it.</p><p></p><p>But, doing that might lower your mission evaluation, and the reward would be a bit less."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's current map only showed the Xuanyuan Prohibition and the Yiguan Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Probably, he would have to clear the Yiguan Prohibition first before the other two prohibited areas could be unlocked.</p><p></p><p>Once he had cleared all the prohibited areas, Qi Yuan estimated that he would then be able to unlock the other maps, and that would be the time when he could finally meet Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also wanted to see what this female online friend, whom he had been chatting with for nearly a year, looked like.</p><p></p><p>It would be best if she was good-looking.</p><p></p><p>But even if she was ordinary, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Her personality didn't seem to have any distinctive features, but when Qi Yuan chatted with her, he felt particularly comfortable.</p><p></p><p>There was no empress-like majesty, no affectation, no scheming and trickery.</p><p></p><p>This kind of personality, to Qi Yuan, could already be considered a very good close friend.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this life, to be able to encounter a girl like this, who can quietly accompany you to watch the clouds rise and fall, the sunrise, and feel that time flows but the years do not easily pass, and find the years peaceful and good, is already very valuable.</p><p></p><p>"Your main task is the priority, if I encounter any changes, I will let you know." Jinli felt a warmth in her heart, "As for your side, although... I can't be of much help to you."</p><p></p><p>Since birth, she had never tasted the so-called family affection, nor had she ever been truly cared for.</p><p></p><p>Her emperor father, being marginalized by the prime minister, drank every day, capricious in his moods, and did not give her any care.</p><p></p><p>Her mother, she had never even seen.</p><p></p><p>The only one who had been good to her was Qin Niang, and now there was also Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The information about the Yiguan Prohibition that you told me last time was a great help.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, I can't help you now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sent the message.</p><p></p><p>His eyes stared at the Yiguan Prohibition soldiers buried in front of him.</p><p></p><p>An idea came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If I can take control of the Yiguan Prohibition, then these Yiguan Prohibition soldiers should also belong to me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Although, in Qi Yuan's eyes, the individual strength of these Yiguan Prohibition soldiers was actually not that impressive.</p><p></p><p>But as an organized Yiguan Prohibition army, the power they could unleash should be able to sweep through the world, right?</p><p></p><p>Except for the prohibited areas.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Prime Minister's mansion was like a palace.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting sat on the high seat, squinting his eyes, constantly rolling the jade worry beads in his hand, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>His eldest son, Sima Riyue, had a fierce expression on his face: "Father, why don't we just rebel? This is getting boring!"</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting looked at his son, his expression unchanged: "You may leave, I have something to discuss with your uncle."</p><p></p><p>This son of his was nothing like him.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his mother's clan's connection to the Holy Gate of the Heavenly Mandate, he...</p><p></p><p>After seeing Sima Riyue leave, Sima Ting looked at the scholar-dressed man beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wen, have you investigated the reason why Lady Qin has reached the Imperial Realm of strength?</p><p>Is there someone else behind Empress Jinli, targeting me or the Holy Gate of the Heavenly Mandate?"</p><p></p><p>The scholar-dressed man was named Wen Zongweng, a Sovereign Realm expert relied upon by Sima Ting.</p><p>This Sovereign Realm expert came from the Holy Gate of the Heavenly Mandate, and his strongest ability was in the art of curse-casting.</p><p>Even the previous emperor, with the protection of the Heavenly Mandate Jade Talisman, was still cursed to death by Wen Zongweng, demonstrating the formidable power of his curse-casting.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 187</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Lord bathed in lightning, his skeletal frame causing him to sigh: "This lightning is still too weak, it can't heal my wounds at all."</p><p></p><p>Seventy years ago, one of his good friends betrayed the Ancient Gods and joined the Evil Gods' camp. The Thunder Lord was furious and lashed out in anger. </p><p></p><p>He single-handedly fought two Lords, severely injuring his former friend.</p><p></p><p>But the injuries he sustained himself were clearly even more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to live another 300 years... is not bad," the Thunder Lord murmured as he felt his body.</p><p></p><p>His injuries were far too severe. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, as a mighty Lord, his lifespan would be measured in units of 100,000 years.</p><p></p><p>300 years would pass in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Lord, long time no see." The speaker was the white-haired old man who had just finished conversing with Elder Bai Xi.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Lord's eyebrow twitched, and a bolt of lightning struck the white-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>"At your age, don't you know to knock before entering? Is my body that nice to look at?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the white-haired old man wasn't angry, but said cheerfully: "Thunder Lord, haven't you always wanted to find a disciple to pass on your legacy? I've brought you one."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder Lord frowned: "If they're too weak, I'd rather not have one."</p><p></p><p>"He's definitely not weak. If it weren't for needing to cultivate the Child of Destiny, I wouldn't give up such a good seedling to you." The white-haired old man then told the Thunder Lord about Qi Yuan's situation.</p><p></p><p>"A legend?" The Thunder Lord was somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>A legendary level God Observation technique could almost create a Lord.</p><p></p><p>"According to him, there are also three other True Gods of the same level," the white-haired old man added.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Lord lowered his head, muttering: "Why have I never heard of these Four Heavenly Kings? And that Howling Celestial Dog, Earth God, and Giant Spirit God - I've never heard of them either."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-haired old man also frowned in thought: "I've never heard of these True Gods either."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some divine lineage that has never appeared on the main battlefield?" the Thunder Lord speculated.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Flood War, there was not only frontal combat, but also some divine lineages that shouldered important responsibilities while concealing their identities.</p><p></p><p>"None of that matters. I just want to know, are you satisfied with this disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"He's passable." Though the Thunder Lord said this, the whiskers on his upper lip were practically pointing to the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The True Gods he visualized are all unknown. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps he also knows of some thunder-wielding deities. If he could visualize them, it might help treat your injuries."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you really dare to imagine. That would require at least a legendary level God Observation technique," the Thunder Lord kicked the white-haired old man. "I need to get dressed now, get out!"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man smiled: "Thunder, don't be as reckless as before this time."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Lord had always been impetuous, just like a brash warrior.</p><p></p><p>Back then, if he hadn't been so impulsive and fought two Lords alone, he wouldn't have sustained such severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Do I need your advice?" The Thunder Lord glared at the white-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, now that you've taken a disciple, that young lad will have a hard time in the future.</p><p></p><p>I estimate he'll have to advise his master every day to be more cautious and not so reckless." The white-haired old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Get out, I need to prepare to leave too!" the Thunder Lord said.</p><p></p><p>Heading to the occupied territories, even he had to be careful.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could end up perishing.</p><p></p><p>There was more than one Lord in the occupied territories.</p><p></p><p>And in the Northern Lands, there was even a Lord at the level of Five Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Against a Lord of that level, the Thunder Lord had no thoughts of victory, let alone fighting.</p><p></p><p>He could be easily killed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>Flying Wilderness City.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi looked at the rain falling like strings of pearls outside the window, her eyes filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>She thought of the Jiang Kingdom, her family, and her great-grandfather.</p><p></p><p>The maid beside her was also moved by the scene: "Young Miss, when will we leave Flying Wilderness City? I want to see the heavy snow in Jiang Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>While it was raining in Lin Kingdom now, snow was falling in Jiang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi stared blankly at the snow outside the window: "I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>Originally, following her great-grandfather's instructions, she came to Flying Wilderness City to find the Origin Lord.</p><p></p><p>But now the Origin Lord was colluding and cooperating with the New Gods.</p><p></p><p>Her great-grandfather died at the hands of the Evil Gods, how could she give her great-grandfather's things to the Origin Lord?</p><p></p><p>Today, at the City Lord's mansion, she saw many important figures of Flying Wilderness City, as well as the Ancient God Weak Feather from Stone Sand Town.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was extremely wary of the Origin Lord.</p><p></p><p>Most of them felt that the Origin Lord had chosen to live in cowardice and cooperate with the New Gods.</p><p></p><p>In the past, she might have had other thoughts about those who lived in cowardice and cooperated with the New Gods.</p><p></p><p>But her great-grandfather's betrayal by his friend from Lu Kingdom was a thorn in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She also felt resentment towards the Origin Lord.</p><p></p><p>"It's all that Origin Lord's fault, joining the New Gods for no reason!" the maid couldn't help saying beside her.</p><p></p><p>If the Origin Lord was still a good Ancient God,</p><p></p><p>The Young Miss would give her great-grandfather's things to the Origin Lord, help him become stronger, and then seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>But with this change now, the Young Miss was confused about her future path, even desperate.</p><p></p><p>Even she felt this way.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>A man holding an umbrella walked through the curtain of rain.</p><p></p><p>He raised the umbrella slightly, revealing a handsome and refined face.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi looked at the man with some surprise, and heard him ask: "Have you met Elder Tianbao?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi was stunned, then nodded: "I've met Great-grandfather, but not often."</p><p></p><p>"Who among the living knows him best?" the man asked again.</p><p></p><p>Anger flashed in Wang Wenqi's eyes: "Lu Kingdom, Zhang Feng!"</p><p></p><p>"A True God?"</p><p></p><p>"A True God at Three Steps to Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"Then... his memories of Elder Tianbao must be very deep." The man murmured.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Wang Wenqi.</p><p></p><p>"I'm Qi Yuan, your great-grandfather's group chat friend.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi, do you want to slay a god?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi's eyes widened, her chest heaving from nervousness or excitement.</p><p></p><p>The maid behind her looked anxious: "Young Miss, he's the Origin Lord who joined the Evil Gods!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi looked into Qi Yuan's clear eyes and reached out her hand.</p><p></p><p>"I... want to!"</p><p></p><p>She leapt down from the windowsill, splashing water everywhere.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The day of the new god's arrival was drawing closer and closer. In Flying Wilderness City, people's hearts were filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying's expression was not good, looking very tired.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Celestial Lord is really stubborn, it's impossible to persuade him!" Ruo Yu said with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being unable to persuade, in reality, they didn't dare to try.</p><p></p><p>"I think the Origin Celestial Lord may be plotting against that new god," Nangong Wuji spoke up for Qi Yuan. "Otherwise, Miss Wang Wenqi wouldn't be willing to go with him to Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>Everyone present fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ruo Yu then said: "He's really daring, that's a true god, a true god who has opened three divine apertures, how dare he plot against it!"</p><p></p><p>Ruo Yu truly didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an ethereal voice came: "In three days... when the Great Plague descends, I will make a move once, to help that young friend."</p><p></p><p>The familiar voice made everyone's faces light up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Round God, you've awakened!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, you've finally awakened!"</p><p></p><p>They were overjoyed, but there was no further response.</p><p></p><p>The ancient god Round had fallen back into slumber.</p><p></p><p>However, they now had a bit more confidence.</p><p></p><p>With the ancient god Round taking action, in three days... they would not be without any chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village, Qi Yuan looked at the altar in front of him, his eyes filled with excitement: "The Great Plague Venerable will descend here in three days?"</p><p></p><p>The evil god was small and thin, looking malnourished: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>He was terrified of Qi Yuan, this demon.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a smile: "I'm so looking forward to time passing quickly, for the day after tomorrow to come soon."</p><p></p><p>What kind of feast would be appropriate for the fall of a true god? Holding a feast in a small place like Gale Town would be insulting to the god.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they had to have a grand feast in Flying Wilderness City.</p><p></p><p>The evil god next to him trembled upon hearing Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on a rock, not knowing how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, someone ran up to his ear and said something.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face showed surprise: "The Round God is going to activate?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi, sitting next to Qi Yuan, was holding a pipa, her fingers plucking the strings.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the Great Plague Venerable will be scared off and not descend?" Qi Yuan said to Wang Wenqi.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't spread the news about his plot against the Great Plague Venerable.</p><p></p><p>What if the Great Plague Venerable was a rabbit, too timid, and got scared? So, until now, he had only given Wang Wenqi the divine viewing method of the Dhritarashtra Heavenly King to contemplate, and hadn't let her consume the supreme treasure to break through to the realm of true god.</p><p></p><p>This time, Wang Wenqi had brought him five treasures that could help those at the peak of the Purple Palace realm break through to true god.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had never met the Heavenly Treasure Venerable, he always kept that gratitude in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He also remembered Zhang Feng's name.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't happen. The ancient god Round has always been in a state of severe injury and coma. Even if he awakens, he won't have much power."</p><p></p><p>"That's good, I'm just afraid... he might be too timid to come down."</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial altar continued.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious space, a voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Great Plague Venerable, you still want to go down? Aren't you afraid someone is setting you up?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if I were that cowardly, I wouldn't have become a true god!"</p><p></p><p>"Then why are you forcing yourself to descend early at the cost of consuming your divine power?"</p><p></p><p>"That boy is too strange, we can't give him more time to prepare."</p><p></p><p>"I wish the Great Plague Venerable a smooth journey!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Plague Venerable ignored this and directly entered the membrane.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a huge heartbeat and chewing entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>The divine power on the Great Plague Venerable's body was rapidly consumed.</p><p></p><p>Above the three divine apertures, a strong light shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>"So hungry, so hungry, really so hungry!" The Great Plague Venerable couldn't help but roar.</p><p></p><p>An intense feeling of hunger struck him, he wanted to cut off his own flesh and eat it.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the starving Great Plague Venerable suddenly laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Mortal Heart Realm... This Lord has finally arrived!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on a night in Gale Town, a huge figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>He roared wantonly, his expression joyful.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a true god spread at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The whole world seemed to be covered in a layer of mist.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all the residents of Gale Town were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Plague Venerable... has descended early!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the governor's mansion of Flying Wilderness City, those powerful experts also sensed this aura and their faces changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Plague Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"He descended early!"</p><p></p><p>"He must have sensed a threat, we're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"Where's the ancient god Round, hasn't he awakened yet?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying looked at the terrifying figure in the sky, her face particularly grim: "The ancient god Round... can't awaken for now, we have to rely on the Origin Celestial Lord himself."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone in the governor's mansion felt a heavy weight in their hearts, sensing a great crisis.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the terrifying figure in the sky, also somewhat surprised: "Finally showing some brains, but not much."</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenqi beside him, seeing this, immediately swallowed the Yin Birth Stone.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the spiritual power in her body transformed into divine power at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A divine aperture quickly formed.</p><p></p><p>The realm of true god... came naturally! At this time, Qi Yuan's face suddenly changed drastically: "Not good, someone's stealing the kill!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a hearty laugh came: "Good disciple, master is sending you a welcome gift!"</p><p></p><p>In the nine heavens above, vast lightning fell, terrifying lightning serpents, each capable of killing a god.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan shouted at the top of his lungs: "Please, leave him a bit of life, don't steal the kill!"</p><p></p><p>Actually, he really wanted to curse the other party for being shameless, but the other party was a Great Venerable! When he was the Wangyue Great Venerable, he knew the strength and terror of a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Anything below the fourth step of sky-treading was an ant, this wasn't just talk.</p><p></p><p>The difference between a Great Venerable and a Venerable lies in the divine domain! Within the divine domain, a Great Venerable could kill a Venerable with a flick of a finger.</p><p></p><p>So at this time, he chose to be submissive! Meanwhile, the Great Plague Venerable was both hungry and afraid, pitiful old man that he was, having finally descended after great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>What did he encounter? A Great Venerable!</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable, ambushing him, a first step sky-treader with three divine apertures, where's the fairness in that! "You all... are shameless!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

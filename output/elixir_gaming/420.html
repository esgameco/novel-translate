        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Moluo clan below all revealed ambiguous smiles.</p><p></p><p>Moon maidens were not allowed to marry.</p><p></p><p>For the Heavenly Lord to abduct a moon maiden as his dao companion was a slap in the face to the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Heavenly Lord on his success!"</p><p></p><p>"In another month, it seems to be the Moon Banquet. If the Heavenly Lord abducts the moon maiden again, it will be a double celebration!"</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan cultivators flattered and laughed.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Banquet was a birthday feast unique to the Moon God Palace. </p><p></p><p>Any cultivator of the Moon God Palace would hold a Moon Banquet every ten thousand years on their birthday.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, whose Moon Banquet is it?" Qi Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be Jinli's?</p><p></p><p>"It's for a legendary female cultivator who illuminates all the heavens, one of the top three on the Absolute Moon Abyss battle rankings!" A Moluo clan cultivator spoke up. He seemed to be very familiar with the situation in the Absolute Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because a birthday feast was only held every ten thousand years, that is, the Moon Banquet, this kind of banquet would be held very grandly by the Moon God Palace, and there would be many guests invited.</p><p></p><p>This legendary figure from the Moluo clan had been here for several hundred years, and had only heard of a few Moon Banquets.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan responded indifferently. </p><p></p><p>Since it wasn't Jinli's, it wasn't important to him.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his figure flashed, and he headed to the garrison post.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was impersonating the Demonic Blaze Heavenly Lord, he had to continue the disguise.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't have a sixth-level heaven residence permit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if he was discovered, not only would the Yang Gods of the Moluo clan surround and attack him.</p><p></p><p>The one from the Supreme Radiance Palace who knew his identity might also make a move against him.</p><p></p><p>As for the Moon God Palace...</p><p></p><p>To him, except for his wife Jinli and his master's wife, everyone else was a stranger.</p><p></p><p>The moon maidens had status in the Moon God Palace, but no real power. If he rashly went to the Moon God Palace's territory, he might be obliterated by the Moon God Palace's miraculous treasures.</p><p></p><p>So, to see Jinli, he had to see her safely, and even had to win over his "mother-in-law".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan considered himself a person with "high emotional intelligence"! In treating his junior sister Jiang Lingsu, he warmed her for a hundred days.</p><p></p><p>He also wouldn't put Jinli in a difficult position between the Moon God Palace and himself.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Moon God Palace forbids moon maidens from marrying, but... are the laws of the Moon God Palace really above marriage law?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered whether he should raise the marriage law to deal with the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, after all, the Moon God Palace was Jinli's maiden home.</p><p></p><p>Doing so wouldn't be good in the end.</p><p></p><p>He had to move people with emotion!</p><p></p><p>"I'm new here, I should go visit the leaders in the Absolute Moon Abyss. Sigh, high emotional intelligence is really tiring!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that sometimes high emotional intelligence was indeed not good.</p><p></p><p>Near the Broken Moon Abyss, in the Absolute Moon Abyss, there was a Principle Yang God stationed there.</p><p></p><p>This Principle Yang God was the "leader" of the Demonic Blaze Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had low emotional intelligence, well, he wouldn't care about any leader.</p><p></p><p>But he was a cultivator with "high emotional intelligence", so he had to go pay respects to the leader.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would be given a hard time.</p><p></p><p>"Social anxiety and high emotional intelligence appearing simultaneously in me, according to that famous saying, holding the sun and moon, plucking the stars..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself in the mirror, feeling like he should admire himself.</p><p></p><p>Now he was a "man of integrity and talent".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped thinking about these things, and instead pondered how to deal with the current situation.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, a voice transmission came.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander from the Supreme Radiance Palace in the Broken Moon Abyss had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Enter!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, a legendary powerhouse pushed open the door and entered the empty great hall.</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Gods of the Moluo clan followed closely behind, filing in one after another.</p><p></p><p>This legendary powerhouse, from the Supreme Radiance Palace, was named Baideng Shangren. At this moment, his face was beaming with joy.</p><p></p><p>In the Supreme Radiance Palace, he was a legendary figure, high above others.</p><p></p><p>But this loftiness was only towards ordinary Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>As for Yang Gods and Heavenly Lords, those were ones he needed to carefully look up to, and even the qualification to meet them required exhausting all his efforts to obtain.</p><p></p><p>But in this Demon Abyss, he was truly a second-generation rich kid.</p><p></p><p>Those Yang Gods of the Moluo clan were also courteous to him, treating him with respect.</p><p></p><p>This... the new Yang God Heavenly Lord who came to garrison the Broken Moon Abyss wanted to see him as soon as he arrived.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to give him a small gift.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he was in high spirits, striding forward with great strides, his heart full of anticipation for what gift this Heavenly Lord would give him.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings... Heavenly Lord!" Baideng Shangren was still very respectful towards Yang God Heavenly Lords, and observed all the proper etiquette.</p><p></p><p>After completing the salute, he raised his head to secretly glance at the Heavenly Lord's figure.</p><p></p><p>In the Supreme Radiance Palace he didn't dare look at the faces of those Yang Gods, but here he dared.</p><p></p><p>However, when he looked over, he couldn't see the Heavenly Lord's appearance at all.</p><p></p><p>This was the taboo of respecting those in high positions.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Heavenly Lord seated on the throne spoke, his voice vast and infinitely sacred: "Which foot did you step into the door with first?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Moluo clan cultivators who had entered were a bit confused, not knowing why the Heavenly Lord asked this.</p><p></p><p>Baideng Shangren was stunned for a moment, not expecting the Heavenly Lord to suddenly ask this.</p><p></p><p>But after all, he was a cultivator with extraordinary memory.</p><p></p><p>"This junior entered with both legs together." Baideng Shangren answered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, seated on the throne, was a bit stunned when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Why aren't you following the script? He was embarrassed and angry! "To actually enter with both legs together, this Lord hates people like that the most!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan flew into a rage, his voice like thunder, shaking the spiritual energy in all directions at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The anger of a Heavenly Lord was enough to affect the four seasons and celestial phenomena, even causing the world to collapse and the sun and moon to reverse.</p><p></p><p>Baideng Shangren's blood and qi surged, his face instantly turning pale, not knowing when he had offended this Yang God Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Gods of the Moluo clan also looked at each other in dismay, not knowing why the Demonic Blaze Heavenly Lord was angry. They trembled in fear, afraid of being implicated.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Lord was wary of the Supreme Radiance Palace and wouldn't do anything to their garrison commander, but implicating them was very normal.</p><p></p><p>"This junior doesn't know how he has offended the Heavenly Lord?" Baideng Shangren's face flushed red, unable to help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>"You entered the door with both feet together, violating this Lord's great taboo. You deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>When these words were spoken, all the Yin Gods present were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Entering with both legs together? What's wrong with that? Unfortunately, they were not from the Blue Star and didn't understand Qi Yuan's high emotional intelligence and humor at all.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pointed a finger.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Gods and Yin Gods was too great, far too great.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Mortal Heart Realm, the No Food Holy Mother with her legendary body, with Qi Yuan's help, could only withstand that one for twenty breaths, and that wasn't even his true form.</p><p></p><p>Baideng Shangren had no ability to resist at all, and was directly obliterated by this tyrannical finger.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the Yin Gods present smelled a faint scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>That proud and elated Baideng Shangren was killed in a moment.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin Gods who witnessed this didn't dare to breathe.</p><p></p><p>They only felt that this matter had become serious.</p><p></p><p>This was the garrison commander of the Supreme Radiance Palace, representing the face of the Supreme Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>As a result... the Heavenly Lord just killed him like this? If the Supreme Radiance Palace found out and became enraged, the Heavenly Lord...</p><p></p><p>Well, the Heavenly Lord should be fine.</p><p></p><p>But they would be...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Terrible.</p><p></p><p>The Moro clan would surely offer up some people to appease the anger of Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"What, do you all have objections to my execution of Baideng Shangren?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over these yin spirits, his eyes calm.</p><p></p><p>The Moro clan yin spirits present trembled, all feeling a sense of impending disaster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a yin spirit venerable suddenly spoke up, with a look of joy on his face: "The Heavenly Lord killed well, killed wonderfully. I've long disliked that fellow, he actually dared to violate the Heavenly Lord's taboo, he deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded approvingly: "What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>There are always plenty of bootlickers.</p><p></p><p>"This lowly one... is Chuanpu!" This yin spirit venerable replied excitedly, hunched over.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan heard this, he immediately found it amusing: "Your name matches your speech very well."</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected such a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Life is indeed full of amusement everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Chuanpu had no idea what Qi Yuan meant, but seeing the Heavenly Lord seemed very happy, he became happy too.</p><p></p><p>"I executed Baideng Shangren because I've long disliked him. </p><p>Hmph, we pay to come fight, yet he comes to show off his might, it's really unlucky!"</p><p></p><p>The other yin spirits hearing this also felt somewhat the same, or shared the same hatred.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, that guardian of Taihuang Palace had been quite bullying and exploitative towards them.</p><p></p><p>"This person deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>"This Baideng Shangren deceived the Heavenly Lord of Taihuang Palace above and bullied us below, he really deserved to die!"</p><p></p><p>However, even if they resented Taihuang Palace, they didn't dare resent the yang spirit lords.</p><p></p><p>After all, the lords are all kind-hearted, they were just deceived.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, a clear stream of light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>The moon boat was like a crescent moon, glowing all over, crystal clear, carrying all kinds of heavenly treasures and fine food and wine.</p><p></p><p>Moonlight poured down, falling on the woman's white robe. The plum blossoms on the plain white dress became even more gorgeous, with the cold beauty of plum blossoms standing proudly in snow. But compared to the owner of this white dress, these plum blossoms were still far inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Yueshuang, why did you come?" Jin Li, in a white robe, saw that cold woman, with a hint of joy in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's less than a month until your birthday, I came to see you," Yueshuang smiled, "Afraid you'd be lonely here alone."</p><p></p><p>"It's just an ordinary birthday, not... a moon birthday." A warmth surged in her chest, but Jin Li said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Tiao's birthday is on the same day as yours. She's holding a moon birthday banquet, all kinds of friends are coming. I couldn't let you be cold and lonely by yourself." Yueshuang said, with a hint of shame in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Back then, on the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>She and Jin Li were trapped.</p><p></p><p>Of the two moon maidens, one was abandoned.</p><p></p><p>The abandoned one was Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Faceless Sword God, Jin Li might have perished then.</p><p></p><p>So, for this sister, she always carried a bit of guilt in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a birthday, no different from any other day. These days, I plan to continue deeper into Jueyue Abyss, to kill more of the Moro clan!" Jin Li mentioned this with a thick bloody aura around her.</p><p></p><p>The once fragile girl, after so many years, had changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Have you earned enough merits?" Yueshuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, just a little more!" Jin Li nodded seriously, with anticipation flashing in her beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>In another ten years or so, her merits would be enough, and she could request the Moon God Sovereign to take action, to fulfill a wish for her.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if it's one more day. Don't go on the day of the moon birthday banquet, let's sisters have a feast together, and after eating, I'll accompany you!" Yueshuang spoke.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li was silent for a moment, then finally nodded: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yueshuang thought of something and suddenly spoke: "What do you plan to ask the Moon God Sovereign to do? Is it... to find him, rescue him, revive him, or...</p><p></p><p>The moon maidens of the Moon God Palace cannot marry. Even if the Moon God Sovereign helps you find him, you can't go with him...</p><p></p><p>Or are you asking the Moon God Sovereign to let you shed your identity as a moon maiden, and then... you go find him yourself, to be together?"</p><p></p><p>Each moon maiden only has one chance in her life to make a request to the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li was silent, then a smile bloomed on her beautiful face, like plum blossoms blooming in vast snow: "As long as he's still alive, that's good. If I could see him once more... it would be the greatest fortune of my life."</p><p></p><p>"Why bother..." Yueshuang sighed.</p><p></p><p>It's destined to have no result, better to end it early.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he's still alive, I believe he... will find me." Jin Li's gaze was firm.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the second sentence Qi Yuan had passed to her through the Bridal Gown Knight.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she didn't quite understand the meaning in those words.</p><p></p><p>Later, seeing the statue of the Faceless Sword God, memories of the past returned, and she understood everything.</p><p></p><p>Those words were what the Faceless Sword God, who had waited in vain for a long time by July Lake, said to the future Empress Jin Li across time and space.</p><p></p><p>Even across the distance of time, he said he wanted to see her.</p><p></p><p>"Oh you..." Yueshuang couldn't help but sigh, "Endless years can bury everything. So many years have passed, how do you know he's still the one in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>The greatest power of an ideal love is that even the real person can't defeat it.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li grasped the Linglongyuxi, brilliant smiles surging in her eyes again. She remembered the sword-carrying watcher with snow-covered shoulders by July Lake; she remembered the world-shaking sword god who held her small hand, traveled to a hundred cities, and killed the Black Robe Guards; she remembered the fearless swordsman who alone blocked the absolute, fought alone for three hundred years, and killed three thousand evil demons.</p><p></p><p>Though she had never seen his face, she understood: "He is a thousand times, ten thousand times better than in my memory!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Everything is prepared, it's time to... go pay a visit to the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord."</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, Qi Yuan's figure slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Eye Heavenly Lord is the ruler of Jueyue Abyss, a yang spirit at the Ultimate Principle realm, and can be considered the superior of the Demon Flame Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Moro clan has a total of five yang spirits at the Ultimate Principle realm, three of whom are in the Demon Abyss, showing how much importance the Moro clan attaches to the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"This meeting with the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord will really test my acting skills! I have a feeling that after this meeting, with my acting skills, when I return to Blue Star, I can aspire to the position of best actor!"</p><p></p><p>"I really am... a man of integrity."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Heavenly Lord and the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord don't have much interaction, but they are both yang spirits of the Moro clan.</p><p></p><p>So, if Qi Yuan is slightly careless, he will be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his visit to the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord this time is not just to visit a leader, but also to fish, to tempt the "cadre" with good things.</p><p></p><p>For this, he not only frantically brainwashed the Demon Flame Heavenly Lord to get more details, but also long ago laid bait in Duanyue Abyss, just waiting for his performance.</p><p></p><p>"An Ultimate Principle realm powerhouse... should be no problem, right?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He had never fought an Ultimate Principle realm powerhouse before.</p><p></p><p>However, he estimated that it shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, his right eyebrow wasn't twitching frantically, indicating everything was under control.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, this is the Demon Abyss not the Moro clan. If the Demon Eye Heavenly Lord disappears for more than a certain period of time, it will definitely be discovered."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, his form heading towards Jueyue Abyss.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

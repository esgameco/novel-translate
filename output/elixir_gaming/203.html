        <h1>Chapter 203</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Linmu Immortal Liquid, the villagers present were breathing rapidly, wishing they could devour it in large gulps.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan didn't say anything, so they didn't dare to step forward.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the villagers behind him who were breathing heavily: "You don't even play basketball, how could you like drinking bath water?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but think of his past life on Blue Star, where there was reportedly a basketball star who wanted to drink bath water.</p><p></p><p>"Basketball?"</p><p></p><p>"Bath water?"</p><p></p><p>The villagers had trouble understanding Qi Yuan's train of thought. </p><p></p><p>They were looking at the Linmu Immortal Liquid, how did these two random things suddenly come up?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it seems this bath water has already been used by someone," Qi Yuan lamented. "Happy Arhat, put away this bath water."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wouldn't use this bath water himself, but... if his subjects wanted to use it, he wouldn't stop them, right?</p><p></p><p>Happy Arhat was somewhat delighted: "Divine Lord, I'm about to condense my second divine aperture. Can I drink a mouthful of the Linmu Immortal Liquid?"</p><p></p><p>The Long-Browed Arhat beside him quickly followed suit, his eyes full of longing for the Linmu Immortal Liquid.</p><p></p><p>The villagers behind were the same.</p><p></p><p>For those who weren't true gods, drinking the Linmu Immortal Liquid still had many benefits - improving cultivation and enhancing aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"Drink, all of you have a mouthful," Qi Yuan didn't stop them.</p><p></p><p>If people wanted to drink bath water, he couldn't be bothered to stop them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the villagers on the scene rushed forward frantically, reaching their hands into the bath water and cupping it in their palms.</p><p></p><p>The village chief Yu Lu's aged face showed an entranced expression as he sniffed the strange fragrance of the Linmu Immortal Liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Truly a rare fragrance in this world. Just smelling it once makes one feel carefree and happy. </p><p></p><p>What kind of delicious taste would it be to drink a mouthful? It's hard to imagine!"</p><p></p><p>Village chief Yu Lu savored the Linmu Immortal Liquid, just like a child from a backward feudal dynasty tasting milk for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The reactions of the others weren't much better.</p><p></p><p>A group of true gods, Purple Palace cultivators, Divine Infant cultivators, and Yuan Dan cultivators drank the bath water with intoxicated looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I can't livestream this, it would definitely be interesting," Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>However, he still secretly took out a recording stone and recorded this scene.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, after endless time passes, these people might all become big shots.</p><p></p><p>Then Qi Yuan could take out the recording stone and show it to them.</p><p></p><p>When they discover how obsessed they were with bath water back then, it would definitely be interesting.</p><p></p><p>"My second divine aperture has opened!" Just then, Happy Arhat suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a powerful divine aura spread out. Happy Arhat had directly opened a divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>The Linmu Immortal Liquid could speed up the condensation of divine apertures. Happy Arhat had accumulated enough and directly opened a divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>His strength instantly surged.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers also became stronger to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>The various treasures in the Linmu Immortal Liquid nourished their bodies. The villagers' complexions became ruddy and their bodies more upright.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, just the first tower yielded so much," Qi Yuan was naturally excited that Happy Arhat's strength had increased.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned before, this ancestral land had seven levels and over a hundred towers.</p><p></p><p>If just the bath water from the first tower was this powerful, if there were even better things later, their overall strength would certainly increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Take these few tons of bath water with us, let's go to the next tower," Qi Yuan commanded.</p><p></p><p>The villagers present didn't know why Qi Yuan called the Linmu Immortal Liquid bath water, but they didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>They just treated it as a pronunciation issue of Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could such precious immortal liquid be bath water?</p><p></p><p>How could anyone use so much precious immortal liquid to bathe?</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Happy Arhat happily took out a storage bag and filled it completely with the Linmu Immortal Liquid.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over the tower. Inside were metal scraps everywhere.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of broken, strange objects.</p><p></p><p>To him, these things were almost useless.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the second tower!" Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The villagers present followed Qi Yuan and left the tower.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the tower, a group of ancient gods were still quietly waiting. They were worried and on edge, ready to step in and rescue at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's been so long without any movement, what's going on?" Yan Xi Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's really strange!"</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but find it odd.</p><p></p><p>The tower was full of dangers, and could trigger the puppet gods to awaken at any time.</p><p></p><p>They had been inside for over a hundred breaths, but there was still no movement, which was very rare.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he really can tell fortunes?" the twin sister said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present smiled when they heard this, not taking it seriously.</p><p></p><p>The matter of fate is most unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>Even fortune-telling masters would die inside the ancestral land towers.</p><p></p><p>Because the things and rules inside the ancestral land towers were more chaotic compared to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly came: "Why are you all here?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present immediately looked up towards the source of the voice.</p><p></p><p>They saw Qi Yuan open something like a glass window at the top of the tower and jump out from inside.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers also imitated Qi Yuan, jumping out from the window.</p><p></p><p>These villagers jumped out of the tower as easily as an adulterous man jumping out of a woman's house.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They...</p><p></p><p>The twin sister spoke frankly: "How did you enter the highest level!"</p><p></p><p>To be able to come out from the highest level, they must have entered the highest level!</p><p></p><p>The tower before them had three levels in total.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient gods had shed blood on the first level, and no ancient god had set foot on the second level until now.</p><p></p><p>How did these two true gods and a bunch of mortals enter the highest level and walk out from inside! Were the puppet gods inside sleeping in a daze?</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others landed beside everyone: "I can tell fortunes, so naturally I found a way to survive. </p><p></p><p>It's a pity that this tower doesn't have any good treasures, only a bunch of bath water."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>The first tower indeed didn't have anything good.</p><p></p><p>"Bath water? There's actually bath water placed in the tower?" </p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present looked at each other, quite puzzled by Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Only bath water?"</p><p></p><p>"No, whose bath water?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan and the others come out like this, many thoughts flashed through their minds.</p><p></p><p>Either Qi Yuan was lucky, or he had something special, or the tower malfunctioned.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this made them envious and jealous.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yan Xi Venerable had entered this first level tower before.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he only entered for one breath before being chased by a group of puppet gods, and ended up leaving his thigh in the tower.</p><p></p><p>That time, he worked so hard and suffered heavy losses, only managing to snatch a thin piece of golden gauze from the tower, which he used as a mask since it could conceal auras.</p><p></p><p>His hard work formed a stark contrast with Qi Yuan's ease.</p><p></p><p>They felt unbalanced in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But when they heard it was bath water, they felt balanced again.</p><p></p><p>This didn't sound like any treasure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the twin sister suddenly looked at the crowd behind Qi Yuan: "They all seem to have been reborn, especially..."</p><p></p><p>She looked at Happy Arhat, sensing that his strength had reached another level.</p><p></p><p>To improve so much in such a short time!</p><p></p><p>There must be supreme treasures!</p><p></p><p>"Linmu Immortal Liquid, this old man smells the scent of Linmu Immortal Liquid!" A man with a large mole between his eyebrows looked at the villagers behind Qi Yuan, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>"Linmu Immortal Liquid, I smell it too!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually Linmu Immortal Liquid!" Some ancient gods' eyes turned red.</p><p></p><p>Linmu Immortal Liquid was a supreme treasure even for true gods below the Great Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>This immortal liquid not only tasted delicious, but also emitted a strange fragrance, truly a delicacy of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, after drinking one drop, the speed of condensing divine apertures would increase fivefold for ten years.</p><p></p><p>If a true god hadn't broken through for a long time, drinking a few drops could even give them a chance to break through.</p><p></p><p>Such precious Linmu Immortal Liquid, yet... Qi Yuan directly gave it to those mortals to drink!</p><p></p><p>Based on the scent they smelled, and they drank more than just one or two drops.</p><p></p><p>What a waste!</p><p></p><p>Pearls before swine!</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present felt heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>The effects such a treasure would bring them would definitely far exceed giving it to Yuan Dan and Divine Infant mortals.</p><p></p><p>"You mean this bath water? It is indeed quite extraordinary. Shen Tu has always been skinny, but after drinking it, he's put on some meat.</p><p></p><p>If he likes drinking bath water in the future, he should drink a bowl every day, otherwise being so weak and frail following me around, people might misunderstand that I like men."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, Qi Yuan didn't care about others' comments about him.</p><p></p><p>He was always magnanimous, at most he would just chop people up offline.</p><p></p><p>But saying he liked men was something he couldn't accept.</p><p></p><p>He was a married man after all.</p><p></p><p>"Bath water? Linmu Immortal Liquid?"</p><p></p><p>"Drink a bowl every day..."</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were completely lost.</p><p></p><p>For a Yuan Dan cultivator, this was too wasteful.</p><p></p><p>He'll burst soon!</p><p></p><p>Some ancient gods thought darkly in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, friend, how much Linmu Immortal Liquid did you obtain?" the twin sister asked seriously, her eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>"Not much, just over ten thousand catties," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene had reddened eyes and rapid breathing.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't on the same side, if Qi Yuan didn't have their gratitude, if they weren't adhering to principles.</p><p></p><p>These treasures would be enough to make people kill and plunder.</p><p></p><p>"I won't waste words with you anymore, I need to go to the second tall tower. </p><p></p><p>My goal is to clear out all the towers before daybreak," Qi Yuan said, then left with his followers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the ancient gods on the scene exchanged complex glances. After looking at each other, they ultimately chose to follow.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and a new tall tower came into view.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the many ancient gods had not yet calmed down when they saw Qi Yuan and his group boldly enter the tower directly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think... it's a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to go in too, that's over ten thousand jin of Linmu Immortal Liquid!"</p><p></p><p>"It's dangerous inside the tower, do you want to go in and die?"</p><p></p><p>"Envious, jealous, uncomfortable!" said the man with a large mole between his eyebrows. </p><p></p><p>He also expressed the feelings of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>They had risked their lives entering the ancestral lands more than once, but the treasures they obtained were not even one ten-thousandth of what Qi Yuan got in one entry.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be jealous?</p><p></p><p>"If you're jealous, why don't you become a follower of the Origin Venerable like those mortals?" the twin sister teased.</p><p></p><p>In their previous exchanges, they had already shared their names.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the man with the mole between his eyebrows waved his sleeve and said, "The Linmu Immortal Liquid is precious, but I'm not such a spineless ancient god!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Linmu Immortal Liquid is precious, but it's just that. </p><p>Unless I could drink a mouthful every day, this old man might consider moving," an old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The first tower might have been luck, but the second won't have such good fortune. Everyone, stop discussing and watch carefully.</p><p>If any problems arise in the tower, we'll act immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The many ancient gods on the scene discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the man with the mole between his eyebrows suddenly asked, "If they come out like they did from the first tower, what... should we do?"</p><p></p><p>With these words, everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Once could be explained away as coincidence.</p><p>Twice... to still call it coincidence would be fooling oneself.</p><p></p><p>"If they come out of the second tower too, and if the treasures obtained are tempting, hehe, this old man's bones could soften a bit," said the Ancient God of Pines.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient God of Pines, aren't you the proudest pine? How come you're also thinking of becoming a follower of an ancient god?" the man with the mole between his eyebrows teased.</p><p></p><p>"Can't this old man have osteoporosis?" the Ancient God of Pines replied, "I'm a pine tree, osteoporosis is reasonable!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed among themselves, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Although they talked about becoming followers, most of it was joking, not truly considering it.</p><p></p><p>These treasures were precious indeed, but at most they would allow them to advance from Sky-Treading Step One to Step Two, or from Step Two to Step Three. It wasn't enough for them to give up their freedom and become followers of an unfamiliar ancient god.</p><p></p><p>Without these treasures, their realms would still improve with time.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to give up their freedom.</p><p></p><p>At this time, inside the tower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan led a group of people to the top floor of the tower again.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Tai Yin Thunder Pearl!" The divine official Shen Tu was still knowledgeable. Looking at the terrifying thunder pearls contained in a huge glass bottle in front, his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually the legendary Tai Yin Thunder Pearl that can destroy a city with one blast!"</p><p></p><p>The Tai Yin Thunder Pearl, tiny as it was.</p><p></p><p>Its power varied according to size.</p><p></p><p>The smallest, merely the size of a mung bean, when released, was equivalent to a full-force attack from a Yin God at Sky-Treading Step One.</p><p></p><p>The largest, as big as a fist, when released, was equivalent to a Great Venerable's attack, with boundless power.</p><p></p><p>In the glass bottle, there were countless Tai Yin Thunder Pearls the size of mung beans.</p><p></p><p>There were also twelve that were fist-sized.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were casually placed in a glass bottle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the villagers present couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>If these were to detonate.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present would have their souls blasted to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the legendary Tai Yin Thunder Pearls with curiosity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Tai Yin Thunder Pearl, also known as fish-blasting thunderbolt, popular among some children.]</p><p></p><p>"For blasting fish?" Qi Yuan's eyes showed curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The power of these Tai Yin Thunder Pearls was more formidable than the nuclear weapons of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were merely toys for children to blast fish.</p><p></p><p>The waters here were deep.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, he was just a player, why consider so much?</p><p></p><p>"This kid has quite the collecting habit, saving so many firecrackers. Too bad, they're mine now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>He, as an adult, had finally fulfilled his childhood self's wish - a whole bottle of firecrackers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held up the glass bottle, boasting: "See this? I have so many firecrackers!"</p><p></p><p>These firecrackers were also poppers, and could even blast fish.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, if he threw them in a river to blast fish and made a short video for Weiship, he'd definitely get praise from a bunch of guys.</p><p></p><p>"Look, this guy's firecrackers can blast fish!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan's boasting was lost on the villagers of Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the glass bottle, their legs trembled, fearing that Qi Yuan might accidentally detonate these Tai Yin Thunder Pearls.</p><p></p><p>With so many Tai Yin Thunder Pearls, if they exploded, the scene would be horrifying, unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"This haul is better than the first tower, let's go!" Qi Yuan waved his sleeve and led everyone to climb out the window again.</p><p></p><p>In this tower, the biggest gain was the Tai Yin Thunder Pearls.</p><p></p><p>As for other miscellaneous items, the other villagers took quite a few, treating them as treasures, but Qi Yuan didn't care for them.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the ancient gods waiting outside sensed something and widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"They're out!"</p><p></p><p>"They actually came out!"</p><p></p><p>"Could he really be a genius at calculating fate?"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>They felt their understanding had been severely trampled.</p><p></p><p>"You're still here?" Qi Yuan looked at the ancient gods with a surprised expression, "The AI of the NPCs set by the game officials needs improvement, they only know how to be spectators."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had played many games, and game NPCs generally had the following characteristics:</p><p></p><p>1. Often spaced out.</p><p>2. Roughly modeled.</p><p>3. New skins for festivals and holidays.</p><p>4. Related side quests optional, not affecting main storyline development.</p><p>5. Low hit points.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, these ancient gods before him were typical NPCs.</p><p></p><p>One fist-sized Tai Yin Thunder Pearl from him, and this group of NPCs would all die, without affecting Qi Yuan's main game storyline.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister seemed to notice something, her eyes widening, her whole body reacting like a startled cat: "Tai Yin Thunder Pearls, so many Tai Yin Thunder Pearls!"</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's glass bottle, there were over a thousand Tai Yin Thunder Pearls about the size of mung beans.</p><p></p><p>There were also more than a dozen fist-sized ones.</p><p></p><p>All these Tai Yin Thunder Pearls were contained in the glass bottle, swaying with Qi Yuan's hand movements, particularly frightening.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were also startled, noticing this, fear showing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the glass bottle and slowly said: "Don't be afraid everyone, these are for blasting fish."</p><p></p><p>He boasted about his firecrackers again.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene fell silent, only looking warily at those Tai Yin Thunder Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Among them, if the fist-sized Tai Yin Thunder Pearls were used, they wouldn't be able to escape even if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"Your luck... is truly good, to find such treasures!" How could these ancient gods not envy.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God of Pines' eyes glowed red.</p><p></p><p>If the Linmu Immortal Liquid only inspired envy, these Tai Yin Thunder Pearls aroused naked jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Venerable Qi Yuan, he couldn't help but say: "Friend, may this old man join you in entering the next tower?</p><p></p><p>This old man... is willing to serve you for ten years, no, become your follower for ten years!"</p><p></p><p>He already had osteoporosis, what's wrong with softening his bones a bit? Ten years' time in exchange for a treasure, absolutely worth it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit surprised: "Barely acceptable, alright."</p><p></p><p>Just one more person, for him, it posed no difficulty at all.</p><p></p><p>In ten years' time, he might have almost finished the game.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods looked at the Ancient God of Pines with contempt.</p><p></p><p>The man with the mole between his eyebrows then said: "Friend, I also want to follow the Ancient God of Pines' example and accompany you to the new tower. One tower, ten years as a follower!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Good."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods' previous hesitation and contempt dissipated.</p><p></p><p>They also hurried to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, I'll come too!"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, my sister and I also want to!"</p><p></p><p>Now that the precedent was set, the remaining ancient gods no longer cared about face.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen breaths, all eight ancient gods present chose to follow Qi Yuan into the tower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "Ten years per tower, there are over a hundred towers here, you'll have to work for me for over a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>PS: There will be more updates today, I'm working hard to adjust the timing. Within three days, I'll adjust to update at a specific time!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang couldn't refute, and looked at Qi Yuan saying: "Now... we should have enough demon blood, right? Why don't we retreat from Shu Demon Mountain first?"</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, far from enough," Qi Yuan shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"This little bit of demon blood, how could it be enough for me to defeat my great enemy. While there's plenty of demon blood here, I need to work hard!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang was completely speechless.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao also remained silent, finally asking: "Mr. Qi wants to conduct guerrilla warfare here to obtain demon blood?"</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wasn't planning guerrilla warfare, but to sweep through.</p><p></p><p>"This..." An Qiao hesitated before saying, "Why don't we leave first, otherwise staying here would only... hold you back, Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was telling the truth. </p><p></p><p>With her late Blood Qi Realm strength, she would be finished if she encountered a Jade Blood Realm great demon.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan was conducting guerrilla warfare, her staying here would likely affect his efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense," Qi Yuan nodded, then swept his gaze over the three people present, looking at Yang Guang, "Can you kill another hundred Jade Blood Realm great demons?"</p><p></p><p>O-one hundred?</p><p></p><p>The expression on Yang Guang's face was worse than crying.</p><p></p><p>A hundred Jade Blood Realm great demons would be enough to stuff him to death.</p><p></p><p>"I... can't kill that many."</p><p></p><p>"It seems your kidney deficiency is still too severe. Go back with An Qiao and the others," Qi Yuan said with a look of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Folks, who can understand? Hired a bodyguard who looks strong and sturdy, but turns out to have kidney deficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Yang Guang was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao looked at Qi Yuan and said seriously: "Mr. Qi, please prioritize your own safety. If it's not feasible, please leave as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an unexpectedly childish voice spoke up: "Mr. Qi, you're slaying demons in Shu Demon Mountain and also lack someone to take care of you. I, Huo Mushi, am willing to stay here and look after your meals and daily needs!"</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi's childish face was full of determination, as if he had also struggled with these words for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, An Qiao and Yang Guang looked at Huo Mushi with surprise, seemingly amazed by his courage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, however, appeared very calm: "I have high standards for meals, three dishes and one soup. Can you manage that?"</p><p></p><p>"..." Yang Guang.</p><p></p><p>"I can!" Huo Mushi's face showed excitement.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, An Qiao didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she wanted to remind Huo Mushi that staying in Shu Demon Mountain could very likely lead to death.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she also didn't understand why Qi Yuan would bring along a burden.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she really couldn't comprehend Qi Yuan's thought process.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, even Qi Yuan himself couldn't understand his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>A quarter hour later.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao and Yang Guang's figures dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In the cave, only Qi Yuan and Huo Mushi remained.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pitch-black night, if Huo Mushi said he wasn't afraid, that would be a lie.</p><p></p><p>However, he still tightly hugged his knife, guarding at the entrance of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Since the southern migration incident, the surrounding cities were in a miserable state.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the young and strong in Zhenyang City had died in battle.</p><p></p><p>Now, among those guarding the city walls, one-third were child soldiers, one-third were white-haired soldiers.</p><p></p><p>The elderly could no longer enjoy their twilight years, and children could no longer grow up.</p><p></p><p>This was the current situation in Zhenyang City.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to other cities that had fallen to demon territories, Zhenyang City was still considered lucky.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other places where groups of demons would swarm upon seeing a city, massacring and exterminating families, using human corpses to make dried rations.</p><p></p><p>And... the leader in Shu Demon Mountain seemed to have more "vision".</p><p></p><p>Rumors said that he listened to his military advisor's suggestion to besiege Zhenyang City, treating the people inside like livestock.</p><p></p><p>This way, when they wanted to eat meat, they would send demon soldiers to snatch people.</p><p></p><p>For them, the human meat rations in Zhenyang City were endless.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other demon territories that exhausted their resources.</p><p></p><p>When other demon territories lacked human population and human meat snacks, they would still capture people from Zhenyang City to sell to other demon territories, obtaining resources.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Zhenyang City was both a livestock farm and a treasury for Shu Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi hugged his knife, occasionally glancing into the cave.</p><p></p><p>From inside the cave came Qi Yuan's strange voice pretending to be a robot.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts crossed Huo Mushi's mind.</p><p></p><p>"If only I could also continuously consume demon blood... that would be great."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly there was a sound from the cave, and Qi Yuan got up and walked out. He looked at Huo Mushi with a regretful expression in his eyes: "It's a pity you don't know how to play the suona, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the times in Canglang Realm and Fanxin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he went on an expedition, there would always be a suona army following.</p><p></p><p>When the suona sounded, nothing would be left, not even bones.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Huo Mushi was stunned for a moment, then said, "The suona you mentioned, sir, I can play it! My grandfather was a funeral musician."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"It seems fate has led you to stay here."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Qi Yuan's hand, a suona appeared.</p><p></p><p>This suona, of course, wasn't carried by Qi Yuan, but was conjured by his magic.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a task. Whenever I'm killing demons, you stand beside me and play the suona... understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... alright!" Huo Mushi was stunned, then quickly nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>In Shu Demon Mountain, within the demon camp.</p><p></p><p>A purple-robed peacock woman's eyes carried a hint of anger: "Are they all useless? A single human... couldn't be captured in three days, and nearly a hundred demon soldiers died?"</p><p></p><p>The peacock's eyes were full of rage.</p><p></p><p>The death of nearly a hundred demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>For the demon camp, this was considered an extremely significant loss.</p><p></p><p>Each time they attacked Zhenyang City, the casualties were only a few demon soldiers, sometimes even zero.</p><p></p><p>As a result, a single human caused the death of nearly a hundred demon soldiers. This was definitely the biggest loss Shu Demon Mountain had ever suffered.</p><p></p><p>"That fellow's strength is formidable... probably only slightly weaker than the Twelve Generals!" A demon lowered his head, his eyes showing a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>In Shu Demon Mountain, there was one leader, three great generals, and twelve generals.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Generals were all late Jade Blood Realm, and not ordinary late Jade Blood Realm at that.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The peacock woman snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>She was a great general, a terrifying demon of the Demon Elite level.</p><p></p><p>"Within three days, I want to see his corpse!" The peacock woman spoke, her voice stern.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall man approached, dressed as a white-robed scholar, his voice cheerful.</p><p></p><p>"Why should the Great General be angry? Shu Demon Mountain's terrain is complex, it's indeed difficult to find a late Jade Blood Realm human cultivator."</p><p></p><p>This white-robed scholar was the military advisor of Shu Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him approach, a hint of affection appeared in the peacock's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But these demon soldiers are just lazy and afraid of death. Otherwise, wouldn't it be easy to capture him by sending a few demon generals?"</p><p></p><p>"That person's strength is ordinary. The difficulty lies in finding him. It's unwise to dispatch a large number of demon soldiers to search for one person." The military advisor spoke.</p><p></p><p>The peacock nodded.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the leader was refining a demon artifact.</p><p></p><p>Most of the demon soldiers needed to guard the demon camp to prevent any unexpected events.</p><p></p><p>"So, to resolve this matter... I have a method, but I need the Great General's agreement." The military advisor spoke, looking at the peacock's face with a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>"The military advisor is so clever, please tell me!" The peacock quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"Let me explain instead!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just then, a burly man exuding a strong aura walked over. </p><p></p><p>His face bore an eerie smile - he clearly wasn't someone to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>"A human?" Seeing the newcomer, a murderous look flashed in the peacock's eyes. If not for the strategist beside her, she likely would have struck to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"General, I have a magical treasure that can detect the exact location of humans within a hundred miles. I can lead the way and help your demon troops kill that person. However... I have one request!" </p><p></p><p>This burly man was Zhou Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What request?" the peacock asked.</p><p></p><p>"I want to meet the flower demon Manlo!" Zhou Yuan stated his purpose. "After killing Qi Yuan, I need an item from his body!"</p><p></p><p>That item was naturally the proof of the Genius Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As for the flower demon Manlo, she was key to him completing this mission.</p><p></p><p>The peacock's pupils contracted slightly. She glanced at the strategist, and seeing his expression unchanged, she smiled: "Alright, I can grant you this condition."</p><p></p><p>The strategist was quite concerned about the flower demon Manlo. </p><p></p><p>Since he didn't object to the other party wanting to meet Manlo, he clearly agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, after meeting Manlo, leaving again... that was out of the question. </p><p></p><p>This was the peacock's intention.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was thinking along similar lines.</p><p></p><p>After meeting Manlo and completing the mission, he could return to base, not fearing any tricks from these demons.</p><p></p><p>The strategist then looked at Zhou Yuan: "Thank you for your trouble."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan smiled: "Don't worry, with my treasure, he'll have nowhere to hide!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan felt some regret inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity Yang Guang hadn't come along.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this time he could have used the demons' power to not only kill Qi Yuan, but also slay Yang Guang.</p><p></p><p>As Zhou Yuan spoke, a compass appeared in his hand from his blood energy space.</p><p></p><p>He held the compass and sprinkled a drop of blood into it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a flash of light shone on the compass.</p><p></p><p>The peacock looked at this compass with greedy eyes. </p><p></p><p>If she obtained it, wouldn't that mean... no matter how deeply hidden, food could always be found?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan chanted quietly as the blood light on the compass grew brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhou Yuan stopped his actions. The blood light vanished and his face showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"There's someone half a mile from us!"</p><p></p><p>The compass indicated someone was 500 meters away.</p><p></p><p>"And... he's quickly heading this way... almost here!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The peacock and strategist also looked dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This was a demon camp outpost with 300 demon soldiers and a general guarding it.</p><p></p><p>How dare anyone approach - were they seeking death?</p><p></p><p>However, before they could react, a thunderous voice rang out in the valley:</p><p></p><p>"No need to trouble yourselves looking for me, I've come... directly.</p><p>Isn't that heartwarming? Aren't you moved? Since you're moved, why not... give me your demon blood essence?"</p><p></p><p>As the voice arrived, so did the person.</p><p></p><p>A hundred meters away, a man in blood-red robes stood calmly, holding a straight, slender wooden staff.</p><p></p><p>That wooden staff seemed to be dyed red with blood, looking demonic.</p><p></p><p>"It's you, Qi Yuan!" Zhou Yuan's expression was strange, not expecting Qi Yuan to appear here.</p><p></p><p>Shock and anger flashed in the peacock's eyes: "Who gave you the courage to come here?"</p><p></p><p>Though she said this, deep in her eyes was intense wariness.</p><p></p><p>When things are abnormal, there must be a trick.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Jingru gave it to me." Qi Yuan held the wooden staff, looking relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Who is she?" The peacock immediately scanned the surroundings, as if wanting to find that person.</p><p></p><p>The other demons also looked warily at their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"You have no sense of humor at all. Looks like I'll have to become one with you to reform you." As Qi Yuan spoke, he took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, making his blood-red robes flutter.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Huo Moshi's expression was excited yet shocked.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been following Qi Yuan, killing demons.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was like an invincible war god, killing gods if they blocked his path, killing Buddhas if they blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>The demons that the people of Zhenyang City viewed as poisonous scorpions were fragile in Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was directly going to slaughter an outpost. He didn't hesitate at all and followed right along.</p><p></p><p>"Mere Jade Blood, how dare you be so arrogant. Monkey General, capture him!" The peacock shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>A monkey demon behind her walked out unwillingly.</p><p></p><p>This monkey demon was short in stature, but extremely thick and powerful, with an agile form.</p><p></p><p>He was also one of the Twelve Demon Generals of Shu Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he would not fear going into battle.</p><p></p><p>But now, this Qi Yuan was taking the initiative to attack alone, which was very strange.</p><p></p><p>However, he still charged forward.</p><p></p><p>"Give me your life!"</p><p></p><p>With the monkey demon's angry roar, its body swelled at this moment, its skin color also changing, becoming green-faced with protruding fangs, truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Is this fate?" Qi Yuan held the wooden staff in his hand, looking at the monkey demon.</p><p></p><p>Then, his form flashed.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving Sword Drawing Technique! A powerful sword strike, no, or rather a staff strike, descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This staff strike was too fast, too sharp.</p><p></p><p>One strike, displaying the aura of a peerless good sword.</p><p></p><p>The powerful monkey demon had no ability to resist under this one strike.</p><p></p><p>One strike was enough to beat it to death.</p><p></p><p>One strike killed one of the Twelve Generals, and 500 drops of demon blood essence fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "Come at me all together, I'm in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou Yuan was shaken inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's strength was beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Originally he thought he could overpower Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed the gap between him and Qi Yuan was very large.</p><p></p><p>In fact, within ten moves, he would surely lose!</p><p></p><p>He felt fortunate inwardly that he hadn't gone to find Qi Yuan, but instead cooperated with the demons.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the peacock let out a sigh of relief: "So this is what you're relying on? The strength of the Jade Blood Perfection realm is indeed very strong, but unfortunately... not qualified to be arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attack was very terrifying, instantly killing the monkey demon.</p><p></p><p>But it also exposed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The peacock had seen through Qi Yuan's power level.</p><p></p><p>With the peacock's voice, the 300 demon soldiers of this outpost all came forward.</p><p></p><p>These demon soldiers had all kinds of strange appearances, wearing various leather armors and holding weapons. United together, they were quite intimidating.</p><p></p><p>If so many demon soldiers were led by the peacock to attack Zhenyang City,</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang City would not be able to defend at all.</p><p></p><p>Huo Moshi, not far away, also felt fear arise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan in his blood-red robes, however, showed no fear at all.</p><p></p><p>"Just 300 demon soldiers, small scene.</p><p>Play the music!"</p><p></p><p>In the previous few worlds, how many enemies had he killed?</p><p></p><p>Countless numbers.</p><p></p><p>He had even faced 3000 enemies of the same level simultaneously before.</p><p></p><p>What were a mere 300 demon soldiers? He grinned, the smile in his eyes extremely chilling.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, destroy everything in sight!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gripped the wooden staff, like a demon god, charging into the demon horde.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the high and mournful sound of a suona horn also rang out.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

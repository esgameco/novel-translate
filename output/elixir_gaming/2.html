        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the many new disciples towards Kang Fulu had changed.</p><p></p><p>Some were admiring, some were envious, and some found it amusing.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu continued, "The information about the five peaks of the Divine Light Sect has been circulated to all of you.</p><p></p><p>Now, those who have scored a B or C grade in the assessment can start choosing which peak to enter."</p><p></p><p>The assessment results were divided into three grades: A, B, and C.</p><p></p><p>A grade was the best, B was the second best, and C was the worst.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, those who scored a B or C would get to choose which peak to join first.</p><p></p><p>Those who scored a B would become formal disciples, while those who scored a C would become auxiliary disciples.</p><p></p><p>Only those who scored an A would have the qualifications to become true disciples!</p><p></p><p>As for those who scored an A, each of them could be considered a genius and would require special cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The senior disciples from these peaks had come here primarily to interact with and invite those few new disciples who had scored an A.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Kang is so impressive, joining the Five Light Peak would definitely be worthwhile!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll choose to enter the Myriad Law Peak, as the Dao and the Law are the key."</p><p></p><p>"My ideal is to become a pharmacist, so I'll join the Divine Medicinal Peak to save the Great Liang!"</p><p></p><p>"The Struggle Peak suits my family well."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Seven-Color Peak doesn't recruit ordinary or auxiliary disciples. Otherwise, I would definitely choose the Seven-Color Peak, as I heard there's only one senior brother there. If I join, I'll be the second disciple, and the resources would be abundant."</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for those who had scored a B or C to have all chosen the sects they wanted to join.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Five Light Peak had the most new disciples, while the Divine Medicinal Peak had the fewest, as not everyone could become a pharmacist. It would be a waste of decades if one had no achievements, so it's better to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had chosen their respective peaks, only the last seven who had scored an A remained - four men and three women.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow junior brothers, how shall we choose these seven?" Kang Fulu spoke, his gaze fixed on a young man in black, who was the one he most favored.</p><p></p><p>The others seemed to have thought of something but didn't speak up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the senior disciple of the Divine Medicinal Peak, Zhuge Miu, suddenly said, "Before coming here, the Sect Master instructed that this time, the Seven-Color Peak shall choose first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kang Fulu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had wanted to withhold this information, as it was not publicly known.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that Qi Yuan would choose the person he most favored.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Seven-Color Peak only had one disciple, making it extremely attractive to the others. Going to the other peaks would require competing with a group of disciples, while going to the Seven-Color Peak would only have one competitor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this sole competitor didn't seem very reliable.</p><p></p><p>The seven new disciples present all had somewhat fervent gazes towards Qi Yuan, as if their faces were saying, "Choose me."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, please make your selection." Kang Fulu spoke.</p><p></p><p>He had not told Qi Yuan the information about these seven, or else the ones with the highest aptitude would be chosen, and his Five Light Peak would suffer a great loss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the seven before him, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Since the Sect Master had instructed him to choose a disciple to increase the manpower of the Seven-Color Peak, he must select a suitable one.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the seven, and some information about them surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The first person he looked at was the young man in black, who was the genius that Kang Fulu cared about the most.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Kang Fulu's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>That young man in black possessed the rare Radiant Spirit Root. This type of root was most suitable for the Five Light Peak, and if he cultivated the Five Light Sacred Law, he could achieve great accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the young man in black, and a piece of information entered his mind:</p><p></p><p>"This is an ordinary young man, but he has joined the Divine Light Sect for an undisclosed purpose."</p><p></p><p>Undisclosed purpose?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly eliminated him.</p><p></p><p>As for this information, should he tell the other members of the Divine Light Sect? No!</p><p></p><p>After all, three months ago, he had exposed that the Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect was a spy from the Demonic Desire Gate, and he had only been confined for a few days.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was largely due to the fact that he had a powerful Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, the Shenguang Sect was full of problems.</p><p></p><p>This world was full of problems everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Since everything was a problem, then the problems were not that big.</p><p></p><p>Go with the flow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then looked at the young girl wearing a pale yellow long dress, who looked innocent and pure.</p><p></p><p>The young girl looked at Qi Yuan, blinking her eyes, which seemed to have a bewitching intent.</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary young girl, but her physique is special, and she has been targeted by the old demon Black Chicken, who sees her as a cauldron, which may bring trouble to the Shenguang Sect.]</p><p></p><p>Exclude.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then looked at the remaining few people.</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary young man, he has two and a half years of cultivation, but now his cultivation is completely gone, in the depths of his consciousness, there is a remnant soul, before coming to the Shenguang Sect, he had broken off his engagement with his fianc√©e.]</p><p></p><p>The protagonist template person?</p><p></p><p>Stay away! In the movies and TV shows Qi Yuan watched before, he should stay away from the protagonist.</p><p></p><p>The general supporting character is good for the protagonist, this supporting character will soon be killed.</p><p></p><p>This kind of person cannot be a friend.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the remaining few people again.</p><p></p><p>A man with three legs?</p><p></p><p>Exclude!</p><p></p><p>A man with a woman's heart?</p><p></p><p>The Canglan Realm hasn't updated the version yet, exclude!</p><p></p><p>Mentally ill? Too dangerous, exclude!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan excluded the remaining three people.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the last young girl.</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary young girl, she is a bit mysterious, and seems to have some thoughts about the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>A rival?</p><p></p><p>Need to eliminate her! The young girl Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan, lowering her head, her gaze cautious.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that Qi Yuan seemed to be rejecting her, her gaze became more determined, and she deeply saluted Qi Yuan: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, please give me a chance to enter the Seven-Color Peak!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was not from the Great Merchant Nation, but came from the distant East.</p><p></p><p>She came from a noble and prestigious family.</p><p></p><p>In the past, she would not have paid much attention to a sect like the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>But a month ago, her bloodline awakened, and she had a chance to wield her clan's precious treasure, the Qiankun Mirror.</p><p></p><p>In the Qiankun Mirror, she caught a glimpse of a scene like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>There was slaughter everywhere, and countless cultivators fell.</p><p></p><p>Her father died in battle, and her mother's blood was spilled in the palace.</p><p></p><p>The continent was broken, and the seas were overturned.</p><p></p><p>Only the small Shenguang Sect seemed to have a powerful person who was able to escape unharmed.</p><p></p><p>The Qiankun Mirror was a precious treasure, and what she saw was a vision of the future.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, a divine warning.</p><p></p><p>So, she came to the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the Shenguang Sect, she had already investigated this sect.</p><p></p><p>This sect was quite ordinary, the only thing that was not ordinary was the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak, whose origins were mysterious, and whose cultivation was stronger than expected.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the future she saw in the Qiankun Mirror, she could not tell everyone in any way.</p><p></p><p>Once it was leaked, everyone would forget this memory, including her.</p><p></p><p>So, at the moment, she could be said to be burdened with a huge responsibility.</p><p></p><p>She did not want to see her loved ones perish, nor did she want to see the collapse of the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Color Peak, she must enter!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the girl's determined gaze and yawned.</p><p></p><p>The young girl Jiang Lingsu immediately said, "To join the Seven-Color Peak, I am willing to be a servant, to help the senior brother solve difficulties."</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the Shenguang Sect, she had investigated the disciples of the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>That Peak Master was extremely mysterious, like a divine dragon that was seen but not fully revealed.</p><p></p><p>As for that disciple, he had some talent, but was also a cultivator of the Zhi (Foolish) Sect.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Zhi Sect often had some problems with their personality.</p><p></p><p>And due to their "foolishness", they neglected other aspects, and lacked someone to take care of them or help them with things.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu calmly and slowly said, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Jiang Lingsu let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of all living beings, how could a little self-sacrifice matter?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

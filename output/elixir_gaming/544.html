        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Insect Girl Cai Diesin thought of this guess, flew towards the hot spring, closely following the surface of the water, like a dragonfly.</p><p></p><p>In the Shen Lingxuan, she had searched many places, but this hot spring had not been thoroughly searched.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Lingxuan also hurriedly put on her clothes and dived into the bottom of the hot spring, listening carefully.</p><p></p><p>"The sound of felling trees, the sound of flames..."</p><p></p><p>The faint sounds came, and she tried to discern them.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it was too far away, and she could not hear it clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Break it for me!" </p><p></p><p>The Insect Girl Cai Diesin called out softly, and the special power waves struck the weakest part of the hot spring, but the bottom of the hot spring remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... we cannot open this." Cai Diesin's eyes showed a disappointed expression, "The rumor is true, unless there is a special opportunity, even if we encounter the Shen Wood Abyss, we cannot enter."</p><p></p><p>"What is in the Shen Wood Abyss?" Shen Lingxuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Cai Diesin's gaze was complex: "I don't know either... I only know that there are many opportunities there, and that is also the safest place in the Qingshan Realm."</p><p></p><p>Now, Cai Diesin brought Shen Lingxuan to hide in the Shen Wood Abyss, but she was quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>Almost the entire Chaotic Star Domain is under the control of the Radiant Sect.</p><p></p><p>The powerhouses of the Radiant Sect are not patrolling the realms, searching for the Mandate Bearers.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, she and Shen Lingxuan could hide safely in the Shen Wood Abyss and remain in seclusion for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But... the news that the Divine Arrival had slaughtered the Seven Gods in Qiyuan has spread, and it may attract the attention of the Radiant Sect.</p><p></p><p>If the Radiant Sect sends powerhouses to descend upon the Qingshan Realm to search for Qiyuan, they might just find the two of them.</p><p></p><p>With their current strength, to confront the Radiant Sect would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, far beyond their abilities.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, finding the Shen Wood Abyss is very necessary.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Sunset Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang was eating buns, his belly round and full.</p><p></p><p>Jiwu Run was wearing a long green dress, looking at Chen Kang's full belly with a helpless expression: "Aren't you worried that your young master might have encountered some accident?"</p><p></p><p>When they had agreed to meet at the Shen Wood Token, Jiwu Run had still chosen to come.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is a divine being descended from the heavens, you can't even choke him to death." Chen Kang answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Jiwu Run, who was eating the buns, suddenly felt that the buns were no longer delicious.</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps were heard, and a man in black clothes appeared.</p><p></p><p>On his forehead, there was a pattern that seemed to be engraved with a character, appearing particularly ominous.</p><p></p><p>His face always wore a smile, but this smile gave people a dangerous feeling.</p><p></p><p>This person was the staff member of the Thorny Blood, the NPC star commentator Xianling Yingjun.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his expression was somewhat grave: "There is a troublesome matter, the Radiant Sect's Fengti Dazun has descended upon the Qingshan Realm, probably in search of the Mandate Bearer."</p><p></p><p>"Fengti Dazun?" Jiwu Run's face immediately showed a fearful expression.</p><p></p><p>To Jiwu Run, whether it was the Thorny Blood or the Radiant Sect, they were not good people.</p><p></p><p>"He is not an ordinary Dazun, his archetype is the top three in the Tread the Heavens Five Steps combat power ranking in the current era of the Radiant Universe!" Mentioning this, Xianling Yingjun's face showed deep dread.</p><p></p><p>He was at the Tread the Heavens Three Steps, and among the Tread the Heavens Three Steps, he was considered an extremely powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>But... the Radiant Universe is so vast, and just in the Void Garden's Tread the Heavens Three Steps, in terms of combat power ranking, he would be ranked after the top three hundred.</p><p></p><p>The top three... what kind of existence is that? Probably one breath could kill him.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is an invincible existence, a mere Fengti, one sword to slay him!" Chen Kang was not at all concerned, he ate the buns, and perhaps felt that his boasting was too exaggerated, so he added, "If one sword is not enough, then two swords."</p><p></p><p>Xianling Yingjun smiled wryly: "Fengti is different from the opponents he has faced before."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Arrival is strong, unrivaled in the Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>It can be considered the strongest in the Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>This scope is limited to one world.</p><p></p><p>But Fengti, that is on the scale of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the Divine Arrival and Fengti is like comparing a village school and a galactic university.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he doesn't come here... if Brother Qiyuan is really in the Shen Wood Abyss... perhaps he can avoid Fengti." Xianling Yingjun said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I built a ladder, so I can see the exit more clearly, awakening my heart's eye.</p><p></p><p>When the ladder is fully completed, do you want to climb the ladder and leave?" Qiyuan continued to refine the ladder.</p><p></p><p>Now this ladder has been refined for a large part.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman shook her head, she looked up at the tiny specks of light in the sky, and her eyes saw only emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"This exit cannot accommodate me." The blind woman shook her head.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to go out, but this exit would not work.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, are you very tall?" Qiyuan looked at the blind woman and wanted to touch her, to see if she was very tall.</p><p></p><p>But based on her breathing and heartbeat, Qiyuan felt that although the blind woman had a tall figure, she was not exactly a giant.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman did not respond, and then asked, "Has the refinement of the artifact arts been perfected? Has the heart's eye awakened? Has the divine artifact been refined?"</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive questions.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan smiled awkwardly: "No."</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to talk to the blind woman either.</p><p></p><p>Where did she attack people like this.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Eight Doors Artifact Refinement is too difficult, even now I've only mastered it."</p><p></p><p>"...A bit slow." The blind woman hesitated for a while before making the comment.</p><p></p><p>She put down the fruits and went to the place where she often swung on the swing.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan set up the repaired ladder, towering high, nearly tens of zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>He carefully climbed up, finally reaching the top of the ladder, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>He began to look at the tiny specks of light again.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly closer, he could see them more clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Why... do I hear the sound of water?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this exit leads to a river?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the heart's eye is so difficult to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>"If I had a progress bar, it would be better."</p><p></p><p>"You took a look at the front, proficiency increased by one."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan talked nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"The ladder is indeed useful, it feels closer... and I understand more."</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, Qiyuan stood on the ladder, blindly surveying that tiny speck of light.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, Qiyuan had been in the Shen Wood Abyss for almost a year.</p><p></p><p>The ladder has finally reached the top.</p><p></p><p>After installing the ladder, Qiyuan climbed up eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"I see this exit is large and round, yet I still can't comprehend it?"</p><p></p><p>After focusing on one thing for so long, Qiyuan felt... his awakening of the heart's eye might just be in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, when he touches that speck of light, he will awaken the heart's eye.</p><p></p><p>With the heart's eye to assist him, the speed of his artifact refinement will probably increase.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the blind artifact refiner's wish can be realized, playing the dual roles of the Divine Arrival and the blind artifact refiner.</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts, Qiyuan had already climbed to the top of the ladder.</p><p></p><p>The wind was a bit strong, and the ladder was swaying.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the speck of light, holding his breath, looking at it intently.</p><p></p><p>The wind stopped, his mind calmed.</p><p></p><p>"So-called heart's eye, is just another way of observing things."</p><p></p><p>"The eyes can deceive, but the heart cannot."</p><p></p><p>"No, my eyes do not deceive me, nor does my heart."</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Qiyuan felt a sense of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"The heart is the continuation of the eyes..."</p><p></p><p>A profound feeling permeated Qiyuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt the world become clear, no longer just black and red.</p><p></p><p>"Still a blind person... but my perception... has increased greatly."</p><p></p><p>This enhancement of perception, for Qiyuan, could be considered a small golden finger.</p><p></p><p>His perception was already very strong, and now it has been further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He continued to look at the tiny dot of light.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a puzzled expression flashed across his eyes: "This light spot... it's so big and round."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see something big and round.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were still blind, and he could only sense a certain outline.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" </p><p></p><p>A delicate shout came, and a long skirt wrapped around Shen Lingxuan's graceful figure. Her eyes were filled with vigilance.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Caizhi also fluttered her wings and flew over, looking vigilantly at the hot spring.</p><p></p><p>"This voice sounds familiar..." Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>As if separated by a world, the voice was a bit blurred.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's memory was excellent, and he quickly realized who it was: "Shen Lingxuan... is that you?"</p><p></p><p>This person was Qi Yuan's wife, the henpecked son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>She was also the final step for him to complete his role as the henpecked son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." Shen Lingxuan's expression was icy cold, but her eyes revealed a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>Next to her, the Insect Maiden Caizhi was surprised: "What voice? I didn't hear anything."</p><p></p><p>She naturally didn't know that Qi Yuan's communication with Shen Lingxuan was using his special ability.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's ears could hear certain sounds, and he could respond using this ability. Previously, he had communicated with the Soundless Voice using this power.</p><p></p><p>Now, since he could hear Shen Lingxuan's voice, he quickly responded with his superpower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Insect Maiden Caizhi couldn't hear it.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's eyes revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect such a loud voice to be inaudible to the Insect Maiden Caizhi.</p><p></p><p>With a puzzled look, she replied, "Is that you?"</p><p></p><p>This familiar voice made her recall the young master she had a fleeting encounter with in the past. Back then, that young master had slain a flower-picking bandit, leaving a deep impression on her.</p><p></p><p>He... actually knew her? And how was he here, under the Divine Wood Abyss?</p><p></p><p>"You recognized me?" Qi Yuan was a bit delighted. "Lingxuan, I've been looking for you for a long time, but I couldn't find you. I never expected to meet you here."</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Caizhi was completely bewildered, watching Shen Lingxuan converse with the air.</p><p></p><p>She had some doubts, wondering if Shen Lingxuan had developed a mental disorder. She quietly hovered in the air.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's face showed an astonished expression: "You've been looking for me? Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>She sensed a hint of conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>That young master had actually been searching for her all this time.</p><p></p><p>"I am your husband... Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Shen Lingxuan's graceful figure trembled, and an expression of disbelief appeared on her beautiful, icy face, causing her to lose her composure. She looked stunning.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just a henpecked son-in-law?</p><p></p><p>Zhifeng had said he was a weakling without any fighting prowess.</p><p></p><p>"I went to the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss to look for you recently, but I couldn't find you anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Oh, by the way, that Fifth Demon who wanted to kidnap you and make you a maid, I casually slew him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Lingxuan's expression of disbelief deepened.</p><p></p><p>Then she heard Qi Yuan continue, "Don't worry about the Rakshasa Kingdom's retaliation. I went to the Rakshasa Kingdom recently and killed that Fifth Extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Wait... are you the Divine Qi Yuan?" Even though Shen Lingxuan was as cold as a jade sculpture, her inner turmoil was like a raging storm.</p><p></p><p>That person who had single-handedly slain seven gods, the Divine Qi Yuan, was actually her husband, that henpecked son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>This was simply astonishing.</p><p></p><p>It was as if, on Earth, a woman suddenly discovered that her henpecked husband was the strongest of the post-80s generation.</p><p></p><p>Next to her, the Insect Maiden Caizhi was very anxious, like an ant on a hot pan, or a short girl jumping up and down trying to see over the crowd because her height blocked her view.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan looked at the Insect Maiden Caizhi, her voice as icy as ever, but a tremor could be detected in her words.</p><p></p><p>"The one speaking to me... is my husband, the Divine Qi Yuan." Saying the word "husband," a blush crept up her snow-white face, making her even more charming and alluring.</p><p></p><p>"Wait... your husband is him? Where is he?" The Insect Maiden Caizhi was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>There were so many coincidences in this world? "He's down there." Shen Lingxuan looked at the hot spring, her blush deepening, making her even more enchantingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Because she recalled the time when he had first met her and said... he wanted to ride her.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she had only felt that he was crazy.</p><p></p><p>Now, thinking about it again, her heart fluttered, and the image of him riding her surfaced in her mind. The icy goddess-like her hurriedly pushed away such thoughts, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>In her heart, she also inexplicably felt a sense of gratitude towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had actually ventured into the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss and slain the Fifth Extraordinary to rescue her.</p><p></p><p>"Fate is truly unfathomable. I'll try to come up and find you now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, and headed towards the tiny dot of light.</p><p></p><p>Excruciating pain assaulted him, as if knives were slicing into his flesh.</p><p></p><p>"It hurts a bit." Qi Yuan commented.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was extremely painful, as if he was being torn apart by a thousand blades, or even more.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary divine beings would likely faint from such agony if they faced it in their mortal forms.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was already accustomed to pain, and this was nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan focused on the hot spring below, her eyes filled with curiosity, anticipation, and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>She had never seen her "husband," and she was anxious and unsure about how to face Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What if he told her again that he wanted to ride her... how should she respond?</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, her expression suddenly turned grave.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Caizhi also suddenly looked up at the sky, her face filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure had descended upon the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Clad in white robes, carrying a sword on his back, he stood in the void, miles away.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the Insect Maiden Caizhi still felt an overwhelming, undefeatable presence from him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a single sword strike from him could shatter the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"It's someone from the Radiant Sect!" The Insect Maiden Caizhi's face turned pale. "The Grand Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan also sensed the surging sword intent.</p><p></p><p>She recognized that person as the one who had slain her in the past with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she had only felt that he was on the divine level.</p><p></p><p>Now, with her increased strength and knowledge, she realized he was not just any ordinary Grand Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>This was a Grand Ancestor of the highest order!</p><p></p><p>Fengti stood in the void, his eyes descending upon the Divine Wood Abyss, his gaze shining with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"You thought you could hide from me in the Divine Wood Abyss, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Fengti's eyes flashed with a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>The sword on his back trembled, and the heavens and earth shook in response.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sword was unsheathed, like a soaring dragon.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful sword strike, with a fierce edge, sliced through everything.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the protective barrier over the Divine Wood Abyss was shattered.</p><p></p><p>This barrier could withstand the attacks of divine-level experts, and even ordinary Grand Ancestors could not break it. Yet, it was destroyed in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fengti's gaze fell upon Shen Lingxuan and the Insect Maiden Caizhi, his eyes filled with mockery: "You little insects, who can only hide and cower. This time, I wonder if you'll survive another life."</p><p></p><p>He had recognized Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ice-cold Shen Lingxuan felt an overwhelming pressure, and her body trembled involuntarily. She looked towards the hot spring and couldn't help but say:</p><p></p><p>"Don't come out, it's dangerous outside!"</p><p></p><p>Hiding in the Divine Wood Abyss was the only true safety.</p><p></p><p>Her husband Qi Yuan was strong, but the person facing them... was a Grand Ancestor, and not just any ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>If her husband came out, he would surely die.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, she was somewhat worried about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

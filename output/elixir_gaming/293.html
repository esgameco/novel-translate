        <h1>Chapter 293</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he was truly an ordinary restarter, perhaps... after killing Wang Wei and tasting the sweetness, he might... go hunt other restarters.</p><p></p><p>"This tiny bit of luck is less useful than a mental illness certificate. I'd have to be seriously ill to go hunt other restarters."</p><p></p><p>As for other restarters, in their previous lives they were mostly ordinary people, and didn't have Qi Yuan's powerful insight.</p><p></p><p>The other restarters didn't know that hunting and killing other restarters could steal their luck.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Wang Wei's corpse with a disappointed expression: "What a loss, not even a bit of experience points. I thought you were something special."</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, Qi Yuan walked towards the body of the black-clothed sniper and picked up the communicator.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the spacious room and the piles of various medicinal herbs and sea monsters, feeling a different kind of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Beside him,狂欢 seemed to still be in shock.</p><p></p><p>The events of today were truly beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in these two hours, all kinds of messages had been coming in continuously.</p><p></p><p>He now knew who had tried to ambush and kill Qi Yuan on the road - it was Black Crystal Earl Zhao Renji.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Renji was from an old noble family. Thirty years ago in the Qin-Cui War, Zhao Renji's father had earned military merits.</p><p></p><p>Now the Zhao family was headed by Zhao Renji.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyue City, the Zhao family was the undisputed hegemon.</p><p></p><p>Even 狂欢, a hereditary viscount, had to yield to the Black Crystal Earl in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... should we leave Tianyue first?" 狂欢 asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>This was Black Crystal Earl's territory. If the Earl was determined to keep Qi Yuan here, he had no way to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>The few mercenaries under his command were no match for the Black Crystal Earl.</p><p></p><p>Once he brought Qi Yuan back to Xinyang, he was confident he could ensure Qi Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I leave?" Qi Yuan shook his head, "When I killed those people, no one saw me, and I was especially careful. </p><p></p><p>With no witnesses and no physical evidence, how would the police find me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, 狂欢 was silent for a moment, then said: "They don't need evidence to arrest people."</p><p></p><p>Evidence was only discussed between parties of equal status.</p><p></p><p>Great nobles didn't need evidence against lesser nobles, just as lesser nobles didn't need evidence against commoners.</p><p></p><p>"No evidence? Surely this counts for something?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out his all-purpose protective talisman.</p><p></p><p>With this thing, he was very confident.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Qi Yuan, he felt the man was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Crystal Earl can not only mobilize a squad of gene soldiers, but also use thermal weapons," 狂欢 still said.</p><p></p><p>A gene soldier squad goes without saying - with Qin Yuan country's national strength, a full gene squad could even sweep through an infantry battalion of some weaker countries.</p><p></p><p>As for thermal weapons, those were something no human power could resist.</p><p></p><p>Under thermal weapons, all life was equal.</p><p></p><p>Even immortal cultivators, what of it?</p><p></p><p>Some weapons on Gongxing, modeled after those on Canxing, experts have said could slay gods.</p><p></p><p>"Those weapons are indeed troublesome," Qi Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>Just like today's sniper rifle - in his current physical state, one shot would certainly kill him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those thermal weapons.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he would find them very tricky to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"So Mr. Qi is willing to come with me?" 狂欢's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>This way his relationship with Qi Yuan would become even closer.</p><p></p><p>"Thermal weapons are troublesome, but people... are very simple.</p><p></p><p>My enemies aren't weapons, just some people."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>Gongxing's technology was still not advanced enough.</p><p></p><p>There were too few protective measures against immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" 狂欢 was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"You're lucky today. If you go to the Zhao family tonight, you might even get to eat a feast," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>The thermal weapons controlled by the Zhao family could indeed cause trouble for Qi Yuan now.</p><p></p><p>But the Zhao family... they were just ordinary people after all.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had gene soldiers as guards, so what?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had played so many games, he'd even killed two Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>His methods were unfathomable. Even Yang Shen might not be able to guard against them, let alone mere mortals.</p><p></p><p>When he got the communicator, Qi Yuan had made a phone call to the person in charge on the other side.</p><p></p><p>The one who answered was Zhao Renji.</p><p></p><p>On the phone, Qi Yuan demanded that Zhao Renji commit suicide to atone for his crimes and apologize.</p><p></p><p>Naturally Zhao Renji would not, and showed no signs of remorse at all.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Qi Yuan showed no mercy either.</p><p></p><p>In myths and legends, hearing a demon's voice would lead to being bewitched by the demon and falling into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's true form was stronger than demons.</p><p></p><p>His methods also surpassed those of demons in myths and legends.</p><p></p><p>With the communicator as a medium, Qi Yuan could easily mix illusion-type spells or other techniques into his voice, making Zhao Renji fall for it effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Renji would not guard against this at all, and didn't take Qi Yuan's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, he probably wouldn't imagine that someone could really kill through a phone call.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Zhao family manor.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Renji's expression was excited, his eyes carrying a trace of killing intent. He looked at Zhao Shiqi and said slowly: "He's just a lowborn commoner. I can kill him if I want."</p><p></p><p>"He's not a lowborn commoner, he's the orphan of a martyr!" Zhao Shiqi's voice was quite displeased.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi had always worked in the military and loved his soldiers like sons.</p><p></p><p>He refuted Zhao Renji's words without even thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, just a bunch of muddy-legged peasants. If I want to elevate them, they're glorious. If I don't want to, they're just a bunch of potential thugs, unstable elements." Zhao Renji looked at Zhao Shiqi, his voice suddenly turning cold, "This time... did you interfere?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Renji didn't take Qi Yuan seriously.</p><p></p><p>He was just an ordinary person after all.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about most was whether Zhao Shiqi had interfered behind the scenes in Qi Yuan breaking through the trap.</p><p></p><p>He had always been wary of this brother.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Zhao Shiqi looked at Zhao Renji, feeling indignant. He could naturally see through his elder brother's thoughts, and felt even more disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Even at this point, all his elder brother thought about was fighting for power.</p><p></p><p>"I wish I had participated!" Zhao Shiqi looked straight into his elder brother's eyes, "Since he survived this time, elder brother... I don't want to see you make a move against him again!"</p><p></p><p>A mocking look appeared in Zhao Renji's eyes: "I don't want to move against him, but he won't let me off.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he called to threaten me, demanding I commit suicide to atone!</p><p></p><p>Hehe... this is the first time I've encountered such a gutsy young man.</p><p></p><p>If you want this matter resolved, it's very simple. You... personally bring him here to apologize to me.</p><p></p><p>If his attitude is sincere, I might spare his life!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi's heart tightened, his feelings of disappointment and anger reaching their peak in that moment.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head without speaking.</p><p></p><p>In his ears, Zhao Renji's cold voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"Nobles are never wrong. Even if they are wrong, they can't admit it. They must even persist in their wrongdoing. Once we open that door, won't those lowborn commoners think we're easy to bully? They'll push their luck. In the long run, who would still fear us?"</p><p></p><p>For Zhao Renji, the face and authority of the nobility were most important.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this, one human life was truly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Although the plan to kill Qi Yuan had many strange aspects, Zhao Renji didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>In this Tianyue City, he had complete control.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi looked at his elder brother, silent.</p><p></p><p>The words his elder brother spoke, their father had said many times.</p><p></p><p>"Bring Qi Yuan's head, and this matter will be settled. Otherwise... the subsidies for martyrs' children in Tianyue City... tsk tsk..." Zhao Renji directly threatened.</p><p></p><p>Long-term superiority and strong control over the lower classes made him fearless and extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, you're not dead yet?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an ethereal voice sounded in Zhao Renji's ear.</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly shouted loudly, his pupils bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi was stunned, not knowing what was wrong with his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>The others outside the room also looked at each other in confusion, unsure of what was happening with Zhao Renji.</p><p></p><p>"Count, what's wrong?" someone asked.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as the words were spoken, the questioner's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>They saw the Count suddenly pull out a gun, his eyes filled with terror, his hand seemingly out of control, and even blood tears flowing from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This scene frightened everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi was also dumbfounded, having no idea what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"I... suicide... no... save... apologize!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Renji, as if out of control, shot himself in the head before anyone present could react.</p><p></p><p>"Count!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, call a doctor!"</p><p></p><p>The room was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi was also stunned, the scene unfolding before him was too bizarre.</p><p></p><p>His elder brother... suddenly drew a gun and committed suicide, and his body seemed to be out of his control.</p><p></p><p>A chilling feeling arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something, and a horrifying realization dawned on him.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>In a room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had just finished another set of Mingwu Resonance Fist.</p><p></p><p>His clothes were soaked with sweat, his spirit invigorated, white steam rising from his body.</p><p></p><p>"The blood of the mutant sea monster has indeed greatly enhanced my progress."</p><p></p><p>After devouring the mutant sea monster's blood, Qi Yuan's efficiency in practicing Mingwu Resonance Fist improved, and his progress increased.</p><p></p><p>The mutant sea monster's blood seemed to have the effect of enhancing martial arts talent and potential.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the other ordinary sea monsters don't seem to have these effects."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had also processed the other sea monsters, extracting the "essence blood" from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after consuming it, Qi Yuan found almost no improvement.</p><p></p><p>"This should be due to the different origins of the bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The blood of these ordinary sea monsters might be suitable for other martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't been practicing martial arts for long, Qi Yuan had already vaguely guessed that the martial arts of this world followed the path of bloodline martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only the information he could observe so far, not the whole picture.</p><p></p><p>"But I have the Devouring Prototype, drinking more blood... is a good thing, maybe I'll fuse and create some kind of bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, the No Food Holy Mother had ultimately transferred the terrifying constitution of the Devouring Prototype to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He could use these blood for his own benefit by devouring them.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go to the martial arts hall to exchange for the later techniques."</p><p></p><p>After devouring the mutant sea monster's blood, the progress of Mingwu Resonance Fist was very fast.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had broken through to the third level in just one day.</p><p></p><p>To obtain the subsequent techniques, he needed to go to the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the martial arts hall was very relaxed and didn't need to check cultivation levels. As long as you paid, you could get the subsequent techniques.</p><p></p><p>There were many people like Qi Yuan who bought subsequent techniques just a few days after joining the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>There were many rich people in this world.</p><p></p><p>As long as they didn't start businesses or gamble, they couldn't spend all their money.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan changed his clothes and went out.</p><p></p><p>The sun was bright in the sky today, and the taxi was driving fast.</p><p></p><p>"Has something big happened? There are several times more drones in the sky than before," the taxi driver couldn't help but complain, looking at the drones in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to have more drones, the security in Tianyu is too poor. Yesterday, someone was even shot dead on the street!"</p><p></p><p>"What? Where did it happen? How come I don't know about it!" The taxi driver became interested.</p><p></p><p>"It was on Lanxi Avenue."</p><p></p><p>"It must be those damn privileged bastards again, only they have the guts to kill people on the street!" The taxi driver said angrily, seemingly dissatisfied with the state of the world.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the taxi stopped in front of the Mingwu Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan got out of the car, a robot approached, speaking in an electronic voice.</p><p></p><p>"Kongjing Smart Taxi, smart driving, electronic is safer, welcome to use our service."</p><p></p><p>The robot said this while handing a flyer to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan could take it, the taxi driver who had gotten out to buy water kicked the robot hard.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, even robots are competing with me for work?"</p><p></p><p>The taxi driver cursed and left after kicking the robot.</p><p></p><p>Kongjing Smart Taxi was a new ride-hailing company in Qinyuan Country.</p><p></p><p>This type of ride-hailing not only had an autonomous driving system but also used robots as drivers, which met with opposition from many drivers.</p><p></p><p>Of course... the opposition was useless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have much feeling about this.</p><p></p><p>He entered the Mingwu Martial Arts Hall, found the second senior brother, explained his intention, spent a large sum of money, and exchanged for the subsequent nine levels of the "Mingwu Resonance Fist" technique.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't realize you had such capability.</p><p></p><p>I've given you all twelve levels of the 'Mingwu Resonance Fist'.</p><p></p><p>If you can practice it to the perfect level, you might be able to enter the top thirty if you participate in the martial arts competition." The second senior brother couldn't help but pick his left nostril, his attitude towards Qi Yuan becoming more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>After all, if before Qi Yuan was just dabbling, now, having spent so much money, he was considered one of their own.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, this would have made him a true disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts competition qualifiers seem to be starting soon. When is the registration? When our martial arts hall registers, can you add my name?" Qi Yuan stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Registration for the martial arts competition was done in the name of martial arts halls and schools.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts competition was about to begin, and Qi Yuan wanted to win the championship and become the Human Dao Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"There are only three months left, you want to participate? With what you've learned now, you'll probably be eliminated in the first round, barely making it into the city's top 100," the second senior brother blinked, looking at Qi Yuan's handsome face, and continued, "Hmm... you're going to gain experience, right? That's fine, we'll add your name to the registration this time. Remember to fill out the application form later."</p><p></p><p>The second senior brother naturally didn't know that Qi Yuan was aiming for the championship.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, of course, didn't bother to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, second senior brother, I'm going to train now."</p><p></p><p>Leaving the second senior brother, Qi Yuan came to the training room again.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao, with her high ponytail, immediately stood up to greet Qi Yuan when she saw him: "I've had my nose slightly adjusted again, can you tell it's plastic surgery now?"</p><p></p><p>Last time, she was angered when Qi Yuan pointed out that her nose wasn't original, and she went to make a scene at the beauty salon.</p><p></p><p>The doctor gave her a free adjustment and modification, and she felt better than last time, so she asked Qi Yuan like this when she met him.</p><p></p><p>"Well... don't ask me this question, I have very good eyesight," Qi Yuan casually replied.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was immediately speechless: "Damn it, I don't want this nose anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Other trainees around who heard Wang Shiqiao's voice couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't pay any more attention and began to focus on performing the Mingwu Resonance Fist.</p><p></p><p>An hour passed as he practiced.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the second senior brother came over with an application form for the martial arts competition for Qi Yuan to fill out.</p><p></p><p>Under the astonished gazes of Wang Shiqiao and others, Qi Yuan completed the application form.</p><p></p><p>"You've got some guts, kid, participating in the martial arts competition in your first year. Aren't you afraid of getting your bones broken?" Wang Shiqiao stretched, her short and tight training suit closely hugging her body, revealing her curves, the cleavage very firm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "Don't stretch your armpits at me, the sweat smell is too strong."</p><p></p><p>"I've shaved everything here clean, where's the smell!</p><p></p><p>You... no wonder you're so handsome but don't have a girlfriend!" Wang Shiqiao couldn't help but complain.</p><p></p><p>Who talks like this?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't say anything, but expressed himself through action, changing to another position to continue training.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao stomped her feet in anger: "Just spend your life with your right hand then!"</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

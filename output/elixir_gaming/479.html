        <h1>Chapter 479</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ghostly spirit banners shrouded the area, confining the battlefield between the two.</p><p></p><p>The banner master's face was filled with confidence.</p><p></p><p>Without the Dati (Great Principle) moment, the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor was nothing more than a big fat pig to him.</p><p></p><p>He struck down, the immortal spiritual power surging, a single strike could destroy the world.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The energy dissipated, the space shattered and overlapped again.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying attack would have even an ordinary Dati greatly moved.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of a sword rang out, a blood-red long sword flew out, emanating various brilliant lights and auras.</p><p></p><p>A particularly evil and dreadful aura permeated.</p><p></p><p>The two auras collided, like two great villains clashing.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The strike ended, the victory was not unexpected by the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>The banner master had the upper hand, the Palace Emissor of the Human Emperor was slightly inferior.</p><p></p><p>Bai Long Yuanmaster narrowed his eyes: "If the banner master still has the assistance of the Taihuang Palace, perhaps he could really seal the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, this Venerable One is also very curious, why did he come out when he could hide in the strange land?" The Heavenly Lord Shenluotian was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, he didn't expect the Taishi Symbol either."</p><p></p><p>"It seems he should not be one of us, the six great sacred lands of the Heavenly Realm."</p><p></p><p>These Dati discussed and speculated.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the battle continued.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it had been a hundred rounds of combat.</p><p></p><p>In these hundred rounds, the banner master had always had the upper hand, but could not hurt the blood-colored figure at all.</p><p></p><p>The banner master narrowed his eyes, his expression surprised: "This strength, this Venerable One must use his true power!"</p><p></p><p>After the exploration, the banner master no longer hid his skills, but attacked with full force.</p><p></p><p>He had explored and found that the opponent indeed did not have the Dati moment.</p><p></p><p>However, if he followed the normal path, he could only injure the opponent.</p><p></p><p>And... it would take a long time to fight.</p><p></p><p>So, he had to start using the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner stood at the Ghost Pass, out of his control, and was seized by the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner was in his hands, naturally without such worries.</p><p></p><p>After all, to a certain extent, he and the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner were one.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, and this Venerable One can give you an honorable death!"</p><p></p><p>With the banner master's voice, the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner trembled, covering the sky and spanning the heavens.</p><p></p><p>A chilling coldness pierced the heart, like an icy block on the back, and a howling icy wind soon followed, revealing ghostly shadows.</p><p></p><p>In the dim light, the ghostly shadows flickered, stretching out their hands, clawing and snarling, like vengeful ghosts seeking retribution.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were either bloodthirsty or dull and numb, looking at Qi Yuan, as if looking at an enemy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt the overwhelming killing intent and hatred sweeping over him.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, under the banner master's refinement, the souls in the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner had long regarded the person the banner master wanted to deal with as the killer of them, their loved ones, or their clan.</p><p></p><p>Under the empowerment of the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, the soul soldiers and the banner master's attacks came immediately.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately sensed a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of sensing the danger of death.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had no hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"You have the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, I have... the Human Emperor's Banner!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a loud roar, and a tattered, blood-stained Human Emperor's Banner appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The banner surface, the width of which was unknown, was covered with intricate patterns, deep and ancient.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the gloomy and terrifying Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, the Human Emperor's Banner, though tattered, emanated a light that seemed like the righteousness of the world, bright as the sea.</p><p></p><p>Under this radiant light, Qi Yuan's blood-red armor became more sinister, and his entire being exuded a boundless sacredness.</p><p></p><p>The majestic blood-red figure, with endless radiance behind him, holding a blood-red long sword, seemed like a heavenly deity, or a demonic god from hell.</p><p></p><p>"Ghosts and goblins, be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>With a sword strike, the light of the Human Emperor's Palace cleansed the evil.</p><p></p><p>The countless ghost souls in the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner let out a pitiful howl.</p><p></p><p>The Human Emperor's Banner, born for the light, represents justice and the great cause of the human race. How could it be contended with the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner that refines the souls of the dead?</p><p></p><p>"The Human Emperor's Banner?"</p><p></p><p>"An offensive Zaohua Yibao! How does he have it?"</p><p></p><p>"Why have I never heard of this offensive Zaohua Yibao?"</p><p></p><p>The observing Yangsheng Celestial Lords were shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm, even if they did not know the full number of Zaohua Yibao, the offensive Zaohua Yibao were definitely well-known.</p><p></p><p>Offensive Zaohua Yibao, inherently different from ordinary Zaohua Yibao, were forged by the Dati with countless years of effort and heart's blood.</p><p></p><p>The banner master now stared wide-eyed, his face showing disbelief: "How can there really be a Human Emperor's Banner?"</p><p></p><p>Whenever the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor came to the Ghost Pass, he claimed that all the banners in the world belonged to the Human Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner of the Ghost Overlord, naturally the banner master did not believe it belonged to the Human Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner was refined by the previous banner master, and he had perfected it. How could it be related to the Human Emperor's Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Whatever injustice in the world, this banner will sweep it all away!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Holding the sword in his left hand, the sword emitting killing intent; holding the banner in his right hand, the heart filled with light.</p><p></p><p>The sinister blood-red sword and the radiant and sacred banner complemented each other.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The sword struck, the banner swept!</p><p></p><p>The banner master's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>His Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, facing the Human Emperor's Banner, was like a mouse encountering a cat, and not a pet cat, but a stray cat.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner trembled, and countless souls cried out in fear, as if facing a natural enemy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the banner master became a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>The opponent did not have the Dati moment, and with his Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, he should be able to crush the opponent.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect the opponent to also have an offensive Zaohua Yibao.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't break through the protective barrier of the offensive Zaohua Yibao, let alone injure the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, he felt that he was being suppressed by heaven.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, holding the Human Emperor's Banner, his voice resounding like a righteous messenger: "Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, you have suffered enough.</p><p></p><p>Your origins are evil, but it was not your original mistake."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the surface of the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner suddenly paused, as if something else was happening.</p><p></p><p>The banner master's expression suddenly tightened: "What did you do?"</p><p></p><p>This was the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner he had refined, compatible with his heart and blood.</p><p></p><p>"I am rectifying the cultivation world's atmosphere, I am reforming with righteousness!" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world's atmosphere was too bad.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could something like the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner be born?</p><p></p><p>He continued to look at the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner.</p><p></p><p>"Banner, I know you have done many wrong things, but the mistake is not yours, but this world.</p><p></p><p>Are you willing to return to the embrace of the Human Emperor's Banner, and follow me... to change this world?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra was activated, and the bewitching voice, under the empowerment of the Human Emperor's Banner, was transmitted to the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner.</p><p></p><p>The banner master's expression changed greatly, and he felt fear.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw with his own eyes that the souls in the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner had momentarily paused, as if they were truly moved.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" The banner master was enraged, directly attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner in his hand was not as obedient as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>In this fight, he was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"See, the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner in your hand does not want to harm me.</p><p></p><p>Banner master... do you know you are wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure was like the sea, standing firm and unshakable.</p><p></p><p>"Wrong your grandmother!" The banner master was furious, attacking frantically.</p><p></p><p>Now he was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>When the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor brought out the Human Emperor's Banner, he knew he could not kill the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Now it was no longer the time to kill, but something strange was happening to his Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, his Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner... might even change hands.</p><p></p><p>He now deeply regretted it, his face anxious, at this moment, his face was very thick: "Everyone, come and help me, I have a Zaohua Yibao to give away!"</p><p></p><p>The banner master could only seek help from the other Dati.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was doomed to be just a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Those Dati simply watched for entertainment, without caring about him.</p><p></p><p>Only the three Dati who had followed the Ghost Overlord joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even with the addition of three Dati, they were still at a disadvantage under the Human Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the banner master's expression was filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>He saw that one-fifth of his Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner had been torn apart and was flowing towards the Human Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were about to pop out.</p><p></p><p>This was his offensive Zaohua Yibao, his lifeline.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a howl, but it had no effect.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Dati also saw this and their expressions became less calm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner is really a part of the Human Emperor's Banner?"</p><p></p><p>"This Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor is so cunning in his calculations, planning so much, just to force the banner master to use the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner to fight him, and then devour the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner!"</p><p></p><p>"If the banner master continues like this... the offensive Zaohua Yibao on his body may... be completely gone."</p><p></p><p>Some Dati spoke up, their gazes fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>If the banner master lost his Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner, he would fall from the second echelon of Dati to the third echelon.</p><p></p><p>As they were discussing, the banner master's Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner let out another ripping sound.</p><p></p><p>More and more of the banner surface flowed into the Human Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is not a battle between the aggressive Zaohua Yibao (Extraordinary Treasures), this is clearly... a prodigal son's return! 'When one knows one's mistakes and is willing to correct them, there is nothing greater.' </p><p></p><p>Pavilion Master, look at the Wanghui Moxiang Fan (Myriad Ghost Soul Banner) in your hand, they all have such keen insight, repenting their past misdeeds.</p><p></p><p>Can you emulate them, commit suicide and enter my Renjuang Fan (Human Emperor Banner)? I'll leave you a position as a Soul Envoy."</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Pavilion Master truly regretted it now. </p><p></p><p>If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have bothered with the Taixi Symbol. </p><p></p><p>Now, bound by the Taixi Symbol, he was completely unable to escape, only able to fight against the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace, without even a chance to flee.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch helplessly as the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner was torn apart bit by bit, merging into the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>The battle raged on, no one knew for how long. </p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master's Myriad Ghost Soul Banner was reduced to less than one-seventh of its original quantity, his appearance was utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a brilliant light flashed. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Pavilion Master's face lit up with joy: "True Element Venerable, help me, remove the Taixi Symbol!"</p><p></p><p>The one who appeared was the projection of the True Element Venerable.</p><p></p><p>All the Grand Perfected Ones present tensed up at the sight of the True Element Venerable. </p><p></p><p>This was the Grand Perfected One of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in the True Element Venerable's eyes, but he still intervened: "Disperse!"</p><p></p><p>The Taixi Symbol had limited effect. </p><p></p><p>Even if he hadn't come, it would have dispersed soon.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the Taixi Symbol instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master's face showed the look of one who has escaped death.</p><p></p><p>Although the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner was shattered, as long as there was still a remnant in his hand, he was still a Grand Perfected One of the second echelon.</p><p></p><p>Even in the second echelon, he was among the bottom ranks.</p><p></p><p>He frantically fled, distancing himself from Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>But who would have known that at this moment, two beams of light suddenly blocked his path.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master's face twisted with anger: "Who is it?!"</p><p></p><p>Because, as he was fleeing, two Grand Perfected Ones had secretly intervened, intercepting him for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But it was this moment that allowed the Great Oblivion Heart Sutra and the Human Emperor Banner of Qiyuan to catch up.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Myriad Ghost Soul Banner on the Pavilion Master's body was also taken by Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The Pavilion Master was in utter agony.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the time for sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Because, having lost the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, with the strength of the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace, although they could not kill him, they could still seal him.</p><p></p><p>Filled with resentment, he fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>Voices of some of the attending Grand Perfected Ones expressing a hint of joy could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, it wasn't me who intervened."</p><p>"Not me!"</p><p>"Nor me!"</p><p></p><p>Many of the Grand Perfected Ones attending the banquet were glad to see the Pavilion Master fall from the second echelon.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the battle came to an end with the Pavilion Master fleeing in disgrace, his banner lost.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Grand Perfected Ones took a deep breath and glanced at Qiyuan, their expressions complex.</p><p></p><p>Some even considered whether they should try to ally with the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>After all, since the last Lingyao Shedding, such an event had never occurred in the Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Ghost Soul Banner of the Pavilion Master had actually been completely stripped away.</p><p></p><p>This was an offensive Zaohua Yibao (Extraordinary Treasure)!</p><p></p><p>There were not many of these in the Six Realms!</p><p></p><p>However, they also knew that this was likely an isolated incident.</p><p></p><p>They even suspected that the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner of the Pavilion Master might have actually originated from the Human Emperor Banner, otherwise why would it be so targeted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qiyuan looked at the True Element Venerable with a deep gaze: "Assisting a criminal to escape, you are guilty!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, all the Grand Perfected Ones present were startled.</p><p></p><p>This Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace actually dared to speak to the Yang God of the Taihuang Palace in this manner.</p><p></p><p>How bold!</p><p></p><p>The Bai Long Abyss Master's gaze fluctuated as he pondered something.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Perfected Ones of the Zhi Lian Hall seemed quite delighted.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the lazy Endless Abyss Abyss Master spoke: "Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace, do you know who he is? He is the Third Palace Master of the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, when the Son of Heaven commits a crime, he is no different from the common people. He is the Venerable, and today he has committed a crime, so he is also guilty!"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>With these words, the gazes of the Grand Perfected Ones present also changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a few who had originally intended to secretly ally with the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace also extinguished that idea.</p><p></p><p>The projection of the True Element Venerable looked at Qiyuan, his gaze calm: "This Venerable would like to see how you will punish the crime of my Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"I will make bold threats!" Qiyuan stretched lazily, his demeanor also becoming more languid, "When my divine cultivation is complete, I will personally go to your Taihuang Palace to demand justice!"</p><p></p><p>Normally, in TV dramas, the defeated villain would make bold threats.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan was not a villain, nor did he discriminate against villains, he was just borrowing the words of the villain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this Venerable will wait for you in the Taihuang Palace!" The True Element Venerable's face revealed a disdainful smile, and his figure disappeared at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The other Grand Perfected Ones also felt that this Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace had a bit of a thick face.</p><p></p><p>To actually dare to go to the Taihuang Palace to demand justice.</p><p></p><p>That was the Taihuang Palace!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the True Element Venerable disappear, the other Grand Perfected Ones gave Qiyuan a deep look and gradually dispersed.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the later incident of the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace challenging the True Element Venerable, they might have chosen to stay and try to befriend this Palace Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Even the Grand Perfected One from the Zhi Lian Hall seemed to want to avoid any association, and left as well.</p><p></p><p>The once lively place was left with only Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, appearing outside a dilapidated town.</p><p></p><p>On the stairs, there were many skeletons.</p><p></p><p>These skeletons were ordinary mortals casually killed by the Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these ragged commoners still maintained the appearance they had before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan closed his eyes, and the scenes of the past instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>These ordinary mortal civilians, before dying, were carrying hundreds of pounds of goods up the stairs to deliver to the Taoist temple on the mountain for their livelihood.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I'm a kind-hearted person, always leaving seeds behind."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>After his combat power reached the level of a Grand Perfected One, Qiyuan's courage also grew.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he saw cultivators, he would secretly leave the imprint of the Underworld on them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was limited to low-level cultivators, for Celestial Venerables and above, it would be easy for him to kill them, and the imprint would also be detected and removed.</p><p></p><p>When passing through here, he had casually left the Underworld's imprint on the bodies of the living beings around.</p><p></p><p>This meant that as long as the resources in the Underworld were sufficient, these people could be revived in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you all jobs with room and board."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan spoke, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>The skeletons lying on the ground suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a slightly surprised voice sounded: "Fellow Daoist, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator shrouded in a gray robe appeared, making it impossible to see their face, and their voice was indistinguishable in gender.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan glanced at the other party.</p><p></p><p>[Bai Long Abyss Master, a Grand Perfected One, bearing the bloodline of the White Dragon.]</p><p></p><p>"I'm helping them find jobs," Qiyuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he didn't want to get too close to the Bai Long Abyss Master.</p><p></p><p>What if this person took off their clothes, the eye mask fell, and they glared at him - what if he got pregnant?</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Fellow Daoist to be so kind-hearted," the Bai Long Abyss Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>She naturally thought that Qiyuan was burying these people.</p><p></p><p>As for reviving them?</p><p></p><p>That didn't need to be considered.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were revived, it wouldn't be the same person who originally died.</p><p></p><p>She felt somewhat sentimental.</p><p></p><p>After all, she too had once had such a kind-hearted side.</p><p></p><p>But after cultivating for countless millennia, she seemed to have seen through everything, becoming more and more numb and uninterested in everything.</p><p></p><p>"What are you here for?" Qiyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an aged voice sounded: "This old one wishes to invite the Honored One to join our Zhi Lian Hall, to become a guest disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Perfected One of the Zhi Lian Hall appeared, unlike the Bai Long Abyss Master, he did not disguise himself.</p><p></p><p>As a member of the Zhi Lian Hall, compared to the Bai Long Abyss Master, he had more courage and a stronger foundation.</p><p></p><p>"No, thank you," Qiyuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Perfected One of the Zhi Lian Hall paused momentarily, then said, "Fellow Daoist has enmity with the Taihuang Palace, cooperating with our Zhi Lian Hall to jointly confront the Taihuang Palace would be a win-win situation!"</p><p></p><p>Even knowing that there was another Grand Perfected One nearby, the Zhi Lian Hall's Grand Perfected One did not hide or hesitate, boldly speaking.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan shook his head: "I'm too lazy to join your Zhi Lian Hall. If I were to discover that your Zhi Lian Hall also has misdeeds, and my heart is moved by compassion, how could I uphold the integrity of my Human Emperor Banner?"</p><p></p><p>These words startled the Bai Long Abyss Master, and the Grand Perfected One of the Zhi Lian Hall was also taken aback.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the distinction between good and evil in this world was not clear, but rather a struggle for interests.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace daring to make bold threats against the Taihuang Palace was because the two sides might have had enmity long ago.</p><p></p><p>As for the crimes, evils, and such that the Palace Envoy had mentioned earlier, he had not taken them seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>They were just rhetoric, or perhaps a pretext.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist's words... could it be true?" The Zhi Lian Hall's Grand Perfected One asked hesitantly after a moment of consideration.</p><p></p><p>"I rarely speak lies, so of course it's true," Qiyuan shrugged. "With the Human Emperor Banner in my hand, purifying the cultivation world has always been my wish. We... are not on the same path."</p><p></p><p>This Grand Perfected One looked at Qiyuan's sincere words, finally sighing deeply: "I was too presumptuous, alas."</p><p></p><p>The Bai Long Abyss Master looked at Qiyuan, his gaze fluctuating, not knowing what he was pondering.</p><p></p><p>At their level, there was no need to lie in such words.</p><p></p><p>So... the Palace Envoy of the Human Emperor Palace... really thought this way?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>But she knew she couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Vicious ambition!" She looked at Sima Ting, her eyes filled with anger, "Colluding with the Northern Han Court, his crime must be punished!"</p><p></p><p>The Northern Han Court and the Southern Qian Kingdom were sworn enemies.</p><p></p><p>Every autumn harvest season, the Northern Han's iron cavalry would invade the borders of the Southern Qian Kingdom, plundering the fields.</p><p></p><p>Between the two countries, there was a deep-rooted enmity.</p><p></p><p>"This is the gap between us." Sima Ting raised his head and said, "Between countries, there is only interest, while warriors speak of grudges and resentment.</p><p></p><p>Lady Qin, I advise you to be self-aware, hand over the keys to the treasury, or else..."</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting threatened.</p><p></p><p>Lady Qin, as the late Grand General's legitimate wife, held the keys to the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>And these keys could open the Heavenly Seal Lock and retrieve the Heavenly Seal Jade Seal.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to usurp the throne, and he had to get the Heavenly Seal Jade Seal to legitimize his claim and inherit the destiny of the Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"You can forget it."</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting looked at Lady Qin and said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lady Qin was the widow of that Grand General.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Heavenly Mandate Supreme General on the frontlines and that Grand General were once like brothers.</p><p></p><p>If he killed Lady Qin, things would become troublesome.</p><p></p><p>But Lady Qin was the Empress's trusted confidante, so he had to act and severely injure her.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Empress would be without her claws and fangs.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Qin, take care of yourself." Sima Ting said, "In three days, the Crown Prince of Southern Feng will arrive, and in ten days, it will be the time of the battle. How will you cope with it?"</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting left with a sweep of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>In Lady Qin's eyes, anger flashed, then turned into a melancholy expression.</p><p></p><p>She was now severely injured, even to the point of damaging her foundation, and it was almost impossible to heal in a short time.</p><p></p><p>That upcoming battle could only end in defeat.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, there are a total of seven books here, all of which record the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land." The palace maid presented the books and placed them on the jade throne.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jinli nodded and picked up a book to read carefully.</p><p></p><p>Today, after hearing Qi Yuan mention the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, she became interested in it.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lady Qin was severely injured.</p><p></p><p>And in ten days, the Crown Prince of Southern Feng will come to the Southern Qian capital, and his court scholar will battle with Lady Qin.</p><p></p><p>If she loses, the Southern Qian Kingdom will be disgraced, and her... fate will also be in danger.</p><p></p><p>Because, ten years ago, when Jinli's father the Emperor passed away and she had not yet ascended the throne, the situation in the Southern Qian Kingdom was turbulent, and the Southern Feng Kingdom had deployed 200,000 troops on the border, with the intention of invading the Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Prime Minister Sima Ting went to the border to represent the Southern Qian Kingdom and reach an agreement with the Southern Feng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This also laid a trap for Jinli.</p><p></p><p>If this battle is lost, she will have to marry the Crown Prince of Southern Feng.</p><p></p><p>How could she, the Empress of this generation, marry the crown prince of another country?</p><p></p><p>This was the trap Sima Ting had laid.</p><p></p><p>Because, ten years ago, before she had ascended the throne, Sima Ting's agreement with Southern Feng did not have too many problems.</p><p></p><p>It was merely exchanging a princess to maintain peace on the border.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Lady Qin severely injured, to win this battle, she must first heal her injuries before having a chance to fight.</p><p></p><p>And among the four forbidden lands, there are many spiritual treasures, perhaps there are medicinal herbs that can heal.</p><p></p><p>After just flipping through a few books, she saw that the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land had several rare spiritual medicines, with various effects, such as healing injuries and prolonging life.</p><p></p><p>"Nine-Petal Brocade Rose?" As she read through the ancient texts, Jinli's gaze was moved.</p><p></p><p>The ancient records stated that the Nine-Petal Brocade Rose was a spiritual medicine in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual medicine, with its nine-petal flowers and nine different fragrances, was known as the Imperial Medicine.</p><p></p><p>"If Lady Qin can obtain this spiritual medicine, not only will her injuries be completely healed, but she may even have the chance to break through to the Imperial Realm!"</p><p></p><p>This information came from the hands of a top-tier Imperial Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>That top-tier Imperial Cultivator, his schemes...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By a chance encounter, he entered the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he saw the spiritual herbs and wanted to pick them, but ended up being attacked by the demonic kings inside.</p><p></p><p>His fists were no match for their four hands, so he escaped the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, but never had the chance to enter it again.</p><p></p><p>"So, there should be many demonic kings within the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?</p><p>As for the Demon Emperor... unknown," Jinli pondered.</p><p></p><p>If there was no Demon Emperor, and only the perception of the demonic kings, perhaps they could sneak in and secretly pick the spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are no records above on how to actually enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>The four great forbidden lands, each has its own difficulties.</p><p>And the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, the most difficult part is how to enter.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be, as Qiyuan said, that we just need to carry a ladder and go in?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Qiyuan, the corners of Jinli's mouth curved into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is impossible.</p><p>This matter is too absurd, or perhaps... illogical.</p><p></p><p>However, Qiyuan had no need to lie to her.</p><p>Towards Qiyuan, she trusted him deeply in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, she would not have had the palace maids collect information about the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>In the next few volumes of books, Jinli read them very carefully.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no news about how to enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she saw a record and couldn't help but read it aloud: "Xuanyuan has a monster, its form like a fox tail, like a brush, mad and deranged, most fond of night-time ambushes."</p><p></p><p>This record was also written by that supreme emperor.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was stunned.</p><p>Qiyuan's previous words flashed before her eyes.</p><p>The deranged brush, especially treacherous, likes to turn into a brush at night and attack people without any sense of honor.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the same ferocious beast?" Many thoughts flashed through Jinli's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme emperor who left this information was once a great devotee of the Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p>This information has always been kept in the library, and has never been circulated.</p><p>Qiyuan... how did he know?</p><p>Could it be that Qiyuan is a member of my royal family?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli's heart was very unsettled at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p>"He knows the ferocious beast is called the Deranged Brush! Could it be... that Qiyuan has really been to the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli took out the Linglong Jade Tablet and quickly sent a message.</p><p>"Qiyuan, have you really been to the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land? The part about carrying a ladder to go in is not a lie, right?</p><p>I have an urgent matter... and need to go in there."</p><p></p><p>Although Qiyuan is a bit eccentric and often says nonsensical things, she was afraid that if he saw her message, he would just casually reply, so she mentioned going herself.</p><p>She was betting her life on this.</p><p>Qiyuan... would not joke around this time.</p><p></p><p>However, after she sent the message, Qiyuan did not reply.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Yiguan Forbidden Land is too far away, otherwise..." Jinli sighed, then her gaze became determined.</p><p></p><p>"Summon someone, I will leave the palace tomorrow."</p><p>Time was running out.</p><p>She decided that she would leave the palace the next day and go to the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p>She had no other choice.</p><p>Staying in the capital was just waiting to die.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, she continued to order, "The Qilin Guard, go to the Yiguan Forbidden Land and see if there are any unusual occurrences there."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan said he had been to the Yiguan Forbidden Land.</p><p>If Qiyuan was a powerful expert, then the Yiguan Forbidden Land must have experienced some upheaval.</p><p>She sent the Qilin Guard to investigate the news from the Yiguan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Yiguan Forbidden Land,</p><p>Qiyuan carried a golden great sword, looking at the strange creatures in front of him with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

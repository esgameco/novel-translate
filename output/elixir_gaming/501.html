        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Bring the arrest warrant, capture the criminal Guang Yao Hui Fang Shisan!" </p><p></p><p>The Jining Prefecture had a yamen (local government office), but inside the yamen, the court's words were not as effective as the words of the Tianzhong sect.</p><p></p><p>In fact, to become the prefect of Fengshan Prefecture, one had to get the approval of the Tianzhong sect.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family was already an influential family in Fengshan Prefecture, not to mention that Shen Lingxuan was a direct disciple of the Tianzhong sect.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's face had to be given.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" The other constables nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Shen Baiting's eyes revealed a smug expression: "The performance today was not bad. With a little more effort, I can go to Yeshanlake... Within the Shen family, my status will rise greatly!"</p><p></p><p>Today, the main and branch lines of the Shen family had gathered many young people, from whom those with spiritual talent would be selected to go to Yeshanlake and participate in the Spiritual Cultivator Convention.</p><p></p><p>"But my talent... is still a bit inferior to White Tiger and the others... I need to use some underhanded means." Shen Baiting thought about sending gifts.</p><p></p><p>His talent was good, but not the best among them. Especially Shen Baitiger, he was far behind.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I felt guilty about sending gifts to squeeze out Shen Baitiger's quota, but... since he told that son-in-law about what I said to him, I can do it without any scruples!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting muttered to himself, just like a prostitute who still wants to put up a signboard.</p><p></p><p>"And that son-in-law..." Shen Baiting's eyes were filled with deep murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The other party was so aggressive that it made him extremely angry.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think I don't dare to bully you?"</p><p></p><p>"If it's late at night and there's no one around, I'll definitely let you see that I'm not someone you can easily provoke!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting said in a low voice in the room.</p><p></p><p>He was very confident, he had many ways to discipline Qi Yuan, and afterwards he could still appear as the victim.</p><p></p><p>"What, you've awakened and want to bully me?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure listening by the wall suddenly pushed open the door, half his body entering Shen Baiting's room, with a joyful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the visitor, Shen Baiting's eyes widened, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Qi... Qi Yuan, how are you here!" Shen Baiting's face changed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan was like a mouse, suddenly appearing.</p><p></p><p>"I'm waiting for you to bully me!" Qi Yuan showed a smug expression on his face, "I saw you say... you want to bully me, so I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>To complete the acting task, he was very determined.</p><p></p><p>"You misheard, I didn't say that!" Shen Baiting hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>He was really speechless.</p><p></p><p>Randomly muttering to himself in the middle of the night, and it could be overheard by someone.</p><p></p><p>"I heard it, you were talking to yourself. Let me give you one piece of advice, talking to yourself is a bad habit. I usually just think it in my mind," Qi Yuan said, adding another sentence.</p><p></p><p>In fact, thinking in the mind is also not safe, because he can hear the voice in the mind.</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting looked at Qi Yuan, glanced outside, and didn't see any other figures. His gaze flickered: "Did you come alone?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I came alone. Didn't you just say that at night, in a secluded place... you can bully me?" Qi Yuan was very expectant.</p><p></p><p>No need to pour water for the mother-in-law, the darkness will reveal the flowers, so he can be bullied.</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting twitched, speechless in his heart, seeing that there was no one around, his courage also grew.</p><p></p><p>"Are you really crazy or just pretending to be crazy?" Shen Baiting's gaze was icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not crazy!" Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting looked at Qi Yuan, almost certain in his heart that this person really had a problem with his brain.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he come to his courtyard and ask him to bully him? And most importantly, he came alone, not afraid of death at all.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really want me to bully you?" Shen Baiting said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He didn't sense the presence of anyone else.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Shen Baiting felt that Qi Yuan had a screw loose.</p><p></p><p>He was even more jealous. How could this kind of waste be able to marry Shen Lingxuan, a heavenly beauty!</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's go outside and talk!" Shen Baiting made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>His courtyard was a separate small courtyard, relatively secluded.</p><p></p><p>The conversation just now between him and Qi Yuan must not have been heard by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan followed Shen Baiting to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting's courtyard was very large, and there was even a small pond.</p><p></p><p>The pond had green lotus leaves, tender lotus pods covering the surface, and dense duckweed floating on the water, which could be considered good pig feed.</p><p></p><p>Shen Baiting stood by the edge of the pond, many thoughts flashing through his mind, and a pitying expression appeared on his face: "Qi Yuan... you shouldn't have offended me."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't offend you."</p><p></p><p>"Even before you went crazy, you couldn't beat me, let alone now that you're crazy..." Shen Baiting looked down on him.</p><p></p><p>He had already planned how to discipline Qi Yuan and then disguise himself as the victim.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and suddenly pinched Qi Yuan's waist.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you want me to bully you?"</p><p></p><p>This pinch, he secretly used a hidden force, a mysterious power that even a high-level military commander could not detect.</p><p></p><p>He didn't hold back when he attacked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This hidden force first caused pain, and then would secretly lurk and damage Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he was in the branch line, his cousin's talent was extremely outstanding, making Shen Baiting extremely jealous.</p><p></p><p>That cousin had always taken care of him and even shared the resources awarded by the main line with him.</p><p></p><p>His jealousy grew crazily, and under the guise of sparring, he secretly injected this mysterious hidden force into his cousin's body. </p><p></p><p>About two years later, his cousin's body deteriorated, and he eventually lost the ability to cultivate, and even limped.</p><p></p><p>His cousin never suspected Shen Baiting, and even gave all his accumulated resources to Shen Baiting, hoping that Shen Baiting could lead the branch line to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Is this enough?" </p><p></p><p>He pinched Qi Yuan's waist fiercely, with a smug smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Then, his body suddenly fell backwards, falling into the pond.</p><p></p><p>He had already thought of the reason.</p><p></p><p>The son-in-law Qi Yuan came to trouble him at night, and he didn't dare to offend him, so he let Qi Yuan beat and scold him, and finally pushed him into the pond.</p><p></p><p>Now, he only needed to shout loudly and call the others over.</p><p></p><p>The perfect victim was achieved.</p><p></p><p>However, after falling into the pond, when he was about to open his mouth to shout, he found that he could not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>By the pond, the handsome-looking man looked at him with an expression of speechlessness: "Your bullying is too pathetic, just this pinch... no strength at all."</p><p></p><p>The son-in-law Qi Yuan stood with his hands on his hips, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that not only are you a green tea, but you are also a member of the Guangyao Hui. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that you people in the Guangyao Hui are all good at palace intrigues?"</p><p></p><p>The hidden force that Shen Baiting used, Qi Yuan's eyes saw it as related to the Guangyao Hui, a special light and dark force of the Guangyao Hui.</p><p></p><p>In the pond, Shen Baiting's eyes widened, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Are you... pretending to be crazy?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to speak, but the words came out as faint as a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"Where am I crazy? Have you ever seen a handsome crazy person like me?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lazily stretched.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who...are you!" Shen Baiting's voice was hoarse, as if his throat had been cut.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that the person in front of him was not Qi Yuan, and he wanted to beg for mercy, to bring up the Glory Association.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan did not give him a chance to speak.</p><p></p><p>"At least I've gained something today - you really did bully me!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the constantly struggling Shen Baiting in the pond, his expression calm. "Do you think that just because everyone is on your side, you are in the right?"</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, but here, strength is supreme."</p><p></p><p>"Slandering the Purple Palace in the Refining Qi realm? That's courting death!"</p><p></p><p>"And by the way, I'm playing the madman, so killing people isn't against the law!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>He came quietly and left quietly, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>In the pond, Shen Baiting struggled constantly, but it was completely useless, and he couldn't even make a splash.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, he slowly sank to the bottom of the pond.</p><p></p><p>"30%, I actually obtained the Heart of Forging."</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan's performance as the useless son-in-law reached 30%, he gained a new ability - the Heart of Forging.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had heard of the Heart of Forging before. In this world, to become a Forgemaster, one needed to have a talent for it.</p><p></p><p>The Heart of Forging was a special kind of talent. For anyone with the Heart of Forging, the success rate of forging any item would be increased by half.</p><p></p><p>It sounded ordinary, but it was actually quite terrifying. The success rate of forging in this world was not very high. Even for a Grandmaster Forgemaster, the success rate of forging a Mysterious-grade magic weapon was less than 50%.</p><p></p><p>Increasing it by half was incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"So, does this mean I'm qualified to learn the Forging Dao now?" Qi Yuan pondered. "It seems I should practice making drones. If I could forge Shen Lingxuan into a drone, I could ride her into battle, and others would think I'm a divine being!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan indulged in wild fantasies.</p><p></p><p>That night, after being bullied, Qi Yuan had one more steamed bun than usual from Chen Kangbao, who grumbled endlessly about it.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan did not go out again that night, nor did he watch Chen Kangbao pour water for his mother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>After reaching 30% progress, he had to take it slow.</p><p></p><p>The mother-in-law task was a big one, and he had to save his strength for the steel blade.</p><p></p><p>The next day, soon after Qi Yuan woke up, an uninvited guest arrived in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, come quickly, Father and Mother have found you a teacher!" Shen Lingfeng rushed in, followed by a middle-aged man dressed in a formal, tidy manner, with neatly combed hair and a well-groomed mustache.</p><p></p><p>He looked like a very orderly person.</p><p></p><p>"A teacher?" Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao came out, both with puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This is Chen Shenwei, our family's Mysterious-grade Forgemaster!" Shen Lingfeng introduced. "My father wants you to do some things, don't let down your father's reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Oh...okay." Qi Yuan hesitated for a moment, but did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>As he was playing the role of the useless son-in-law, learning forging might also increase his performance. Plus, he was also interested in Forgemasters and wanted to see this mysterious system.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze calm. When his eyes fell on Chen Kangbao, he frowned at Chen Kangbao's unkempt appearance.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help reaching out and moving the steamed bun in Chen Kangbao's mouth. "When eating, you should eat from both sides, not just the left side. What's the matter with you?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng leaned closer to Qi Yuan. "Brother-in-law, Chen Shifu is very rigid and likes things to be orderly."</p><p></p><p>Oh, so he had OCD.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts arose in his mind, and he couldn't help but ask, "Chen Shifu, do you also have to arrange your chopsticks evenly when you go to the toilet?"</p><p></p><p>On Earth, Qi Yuan knew that many people had OCD.</p><p></p><p>He had always wanted to ask those with OCD a lot of questions, and now he had the chance.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei's mustache trembled, and the corner of his mouth twitched when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Shifu, don't shake, your mustache isn't even!" </p><p></p><p>"You..." Chen Shenwei hurriedly fixed his mustache, giving Qi Yuan an unfriendly look, deeply pained in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Among all the Forgemasters in the Shen family, why did they have to let him, Chen Shenwei, teach this madman forging? Wasn't this just torture?</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Chen Shenwei took out a pile of strange and unusual items.</p><p></p><p>He sat on a pear wood chair, his expression solemn. "In ancient times, when chaos first opened, our ancestors emerged from the great mountains, creating stone tools, iron implements, and establishing a brilliant civilization."</p><p></p><p>To learn the Forging Dao, one needed to know the origins of the Forging Dao.</p><p></p><p>Generally, when Chen Shenwei taught others, he would not mention these esoteric things.</p><p></p><p>But teaching a madman, he didn't need to teach the obscure and difficult aspects of the Forging Dao - he would just teach the mythological stories of the Forging Dao.</p><p></p><p>"How did ordinary stone tools and iron implements transform from the mundane to the extraordinary?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary stone tools also existed on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, the Forging Dao had extraordinary factors.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei nodded and continued, "Then...the Ominous Spirits descended, invading the world. Our ancestors wielded common iron, how did they fight against the Ominous Spirits?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Forging Dao descended from the heavens, falling into the Great Realm. It was then that we relied on various magic weapons to battle the Ominous Spirits. Forgemasters, using the essence of mountains and rivers, the radiance of the sun and moon, forged unparalleled magic weapons, changing the heavens and earth, moving mountains and filling seas!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Chen Shenwei's expression was full of nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>"According to the 'Secret of Origins' records, before we had magic weapons, our world was almost taken over by the Ominous Spirits and turned into their playground!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened attentively to the background story of this world.</p><p></p><p>The origin of magic weapons was actually related to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Do we now have people who can communicate with the heavens?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei shook his head. "News like that is not something a mere Mysterious-grade Armaments Master like myself can know.</p><p></p><p>If one day you reach the Heaven-grade Armaments Master realm and step from the Blue Mountain Realm into the Great Realm, perhaps then you may know."</p><p></p><p>This world was called the Blue Mountain Realm, located in the chaotic star domain, which was a small realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the small realms, there were the Great Realms.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I've told you too much too soon. If you can truly become a Forgemaster, I may even be considered a renowned teacher!" Chen Shenwei sighed, making the best of a bad situation.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's continue discussing the history of Forgemasters..."</p><p></p><p>That's right, he planned to teach some history first.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knows what unexpected things might happen if a madman started learning forging.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Shifu, do Forgemasters need to use Ominous Fires when forging?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>On TV, refining dan required Ominous Fires, so what about forging? Chen Shenwei was surprised to see Qi Yuan's question. "Forgemasters forge using their Heart Fires.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the will, the higher the talent realm, the more intense the Heart Fire.</p><p></p><p>Well, today's lesson is about enough. Here is an introductory Forging Dao technique, you can take a look at it yourself, and I'll teach you more tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei finished speaking, tossed the "Forging Basics Technique" book to Qi Yuan, and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Qi Yuan carefully flipped through the book.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Qi Yuan was surprised, "this seems to be of the same origin as the Forging Techniques of the Heavenly Clan!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

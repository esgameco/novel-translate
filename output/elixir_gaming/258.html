        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The branch leader of the Divine Flower Association looked at the post, with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A Yin God next to him laughed and said, "Old Ginseng, do you think what this Blood Robe Sword God said is true or false?"</p><p></p><p>The branch leader of the Divine Flower Association shook his head: "How could it be true? We cultivate these techniques ourselves, how could we not know if there were problems? He's just fear-mongering."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the idea that cultivation techniques are poisonous is absurd nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"This person fabricated the claim that techniques are poisonous, forcibly linking it to the great calamity, just to promote the Original God Sharing Association and absorb cultivation techniques from all over the world."</p><p></p><p>The branch leader of the Divine Flower Association clearly did not believe what Qi Yuan said was true.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's post did indeed spark a lot of discussion and attract the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>But most of the powerful Yin Gods who saw this were at most skeptical, and chose not to believe it. </p><p></p><p>Only some low-level cultivators chose to believe it.</p><p></p><p>After all, a powerhouse like the Blood Robe Sword God had no reason to deceive them, right?...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Qi Yuan stretched lazily. </p><p></p><p>Without playing games, Qi Yuan was in good spirits and didn't need to stay up late, but he still slept in for once.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad." At this moment, the Rogue Immortal Lord rushed over in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Could something big have happened? Did the Martial Monarch come to attack?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, the post you made on the Divine Flower Association last night has been deleted!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly probed his consciousness into the jade slip of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the post he made yesterday had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday there were over a thousand comments and replies, but now... the post was gone, as if it had never existed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Sun Flame Emperor and Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady also rushed over, apparently having discovered this matter as well.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>This was very strange.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and sent a message to the Eastern Land leader of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see the post I made yesterday, why was it deleted, who deleted it?"</p><p></p><p>Before long, Qi Yuan received a response from the Eastern Land leader.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this old man does not know either. But one thing is certain... it was likely deleted by... the Supreme Leader!"</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Leader? Did I offend him? Why delete my post, does even the small Divine Flower Association not have freedom of speech? What's his ID number, give it to me, I'll add him and confront him directly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit angry.</p><p></p><p>It was one thing to have posts deleted on Blue Star, but to have a post deleted while cultivating immortality was too outrageous!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to have a good talk with the Supreme Leader of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is powerless in this matter, and cannot contact the Supreme Leader either," the Eastern Land leader replied.</p><p></p><p>"Can my post be restored?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I'll post another one!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was angry. He took out the Blood Robe Sword God's account, preparing to make another post and complain about the deletion.</p><p></p><p>But he suddenly found that he couldn't post.</p><p></p><p>"I've been muted!" Qi Yuan was angry.</p><p></p><p>He had actually been muted! Authoritarian dogs! He was furious. He had just made one post, and not only was it deleted, but he was also muted.</p><p></p><p>He made a mental note of this Divine Flower Association Supreme Leader.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Land leader looked terrified: "Senior, this has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Supreme Leader of the Divine Flower Association?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Leader comes and goes mysteriously, no one knows where he is."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exited the Divine Flower Association jade slip and told the Great Sun Flame Emperor, Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady and others what had happened.</p><p></p><p>When they heard this, their expressions all became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the waters run deep!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was profound: "No matter how deep the waters, I'll cut off the head of that authoritarian dog with one sword strike!"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, be careful, recently it seems..." Ice Mountain Tyrant Lady couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan being muted was strange and ominous.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that danger was approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we'll see who needs to be careful," Qi Yuan said nonchalantly. "Actually this is good. Before I didn't know who the enemy was, but now at least I know... who the enemy is."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry about this matter. Today we were supposed to visit Wind Lord, let's go to Wind Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very carefree.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he was also very confident.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Unknown location.</p><p></p><p>Thunder seas spread out, with immortal clouds swirling.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a fog, obscuring most of the scenery within, but vague figures could be seen moving about.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light flew past and landed in the unknown location.</p><p></p><p>A decree unfurled, emanating boundless pressure.</p><p></p><p>This decree seemed capable of easily suppressing or even destroying Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Golden light scattered, and over a hundred golden characters danced in the air as an authoritative, vast voice rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Lei Family Four Generals, heed my command!"</p><p></p><p>From within the thunder sea, four bare-chested men emerged.</p><p></p><p>Their chests were covered in sword and blade scars, clearly having suffered severe injuries in the past.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from these four men was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Each one of them would be considered an unrivaled expert in any realm.</p><p></p><p>How much more terrifying were the four gathered together? Their eyes were lifeless, like those of death gods. Standing together, they gave off an invincible aura.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God of Light Phoenix City in Phoenix Sky Realm has violated the prohibition. Kill without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was authoritative and filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The Lei Family Four Generals knelt on one knee, their voices hoarse as if emerging from hell: "We obey."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Venerable was lying sideways on the bed, her clothes disheveled, with kiss marks scattered on her exposed shoulders and jade feet. Her eyes were filled with spring water, gazing lovingly.</p><p></p><p>A faint aura of debauchery permeated the vast palace, along with the scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>She lay sideways on the bed, staring blankly at an ancient mirror in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Men who are too weak are indeed boring."</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Venerable licked her lips, inexplicably recalling the Blood Robe Sword God she had met yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. Such a man is destined not to be toyed with at my whim. What a shame, a shame... if he truly liked me and respected me, I might not be unwilling to settle down and be his wife."</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Venerable's eyes were full of greed, with a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>She liked to control powerful men.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday when Qi Yuan slew Elder Xiang Yun in front of her, it had actually displeased her.</p><p></p><p>However, for the sake of Blood Robe Sword God's face, she had held back from taking action.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't have a spring tryst with him soon, you'll never have the chance."</p><p></p><p>A shrill, extremely hoarse voice suddenly came from the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>In the mirror, the back of a man in white robes suddenly appeared. But there was no such person in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Jasmine Venerable was somewhat surprised. "Could it be that besides me, someone else has their eye on him?"</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Venerable's thoughts toward the Blood Robe Sword God were not good to begin with.</p><p></p><p>She was very fickle, but also very passionate.</p><p></p><p>She was so fickle that she might fall for a handsome man at first sight.</p><p></p><p>She was so passionate that after a night of passion, she couldn't bear for the man to leave. Unable to endure the pain of longing, she would kill him, drink his blood, and make his skull into a wine cup.</p><p></p><p>For her, a night of passion with the Blood Robe Sword God would definitely be the most satisfying night of her life. The Blood Robe Sword God's skull...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wine glass she made would also be her most precious collection.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood Robe Sword God's performance yesterday left her quite dissatisfied. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, she might have truly settled down to be a virtuous wife and good mother.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Sun has targeted him." A shrill voice came from the mirror, though this time it carried a hint of terror.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Sun..." Hearing this name, even the Great Venerable Jasmine felt her heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>"In at most ten days, Dark Sun's people will arrive in Qinghong City," the person in the ancient mirror warned. "So I won't appear in the coming days."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Great Venerable Jasmine's eyes revealed a pained expression: "The beautiful die young, alas."</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be grieving over the Blood Robe Sword God's impending demise.</p><p></p><p>"Why must such a handsome man die at someone else's hands rather than mine?" </p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Jasmine felt quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is life, full of regrets everywhere.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wenfeng Mountain was only 3,000 li from Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>This time Qi Yuan did not take a flying ship. With just a wave of his wide sleeve, he brought the Great Sun Flame Emperor and the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman to Wenfeng Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Wenfeng Mountain was built on a large spirit vein. As soon as they arrived, Qi Yuan sensed the rich spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With this level of spiritual energy, ordinary people living here would be free of all illnesses and live to 120 years old.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor led Qi Yuan and the other two towards the highest peak of Wenfeng Mountain. </p><p></p><p>Along the way, all cultivators they encountered bowed to the Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Young Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects, Young Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Xie was the grandson of Feng Jun, and Feng Jun's only descendant.</p><p></p><p>Feng Xie's father, that is, Feng Jun's son, had suddenly perished without reason 700 years ago.</p><p></p><p>In no time, they arrived at the highest peak of Wenfeng Mountain, which was Feng Jun's place of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall man walked out with a kindly expression: "Junior Brother Feng Xie, Master is currently meeting an honored guest. Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather has a guest?" The Great Sun Flame Emperor was surprised. "Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a Yin God. His whole body is shrouded in a black robe. He seems unwilling to reveal his identity, so I don't know who he is either," the tall man replied honestly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Great Sun Flame Emperor could only say to Qi Yuan: "I'm sorry, we'll need to wait for a while."</p><p></p><p>The tall man also glanced at the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman and Qi Yuan with a strange expression. As for the Rogue Immortal Venerable, he was completely ignored.</p><p></p><p>The group waited at the foot of the mountain peak. After about a quarter of an hour, a loud shout suddenly came from the peak: "Get out!"</p><p></p><p>The clouds at the mountaintop swirled and dispersed in that moment.</p><p></p><p>A black-robed man was seen coming down from the mountain peak, looking quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the Great Sun Flame Emperor, the black-robed man said softly: "Feng Xie, you should persuade your grandfather. The Mythical Secret Treasury includes a share for your grandfather. It shouldn't be in that woman's hands!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the black-robed man's form dissolved into bubbles and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor's expression darkened slightly, but in the end he said nothing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an elegant white-robed old man appeared. Half the hair on his forehead was white and half was black, looking quite strange.</p><p></p><p>"Honored guests have come from afar. I apologize for not welcoming you earlier. Please forgive me. I am Feng Jun."</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God... You may also call me Origin Venerable," Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Please come with me, everyone." Feng Jun waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the scene before the group changed. When it reappeared, they were in a rather simple and elegant cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got straight to the point: "The four of us wish to establish the Original God Sharing Association. We need someone to manage it. Feng Xie recommended you. I wonder if you... are willing?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun had received a message about this matter from Feng Xie last night.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun nodded: "There's no problem with this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your trouble, senior. If the Original God Sharing Association encounters any issues, please contact me anytime," Qi Yuan said, respectfully addressing Feng Jun as "senior" out of reverence for the elderly.</p><p></p><p>"These are the cultivation techniques I've collected that can be made public, as resources for the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>Among them are fourteen Heavenly Methods and three Profound-level Secret Techniques. These are non-toxic cultivation methods, so the exchange price should be set higher," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Non-toxic cultivation methods would certainly be most welcomed by those sects.</p><p></p><p>That means more people would exchange for them, so the price should naturally be higher.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun nodded, then hesitated: "Is it true or false that the cultivation methods are toxic?"</p><p></p><p>"It's true," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Great Sun Flame Emperor said: "Grandfather, the post that the Blood Robe Sword God made yesterday... was deleted."</p><p></p><p>He told Feng Jun the full story of Qi Yuan's forum post.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Feng Jun fell silent for a long time, frowning continuously. After a while he said: "It seems this matter is even more complex than imagined."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his thoughts were complicated, and he activated his cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>However, even he couldn't detect any problems with the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>So it can be said that the other Yin Gods in the world probably wouldn't believe Qi Yuan's words if they heard them.</p><p></p><p>"It concerns the great calamity, so of course it's complex," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is very difficult for people to believe. I'm afraid the initial... promotion of the Original God Sharing Association will be very challenging," Feng Jun said honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... how can we make people believe?" Qi Yuan was also pondering this question, but couldn't find a solution.</p><p></p><p>The other three of the Four Flower Emperors also looked at each other, having no good ideas.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan said: "Let's go ahead and collect as many cultivation techniques as we can."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what the Blood Robe Sword God says makes sense. The many techniques he's provided now are enough to tempt some factions to offer their own techniques in exchange," Feng Jun said.</p><p></p><p>The slogan of the Original God Sharing Association might spread slowly, but profit motivates people and will also attract quite a few cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe later I'll bring out some God-level methods, which could really rake in the profits," Qi Yuan was just waiting for the God of No Gods to descend and give him God-level methods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's casual remark left Feng Jun a bit dazed: "You have God-level methods?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have one, but that one can't be revealed.</p><p>There may be new ones later, and revealing those shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>When the time comes, I'll put the techniques into the Original God Sharing Association. Senior, feel free to look at them if you wish," Qi Yuan said generously.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to manage the Original God Sharing Association, only to be a hands-off boss.</p><p></p><p>If Feng Jun helped him manage it, what harm was there in letting him see the techniques?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Feng Jun fell silent, and also felt some emotion: "People..."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled the black-robed man who had visited him today.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man had tried to tempt him with the Mythical Secret Treasury, hoping he would participate in the plot against the Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Mythical Secret Treasury has stirred up endless bloodshed in the Phoenix Heavenly Domain.</p><p></p><p>The main reason these Yin Gods coveted the Mythical Secret Treasury so much was for a top-grade Heavenly Method within it, as well as some spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing Qi Yuan say he could produce God-level methods, Feng Jun felt a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to the legendary God-level methods, Heavenly Methods... were nothing.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan truly had God-level methods, the Original God Sharing Association would instantly become famous throughout the various domains of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>Those were God-level methods, unprecedented in the Azure Waves Realm. Even if there were any, there was probably only one.</p><p></p><p>Yet Qi Yuan had them.</p><p></p><p>Once again, thanks to God Without Tears← for the 10,000 reward and continued support; thanks to Black Fatty and Gennr for another 1,000 reward; thanks to Autumn Summer Raccoon Dog, Ten Don't Not Not, Thousand Leaves Spring Autumn, Reader 20210523114458140, 19966789, Gentleman, 卍XZ, North Star Lord, and Following the Wind for their rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

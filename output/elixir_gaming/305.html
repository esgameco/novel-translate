        <h1>Chapter 305</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yaji's face showed unease and a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Sir... are we going in the wrong direction?"</p><p></p><p>Yaji had thought they were leaving the hellhole of Wugui country, but instead the car was heading deeper in.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the direction they were going instinctively repulsed Yaji. </p><p></p><p>His parents had died in that direction, at the hands of the demons in that military camp.</p><p></p><p>"It's not wrong. The person I need to pick up is there," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yaji's body trembled imperceptibly. </p><p></p><p>The dirty little girl also tightly gripped her brother's arm.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, their hearts were not at ease at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They even thought that perhaps the two people in the car who had rescued them had deep connections with those demons.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would they drive towards the military camp to pick someone up?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the car stopped on a hilltop in a small town.</p><p></p><p>Wenmin got out of the car and gazed into the distance, slowly saying: "Mr. Qi, the boss... is in the military camp ahead."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, there was a hint of fear in his voice.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan fell into a trap there, those left waiting here would surely die.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I see it," Qi Yuan said, looking down below.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, dust was flying, like a great desert.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the desert, steel buildings towered imposingly.</p><p></p><p>Looking from afar, one could see a flood of steel patrolling.</p><p></p><p>On the watchtowers, well-equipped soldiers stood ramrod straight.</p><p></p><p>In this military camp, there were over 3,000 battle-ready troops.</p><p></p><p>"Wait here for a bit, I'm going to pick someone up," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>With that, he walked down from the hilltop.</p><p></p><p>It was only seven or eight li from here to the camp gates.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's pace was neither fast nor slow.</p><p></p><p>The drones flying overhead seemed not to notice his approach.</p><p></p><p>Dust swirled everywhere as a tall figure moved through the yellow sand.</p><p></p><p>On the hilltop, Wenmin watched Qi Yuan's receding figure, his mind shaken and still somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>Yaji felt even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's actions were too bewildering to guess his intentions.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, in the military camp, the minds of several soldiers on the watchtower suddenly tensed.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why is someone coming this way? </p><p>Where are the drone patrols? Why didn't they detect this?"</p><p></p><p>A soldier in uniform exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>This was a military-controlled area. Ordinary people couldn't enter without permission.</p><p></p><p>Yet someone was walking towards them.</p><p></p><p>The drone patrol team hadn't stopped him.</p><p></p><p>He was only spotted by the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>Now, the figure on the road was getting closer and closer. The soldiers on the watchtower could see the person's face with their naked eyes.</p><p></p><p>These soldiers were curious, thinking perhaps it was some madman who had wandered in by mistake.</p><p></p><p>"Halt!" </p><p></p><p>At that moment, over a dozen guns were aimed at the approaching figure from in front of the camp gates.</p><p></p><p>These gate guards all had casual looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>A soldier captain shouted: "What are you doing here? Quick, seize him!"</p><p></p><p>The detectors showed the person wasn't carrying any bombs, so there was no danger.</p><p></p><p>Although they found it strange how he had managed to walk here, they simply treated him as someone who had wandered in by mistake.</p><p></p><p>With over a dozen guns pointed at him, four soldiers walked towards Qi Yuan with mocking looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this dusty land, young men with delicate skin like Qi Yuan were rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood outside the military camp, facing the dense steel buildings ahead alone, with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to take someone away," Qi Yuan said in a loud, clear voice that reached the ears of all the soldiers present.</p><p></p><p>Before the soldiers could react, suddenly a large truck stopped beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A group of masked soldiers in military uniforms got out of the truck.</p><p></p><p>These soldiers were holding guns and had burly builds, seemingly much more muscular than ordinary soldiers.</p><p></p><p>These soldiers returning to camp were clearly gene warriors who had been out "hunting".</p><p></p><p>They held guns and were escorting some civilians with numb expressions back.</p><p></p><p>The leader looked at Qi Yuan and said in a gruff voice: "We're short on blood for our experiments. We'll take this one."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan as if looking at prey.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the soldiers stationed at the gate showed regretful looks.</p><p></p><p>The project the gene warriors were currently responsible for was extremely inhumane.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that these gene warriors were fanatical believers of the Wu religion in the camp.</p><p></p><p>They captured heretics to carry out religious experiments.</p><p></p><p>No one captured for experiments ever survived. Before dying, they would suffer inhuman tortures.</p><p></p><p>At the gene warrior leader's words, two gene warriors immediately cracked their knuckles and walked towards Qi Yuan, as if looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're unwilling to hand over the person I need," Qi Yuan sighed at this point, his voice tinged with inexplicable regret.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the 30-some gene warriors present, a glint of killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had originally wanted to reason with them.</p><p></p><p>But there were too many people in this camp, over 3,000 in total.</p><p></p><p>Reasoning with each one would be too tiring.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't Tang Sanzang after all.</p><p></p><p>So it was better to just kill them all.</p><p></p><p>It's easier to reason with dead people.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted lightly.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, a blood-red longsword had appeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red sword was extremely bewitching, emanating a terribly frightening aura.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the sword appeared, everyone present couldn't help but tremble in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This sword was Qi Yuan's weapon from the Flowing Wind Realm. Inscribed on it was the primordial divine ability "Void Ruler's Heart Demon Attraction".</p><p></p><p>The blood-red longsword left its sheath.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a blood-red light flashed through the swirling yellow sand.</p><p></p><p>The 30-some gene warriors near Qi Yuan froze in that moment, their expressions fixed.</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew past, and these gene warriors collapsed to the ground like scarecrows.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, and blood light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Qi Yuan only had Foundation Establishment realm strength.</p><p></p><p>But his sword strike was unstoppable even for Core Formation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention these gene warriors.</p><p></p><p>With just one strike, over 30 gene warriors fell.</p><p></p><p>The civilians captured by the gene warriors flashed looks of terror in their eyes, which then turned to wild joy and reverence.</p><p></p><p>These people knelt down with a thud, shouting: "God!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they took Qi Yuan as a god who had come to save them!</p><p></p><p>At this point, the soldiers in the camp were also shocked.</p><p></p><p>Shocked as they were, they didn't hesitate at all. Bullets rained towards Qi Yuan like raindrops.</p><p></p><p>"Not only do you not beg for mercy, you even dare to resist. It seems... you all must die!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with these bullets, Qi Yuan's sword swept through the air.</p><p></p><p>A blood screen appeared in front of him, blocking all the bullets.</p><p></p><p>This scene stunned the soldiers.</p><p></p><p>However, they still frantically pulled their triggers, spraying bullets.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The originally incoming bullets reversed course.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Ghost!"</p><p></p><p>The dozens of people who had fired at Qi Yuan instantly perished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his longsword, his form suddenly accelerating.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, you can all... die!"</p><p></p><p>Holding his longsword, Qi Yuan charged furiously into the military camp.</p><p></p><p>Like a god of death, he held his sword and reaped lives.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the tall watchtowers over ten meters high, he shook his blood-red longsword.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The majestic buildings collapsed like tofu dregs.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary bombs couldn't destroy watchtowers like these.</p><p></p><p>Human strength certainly couldn't harm them at all.</p><p></p><p>Yet today, someone had sliced one down with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The huge crash of the collapsing watchtower seemed to wake up the other soldiers in the camp at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Alarms began to sound.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?!"</p><p></p><p>"Has Yuelang invaded?!"</p><p></p><p>More and more soldiers poured towards this area from all over the camp.</p><p></p><p>More soldiers and officers were bewildered and confused, having no idea who the enemy was.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan leisurely held his longsword.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, several tanks rolled towards him. The soldiers driving the tanks still had confused looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because they had no idea who</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No large-scale enemy forces were discovered.</p><p></p><p>They only saw that man holding a long sword. However, in the next moment, their confusion was resolved.</p><p></p><p>They watched as the young man casually swung the long sword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A 50-ton tank was directly flung into the air, crashing into other buildings.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit..."</p><p></p><p>"Ghost!"</p><p></p><p>The soldiers driving the tanks were terrified by this sight.</p><p></p><p>Is this even human? Flinging a tank with one sword strike?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, before they could think further, a flash of blood-red light passed by. Their consciousness stopped there, and the tank they were driving was also thrown into the air at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his long sword, walking through the military camp as if it were uninhabited.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the hills of the small town.</p><p></p><p>The civilian blinked while holding binoculars.</p><p></p><p>Yaji also widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were anxious and utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They watched as Qi Yuan approached the military camp and seemed to be stopped by someone.</p><p></p><p>What happened next was completely unclear.</p><p></p><p>They only saw flashes of red light, one after another.</p><p></p><p>The sound of gunfire and explosions erupted frantically.</p><p></p><p>Tall watchtowers collapsed, and steel monster tanks were overturned.</p><p></p><p>Inside the military camp, flames were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this military camp had been attacked.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan's figure could not be seen at all, even with binoculars.</p><p></p><p>At this time, deep inside the military camp, in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Several military officers looked terrified, their expressions panicked.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Enemy attack?"</p><p></p><p>"How could Yuelang have broken through? Why didn't we receive any intelligence?"</p><p></p><p>These high-ranking officers were the actual controllers of the military camp.</p><p></p><p>They had gathered to discuss battle plans.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of gunfire and explosions erupted continuously.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, there was turmoil in the camp, or an enemy attack.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? I need an explanation!" A high-ranking officer shouted angrily into his communicator.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, enemy attack! Enemy attack! Quick, run!"</p><p></p><p>An urgent voice came through the communicator.</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking officer looked up at the sky, his eyes showing confusion.</p><p></p><p>There were no planes in the sky.</p><p></p><p>There was also no sound of missile bombardment in the camp.</p><p></p><p>The air defense system and the Sky Prohibition system had not detected any enemies.</p><p></p><p>This meant there was no missile attack, nor any drone squadron attack.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be gene soldiers? How many have come?" the high-ranking officer asked.</p><p></p><p>Only a special gene soldier squad could cause the current situation.</p><p></p><p>However, such special gene soldier squads could only cause limited casualties, at most creating some turmoil, essentially a suicide attack.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the high-ranking officer remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the enemy is not human. It's just one person..."</p><p></p><p>"One person!"</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking officers in the hall were stunned, then roared in anger.</p><p></p><p>"One person... causing such a big disturbance, are you all useless?"</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest gene soldier would die after a few sniper shots.</p><p></p><p>Encountering a tank, they would be crushed directly.</p><p></p><p>How could human strength compete with these?</p><p></p><p>The officers present all felt it was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could ponder further, they saw that the alarm in the entire military camp had been raised to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the front defenses of the entire camp had already collapsed.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible!</p><p></p><p>The front defense had eight hundred men.</p><p></p><p>These eight hundred men had countless guns, were equipped with over eighty tanks and armored vehicles, and had a large number of drones.</p><p></p><p>As a result... it all collapsed?</p><p></p><p>It had only been less than three minutes since the alarm sounded, right? The collapse was too fast. Was the enemy's firepower... so strong? High-ranking officer Guo Tanran was shocked, but no matter what, his position was unstable this time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go out and see what's going on!"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he went out, he saw countless defeated soldiers.</p><p></p><p>These soldiers had no fighting spirit at all, their expressions as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>They were indeed shouting about ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"He's not human at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly, it's a ghost!"</p><p></p><p>These soldiers had participated in more than a dozen battles, large and small.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that their fighting spirit was strong.</p><p></p><p>Even facing an enemy ten times their size, they would dare to fight.</p><p></p><p>But what they faced today was not an enemy.</p><p></p><p>It was a devil!</p><p></p><p>Have you ever seen someone who couldn't be hurt by bullets, rocket launchers, or artillery shells? Have you ever seen someone who could fling a tank with one sword strike, or split a steel fortress with one sword? They had seen it.</p><p></p><p>So, they chose to run away directly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a rout formed.</p><p></p><p>High-ranking officer Guo Tanran was extremely angry.</p><p></p><p>The scene before him was truly beyond his expectations, beyond the expectations of these officers who had just walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Explain, I need an explanation!" Guo Tanran was furious.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, at this time, no one was reporting the situation to him.</p><p></p><p>The previous communicator was full of static noise.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't need anyone to report the situation to him, as he had already seen... the invading enemy.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, tall buildings were collapsing one after another.</p><p></p><p>A man with slightly long hair, holding a blood-red long sword, was emitting various kinds of light.</p><p></p><p>These lights were like special effects in a movie.</p><p></p><p>As he swung the sword in his hand, an armored vehicle was thrown into the air.</p><p></p><p>The sword swung again, a flash of blood-red light passed, and dozens of soldiers hiding behind cover directly exploded.</p><p></p><p>High-ranking officer Guo Tanran widened his eyes, his pupils filled with disbelief: "God... how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"This is not human at all!" The other officers also trembled, unable to believe the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a terrifying and powerful person in this world?</p><p></p><p>"Weak, too weak."</p><p></p><p>"Not even a match for a single strike."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's eyes were full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Such a military camp posed less of a threat to him than a sect guarded by a Foundation Establishment elder.</p><p></p><p>He just kept walking forward, casually swinging his sword a few times.</p><p></p><p>All buildings collapsed, all resistance turned to nothing.</p><p></p><p>"With just this, you dare to arrest my little brother?"</p><p></p><p>"With just this, you dare to be so arrogant online?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the enemies fleeing in all directions, a demonic smile flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Escape... is impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Sword... come!"</p><p></p><p>With his loud shout, the blood-red long sword in Qi Yuan's hand suddenly burst with brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up and saw a huge blood-colored sword appear above the entire military camp.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored sword was as big as a small mountain, emitting an endless terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood-colored light passed.</p><p></p><p>Countless tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy trucks were reduced to fragments. Whether drones or planes, they all fell to ashes before they could take off.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm, his voice as steady as still water: "All those in the military camp shall be killed!"</p><p></p><p>The game NPCs were too arrogant, they must be cleared out.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the huge blood-red sword slammed into the military camp.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red giant sword was actually larger than the military camp.</p><p></p><p>As the sword struck, it was like a mushroom bomb had been dropped.</p><p></p><p>The entire military camp instantly became a blood-colored hemisphere.</p><p></p><p>All people saw was endless blood color.</p><p></p><p>Countless lives screamed and struggled at this moment, then perished.</p><p></p><p>High-ranking officer Guo Tanran and the other officers died in the sword light with shock and confusion.</p><p></p><p>The entire military camp became ruins at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All enemies were slain by this single strike from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense spread out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was decisive in killing, but never killed indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>He was lawful good.</p><p></p><p>So, those he killed... were all enemies.</p><p></p><p>Those who had been captured by the military camp for experiments, or who were imprisoned, he did not harm.</p><p></p><p>As his divine sense swept through, he discovered that there were actually over a hundred weakened civilians still imprisoned in the military camp.</p><p></p><p>And those civilians had various test tubes inserted into their bodies, as if their blood was being drawn.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan investigated a bit, curiosity appearing in his eyes: "Drawing blood?"</p><p></p><p>This Wu Jiao... seemed to be conducting some kind of experiment.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand military affairs, nor can I play politics.</p><p></p><p>I feel that in this situation, just killing him completely would suffice."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan expressed his strange opinion.</p><p></p><p>"I'll see when I can recruit some little brothers under my command, and send them to help you."</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Jin Li for a while, Qi Yuan logged out of the game.</p><p></p><p>The demons of Yiguan Jin are not easy to deal with during the day.</p><p></p><p>He had to wait until night to log in and deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Staying in the game world for too long would cause too much mental exhaustion, so Qi Yuan did not remain in the game world continuously.</p><p></p><p>"I need to adjust my schedule."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that during this period, he should play the game at night and sleep during the day to rest.</p><p></p><p>"I need to speed up the progress and complete the game. Maybe I can then collect all the fragments of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>According to the Heavenly Dao foundation theory, the Heavenly Dao is the best foundation spiritual object.</p><p></p><p>If I use the Heavenly Dao as the foundation, as the senior disciple of the Five Peaks, I should be the leader!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's still early, I should go for a walk with my knife."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, I need to walk it more diligently, I feel like it's about to grow a brain."</p><p></p><p>"It should develop spiritual intelligence in about a month? Why is it so early? Could it be related to my enlightenment of the Heavenly Dao foundation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked around with the ordinary kitchen knife, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if after it develops spiritual intelligence, if I can use it to kill the Yuandan Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>He had been modifying the Forging Spirit Technique for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The knife he cultivated would definitely be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, he could not break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, so his strength could not undergo a qualitative change, but the knife could give him extraordinary power.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was strolling casually on the main road of the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a group of disciples wearing black uniforms hurried by.</p><p></p><p>These disciples were from the Golden Light Hall of the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Hall was the law enforcement hall of the Shenguang Sect, dealing with both external and internal affairs.</p><p></p><p>These disciples were rushing out of the sect's mountain gate, obviously something urgent had happened.</p><p></p><p>However, when they saw Qi Yuan, the Golden Light Hall disciples still stopped their steps: "Greetings, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the law enforcement disciples, especially the leader, Zheng Jianghe, and nodded: "No need for formalities, you all go quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother," Zheng Jianghe replied, and the group hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite familiar with Zheng Jianghe, as he had been caught by the Golden Light Hall a few times due to his rather unconventional behavior, so he had become acquainted with Zheng Jianghe.</p><p></p><p>Watching Zheng Jianghe's back, a series of words flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>【This is a cultivator with a strong sense of justice, but at this moment, he only wants to kill.】</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what happened down the mountain." Qi Yuan simply sat on a rock, not wanting to walk, letting the knife bask in the sun.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Shenguang Sect disciples were also discussing animatedly, seemingly discussing the urgent departure of the Golden Light Hall disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Light Hall has sent so many disciples out, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know? Recently, there have been several murder cases in our Shenguang Sect area."</p><p></p><p>"Murder cases?"</p><p></p><p>"Last night, the son of the virtuous elder Xu in Rongcheng was getting married, a joyous occasion, but alas, at dawn, someone discovered that Elder Xu's entire family of eighteen had been killed.</p><p></p><p>Especially the newly-wed bride, she was desecrated and then killed, it was truly tragic!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the evil deeds of a villain!"</p><p></p><p>"This kind of incident has already happened three times in the vicinity of Rongcheng.</p><p></p><p>All of them were young brides on their wedding night being desecrated, and the groom's family being wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>"Which evil person dares to commit such atrocities in our Shenguang Sect's domain!"</p><p></p><p>Some were indignant, some were deeply saddened, and some were indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Who else could it be but the demonic disciples of the Heishan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Heishan Sect, the expressions of everyone present changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Merchant Kingdom had three major sects, and the Shenguang Sect was one of them.</p><p></p><p>The three major sects were the Shenguang Sect, the Xuanfeng Mountain, and the Moyu Gate.</p><p></p><p>The three major sects were the strongest forces in the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect was one of the three major sects. However, if we were to talk about the sect that was the most unapproachable, it would undoubtedly be the Black Mountain Sect, which was under the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect only had a few Elixir Immortals guarding it. In terms of strength, it was naturally not as powerful as the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>But the Sect Master of the Black Mountain Sect had taken on an adoptive father, known as the Old Demon Black Chicken.</p><p></p><p>This old demon was a powerful demonic cultivator in the middle stage of the Spiritual Infant realm, and he was a wandering cultivator who was extremely vindictive and difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect had always treated the Old Demon Black Chicken as their filial son.</p><p></p><p>And the demonic disciples of the Black Mountain Sect, relying on the might of the Old Demon Black Chicken, became increasingly arrogant and malicious, constantly committing evil deeds.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Black Mountain Sect in the Great Liang Kingdom was utterly abhorrent.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Old Demon Black Chicken was too powerful, and he was a wandering cultivator, making him very difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't guarantee that they could directly kill him, those sects might end up receiving his retaliation.</p><p></p><p>That was why the Black Mountain Sect could be so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Divine Light Sect discussed this matter endlessly, and some of them felt quite resentful.</p><p></p><p>What could they do about the evil deeds of the Black Mountain Sect disciples? They could only silently condemn them.</p><p></p><p>This time, the law enforcement disciples of the Golden Light Hall went to Rongcheng, but they would probably return empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Qi Yuan overheard this and murmured, "The demonic version of Chang Wei?"</p><p></p><p>No, it was even more detestable than Chang Wei.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Qi Yuan killed a chicken and made some chicken soup to drink.</p><p></p><p>In the game, he had consumed too much, leaving him a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>He needed to replenish himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also shared the chicken soup with Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jiang Lingsu had given him a cultivation technique jade slip, which had greatly helped him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it's delicious." Jiang Lingsu drank a full bowl of the chicken soup, with some of the liquid still glistening at the corners of her mouth. "Big Brother, you've brewed this Black Chicken soup quite well. If you can't continue cultivating the Immortal path in the future, being a chef and opening a restaurant wouldn't be a bad idea."</p><p></p><p>"Then you'll have to endorse me." Qi Yuan glanced at her. Although Jiang Lingsu was not yet grown up, her appearance and demeanor were already quite good, far surpassing the so-called '98 flowers' and '00 flowers' of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"With salt?" Jiang Lingsu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, this topic did not continue, as Qi Yuan needed to start grinding in the game.</p><p></p><p>At night, Qi Yuan entered the game.</p><p></p><p>In the Forbidden Courtyard, it was silent and still.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a pale white arm emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had logged in.</p><p></p><p>He held his greatsword and continued to sneak forward.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he arrived at a forest.</p><p></p><p>Hanging from the trees were many sets of clothes.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't look closely, they might have thought they were the bodies of people.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan selected an area with a demonic cultivator's robe and raised his greatsword, vigilantly observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, at night, their senses are greatly weakened, and the connection between them is also diminished. Just how much will it be weakened?"</p><p></p><p>If it were daytime, he would have been discovered by the demonic cultivators long ago if he had brazenly appeared with his greatsword.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no reaction.</p><p></p><p>This meant that their senses were indeed weakened at night.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked over and stabbed the robe with his greatsword.</p><p></p><p>The robe instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, and the rest of the demonic cultivators hanging on the trees showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but smile: "Doesn't this mean I can quietly kill all the demonic cultivators in a single night?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he approached the second demonic cultivator and repeated his actions.</p><p></p><p>Experience +200.</p><p></p><p>He wielded the greatsword and killed them effortlessly and casually.</p><p></p><p>However, when he reached the thirtieth demonic cultivator, the demonic cultivators hanging on the trees finally reacted, gradually awakening.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the orderly and coordinated manner during the day, the demonic cultivators at night seemed chaotic, like headless flies.</p><p></p><p>"Hunting time!" Qi Yuan felt this was his opportunity.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

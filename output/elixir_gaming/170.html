        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky, gazing at those stern-faced Purple Mansion cultivators with awe in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hunched old man appeared and said with anguish, "Esteemed Blood Robe Sword Saint, this youth is from a branch of our Liu family, and has no connection to our main Liu family at all."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword Saint had not yet appeared, but this Purple Mansion cultivator was already talking non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the cultivators in the city felt mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Purple Mansion expert ah, whose slightest movement could shake the entire Thunder State. </p><p></p><p>But because a descendant of a Liu family branch offended the Blood Robe Sword Saint, he traveled thousands of miles to come here and capture that descendant."</p><p></p><p>"This Liu Wen bullied men and women alike, and offended the Blood Robe Sword Saint. It's truly karmic retribution!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Blood Robe Sword Saint? Why hasn't he arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was puzzled, and also wanted to see what the legendary Blood Robe Sword Saint actually looked like.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure in a blood-red robe appeared in front of over ten Purple Mansion musicians.</p><p></p><p>The man was handsome and tall, holding the hand of a harmless-looking little girl.</p><p></p><p>But anyone who saw this little girl only felt fear and awe, and would not be deceived by her appearance.</p><p></p><p>She was an Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Blood Robe Sword Saint. The aura of an Yin Spirit Venerable is truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even if he concealed his cultivation, if I saw him on the street, I would still think he was a supreme expert." A man sighed. Suddenly, he glanced at the man beside him with confusion, "Brother Feng Tian, what's wrong with you? Why are you trembling?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Tian was now looking at the man in the blood-red robe in the sky, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>How... how could he be the Blood Robe Sword Saint? Beside him, Sister Hua was also trembling violently, her face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Ye Chan covered her mouth, unable to speak as she looked at the Rogue Immortal Lord, her eyes blinking frantically.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Rogue Immortal Lord felt very smug and finally said gleefully, "You're not seeing things. He is the Blood Robe Sword Saint, and the girl you just gave candy to is his daughter, an Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>You're really brave, I admire you."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the sky, Qi Jianjun was reading Liu Wen's list of crimes one by one.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a brilliant smile: "The most praiseworthy thing in your life is dying by my hand."</p><p></p><p>With a gentle push of his hand, Liu Wen, who had boasted so much on the Divine Flower Association forum, instantly perished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the Purple Mansion expert on the ground who had rushed here from afar, and said softly, "I've always been reasonable. I won't implicate the innocent, much less kill entire families. You may go."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Purple Mansion expert breathed a sigh of relief: "Thank you, esteemed Blood Robe Sword Saint, for purging the cultivation world. This junior will return and strictly require our descendants to do more and talk less."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded, and his figure dissipated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the suona horns also stopped abruptly, and the Purple Mansion experts in the sky disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the city looked at the sky, still wanting more.</p><p></p><p>"I hadn't seen enough, why did he leave?"</p><p></p><p>"It would've been great if he killed one more!"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't someone go provoke the Blood Robe Sword Saint again, so we can see more excitement!"</p><p></p><p>"You go if you want to!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan, holding Qi Jianjun's hand, reappeared in the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>However, due to his Origin Divine Ability, even if others saw him, they wouldn't remember him or associate him with the Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>"The killing is done. Rogue Immortal Lord, let's go and have a gathering," Qi Yuan called out to the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chan beside the Rogue Immortal Lord felt her heart pounding, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Feng Tian and Sister Hua's faces were ashen as they saw the interaction between the Rogue Immortal Lord and Qi Yuan, their emotions tumultuous.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Qi Yuan called to the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chan looked at the Rogue Immortal Lord, her voice choked with tears: "My legs won't move, I won't go."</p><p></p><p>She still couldn't accept it, she didn't dare to meet the Blood Robe Sword Saint and his daughter, afraid of making a fool of herself.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord sighed helplessly: "Alright, be careful then. I'll go chat with my friend and deliver some pills to your grandfather."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Chan thought:</p><p></p><p>What's the point of delivering pills!</p><p></p><p>Why not just give them to me directly?</p><p></p><p>Of course, she didn't say this out loud.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Rogue Immortal Lord and Qi Yuan sat down again at their original seats in the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>They ordered quite a few dishes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun held a wine cup, about to take a sip.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's chopsticks tapped her little hand: "Children can't drink alcohol."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the waiter saw this scene and smiled: "This is fruit wine, it won't make you drunk. Children can drink it, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun looked smugly at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glared at the waiter: "If my daughter turns out badly, it'll be your fault."</p><p></p><p>"Sir's daughter is sweet and lovely, with a bright future. She will surely become an Elemental Pill True Person in the future." The waiter said some auspicious words as before.</p><p></p><p>"Don't say that!" Qi Yuan quickly retorted.</p><p></p><p>The waiter was stunned for a moment: "Divine Infant True Monarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Use your imagination a bit. I hope that in three hundred years, my daughter will be able to dominate all of antiquity." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The waiter also laughed, finding this customer particularly interesting.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate his food and looked at the Rogue Immortal Lord, slowly saying: "Regarding what you told me a while ago about wanting to shatter your Golden Core and cultivate anew, I've thought about it for a long time and discussed it with Great Wisdom True Monarch for several days. We finally concluded that you don't need to shatter your Golden Core and start over."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been generous to his friends.</p><p></p><p>He had kept the Rogue Immortal Lord's words in the group chat in mind.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord felt deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had only mentioned in the group chat that his Golden Core wasn't good enough and he wanted to shatter it and start over.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the Origin Venerable would actually consider it for him.</p><p></p><p>"After Great Wisdom True Monarch's guidance, I think you can emulate Great Wisdom True Monarch's Two Core Method.</p><p></p><p>If you're not satisfied with your previous Golden Core, then form several more.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, I've roughly created a technique based on your situation, called the 'Nine Core Method'. This method allows you to form up to nine Golden Cores.</p><p></p><p>However, due to time constraints, I haven't completed it fully.</p><p></p><p>As you form more Golden Cores, you'll get used to it, and later you can improve it yourself to ten cores, twenty cores, whatever you like."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan handed a jade slip to the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that creating this technique for the Rogue Immortal Lord also gave Qi Yuan many inspirations.</p><p></p><p>His Fixed Star Golden Core currently devours using the True Fire of the Sun.</p><p></p><p>But as everyone knows, eating too much can cause strange things to happen, like an upset stomach.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan thought that his Golden Core could also take two paths.</p><p></p><p>One is to form more Fixed Star Golden Cores and Planetary Golden Cores; the other is for the Fixed Star Golden Core to keep devouring.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Origin Venerable!" The Rogue Immortal Lord felt deeply moved as he accepted the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me. When I lacked techniques before, didn't you all give me techniques too?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he lacked techniques, the Four Emperors of the Divine Flower had all supported him to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, suddenly, a beam of light landed in front of the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Several figures appeared at once.</p><p></p><p>The leader was an old man, clearly at the Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the cultivators in the restaurant all revealed surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the great Feng Xiao, why has he come here?"</p><p></p><p>"Beside him is Green Poverty True Monarch, his face looks a bit unpleasant."</p><p></p><p>"What happened? They've come to the inn, is there some big shot here?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Feng Xiao's face bore a fearful expression as he looked ahead: "Feng Xiao, bringing my unworthy descendant Feng Tian, requests an audience with the esteemed Blood Robe Sword Saint."</p><p></p><p>In front of Feng Xiao, the previously arrogant Feng Tian was kneeling, his body covered in wounds, looking like he had been severely beaten.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the physical pain, Feng Tian was clearly more afraid of the legendary Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Sister Hua was the same, kneeling on the ground, her face full of pleading expressions.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Feng Xiao spoke, everyone in the restaurant was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword Saint is in the restaurant?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone quickly turned their heads to look, scanning the restaurant, but they couldn't see the Blood Robe Sword Saint at all.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant owner and waiters also panicked.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a lazy voice came from inside the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"I'm eating. Don't disturb my elegance.</p><p></p><p>Some small matters, once punished, are over.</p><p></p><p>Am I, the Blood Robe Sword Saint, the kind of petty person?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>It seems hiding one's identity is still better.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, you can't even eat in peace.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, being too famous is not good.</p><p></p><p>Outside the restaurant, hearing the Blood Robe Sword Saint's voice transmission, the great Feng Xiao breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your magnanimity, esteemed Blood Robe Sword Saint."</p><p></p><p>Green Poverty True Monarch also wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword Saint was a true god of killing.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare to believe he wouldn't implicate others? The Light Palace was directly annihilated! And those former powerhouses of Poor Venerable's Heaven and Earth Palace were lined up and beheaded.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with that overwhelming blood qi, how could they not think he was a demon?</p><p></p><p>Without killing hundreds of thousands of living beings, how could one have such blood qi? The great Feng Xiao came in a hurry and left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The customers in the restaurant looked at each other, sizing each other up.</p><p></p><p>But they simply couldn't tell where the Blood Robe Sword Saint was.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yaochang Gate.</p><p></p><p>Danheng Zhenjun was refining pills. He looked at the time: "This kid still hasn't come back after delivering the pills. Who knows where he's fooling around?"</p><p></p><p>Danheng Zhenjun felt helpless. This disciple was very similar to himself when he was young - liked to slack off and brag.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cheerful laugh rang out: "Brother Danheng, I didn't expect you to be hiding so deep!"</p><p></p><p>Danheng Zhenjun was startled, and saw the great cultivator Yechen arriving with Yechan.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior." Danheng Zhenjun was puzzled, but still bowed, not knowing why the great cultivator Yechen had come.</p><p></p><p>"You've taken on a good disciple," Yechen couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>Danheng Zhenjun's heart skipped a beat. </p><p></p><p>Oh no, did Gao Xiaoyu cause trouble again?</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that, Senior Yechen? Did my unworthy disciple not deliver the pills?" Danheng Zhenjun was a bit angry.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't Gao Xiaoyu know what's important?</p><p></p><p>"The pills aren't important." Yechen looked at Danheng Zhenjun, confusion in his eyes. "Brother Danheng, do you really not know who your disciple is with right now?"</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be with a friend. </p><p>Sigh, my disciple has always valued friendship. He has a friend who came here with a powerful enemy to face. </p><p>Fearing they wouldn't be a match, he invited my disciple to go help. That's why he was delayed in delivering the pills to you, senior. I hope you can forgive him." Danheng Zhenjun's mind was active, immediately embellishing the story.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the great cultivator Yechen squinted and smiled: "It seems, Brother Danheng, you really don't know who this good friend your disciple made is."</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Did they offend you, senior?"</p><p></p><p>"I wouldn't dare offend that person."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"He is... the Blood Robe Sword God."</p><p></p><p>"What?!" Danheng Zhenjun was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Great Cultivator Yechen smiled brightly: "With this connection, the Yaochang Gate is sure to prosper for ten thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed, and the Blood Robe Sword God had traveled almost all of the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the suona horn also spread throughout the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Those who had previously badmouthed him on the Divine Flower Meeting forum all received due punishment.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan was posting on the forum.</p><p></p><p>All the replies to him were words of praise.</p><p></p><p>The previous hostility, arguments, and irritating responses were all gone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the comments, feeling pleased: "It seems our efforts to clean up the atmosphere of the cultivation world have achieved great success."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was speechless in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Is this success?</p><p></p><p>This is just people being too afraid to speak up, afraid of offending you.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom Zhenjun sighed: "Indeed, the atmosphere of the cultivation world has been cleaned up quite a bit.</p><p>It's a pity that under this prosperous era of peace, there is still much evil and injustice hidden."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became unusually profound for a moment: "The cleanup is not yet complete. We must all continue to work hard."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Ya said: "Senior, we're about to arrive at the Ascension Tower. </p><p>Master said all the techniques in the Ascension Tower will be open to you."</p><p></p><p>Back in the Wangyue Continent, Jiang Ya had made an exchange with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They exchanged cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was going to the Ascension Tower for those techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had collected quite a few techniques from other Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>But for him, it still wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Golden Core chapter was a bottomless pit.</p><p></p><p>And the Ascension Tower collected techniques from all over the world, not just the Eastern Lands, but other regions of the Canglan Realm as well.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Lands bordered the Northern Lands, but were quite far from other regions.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Central Heavenly Region - even for Yin Gods, it wasn't easy to reach.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in the Eastern Lands, the place with the most complete and numerous cultivation techniques was the Ascension Tower.</p><p></p><p>About an incense stick's time passed.</p><p></p><p>The spirit ship landed.</p><p></p><p>A tower stretching straight into the clouds appeared in Qi Yuan's view.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this tower, Jiang Ya's eyes lit up with a bright smile: "We're back."</p><p></p><p>She never imagined that just participating in a small Eastern Lands Genius Ranking would lead to so many events.</p><p></p><p>Everything felt like a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Lord Blood Robe Sword God." Just then, a man in white robes appeared, handsome and refined, with a strong scholarly aura.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother." Jiang Ya called out.</p><p></p><p>This white-robed man was Jiang Ya's senior brother.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom Zhenjun looked at the white-robed man: "That old Wutian didn't come down?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man didn't seem surprised by Great Wisdom Zhenjun's form of address.</p><p></p><p>"Master is confined to the Ascension Tower. He won't come down until he solves the riddle. Please forgive him, senior." The Ascension Tower senior brother said politely.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, take me into the Ascension Tower." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't interested in meeting old man Wutian.</p><p></p><p>He was interested in the collection of the Ascension Tower.</p><p></p><p>Was it really as rumored, collecting techniques from all over the world?</p><p></p><p>Not just the Eastern Lands, but other regions as well.</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me, senior." The white-robed man said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed him in, while the others remained outside.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan arrived at the Ascension Tower that stretched straight into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>His left eyebrow twitched, and Qi Yuan smiled: "Looks like there will be good news this time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the Ascension Tower, and the white-robed man said goodbye and slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Ascension Tower, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the dazzling array of technique jade slips on the first floor, a satisfied expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Ascension Tower's reputation for collecting techniques from all over the world is actually true." With just a sweep of his divine sense on this first floor, he discovered over ten thousand techniques.</p><p></p><p>Low grade, medium grade, high grade, jade grade, mystic grade - they had it all.</p><p></p><p>On just the first floor, he found five heavenly grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that from Pauper Venerable and Affectionate Venerable, he had only obtained six heavenly grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>Here there were five, and this was just the first floor.</p><p></p><p>According to Jiang Ya, the Ascension Tower had five floors in total.</p><p></p><p>This first floor alone was almost richer than a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>Yet old man Wutian was only a Purple Palace realm great cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Wangyue Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a hoarse voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw an old man sitting in a wheelchair.</p><p></p><p>The old man's body was like withered wood, but his eyes were bright and piercing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes showed surprise: "You're already at the Purple Palace realm, yet you still use a wheelchair?"</p><p></p><p>[An unusual cultivator, the master of the Ascension Tower, old man Wutian.]</p><p></p><p>"I got used to sitting and can't leave it." The old man's voice was hoarse.</p><p></p><p>"If you get married in the future and are about to enter the bridal chamber, will you still be sitting in a wheelchair?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is truly an interesting person."</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, he didn't show the fear that other Purple Palace cultivators did.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to interact as equals.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't mind this.</p><p></p><p>"If one cannot break free from the shackles of this body, how can one talk about... marriage." Old man Wutian said, looking at Qi Yuan, "I envy you, friend. You leaped to become the Wangyue Venerable, breaking free from shackles in an unusual way, at least gaining 100,000 years of freedom."</p><p></p><p>"Don't speak in riddles." Qi Yuan looked at old man Wutian.</p><p></p><p>Old man Wutian's eyes fixed on Qi Yuan: "Does the Wangyue Venerable know what the great calamity is?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, showing a surprised expression: "You know?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had asked many Yin Gods, who all mentioned the great calamity, but none actually knew what it was specifically.</p><p></p><p>This old man Wutian actually knew.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, please look up at the sky, at the brightest star."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the red sun was like a glowing tomato.</p><p></p><p>"The sun? The great calamity is the sun?" Qi Yuan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he had obtained, this sun in the sky represented a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>That Yang God was also the most powerful Yang God in the nearby realms.</p><p></p><p>That's why his light was the brightest.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were definitely stronger ones among the Yang Gods illuminating all the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But those were too far, too distant from the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and no." Wutian spoke, "The great calamity has an indescribable relationship with that great sun.</p><p>So even though the Canglan Realm has some powerful beings, in the face of the great calamity, they can only endure humiliation to survive, allowing themselves to be cut."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan understood roughly.</p><p></p><p>If what old man Wutian said was true, then this great calamity was indeed difficult to resolve.</p><p></p><p>"300,000 years ago, an supreme expert emerged in the Canglan Realm.</p><p>He created his own technique and ascended to become a Venerable.</p><p>Facing the great calamity, he struck out fiercely, almost suppressing it.</p><p>But... at that moment, stars throughout the heavens shone, and countless immortals and gods descended.</p><p>That supreme expert perished because of this."</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the big shots ←God Without Tears, Cannot Bear HW, Black Fatty, soraliu, Hankehum, etc. for their thousands in rewards, and thanks to readers 20191206010148838, 20220428152007762, Salted Fish, Husky of the Flower-Growing Family, Little Jingyu, Lin Lin's Favorite, [I'm Crazy I'm Wild], reader 20200621094603105, reader 150504212758410 for their rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

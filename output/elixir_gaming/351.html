        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tian Yue City, Purple Flower Residential Complex.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Military Security Complex, the people living in this complex were either wealthy or noble.</p><p></p><p>In a large flat, Wu Qi was wearing a white bathrobe with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"Little Qi, why be so proud? That is... a legendary cultivation sect. </p><p></p><p>Although it's a small sect, for us people on Gong Xing, which one isn't a true divine court? My cousin, who used to be an ordinary girl working as a waitress in a milk tea shop earning 3000 yuan a month.</p><p></p><p>Now, she's been tested to have cultivation talent, joined the Hun Sha Sect, and directly... the village genealogy opened a separate page for her. Do you understand how valuable that is? To put it bluntly, you used to be a celebrity with some status and position, but compared to these cultivators, aren't you just an entertainer? Now, you have talent, isn't it good to join the Hun Sha Sect? Although you'd only be an outer disciple, not everyone can join.</p><p></p><p>After you join, my cousin can pull some strings, and you can work under her in the future. Your prospects would be limitless..."</p><p></p><p>The agent's voice droned on and on, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi listened with a headache.</p><p></p><p>The Hun Sha Sect was a small sect, with only one Yuan Dan elder in the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>It recruited disciples in various places in Qin Yuan, and had gained some reputation.</p><p></p><p>Many with talent who couldn't join major sects like the Tian Xuan Sect would choose to join medium and small sects like the Hun Sha Sect.</p><p></p><p>But even these medium and small sects weren't open to just anyone who wanted to join.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's talent wasn't high, but she had some, just barely making the cut.</p><p></p><p>Plus, since the agent's cousin had joined the Hun Sha Sect as a formal disciple, the agent wanted Wu Qi to join and become her cousin's follower.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Liu, my situation is complicated. Let's not push this matter," Wu Qi said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Little Qi, I know you're still thinking about that Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>You want to climb into his bed and become a noble lady.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed. You should be an independent and strong woman. Join the Hun Sha Sect and you'll be nobility! That Qi Yuan, at most he's an earl. In the eyes of cultivators, how is he any different from a slightly larger ant?" the agent persuaded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, you were a small celebrity, I could understand your desire for his power.</p><p></p><p>But now... times have changed! He's become just one of the masses. Don't waste your youth on him anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi was speechless. She couldn't reveal or expose Qi Yuan's true identity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she thought of a famous saying and said, "In the past, I sat in a well looking at the sky. Seeing Mr. Qi was like a frog in a well seeing the sun and moon. Now that the immortal way has revived, seeing Qi Yuan is like a mayfly seeing the blue sky."</p><p></p><p>"You... what kind of love potion did he give you?" The agent's voice was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the doorbell rang.</p><p></p><p>"I have a visitor, I have to go!" Wu Qi quickly hung up the phone, also wondering who would come to her place in the middle of the night.</p><p></p><p>Could it be one of her close girlfriends? Thinking this, she walked to the door and looked out through the peephole-like device.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that face, an expression of intense joy flashed across Wu Qi's face.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Standing outside was none other than Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>He had actually come back.</p><p></p><p>And... what did he want with her? Without any hesitation, Wu Qi opened the door, her face beaming with joy: "Mr. Qi, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>When the cool breeze from outside blew in, she felt a chill on her bare shoulders and only then realized she was wearing just a bathrobe. Her face immediately turned red.</p><p></p><p>"My ears are quite good. Hmm, just now the wind carried some sounds, saying you wanted to get into my bed..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? She was talking nonsense, it's not true!" Wu Qi hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was extremely nervous, her heart pounding, feeling as if the world was a bit hazy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, good that it's a misunderstanding. I'm a married man." Qi Yuan sat down in the room and finally stated his purpose, "I came here for a drop of your blood."</p><p></p><p>"One blood?" Wu Qi exclaimed in surprise, not hearing Qi Yuan's words clearly.</p><p></p><p>If this had happened when they first met on the cruise ship, Wu Qi might have hesitated a bit before willingly giving herself to Qi Yuan in order to get close to him.</p><p></p><p>But now, she didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>"Clean your ears and listen more carefully, it's one drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Remember when I first rode in your car? We agreed then that you'd give me your blood."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan needed a drop of Wu Qi's blood as a medium to store his divine infant.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi finally heard clearly, the misunderstanding cleared up, feeling even more embarrassed as she curled her toes.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, please take it." Wu Qi extended her finger.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was also curious what Qi Yuan would do with this drop of her blood.</p><p></p><p>But since she had already bet on Qi Yuan, she would do as he asked no matter what.</p><p></p><p>As her slender white finger extended, a flash of red light passed through Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A fine line appeared on Wu Qi's finger, and a drop of blood rolled down, falling into Qi Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's palm seemed to have a hole in it.</p><p></p><p>That drop of blood directly seeped in.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was sensing which divine infant had an affinity with Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths later, Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi stood quietly to the side, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Last time, didn't I say I'd give you a grandmother?</p><p></p><p>Well, this time I'll give you... five grandmothers directly."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Wu Qi blinked, a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"They are the Four Heavenly Kings - Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, and Vaiśravaṇa.</p><p></p><p>And another one is Yuè Yào. I didn't expect this pair of underdeveloped twins to be separated."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>The Four Heavenly Kings were his earliest fighting force in Qingshui Village, with Dhṛtarāṣṭra being Wang Wenqi, the granddaughter of Venerable Tianbao.</p><p></p><p>Yuè Yào was one of the twin goddess sisters Qi Yuan encountered in the ancestral grounds of the Ancient Clan.</p><p></p><p>The elder sister had a cold personality, while the younger was more carefree.</p><p></p><p>This time, the younger sister didn't come with her elder sister, which was quite unexpected for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, he was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>This Wu Qi looked to be only about 1.7 meters tall, but her blood was quite strong to be able to accommodate five grandmothers at once.</p><p></p><p>"They are..." Wu Qi was puzzled and confused.</p><p></p><p>"They are my old acquaintances, and can be considered my subjects..." Qi Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>They were actually Mr. Qi's old acquaintances? She was a bit bewildered. Could it be something like remnant souls from the cultivation world?</p><p></p><p>"They are also my divine infants. They died in battle before, and now lie dormant. They will reside in your body.</p><p></p><p>They... can also guide you in cultivation and help you become stronger," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide this.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..." Wu Qi's heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Because she heard the words "divine infant".</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Mr. Qi's old acquaintances were all divine infants!</p><p></p><p>Those were divine infant cultivators! Wu Qi was no longer ignorant now.</p><p></p><p>With the descent of the three realms to Gong Xing and the revival of the immortal way, she had some understanding of cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>Divine infant cultivators were called deities.</p><p></p><p>Like that demonic cultivator who held the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, easily slaughtering a city alone.</p><p></p><p>If not for the activation of the Eye in the Sky, who could have stopped him?</p><p></p><p>Such terrifying powerhouses, as majestic as gods, were the patriarchs of sects.</p><p></p><p>Even the heads of the Seven Martial Star families had to treat divine infant elders with courtesy.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Qi's acquaintances were divine infants, then he... wouldn't he be a divine infant as well, or even higher?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, apart from guiding you, they won't harm you. As for the price you pay, it's just that drop of blood."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>In his palm, a drop of blood</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gushing out.</p><p></p><p>This drop of blood was Wu Qi's blood, now stained with five divine infants.</p><p></p><p>However, ordinary people would not notice anything unusual about it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the blood you just gave me. Drink it, and it will reside in your spirit. As your spirit grows stronger, she will gradually awaken. Alright, I've finished here, so I need to go now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very busy. He still had over 4,000 divine infants inside him. He needed to find some grandchildren for these divine infants.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Mr. Qi, I'll take care of them like my own grandmothers!" Wu Qi replied excitedly. With five divine infants guiding her, what was the Soul Destruction Sect? Nothing but trash. Just an elder at the Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, alright. If they awaken, I'll ask if they're willing to accept you as a granddaughter. Bye bye."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched as Wu Qi swallowed that drop of blood, then his form vanished in that moment.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Wu Qi stood dumbly in place. After about a minute, she sat down on the sofa, her face showing wild joy.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, having obtained the technique, she felt refreshed and energized.</p><p></p><p>During that hour, she had closed her eyes to rest, and intermittent information had flowed into her mind. It was an incredibly profound technique for cultivating the spirit.</p><p></p><p>At this point, she finally confirmed that it wasn't a dream, but reality. Five grandmothers, five... divine infants.</p><p></p><p>She sat dazed on the sofa for a while, then made a phone call.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Liu, I've accepted five grandmothers."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"No good, I have too many divine infants."</p><p></p><p>In the room, Qi Yuan had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>He had sent over a hundred divine infants to the Origin Land, given a few to the Yaji siblings, and now a few to Wu Qi. But there were still many left.</p><p></p><p>"How about... a global recruitment?" Ning Tao was eating cake, her delicate fingers covered in cream. She licked it with her fragrant tongue while offering advice to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What you say... makes sense." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Over 4,000 divine infants was a bit much.</p><p></p><p>The potential of the Origin Land hadn't been fully tapped, but to continue exploring it would require completing new missions. Qi Yuan didn't know when new missions would come.</p><p></p><p>So for now, he should focus on Arch Star.</p><p></p><p>There were many people on Arch Star, and there might be many with special talents like Yaji and Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, with the development of modern civilization, familial affection between people has become increasingly indifferent. It seems I need to send some grandfathers and grandmothers to the people of Arch Star, to let them feel the caress of family love."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan made his decision, already forming a plan in his mind: "Ning Tao, after you finish your cake, take me to the capital. I want to meet the Seventh Prince."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Ning Tao quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Eat slowly, don't choke, there's no rush." Looking at Ning Tao, Qi Yuan revealed a doting expression.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince was dressed in royal attire, his figure tall and straight, looking refined and courteous.</p><p></p><p>Standing before him now was an elder with a long beard.</p><p></p><p>This long-bearded elder was from the Heavenly Origin Sect, an elder of that sect.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Origin Sect was from the Fire Spirit Realm, a step above the Fighting God Sect and Mysterious Heaven Sect in power. It was the true hegemon of the Fire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the founding ancestor of this sect, in his youth, had chanced upon a strange stone.</p><p></p><p>This stone could attract good fortune and avoid calamities, predicting blessings and misfortunes.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this stone, the Heavenly Origin Sect's ancestor had smooth sailing in the cultivation world. He finally entered the Yin Spirit realm and ascended to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>This stone could not be taken to the upper realm, so it was left in the Heavenly Origin Sect.</p><p></p><p>This time, when the passage between the Fire Spirit Realm and Arch Star opened, this stone played a big role.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Origin Sect was most skilled at divining heavenly secrets.</p><p></p><p>"Seventh Prince, the Heavenly Origin Sect wishes to build the Heaven-Turning Array, we absolutely have no ill intentions." The Heavenly Origin Sect elder's voice carried a hint of pleading.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wang, I believe in the Heavenly Origin Sect's good intentions. But building the Heaven-Turning Array all over the world... this is not something our royal family can decide alone. The Seven Star Families are not of one mind, and cannot agree to such a request. Not to mention, Qin Yuan and the Ancient Witchcraft Nation have long been at odds. Even if we agree, they will certainly refuse. Conversely, if they agree, we would oppose it."</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince's words were already a firm refusal.</p><p></p><p>After all, building the Heaven-Turning Array all over the world was tantamount to establishing military bases in various countries.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Origin Sect people said the array was only for observing heavenly secrets and divining the movements of stars, how could they believe that? What if it formed some great array and usurped their position?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Kaixiang's expression darkened: "Seventh Prince, our Heavenly Origin Sect has no selfish motives in this. It's just that our sect's treasure, the Origin Stone, has divined that within a thousand years, great changes may occur in this world, which could even affect the Fire Spirit Realm. That's why we want to prepare early, building the great array to deal with the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Kaixiang spoke sincerely and earnestly.</p><p></p><p>What he said was indeed what the Origin Stone had predicted.</p><p></p><p>That's why he was in such a hurry to build the Heaven-Turning Array, to deal with the crisis.</p><p></p><p>However, on Arch Star, the strongest were the Qin Yuan Nation and the Ancient Witchcraft Nation. Without convincing these two nations, it couldn't be built.</p><p></p><p>"Events a thousand years in the future are too distant." The Seventh Prince shook his head, then said apologetically, "Elder Wang, I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a man in uniform hurriedly entered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the man, the Seventh Prince's expression changed slightly. When he heard what the man said, his expression became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi has come? Why didn't you bring him directly here? No, I'll go receive him myself, to the main hall!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the Seventh Prince seemed to have forgotten Wang Kaixiang in his haste, and hurriedly walked out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Wang Kaixiang, left in the hall, showed a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi? A cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>He had met the Seventh Prince several times, and the prince had always shown respect to cultivators like them.</p><p></p><p>But such loss of composure as just now was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when meeting him, the Seventh Prince had only used a side hall.</p><p></p><p>When the Ten Divine Infants negotiated with the leaders of the Seven Star Families, it was in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Even an elder at the Divine Infant stage didn't qualify for the main hall when visiting the royal family.</p><p></p><p>This Mr. Qi... could actually go to the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Do we have any Divine Infant elders surnamed Qi in our three realms?" Wang Kaixiang was very confused.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to leave.</p><p></p><p>He would secretly take a look later to see who this so-called Mr. Qi really was.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, outside the royal palace's main hall, the Seventh Prince was jogging, his eyes showing delight.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, sorry to keep you waiting."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, he was like seeing a deity.</p><p></p><p>Especially the peerless beauty in Qi Yuan's arms, who was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he had learned that Qi Yuan had married two wives.</p><p></p><p>He admired Qi Yuan even more in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Ning Tao, a terrifying powerhouse who could easily destroy the Eye in the Sky, was willing to serve at Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I came here because I need your help with something." Qi Yuan directly stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Please speak, Mr. Qi. The royal family is your most loyal servant, always at your service!" The Seventh Prince said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I want to bring more love to this world."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to send some grandfathers and grandmothers to some people in this world."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

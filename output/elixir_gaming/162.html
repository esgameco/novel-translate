        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan, with a head full of white hair, looked at Zhao Ci and said earnestly, "The Wangyue Continent has no future. The Moluo clan simply cannot be resisted. Why don't you become my disciple and join the Canglan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder, I vowed when I was young that in this life I would not take a master, unless it was the strongest Faceless Sword Immortal!" Zhao Ci's gaze was determined. </p><p></p><p>He had grown up hearing stories of the Faceless Sword Immortal since childhood, and deeply admired, even fanatically worshipped, this figure who single-handedly fought against three thousand demonic invaders from other realms.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Zhang Yan snorted coldly. "How short-sighted. The Wangyue Continent's heavenly laws are flawed. The strongest here are merely at the Divine Infant stage. No matter how strong the Faceless Sword Immortal is, he's just an unusual Purple Palace cultivator at best. As for me, I have the potential to reach Purple Palace in this lifetime. If this so-called Faceless Sword Immortal appeared before me, how could he possibly withstand one of my primordial divine abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ci remained silent. He knew he couldn't convince Zhang Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, your third brother was planning to secretly go welcome this so-called Blood Robe Sword Immortal, but was turned into a human swine by Hu Mang," Zhang Yan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ci's hands froze, causing the water in the basin to ripple. A mist seemed to appear before his eyes. </p><p></p><p>His third brother... was an upright person who loved to help others. When they were young, he often took Zhao Ci out horseback riding. </p><p></p><p>Now, he had been turned into a human swine - his palms and feet chopped off, eyeballs gouged out, vocal cords pierced, ears punctured. </p><p></p><p>How could Zhao Ci not feel furious?</p><p></p><p>"My patience is limited. If you don't give me a satisfactory answer within three days, your third brother's fate may become yours," Zhang Yan said coldly. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to communicate properly with this Wangyue Continent native anymore.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood-red light streaked across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and his group of four landed on the city walls outside the imperial capital of the Chuang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, several terrifying auras approached.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw several Divine Infant cultivators from the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily, "Where is the Moluo clan's camp? My sword is thirsting for blood."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Yan stepped forward with a respectful expression: "Are you the senior Blood Robe Sword Immortal? I am Zhang Yan, the elder brother of Mier, the female official under Ye Qiong Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Mier? </p><p></p><p>Wasn't that the arrogant woman who had tried to threaten him on his way to destroy the Palace of Light, whom he had killed with one sword strike?</p><p></p><p>Her brother?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression turned strange. Should he kill him? But thinking of the saying "don't harm the innocent family members", the killing intent in his heart dissipated. </p><p></p><p>He didn't like killing entire families.</p><p></p><p>He also found it strange - the other party was Mier's elder brother, so didn't he know Qi Yuan had killed his sister? Why wasn't Zhang Yan angry at all?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... he was a noble gentleman who believed in reason?</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, he understood.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Wangyue Continent rarely opened.</p><p></p><p>And Zhang Yan had entered the Wangyue Continent a year ago.</p><p></p><p>So, the news of Qi Yuan killing Mier and destroying the Palace of Light may not have reached Zhang Yan's ears yet.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I want to go kill the Moluo clan. Just give me the location and I'll go kill them," Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to leave quickly. He was afraid that if he stayed near Zhang Yan for too long, he wouldn't be able to resist the urge to eliminate the entire family.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we fellow cultivators can handle the Moluo clan. Perhaps you should go elsewhere," Zhang Yan said in a raised tone. "We came here on Ye Qiong Venerable One's orders. I hope senior can understand."</p><p></p><p>He only regarded the Blood Robe Sword Immortal as an ordinary Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So he was respectful, but not overly so.</p><p></p><p>If he had known that Qi Yuan had destroyed the Palace of Light, if he had known Qi Yuan's personality, or rather his unstable mental state, he wouldn't have spoken like this.</p><p></p><p>"I'm naturally inclined to help others. Besides, the Wangyue Continent is my home. Protecting it can't just rely on everyone else - it also needs me, the owner," Qi Yuan said, being a bit more polite since he had killed Zhang Yan's sister after all.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan's eyes held a smile: "Your Majesty the Emperor, why don't you tell us if you need their help?"</p><p></p><p>The man wearing dragon robes was old and frail, with cloudy eyes full of helplessness. He finally spoke: "Thank you for your kindness, senior. We will deal with the Moluo clan ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Zhao Ci saw this scene and felt disappointed. </p><p></p><p>The young girl's expression was also noticeably poor.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan's eyes held a smile: "Senior Blood Robe Sword Immortal, please go back!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the old emperor: "If you're being threatened, just blink your eyes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old emperor was stunned. He who already blinked frequently couldn't help but blink his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's face filled with anger: "How dare you threaten the emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instantly became enraged at the dozen or so Divine Infant cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>In the past, these people could have been considered his ideal targets, worthy of serious attention.</p><p></p><p>But to the current him, these dozen or so Divine Infants were nothing but trash!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's loud shout startled almost everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord couldn't help but say: "According to my study of the law, threatening the emperor is a capital offense punishable by the execution of nine generations of the family. </p><p></p><p>Alas, your mothers... are gone."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infants' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan couldn't help but repeat: "Senior Blood Robe Sword Immortal, we came here on Ye Qiong Venerable One's orders! </p><p></p><p>Please reconsider, senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom True Lord said threatening the emperor will lead to the execution of nine generations of the family.</p><p></p><p>Your elder sister is Ye Qiong Venerable One's female official. Ye Qiong Venerable One can barely be considered part of your nine generations of family, so he's also implicated and can't save himself," Qi Yuan pressed his advantage relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found a reason to condemn Ye Qiong Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>He instantly stood on the moral high ground again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words caused the Divine Infants present to change expression slightly.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what Qi Yuan meant by this.</p><p></p><p>They only felt that this person was outrageously bold.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with a Purple Palace cultivator, they still didn't dare to be too overbearing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they were killed, it would be too unlucky.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, it's not that we're stopping you from killing the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>It's just that... senior is already at Purple Palace realm. If you indiscriminately slaughter Moluo clansmen in the Wangyue Continent,</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid the Purple Palace cultivators of the Moluo clan have already received news and will come to surround you. Senior should be careful!" Zhang Yan said, while also subtly threatening.</p><p></p><p>"Don't change the subject. Execution of nine generations, behead them, behead them!" Qi Yuan shouted.</p><p></p><p>The long sword in his hand unsheathed, emanating a sky-shaking bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan's expression turned ugly: "Senior, are you really going to do this?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, not to mention the matter of executing nine generations, maliciously preventing me from cleaning up the trash in my home - your intentions are despicable!</p><p></p><p>No, you are also trash in my home. You must die!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan paid no heed to anything else. The blood-colored long sword in his hand boiled with energy.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the sword came out, it gave these dozen or so Divine Infants no time to react.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, sixteen fine heads fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Infants inside their bodies, they hadn't even had a chance to emerge before falling silent.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infants never imagined, even until the moment of their deaths, that they would be killed like this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan killed over a dozen Divine Infants without a second thought as soon as there was a disagreement.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhao Ci felt excited inside: "Thank you senior for saving our Chuang Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Zhao Ci knelt on the ground, his face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Chuang Kingdom present also couldn't help but kneel, grateful to this Blood Robe Sword Immortal who had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and everyone present stood up.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to kill the Moluo clan. Send me their address and location.</p><p></p><p>Also, I need cultivation techniques, as many as possible!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The old emperor hurriedly said: "We'll prepare them for senior right away!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the corpses of the Divine Infants on the ground, then looked at Zhao Ci: "Your sword is not bad. May I borrow it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ci was flattered and handed over his sword: "Please use it, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the sword and looked at its design, saying mysteriously: "This sword... is quite special."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Ci proudly said: "This sword was forged in imitation of the Faceless Sword Immortal's sword."</p><p></p><p>"Faceless Sword Immortal?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that events from who knows how many ages ago would still be passed down to the present.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the sword, infusing it with a gush of blood-red energy. He swung the sword and planted it in the official road in front of the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>He said softly: "Canglan Realm cultivators who cross this sword will be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was like a heavenly edict.</p><p></p><p>The blood sword planted in the ground emanated a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>He naturally didn't want to involve this small kingdom in his grudge with Ye Qiong Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>He had killed so many Divine Infants. To prevent Ye Qiong Venerable One's subordinate Divine Infants from retaliating against the Chuang Kingdom, he specially left this sword.</p><p></p><p>This sword could easily kill the Divine Infants at the outpost.</p><p></p><p>As for Purple Palace or even Yin Spirit cultivators coming later, by that time he... would likely have completely taken over the Wangyue Continent and could appear here with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhao Ci's face was excited: "Senior has also heard the story of the Faceless Sword Immortal and the Moon Lady?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when powerful experts from the Hundred Kingdoms Alliance attacked to kill the Faceless Sword Immortal,</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sword Immortal gave his sword to the Moon Lady. The Moon Lady held the sword in the snow and wind, coldly shouting before thousands of troops 'Those who cross this sword will be killed without mercy'. The experts of the Hundred Cities Alliance grew reckless and actually dared to cross the sword, resulting in being killed with one strike." Distant memories surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression softened: "How do you know so clearly?"</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't know about the followers of the Faceless God Cult?" Zhao Ci said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned. </p><p></p><p>When did a Faceless God Cult appear? And he became a "god"?</p><p></p><p>"My third brother also believed in the Faceless Sword God, but unfortunately... he was mutilated by them!" Zhao Ci said through gritted teeth, hating those dozen or so divine infants so much he wanted to eat their flesh and drink their blood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan calmly said: "Bring him over for me to see."</p><p></p><p>These followers of the Faceless God Cult were all his fans. </p><p></p><p>He rarely had fans, so he definitely needed to treat them well.</p><p></p><p>Who told them to have such good taste!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Ci was delighted: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, several soldiers appeared carrying a stretcher.</p><p></p><p>On the stretcher was a person whose limbs had been cut off, no longer resembling a human.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at that person and placed his hand on this prince's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, flesh and blood grew frantically all over the prince's body.</p><p></p><p>The destroyed vocal cords and eyeballs were also regenerated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ci's face showed immense gratitude, with thousands of words in his heart, not knowing how to express them.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Jiang Ya's eyes revealed a surprised look: "I didn't expect the senior Blood Robe Sword God to be so proficient in medicine as well."</p><p></p><p>It was normal for powerful cultivators to use their cultivation to heal people's injuries.</p><p></p><p>But she couldn't understand the method used by the Blood Robe Sword God, though she could see it wasn't using cultivation to heal.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that the Blood Robe Sword God knew some special medical techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know medicine, it's just that this world is mine, so it's simple for me to restore a person's injuries," Qi Yuan said, adding, "What I'm most proficient at is modifying cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ya was stunned.</p><p></p><p>She recalled Qi Yuan who was also skilled at modifying cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The two were really too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the huge difference in cultivation level, she would have thought they were the same person.</p><p></p><p>But... was Qi Yuan really just at Foundation Establishment?</p><p></p><p>Just then, an ethereal voice entered Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God, may I have a word?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirit!</p><p></p><p>That's right, the person who sent him this voice message was none other than a Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful and wait here for a while, I'll go out for a bit and be back soon," Qi Yuan said after some thought, then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't fully taken control of the Wangyue Continent yet when he encountered a Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>His heart was actually a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought of how he still had Ning Tao, and his confidence grew again.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths of time passed, and Qi Yuan stopped by a lake.</p><p></p><p>By the lake, lush green trees flourished, and a woman in snow-white robes stood there. There was a layer of mist on her face, making it impossible to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>[This is a somewhat mysterious woman, with cultivation at the Yin Spirit realm, one step into Heavenly Ascension.]</p><p></p><p>The information obtained by his eyes confirmed for Qi Yuan the cultivation level of this Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could be certain that she was not from the Wangyue Continent, but from the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, an elder from the Eastern Lands? What business do you have with me?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman looked at Qi Yuan and shook her head: "I am not an elder from the Eastern Lands. I came here to persuade you to stop killing members of the Moluo race."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised and curious about the identity of the white-robed woman before him.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, strictly speaking, this was the first Yin Spirit he had ever met.</p><p></p><p>"On the Wangyue Continent, there are five Yin Spirits among the Moluo race, two of whom are Yin Spirits who have taken two steps into Heavenly Ascension. If you continue to slaughter the Moluo race here at will, it will attract the attention of those five Yin Spirits. I'm afraid it won't be long before those five Yin Spirits appear and surround you to kill you."</p><p></p><p>"When they appear, who knows who will be surrounding whom!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>By then, he would have fully taken control of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>His strength would skyrocket, and he didn't believe he still couldn't defeat those five Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by that time, the spiritual energy in his body would probably be fully recovered, and he would also have his Solar Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-robed woman's expression showed neither joy nor sorrow: "Your strength is indeed great, but facing those five Yin Spirits, the outcome is still uncertain."</p><p></p><p>"I have confidence."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman sighed softly: "You... alas."</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? What does this have to do with you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe this Yin Spirit was so kind-hearted as to just be concerned for him.</p><p></p><p>"I secretly entered this realm with important matters to attend to," the white-robed woman said. "If you wake up those five Yin Spirits, I'm afraid it will disrupt my important business."</p><p></p><p>"Then I can only say sorry," Qi Yuan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman looked at the Blood Robe Sword God and after a long while said: "Do you know about the Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"I have a vague understanding," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Where was it vague? He didn't know anything about it at all.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Calamity is approaching, and even we Yin Spirits can barely protect ourselves. Even if we escape to the Wangyue Continent, it's just another compromise, but we still can't escape the fate of greatly reduced cultivation!" The white-robed woman sighed, her words full of worry for the future.</p><p></p><p>"Go on," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have a way to escape from the Cang Lan Realm, escape from the Wangyue Continent, and completely avoid the Great Calamity! As long as you cooperate with me and are willing to help me with one thing, I am willing to share that path with you," the white-robed woman said with sincerity.</p><p></p><p>She didn't trust any of the Yin Spirits in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even trust the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>But since the Blood Robe Sword God was killing indiscriminately here, disrupting her plans, she had no choice but to appear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan frowned: "Is the Great Calamity very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman nodded: "If It wanted to, It could swallow... the Wangyue Continent in one gulp."</p><p></p><p>She didn't say the second half.</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Continent's Heavenly Dao was flawed, so it could be swallowed so easily.</p><p></p><p>If the Wangyue Continent's Heavenly Dao existed, it would be almost impossible for that being to swallow it... It would have to choose a smaller world of lower level to have a chance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was no need to tell the Blood Robe Sword God these things.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" Hearing this, Qi Yuan was shocked internally! The Wangyue Continent was very large, at least as big as a dozen countries.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it could be swallowed in one gulp! How strong was that! Qi Yuan's confidence was instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Is it strong enough to swallow the sun in the sky?" Qi Yuan asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>If it was too strong and could even swallow the sun, he definitely wouldn't be a match now.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful being was already beyond his understanding.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-robed woman couldn't help but laugh: "Are you joking? Even Yin Spirits who can illuminate all the heavens are at least at the Great Venerable realm. Not to mention... the sun is such a powerful celestial god. Even the being behind the Great Calamity couldn't swallow the sun."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But he was still filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>After all, his Golden Core was in another universe.</p><p></p><p>When would he be able to bring his Golden Core here?</p><p></p><p>"There are only a few hundred years left until the Great Calamity. You need to prepare early and leave this realm, otherwise... alas." The white-robed woman sighed again.</p><p></p><p>"Is there any chance the Great Calamity could come early?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"It won't," the white-robed woman shook her head and said with certainty, "It is in a daze."</p><p></p><p>The sense of urgency in Qi Yuan's heart eased a bit more: "That's good then. In a few hundred years, not to mention how many more stars my Solar Golden Core will have swallowed, even my daughter will probably be dominating the ages. There's nothing to fear!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman frowned.</p><p></p><p>She had long heard that the Blood Robe Sword God was crazy.</p><p></p><p>She originally thought this craziness was just temporary, who knew he would be so crazy even regarding such important matters.</p><p></p><p>This was the Great Calamity! The catastrophe for all living beings in the Cang Lan Realm, yet he still had such an attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Are you really unwilling to cooperate with me to leave this realm together?" the white-robed woman confirmed again.</p><p></p><p>"The Cang Lan Realm is my second homeland, and the Wangyue Continent is my third homeland. I won't leave for now," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>A look of disappointment appeared on the white-robed woman's face: "If that's the case, please be more careful in your actions and try to delay using power at the Yin Spirit level as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan nodded. He thought of something and couldn't help but ask, "Big shot, can I ask you a question?"</p><p></p><p>It was rare to meet a Yin Spirit, so he should learn more information about Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just... I have Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, using the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent. If I swallow it in one gulp and take control of the Wangyue Continent again, how strong would I be roughly?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-robed woman's expression became strange: "I've never heard of such Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment. But... for any Heavenly Dao born in a world, to plot against it and swallow it, at least the Great Venerable realm is needed. Even for a world as small as a palm, if it has given birth to a Heavenly Dao, ordinary Yin Spirit Venerables cannot plot against it. Only a Great Venerable can do so. Worlds have different levels, big and small, and Great Venerables also have strong and weak ones. Not all Great Venerables can plot against a Heavenly Dao. For some powerful worlds, even Yang Spirits can do nothing about their Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned upon hearing this and asked expectantly: "Then how strong am I?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman smiled bitterly: "That's not something I can know."</p><p></p><p>PS: Why weren't the stories of the Faceless Sword God widely known during Jin Li's time? That will be revealed later.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to USTRyan for the helmsman reward, and thanks again to ←God Without Tears, Tears of Three Lives, A Plankton Swimming in the Sea of Books for the thousand rewards.

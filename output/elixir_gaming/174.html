        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fei Huang City's Nangong Wuji requests an audience with the deity!" The elderly man in Confucian robes was extremely powerful, able to easily kill even a town's god.</p><p></p><p>However, this time when coming to see the deity of Qingshui Village, his attitude was extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, who had been focused on eating, looked up. He looked at Nangong Wuji and said, "You've also come to eat at the banquet. Come, sit down and help yourself."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wuji looked at Qi Yuan with surprise in his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Because he did not sense a strong divine aura from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that this deity was actually very low-ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Then this old man shall not refuse your kindness." Nangong Wuji walked over.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying also followed curiously. She was very curious how this new deity had managed to kill the god of Shijia Village.</p><p></p><p>She was also curious why a deity would sit together with these ordinary people... to eat at a banquet? She had seen many deities before, and while they may not have been very powerful, they all considered themselves noble and were completely unwilling to sit with mortals.</p><p></p><p>This deity seemed excessively down-to-earth.</p><p></p><p>As Nangong Wuji and Huang Mengying arrived, villagers quickly brought over chairs for them and added some bowls and chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>The villagers all looked curiously at the elderly man and young woman.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were important people from the city.</p><p></p><p>"Is sir the newly born deity?" Huang Mengying couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>If she remembered correctly, the deity of Qingshui Village was a foxtail grass god, not in human form.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so." Qi Yuan focused on eating the banquet food.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, in the Cang Lan Realm, he had already transcended the need for food. No matter how delicious the food, it all tasted the same to him.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps this was due to his increasing age.</p><p></p><p>But eating at the banquet in Shijia Village, he rediscovered the flavors of his childhood.</p><p></p><p>"Why did Your Eminence suddenly kill the new god of Shijia Village?" asked the Confucian-robed elder Nangong Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, any deity could be addressed as "Your Eminence".</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wuji addressing him this way was like calling a deputy director "Director".</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying was also very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the few remaining ancient gods in Fei Huang City hardly dared to provoke new gods.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to act against evil gods were very rare.</p><p></p><p>"I had just arrived here and was hungry. My domain is dirt poor.</p><p></p><p>What to do when hungry? I couldn't just rob others for food, how would that be different from a bandit? So I came up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>When people die, don't they hold a funeral banquet? There would be a feast to eat! I killed their god, and now they're holding a banquet.</p><p></p><p>You see, my idea was correct." Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly, happily eating the banquet food.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nangong Wuji was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying was also completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>This reason sounded far too absurd.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Mengying still said, "Your Eminence killing the evil god of Shijia Village... will likely provoke the evil god of Kuangfeng Town."</p><p></p><p>Shijia Village was under the jurisdiction of Kuangfeng Town, and the relationship between the two evil gods was like that of superior and subordinate.</p><p></p><p>"If I offend them, so be it." Qi Yuan didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>After eating banquet food for several days, the hunger in his stomach had gradually dissipated. It was time to continue eating banquets. </p><p></p><p>No, killing monsters.</p><p></p><p>"The deity of Kuangfeng Town has cultivation far surpassing that of Shijia Village's evil god.</p><p></p><p>Master Nangong Wuji was injured by that evil god." Huang Mengying said, with a sorrowful expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Confucian-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>[Nangong Wuji, Divine Being Level 82.]</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, qualified to play the suona for me.</p><p></p><p>My orchestra is still short one person, want to join?" Qi Yuan looked at Nangong Wuji expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wuji's strength, according to the Cang Lan Realm's classification, would be considered late Purple Palace stage.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that eating a banquet in a village, he'd encounter a late Purple Palace cultivator coming to freeload.</p><p></p><p>The waters of this world run deep.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had traveled all over East and West in the Great Shang Kingdom, and rarely encountered even a late Divine Infant stage cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nangong Wuji didn't understand Qi Yuan's words, and just smiled awkwardly, "What Miss Huang said is true. Your Eminence killing the evil god has thoroughly offended the evil god faction. Perhaps before long, the evil god's minions will find their way here."</p><p></p><p>"This girl is the daughter of the City Lord of Fei Huang City. Your Eminence might as well leave Qingshui Village and come to our Fei Huang City.</p><p></p><p>This girl will establish a temple for Your Eminence and build a divine statue!" Huang Mengying was trying to recruit Qi Yuan, and also trying to save his life.</p><p></p><p>Any ancient gods outside who dared to kill new gods would all be surrounded and killed by the new gods, with extremely miserable ends.</p><p></p><p>"No need, don't mention this again. I will not leave Qingshui Village." Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>His mission was to protect Qingshui Village, how could he possibly leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's reaction, Huang Mengying knew she couldn't persuade him, and could only sigh softly.</p><p></p><p>She had already explained the severity of the situation, but if he wouldn't listen, there was nothing she could do.</p><p></p><p>She felt somewhat regretful that Fei Huang City's power was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could new gods act so freely.</p><p></p><p>"This is pig's ear, have some." Qi Yuan picked up a piece of pig's ear for Nangong Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nangong Wuji smiled and declined, "I don't eat meat."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned, "Are you a monk? No, your hair is quite thick. Are you a vegetarian?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wuji didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words, and said, "I am a follower of the Foodless Holy Mother."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's confused expression, Huang Mengying explained, "The Foodless Holy Mother is a powerful ancient god.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother believes that when people are born, they are at their purest, and become turbid after walking through the world.</p><p></p><p>The food eaten, the spiritual energy cultivated, the air breathed in and out, are all harmful to the body and pollute oneself.</p><p></p><p>Only by abstaining from food, cutting off from heaven and earth, can one forge a pure crystal-like self!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan didn't know how to respond for a moment, "This Foodless Holy Mother seems to have some issues with her head."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this assessment, Nangong Wuji didn't get angry.</p><p></p><p>Because almost no one approved of his faith.</p><p></p><p>And he wasn't truly abstaining from food either.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, Huang Mengying ate quite a bit, while Nangong Wuji simply drank some water.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as the banquet ended, Huang Mengying said, "If Your Eminence encounters any difficulties, you can come to our Fei Huang City. The gates of Fei Huang City will always be open for Your Eminence."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded, taking Huang Mengying's words to heart.</p><p></p><p>Watching Huang Mengying and Nangong Wuji leave, Qi Yuan sat at the banquet table.</p><p></p><p>He spoke, "Whose banquet should we hold tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man Wang Zhongshan quickly said, "Divine One, Shi Gangqiang."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, make it a grand affair." Qi Yuan waved his hand magnanimously.</p><p></p><p>At this point, a troubled expression appeared on Wang Zhongshan's face, "We don't have much pork left in stock in Shijia Village."</p><p></p><p>They had been holding banquets every day for the past few days, and had already slaughtered several pigs in Shijia Village.</p><p></p><p>Several hundred people eating lavish banquets every day, the food was very sumptuous.</p><p></p><p>There were still plenty of grain stocks, but the pigs were gone.</p><p></p><p>"No more pigs?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became troubled, "Which nearby village has a lot of pigs?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>A murmuring voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Civet, can you capture Nangong Wuji?" A man dressed in fine silks and satins, looking quite wealthy, asked.</p><p></p><p>In the temple, the divine statue opened its eyes, "His strength is very great, he escaped.</p><p></p><p>But I also severely injured him. He won't be able to fight strong opponents again for three years."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the wealthy man's face lit up with joy, "As expected of Lord Civet."</p><p></p><p>"When will you be able to welcome that Eminence's descent?" The evil god Civet asked.</p><p></p><p>The "Eminence" he referred to was a new god, that is, a true god.</p><p></p><p>A troubled expression appeared on the wealthy man's face, "Currently Fei Huang City is still under the City Lord's control.</p><p></p><p>We also don't know if the ancient god Yuan is still alive. This matter requires careful planning."</p><p></p><p>"You need to hurry." The evil god Civet spoke, his voice carrying a hint of violence.</p><p></p><p>The wealthy man's heart tightened, and he quickly said, "Don't worry my lord, within three years, we will definitely summon forth the new god."</p><p></p><p>The evil god Civet's gaze surged, "Too slow, too slow."</p><p></p><p>The wealthy man didn't dare speak.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart he grumbled.</p><p></p><p>If you think it's too slow, why don't you attack Fei Huang City yourself?</p><p></p><p>Is it because you don't want to?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't say these things out loud.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, the wealthy man said, "Recently we received an order that a woman related to an ancient god has wandered into the area near Kuangfeng Town. Please, my lord, take action to capture her."</p><p></p><p>"Ancient god? Which one?"</p><p></p><p>"This lowly one doesn't know, probably... a true god."</p><p></p><p>"A true god? This deity will remember.</p><p></p><p>What's her name, what does she look like?"</p><p></p><p>"Her name is... Qi Qi. This is her portrait."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On a dark mountain path, the young woman Qi Qi's eyes held a resolute look.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, the maid Xiao Xue was panting, "Young Miss, how much further until we arrive?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the map, we're almost there." Qi Qi's gaze was determined.</p><p></p><p>She came from a great clan. When she was young, an evil god descended, and all her clansmen perished.</p><p></p><p>Only she survived, carrying the clan's token, and was now heading towards a remote small village.</p><p></p><p>According to the records in the clan token, the divine statue in that remote small village was crafted by her clansmen.</p><p></p><p>Within the divine statue was hidden a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Treasure, born of yin in stone.</p><p></p><p>This treasure... can create true gods! Now, new gods and ancient gods are clashing. </p><p></p><p>The ancient gods have always been at a disadvantage, because new gods emerge continuously.</p><p></p><p>When ancient gods fall, they fall completely, with no new ancient gods being born.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, heaven and earth underwent great changes. The divine beings of this world could no longer break through limits on their own to enter the realm of true gods.</p><p></p><p>So, when an ancient god is lost, it's a permanent loss.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are still fragments of treasures scattered across the land, like the yin-born stone, that can help one enter the realm of true gods. </p><p></p><p>However, such treasures are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the number of ancient gods increasing is far lower than the number falling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi came to Qingshui Village this time to take the yin-born stone from inside the divine statue.</p><p></p><p>This way, she could create a new ancient god.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps she could even avenge her people.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, was what the old woman we met on the road earlier said true?" the maid asked, remembering something.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, while traveling, they had encountered a deranged old woman.</p><p></p><p>That old woman said Qi Qi was of noble birth, and told Qi Qi to go with her.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Qi Qi didn't go with the deranged old woman.</p><p></p><p>She laughed self-mockingly: "My parents are dead. What use is a noble birth now?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the maid Xiao Xue nodded, agreeing.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something else, she continued: "Miss, if the guardian deity of Qingshui Village is still there, how will we get our hands on his divine statue?"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, to obtain something from inside a divine statue requires the deity's permission.</p><p></p><p>After all, for deities, the divine statue is like their second body.</p><p></p><p>"I brought a treasure this time that can create an even more precious divine statue.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, I'll create a statue and trade with that deity.</p><p></p><p>Plus, I have a token, hehe." Qi Qi's eyes lit up as she mentioned this.</p><p></p><p>When her ancestors created the divine statue long ago, they made an agreement with it.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Qi Qi's gaze became somewhat dejected: "I heard that Qingshui Village seems to be finished. Perhaps we won't see that deity.</p><p></p><p>That divine statue may be empty, with no deity residing in it."</p><p></p><p>Now, evil gods have descended, and new and old deities are clashing.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods have always been at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Many villages have already become playgrounds for evil gods.</p><p></p><p>All the common people have lost their own consciousness, becoming puppets that only know how to worship evil gods, becoming part of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Just like Stone Family Village - give that evil god another hundred years,</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Stone Family Village will slowly turn into walking corpses, becoming part of the evil god.</p><p></p><p>And the evil god's own power will be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>After about a few hours passed, Qi Qi and her maid Xiao Xue finally arrived at Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the dilapidated village, Qi Qi's eyes revealed a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>Originally in the mortal realm, everyone lived in peace and contentment.</p><p></p><p>But now... on one side unbearable suffering, on the other... all turned into walking corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, where are the villagers of Qingshui Village, and where is the great deity?" Qi Qi immediately went up to ask an old woman she saw.</p><p></p><p>The old woman looked at Qi Qi warily: "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, my name is Qi Qi, I'm from the Heavenly Mansion..."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mansion?" The old woman looked at Qi Qi, confirming her bloodline, her eyes filled with grief, "You're also of the ancient clan's bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, when evil gods descended, the people of the Heavenly Mansion refused to worship them.</p><p></p><p>The gods were enraged and destroyed the city. The Heavenly Mansion turned to scorched earth, all its people died in battle.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Heavenly Mansion also had the bloodline of the ancient clan, and were unwilling to worship new gods.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the old woman would trust someone with the same bloodline much more.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Qi nodded, her expression seemingly without joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"The villagers of our village, under the leadership of the great deity, went to attack the evil god of Chenxi Village.</p><p></p><p>The evil god said there are many pigs in Chenxi Village, kill the evil god and have a feast." This old woman was also cheerful in nature, her mouth almost drooling, where was the grief from earlier?</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>What did this have to do with anything?</p><p></p><p>She was also puzzled, how could the deity of Qingshui Village go to attack an evil god?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this deity was somewhat strong? But the divine statue of Qingshui Village was created by the Qi family, she knew best what level it was, how could it give birth to a powerful deity?</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, where is Chenxi Village?" Qi Qi couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Follow that main road ahead, go straight for three li, when you see a pavilion, turn right..."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, grandmother!" Qi Qi hurriedly set off towards Chenxi Village with her maid Xiao Xue.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Xiao Xue's face showed a puzzled expression: "Miss, how can the deity of Qingshui Village be so bold as to dare lay hands on an evil god!</p><p></p><p>Feihuang City... is almost all fallen territory!"</p><p></p><p>Now the evil gods and ancient gods are clashing fiercely, opening up many battlefields.</p><p></p><p>Different battlefields have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the new gods are more powerful.</p><p></p><p>And Feihuang City belongs to the fallen areas.</p><p></p><p>The cities near Feihuang City have been mostly occupied by new gods.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment, the ancient gods have always been at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>So, many of these ancient gods choose not to resist, not to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Some even choose to become lackeys of the new gods.</p><p></p><p>For the deity of Qingshui Village to dare attack an evil god was unexpected.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the deity of Qingshui Village is also a righteous elder who doesn't want to see evil gods slaughter the masses!" Qi Qi hadn't met the deity of Qingshui Village yet, but already felt admiration for them in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She felt this was a great deity, willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Such ancient gods may be more likely to die in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But they are definitely worthy of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Such elders are most likely to be killed by evil gods, while those ancient gods who live in cowardice and submit to new gods can live longer. This world is too unfair!" Xiao Xue couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The two quickened their pace towards Chenxi Village.</p><p></p><p>At this time, suddenly, an urgent voice came:</p><p></p><p>"You're a divine infant cultivator, yet you can't even catch a pig?!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, catch these pigs quickly, otherwise how can we have a feast!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi and Xiao Xue looked over to see a large group of pigs frantically running towards them.</p><p></p><p>These pigs were all robust and strong, and all had cultivation levels, mostly at the Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>The pigs were fleeing wildly, kicking up dust.</p><p></p><p>Behind the hundreds of pigs, a handsome man with a long sword on his back had his hands in his pockets, his left foot stepping on a fat domestic pig, cursing loudly.</p><p></p><p>"If I didn't need to catch them alive, I'd cut off all these pigs' heads with one sword." As the handsome man spoke, he was emanating divine light.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's eyes widened: "Is he the deity of Qingshui Village?"</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Just now in their minds, they had imagined the majestic image of Qingshui Village's deity, but now they're told he's catching pigs?</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what are you standing there for, hurry up and help block the pigs, I'll reward you with a pig's tail to eat!" Qi Yuan shouted from afar.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu was also grabbing a pig in each hand, looking towards Qi Qi as if seeking help.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi had no choice but to take out an array disk from her bosom.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Yin-Yang Dragon Trapping Array! As soon as this array disk appeared, the space around Qi Qi changed greatly. A hundred golden-armored divine generals appeared, holding long spears, their expressions solemn, advancing forward.</p><p></p><p>"Trap!"</p><p></p><p>The hundred golden-armored divine generals shouted, their long spears turning into celestial ropes, binding all the running domestic pigs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but clap: "Not bad, not bad, I'll reward you with a pig's head later."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi felt somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful array, yet she used it to trap pigs.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Village Chief Yu Lu and Divine Official Shen Tu came over, giving Qi Qi an approving look.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, little girl!"</p><p></p><p>"You've got skills, trapping hundreds of pigs just like that."</p><p></p><p>Being praised by these people, Qi Qi's toes curled up, almost digging out a villa.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's nothing." Qi Qi smiled awkwardly yet politely.</p><p></p><p>She smiled as she watched the villagers carry the pigs away. She walked towards the handsome-looking man, trying hard to keep her composure.</p><p></p><p>But when she saw the pig under his foot that kept howling, she couldn't help but twitch the corners of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the guardian deity of Qingshui Village? This humble girl is Qi Qi, from the Heavenly Mansion."</p><p></p><p>PS: Regarding updates, the update times are actually unstable, it's really not laziness.

        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As long as the distance between Qi Yuan and Xiao Jia was not too far, even if they were not together and could not see each other, Qi Yuan could use this great skill to merge with her.</p><p></p><p>When using this skill, Qi Yuan could enjoy Xiao Jia's authority.</p><p></p><p>Rip Clothes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attacks always had the property of breaking armor against clothes and armor.</p><p></p><p>These two skills were quite good.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan discovered that by normally leveling up to level 90, he could also obtain two skills.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to him getting two skills for free.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia left his body, and for some reason, Qi Yuan felt that he and this clothing monster seemed to have some innate connection.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xiao Jia, looking at her intently.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see her eyes, but he couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Sure you don't want a divorce?" Qi Yuan said, "Once this map is cleared, I might have to leave."</p><p></p><p>In the past, there were love stories like Xu Xian and the Snake Demon, Dong Yong and the Seven Fairy Maidens, the Gibbon Monkey and the Sparrow Fairy, but no one had ever seen a human and an NPC fall in love.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the NPC being a piece of clothing.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Xiao Jia's body trembled, and a wooden plaque fell down, with a man drawn on it and the words "Husband" written.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up the wooden plaque and thought for a while: "Then you're just my game's CP. We're now in a divorce cooling-off period."</p><p></p><p>When he completed the game, it would be the end.</p><p></p><p>Another wooden plaque slid out of Xiao Jia's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Stick together.</p><p></p><p>If the little thing had eyes, it would surely be looking at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"No sticking!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>What's the point of sticking together? It's better to merge.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Xiao Jia and slowly said, "Let's merge."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xiao Jia did not refuse, Qi Yuan used the skill "Comrades-in-Arms."</p><p></p><p>Comrades-in-Arms was different from Xiao Jia actively merging with him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see the difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Xiao Jia was printed on his chest again.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red armor appeared on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Xiao Jia's active possession, this armor was covered in blood-red thorns, looking more dangerous and eerie, with the blood-red color being more vivid, not the previous dark red.</p><p></p><p>If Xiao Jia's active possession emphasized defense and protection, then Qi Yuan's Comrades-in-Arms merger focused on attack.</p><p></p><p>The +5 level bonus still existed.</p><p></p><p>This kind of bonus was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"If I wear this armor and charge into the clothing monsters, except for the Forbidden Area's master, who can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that his game progress had sped up a bit.</p><p></p><p>"What about the shared authority?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"One-third control over the Clothing Taboo?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned, not expecting this.</p><p></p><p>But Xiao Jia's type of control was obviously different from Qi Yuan's previous control over the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>According to the game's explanation, Xiao Jia's was a soft control, while Qi Yuan's was a hard control.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head, and through the red armor, he saw Xiao Jia printed on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"It seems she is also a big boss of the Clothing Taboo.</p><p></p><p>Since we can share, then I don't have to kill her?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered something.</p><p></p><p>To obtain the Heavenly Dao fragments and successfully establish the Heavenly Dao foundation, he needed to clear the Clothing Taboo.</p><p></p><p>This game should also be completed.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan sometimes seemed to lack a plan, he wouldn't make mistakes at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>"Authority."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed.</p><p></p><p>This time, he appeared in the cemetery he had been to before.</p><p></p><p>His ten-meter-tall figure in this place was like a giant.</p><p></p><p>He stared at a tomb, and his figure shrank to normal human size.</p><p></p><p>The tomb was quite ordinary, and there was even a hole through which white centipedes could be seen crawling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly entered the hole.</p><p></p><p>With the authority shared by Xiao Jia, Qi Yuan knew that beneath this tomb was an ancient underground palace.</p><p></p><p>In the underground palace, the emperors of the Clothing Taboo throughout history were buried.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>It's nothing much.</p><p></p><p>He held the great divine sword, the red metal flowing, also covering his great divine sword.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the threatening underground palace, or perhaps because of the possession of the little bride, the main gate to Qi Yuan was wide open.</p><p></p><p>Walking in the underground palace, Qi Yuan looked at the surrounding architecture, somewhat puzzled: "To be able to build such an underground palace shows that the Clothing Monsters still have intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Why, all the Clothing Monsters I see are... murderous, frenzied and without wisdom?"</p><p></p><p>In the game, even if Qi Yuan did not pull the aggro of the NPC mobs, these mobs would still actively attack him. </p><p></p><p>As if those mobs wanted to tear apart all living things in the world.</p><p></p><p>But the little bride was different from the NPCs Qi Yuan saw.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered the information he saw about the Ugly Clothing Monster Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"The Fallen Forbidden Zone Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the little bride is not fallen?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he might have discovered the truth of the matter.</p><p></p><p>He entered the depths of the underground palace, suddenly... Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Have I entered the Mausoleum of the First Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were row upon row of black armored robes.</p><p></p><p>Some held long spears, some held halberds.</p><p></p><p>They stood in the pits, like a well-organized army, motionless, but Qi Yuan still felt a sense of coldness and military austerity.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, dense and numerous, thousands upon thousands.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were just like the Terracotta Warriors.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan had a feeling that once they were awakened, they would be the mightiest army in this world, invincible.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was drawn to a stone stele.</p><p></p><p>On the stele were densely written words.</p><p></p><p>"The four divisions of the Divine Court, the Clothing Division, the Bride Clothing Princess, the wife of the Celestial Deity in charge.</p><p></p><p>Gather the battle robes of the world, support the grandeur of the Divine Court, the demonic beasts are shocked and alarmed, the world can be clothed!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at it carefully.</p><p></p><p>This stele recorded many things, and also recorded a mighty and prosperous era.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Celestial Deities established the Divine Court, commanding the four divisions, shaking the world, and bringing peace to the four seas.</p><p></p><p>The Clothing Division was the most prominent of the four divisions, its leader in charge of killing and destruction.</p><p></p><p>The Clothing Division's elite troops had even trampled the ten-thousand-mountain range and the endless plains, driving the demonic tribes to the icy and snowy wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Clothing Division was the Bride Clothing Princess, who was also the wife of the Celestial Deity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of the little bride.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the little bride is related to this Bride Clothing Goddess?</p><p></p><p>He continued to look.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Court ruled the four seas and eight horizons, and the world enjoyed peace for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Court, commanding the four divisions, was invincible in the world.</p><p></p><p>But the invincible also means there are enemies from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, there was an enemy from the outside world, invading the Yueyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Divine Court, that powerful Celestial Deity, led the troops to meet the enemy.</p><p></p><p>But he never returned.</p><p></p><p>The four divisions also gradually declined because of this.</p><p></p><p>And the last elite troops of the Clothing Division were buried in the underground palace, waiting for the day they would revive, to fight for the Celestial Deity, and for the world.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the setting of this game?"</p><p></p><p>"The four great forbidden lands must be the four great divisions of the Divine Court."</p><p></p><p>"The biggest boss must be that external enemy."</p><p></p><p>"My mission goal must be to defeat the external enemy, protect the world, and then have the Heavenly Dao reward me?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, by wearing the Imperial Armor, I have to become the great hero who protects the world!"</p><p></p><p>As a non-hardcore gamer, this was Qi Yuan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>"I thought the task of defending a country for Jinli was difficult, but it seems this is the true hell difficulty!"</p><p></p><p>According to the records, the Divine Court ruled the world, high and mighty, with nearly a hundred human kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"To lay the foundation of the Heavenly Dao, I must go all out!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, I am the man of the little bride!"</p><p></p><p>Directly leveling up five levels! That's too strong!...</p><p></p><p>On the Yueyue Continent, in some place, there were murmuring sounds, as if whispering in secret.</p><p></p><p>Recommended a good brother's novel: "I Overlook the Ages Above the River of Time!" Below is the recommendation and a link, you can directly collect and read it, those who like it can go and have a look!</p><p>Recommendation: Watching the peerless female immortals, demonic women, and Confucian female saints of the future come to me... I never thought the history I experienced would come true!</p><p>Many thanks to [Cultivating for 40,000 Years] for the donation!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

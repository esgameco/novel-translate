        <h1>Chapter 198</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village. The Great Thunder Lord watched the expedition team depart, his eyes still filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They're really setting out? Beside him, Zhu Zhuangshi looked at the mighty Black Dog marching off proudly, his eyes full of envy. </p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Great Thunder Lord next to him, suddenly feeling much bolder.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he would have kowtowed and knelt before such a powerful True God.</p><p></p><p>But after spending time with the Guardian God, he had lost all sense of reverence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Guardian God still commanded respect.</p><p></p><p>"You'll get used to scenes like this after seeing them enough times," Zhu Zhuangshi shared with the Great Thunder Lord, speaking as someone with experience.</p><p></p><p>Following the Guardian God, which of the elders wasn't immune to such scenes? The Great Thunder Lord glanced at Zhu Zhuangshi and said dismissively, "Someone who was pinned to the ground by a dog and didn't dare get on the table is not worthy of speaking to me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi's experienced demeanor instantly vanished, replaced by a pitiful expression.</p><p></p><p>Recently at a banquet, Zhu Zhuangshi had gotten drunk and hugged the Black Dog while reminiscing about the glorious past. </p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Black Dog had pinned him down directly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhongshan standing nearby had immediately teased Zhu Zhuangshi, saying: "My sworn brother is not what he used to be. How dare you act so carelessly with him?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhongshan's sworn brother was the Black Dog.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the pitiful expression on Zhu Zhuangshi's face deepened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>Officials stood in two rows lined up outside the city.</p><p></p><p>These officials had varying expressions.</p><p></p><p>Some looked expectant, some uneasy, some anguished.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Ji, why did you stay behind?" A mustachioed man in cyan robes looked tall and imposing, wearing a gray belt, his whole demeanor full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buran glanced at Wang Chunfeng but remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Chunfeng didn't get angry. He cupped his hands and said amiably, "We'll be colleagues from now on. I'll need your guidance in the future."</p><p></p><p>Feiwu City had no Ancient Gods, only a City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buran was the Chief Commander in the City Lord's mansion and also led a battalion.</p><p></p><p>Now, with sudden changes, the important figures of Feiwu City had chosen to flee.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Ji Buran was the highest-ranking person among those who hadn't left Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>As for Wang Chunfeng, he was a merchant with no official position. With the new god about to take over Feiwu City, he was the first to pledge loyalty, thus becoming a representative of the new god's forces.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they stood outside the city, waiting to welcome the new god's convoy.</p><p></p><p>These officials harbored various intentions as they stood outside the city.</p><p></p><p>The light rain meant nothing to cultivators like them.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunfeng looked at Ji Buran, his eyes smiling: "Does Commander Ji look down on me as a mere merchant?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Buran finally looked at Wang Chunfeng seriously, his voice gruff and succinct: "Not at all."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. I've always admired Commander Ji," Wang Chunfeng smiled warmly. "When the lord arrives, we must work together to serve the deity."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the new god, Wang Chunfeng's eyes filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>The new god would assimilate some subjects, but not all of them.</p><p></p><p>The new god had also promised that loyal and devoted servants could leave the Mortal Heart Realm with the deity and attain longevity.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunfeng's foundation was in Feiwu City. If he left, all his life's work would be lost, so he chose to stay.</p><p></p><p>There were many opportunists like him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most people in Feiwu City were ordinary citizens who were too old or weak to leave.</p><p></p><p>Even those with Foundation Establishment or Core Formation cultivation levels might be sending themselves to their deaths if they left Feiwu City in the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buran had chosen to stay out of concern for the citizens under his care.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ji Buran looked at Wang Chunfeng and nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Chunfeng seemed to think of something and said: "Commander Ji, with the new god's arrival imminent, we subjects should do something. </p><p></p><p>We are planning to hold a banquet of young girls. Commander Ji knows Feiwu City best, so please help gather the girls."</p><p></p><p>A fierce light flashed in Ji Buran's eyes, but he quickly suppressed it: "Feiwu City has many urgent matters to attend to. Holding a banquet of young girls should be carefully considered."</p><p></p><p>"Does Commander Ji not want to?" The smile in Wang Chunfeng's eyes deepened.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Anger flashed in Ji Buran's eyes as he glanced at Wang Chunfeng.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunfeng clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, two guards brought over a child who looked about seven or eight years old.</p><p></p><p>The child struggled against their grip.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunfeng smiled and said: "If Commander Ji can't bear to hold a banquet of young girls, then let's hold one for young boys. I've made a small effort and caught one."</p><p></p><p>"You!" Ji Buran exploded in anger.</p><p></p><p>Because the child Wang Chunfeng had brought was his own young son.</p><p></p><p>He had chosen to stay in Feiwu City, sharing its fate.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forced his family to do the same.</p><p></p><p>So he had sent his family out of the city.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined they would be captured by Wang Chunfeng.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be furious! The aura of a Purple Palace Realm cultivator at the peak stage erupted from him in that moment. He wanted to kill!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Chunfeng calmly said: "The lord is about to arrive. Does Commander Ji intend to rebel?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunfeng had always intended to vie for power and plot against Ji Buran, aiming to become the evil god's most trusted subordinate.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buran's aura surged throughout his body as he wanted to attack, but he suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of a suona horn came from ahead.</p><p></p><p>Everyone outside the city immediately looked over.</p><p></p><p>They saw a long procession slowly advancing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At the front were over a dozen middle-aged women dressed in white mourning clothes. As they flew through the sky, they wailed loudly, overcome with grief.</p><p></p><p>The mournful suona music was sorrowful and moving, bringing pain to all who heard it, as if they were there themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Whose funeral procession is this, heading into the city? Today is the day the new god arrives. If they see this and become enraged, we'll all suffer!" Wang Chunfeng shouted angrily. "Someone go drive away that group of mourners!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ji Buran couldn't help saying: "Show respect for the dead."</p><p></p><p>"Don't these ignorant commoners know what day it is? Choosing to hold a funeral today is unforgivable!" Wang Chunfeng truly feared the funeral procession would offend the new god.</p><p></p><p>He was also very confused about why anyone would be holding a funeral heading into the city at this time.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't figure it out, and his worst fears finally came true.</p><p></p><p>Just then, celestial music rang out. In the sky above, twelve beautiful fairy maidens appeared, their shoulders and chests revealing large patches of snow-white skin, their calves wrapped in sheer stockings, looking extremely alluring.</p><p></p><p>A giant auspicious beast pulled a divine carriage, following closely behind the fairies.</p><p></p><p>This procession finally met the funeral procession in the air.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunfeng's heart sank, filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the golden-eyed man in the divine carriage had his eyes half-closed, with a very attractive young woman sitting in his arms.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a soft feminine voice came from outside the carriage: "Great Deity, there is a funeral procession blocking the way ahead."</p><p></p><p>The golden-eyed man opened his eyes, looking impatient: "How big is their coffin? Put all the others inside it."</p><p></p><p>The woman outside heard this and paused: "They... don't have a coffin."</p><p></p><p>She had just noticed that the procession in the distance looked like a funeral, but upon closer inspection, it wasn't quite right.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a lazy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Might that be Lord of Romantic Charms ahead?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the golden-eyed man instantly sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>However, as a new god in conquered territory, he was very bold: "Speak."</p><p></p><p>"Our funeral procession is missing a key figure. Would you be willing to condescend to play the role of a corpse?" The voice was light and airy, but carried an undeniable tone.</p><p></p><p>These words echoed outside the city.</p><p></p><p>The officials waiting outside were stunned.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't a funeral procession, but troublemakers! Ji Buran was also puzzled - who would dare... such boldness!</p><p></p><p>In the current conquered territories, the Ancient Gods were all in fear for their lives. What Ancient God would come to manage Feiwu City! He looked towards the funeral procession, a strange light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" The divine carriage of the Lord of Romantic Charms exploded along with his furious shout. The attractive woman in his arms also exploded into a bloody mess.</p><p></p><p>He glared angrily at the crowd ahead, killing intent flashing in his eyes: "State your name! I don't kill nameless nobodies!"</p><p></p><p>"Qingshui Village, Origin Sky</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency," Qi Yuan said leisurely, "Alright, can I borrow your corpse now?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Chunfeng heard this and became a bit bolder: "How dare you be disrespectful to the divine lord, you're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>This was his best chance to perform! Didn't he see the divine lord still had the upper hand, ready to kill the villain?</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Elegant Lord who seemed about to display his divine might suddenly shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"I've remembered your name, my brother-in-law won't let you off!"</p><p></p><p>After leaving this threat, the Elegant Lord directly chose to flee. Although he hadn't sensed any dangerous aura, in this situation, it was still better to run away.</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord's escape shocked Wang Chunfeng, his jaw dropping.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched the fleeing Elegant Lord and couldn't help but sigh: "Even grander than me, I thought he was a heroic figure, but turns out he's a coward."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan sighed, four true gods suddenly appeared in front of the Elegant Lord.</p><p></p><p>These four true gods were none other than four arhats.</p><p></p><p>They were the Joyous Arhat, the Long-Browed Arhat, the Door-Keeping Arhat, and the Happy Arhat.</p><p></p><p>The four arhats who had taken a step into heaven descended, blocking the Elegant Lord's escape route.</p><p></p><p>"Let us borrow your corpse!"</p><p></p><p>The four arhats spoke simultaneously, their voices like thunderclaps.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these four arhats, the Elegant Lord's face froze: "Even the ancient gods of Feilingfu have come here? No, you're not the ancient gods of Feilingfu!"</p><p></p><p>These four arhats were not any of the ancient gods in his memory.</p><p></p><p>The four arhats couldn't be bothered to waste words with the Elegant Lord and attacked together.</p><p></p><p>Arhat Fist! This was both a martial art and a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Eight fists came striking at the Elegant Lord, who felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>Although he had opened four divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>In theory, with one divine aperture at the heaven-stepping level, he should be able to easily fight four opponents.</p><p></p><p>But facing these four before him, he felt that even facing one would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth are you?" the Elegant Lord shouted, struggling to hold on.</p><p></p><p>These four, if allowed to grow, would surely become great lords.</p><p></p><p>And not just ordinary great lords at that.</p><p></p><p>The four arhats couldn't care less about the Elegant Lord's words.</p><p></p><p>The four moved as one, all punching at the Elegant Lord.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding area kept collapsing.</p><p></p><p>The Mortal Heart Realm was very stable, with ordinary yin gods only able to destroy a city with their full power attack.</p><p></p><p>If not for one arhat protecting them, the clash of these true gods would have affected their side as well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Elegant Lord was both fighting and trying to persuade them to surrender.</p><p></p><p>"Your talents, even in our new god faction, would be first-rate. Why serve the ancient gods?"</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord was speaking the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Let us borrow your corpse!" The four arhats ignored the Elegant Lord's persuasion, repeating Qi Yuan's earlier words.</p><p></p><p>The battle grew fiercer, entering a white-hot stage.</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord was anxious inside, pondering how to break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>The only way was to capture the leader first.</p><p></p><p>With four true gods here, that Blue Water Village guardian deity's side must be short-handed, with only one true god protecting the others.</p><p></p><p>If he could sneak over and instantly capture Qi Yuan, he could escape this predicament.</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord fought while moving towards Qi Yuan's direction.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow, at this rate, it'll delay the feast," Qi Yuan watched the clash of true gods with boredom, "Four Heavenly Kings, you..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped mid-sentence, as there was no need to continue.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the divine power on the Elegant Lord's body suddenly surged, and he frantically charged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His eyes held a smug smile: "I've been through divine wars before, emerging from the slaughter. How can you pampered locals fight me?"</p><p></p><p>He charged at Qi Yuan, extremely pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>As the Elegant Lord's voice rang out, suddenly the Four Heavenly Kings blocked in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The four beautiful women, each with power at the true god level.</p><p></p><p>As the Four Heavenly Kings made their move, the remaining twelve arhats also formed a human tower to surround and protect Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from these arhats was also at the true god level.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the smile froze on the Elegant Lord's face. He swallowed hard, somewhat in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Sixteen true gods attacked simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of pipa, spinning umbrellas, and bells filled the air.</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord saw twelve iron fists rushing straight for his face.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine energy swept out.</p><p></p><p>Encountering such a strong attack, the Elegant Lord's divine apertures shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, the iron fists continued.</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord's divine apertures couldn't withstand it, breaking one by one.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched the Elegant Lord's miserable state and couldn't help but sigh: "If you had lent me your corpse earlier, you wouldn't be so wretched.</p><p></p><p>If I was in a good mood, I might have even let your spirit tablet sit at the table for a feast."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's sigh, the Elegant Lord was beaten to death by the iron fists.</p><p></p><p>How could the Elegant Lord, a mere youngster, withstand the iron fists of over a dozen burly men?</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes as he turned his gaze to the officials outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Those officials were all dumbfounded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Qi Yuan with deep fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Elegant Lord had actually been killed! And by... twenty true gods! Where did Feilingfu get so many true gods?</p><p></p><p>"Let the feast begin," A cold glint flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes, "Those who were ready to help the evil god just now, kill them all. It's perfect... we can extend the feast by another day."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, the Dragon-Subduing Arhat and Tiger-Taming Arhat charged into the crowd, as if entering unoccupied territory.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, screams of agony, wails, and howls of pain rang out.</p><p></p><p>The officials who were high and mighty just moments ago, viewing the masses as insects, were as fragile as paper in the hands of the Dragon-Subduing Arhat and Tiger-Taming Arhat.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ji Buran, his voice becoming lazy again: "I have a task for you."</p><p></p><p>Ji Buran was nervous inside but put on a serious face: "Please speak, Your Excellency!"</p><p></p><p>Before him was an ancient god, an ancient god who dared to stand up for Feiwu City. Ji Buran was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"We've come all the way to Feiwu City just to hold a feast for the Elegant Lord.</p><p></p><p>We've brought the chef, the mourners, and the musicians, but we didn't bring any food.</p><p></p><p>Go prepare some, bring some food over," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The villagers behind him, hearing about the feast, all felt their appetites opening up.</p><p></p><p>Following Qi Yuan, the happiest thing for them was having feasts.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Buran was a bit confused, finally nodding: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand this guardian deity of Blue Water Village, but he felt that it surely wasn't as simple as just holding a feast.</p><p></p><p>This move must have deeper meaning!</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Lord has come, and the people of Feiwu City... will have a feast to eat," Qi Yuan watched Ji Buran's retreating figure, looking at the majestic city ahead, suddenly feeling something.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi stood to the side, her eyes excited, but deep down there was a trace of faint disappointment.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that Tianfu... and the other cities, those innocent people who died tragically at the hands of evil gods, would not have the chance to feast, to eat the evil gods' feast.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi decided she would eat well, eating on behalf of all the fallen people of Tianfu.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand took the Elegant Lord's storage bag, casually glancing inside: "If I had met him a few months earlier, he might have qualified to be my true love. But now... is this all?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were no good items in the storage bag, but the evil god's spirit power and experience bar were increasing.</p><p></p><p>This was also quite a good harvest.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's gaze paused slightly when he saw something.</p><p></p><p>In the storage bag was a broken set of armor. The armor was riddled with holes, still with bright bloodstains on it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed a familiar aura on the armor.</p><p></p><p>"Wenqi, is this... your great-grandfather's armor?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Qi Yuan's hand, the tattered armor appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>Evil god spirit power flowed and spread within the armor. One could imagine how brutal that battle must have been.</p><p></p><p>P.S. There's one more chapter at 2:30.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

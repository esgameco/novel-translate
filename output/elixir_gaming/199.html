        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Wang Wenqi saw the helmet, her eyes turned red.</p><p></p><p>She didn't say anything, but her reaction spoke the answer.</p><p></p><p>"So this Romantic Venerable One is related to the Jiang Kingdom?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it meant he had killed a rather important evil god.</p><p></p><p>Countless images flashed through Wang Wenqi's mind before settling. Her voice was cold: "He is Zhang Feng's brother-in-law, the offspring of a great venerable one!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng was an ancient god, Wang Wenqi's great-grandfather, and a good friend of the Heavenly Treasure Venerable One. </p><p></p><p>This friend eventually betrayed the ancient gods and joined the ranks of the new gods.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Feng was favored by an evil great venerable one, who married his daughter to him.</p><p></p><p>Later when the Jiang Kingdom fell, Zhang Feng had a hand in it.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Romantic Venerable One was also the offspring of that evil great venerable one.</p><p></p><p>"So it's him." Qi Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qi Qi immediately understood the situation, and her expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>Killing the offspring of a great venerable one!</p><p></p><p>This was a big deal.</p><p></p><p>If the great venerable one sought revenge, their current strength would be no match at all.</p><p></p><p>Although they had twenty true gods, that was just a numerical advantage.</p><p></p><p>Forget about facing a great venerable one, they couldn't even withstand a true god who had taken three steps to heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, should we still hold the banquet?" Qi Qi had thoughts of retreating.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to persuade Qi Yuan to leave.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that great venerable one, even if just Zhang Feng came, they would have a hard time escaping.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the starry sky, sweeping his gaze over the brightest star.</p><p></p><p>"In a game, if you get scared off by some second-generation rich kid, what's the point of playing?" Qi Yuan said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>He had always been autocratic.</p><p></p><p>He left logistics and various management tasks to Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>But once he made a decision, it was irreversible.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the worry on Qi Qi's face dissipated, replaced by a sweet smile: "Everything is up to you, Dad."</p><p></p><p>"Continue with the banquet, continue executing the plan, conquer territory.</p><p></p><p>My plan is to hold banquets everywhere in Feilin Prefecture within a month!" Qi Yuan said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was excited, seemingly motivated by Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>The once desolate Feiwu City had completely transformed with Qi Yuan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>On the wide streets, flowing banquets stretched for miles.</p><p></p><p>Many of those still in Feiwu City poked their heads out and walked onto the streets to join this inexplicable feast.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that a new ancient god had come to take over Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>For many civilians, there was a brief moment of excitement in their hearts, but more uncertainty about the future.</p><p></p><p>Because they didn't know how long this ancient god would stay in Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after the joyous banquet, he would leave Feiwu City with all his followers.</p><p></p><p>Those left to face the new gods' retaliation would be the people themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, what's... happening outside?" came a weak voice from inside the room.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian opened the door and looked at her frail sister on the bed, telling her about the events outside.</p><p></p><p>"A banquet? I want to go eat," her sister struggled, trying to get up.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian shook her head: "We don't know the character of this ancient god, whether he's friend or foe. Sister, you can't go out."</p><p></p><p>The little girl lay in bed, disappointment showing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go out later and bring back some good food for you," Yang Lian stroked her sister's head, her eyes full of doting affection. "I guess they won't stay in Feiwu City for long before leaving."</p><p></p><p>A resolute look appeared in Yang Lian's eyes: "This is also our chance.</p><p></p><p>During this time, you rest well. When you're better, I'll take you away from Feiwu City!"</p><p></p><p>It was because of her sister's health issues that they couldn't leave this time.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Origin Venerable One's arrival, she could take her sister away.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Her sister nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, whether it's ancient gods or evil gods, don't reveal yourself in front of them, understand?" Yang Lian gripped her sister's hand, "Until you become a great venerable one, until you awaken your powers, don't trust anyone!"</p><p></p><p>The frail girl nodded.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian looked at the starry sky, her gaze turning desperate: "This world... is beyond saving, no one can save it.</p><p></p><p>Only by leaving is there a way to survive.</p><p></p><p>Sister, you carry the seed of the world. If you leave this realm for the upper realm, seeking help... from other yang gods, perhaps only then can the Mortal Heart Realm be saved!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yang Lian knew that such words would also put the Mortal Heart Realm in danger.</p><p></p><p>After all, an innate world that could create infinite possibilities would be a prize for any yang god.</p><p></p><p>But the Mortal Heart Realm had no ability to protect itself.</p><p></p><p>Only by seeking help from other yang gods was there a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>However, even then, the Mortal Heart Realm might still be taken by other yang gods.</p><p></p><p>But at least that would be much better than... destroying all living beings as things were now.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yang Lian smiled: "I'm overthinking. Even if we manage to leave with the world's seed, it would be very difficult to meet other yang gods.</p><p></p><p>But sister, as long as you're alive, there's hope for everything."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Her sister nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>After Yang Lian finished speaking, suddenly, she sensed something and quickly walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, rhythmic knocking could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian's breathing quickened as she tensed up.</p><p></p><p>"Not home?" After the knocking had gone on for some time, a drawn-out sigh came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Zhao?" Hearing the familiar voice, the wariness on Yang Lian's face disappeared. She opened the door and immediately saw a familiar face. "Why are you here? I thought you...!"</p><p></p><p>There was excitement in Yang Lian's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She and Venerable Zhao were acquainted.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yang Lian, a look of joy flashed across Venerable Zhao's face.</p><p></p><p>"I returned to Feiwu City with the divine lord," Venerable Zhao said, his expression indescribable as he mentioned this.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the city, he had gone to find many old acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>The vengeful foster father who had seized his family property had left Feiwu City some days ago and died at the hands of bandits.</p><p></p><p>This left him with mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>Many old acquaintances had left, and Venerable Zhao hadn't seen many of them.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected Yang Lian to still be here.</p><p></p><p>"The guardian deity of Qingshui Village?" Yang Lian was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Venerable Zhao, she realized that his current strength was now unfathomable to her.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the lord bestowed upon me a method of observing gods, which is how I achieved my current status." Venerable Zhao explained, seeing Yang Lian's confusion. His eyes were full of admiration for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this familiar old acquaintance, Yang Lian boldly asked: "When will you... leave this time?"</p><p></p><p>In Yang Lian's understanding, the guardian deity of Qingshui Village had killed an evil god and would surely fear retaliation from other evil gods, so they certainly wouldn't stay long in Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>"This city, now that we've occupied it, is Qingshui Village territory. We won't give it up!" Venerable Zhao said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was already planning to conquer the other two cities.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Zhao wouldn't divulge the Venerable One's plans, so he didn't mention these to Yang Lian.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian was stunned for a moment, not expecting such an answer: "What if... other evil gods attack?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Kill them!" A fierce look flashed in Zhao Zun's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Back in the ancient battlefield of the Hundred Flowers Meeting, he had single-handedly slaughtered seven true gods. </p><p></p><p>He no longer felt the same fear towards evil gods as before.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zhao Zun's expression, Yang Lian knew his personality and that he wouldn't lie.</p><p></p><p>She thought of the Origin Lord she had never met: "He must be a great man."</p><p></p><p>"He is the person I admire most in this life!" Zhao Zun's gaze was like a torch.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." Yang Lian felt a sense of regret in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Such an ancient god would ultimately die at the hands of evil gods, accompanying the mortal realm to its doom.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." Just then, a coughing sound came from inside the room.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun seemed to realize something: "Your sister?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'll go check on her. You... wait here for a moment." Yang Lian hurried into the room.</p><p></p><p>Back in the room, she closed the door tightly, which surprised Zhao Zun a bit, but he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>After about a minute, Yang Lian came out of the room, her face still bearing a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"My sister says she greatly admires the Origin Lord. She wants to send him a gift." Yang Lian stretched out her hand, now holding a delicate and translucent jade leaf.</p><p></p><p>The jade leaf was as thin as a cicada's wing, with veins on it that seemed to have been carved by time. However, the entire jade leaf was blood-red, as if... it had been soaked in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun took the jade leaf, somewhat surprised. He felt there was something special about this leaf.</p><p></p><p>"I will give it to the Lord."</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian thought of something and continued: "My sister is quite weak now and can't see strangers."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun nodded.</p><p></p><p>He understood Yang Lian's meaning: "I will relay this message to the Lord as well."</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Yang Lian for a while, Zhao Zun left.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian closed the door tightly and returned to the room.</p><p></p><p>She looked at her increasingly frail sister, her eyes showing pity.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, why do you have to do this?"</p><p></p><p>The small girl on the bed opened her eyes, which were clear and spirited: "He killed the evil god, so he is our benefactor."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not worth it," Yang Lian said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, sister. He won't discover me."</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian knew this was true, which is why she didn't stop her.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, have you noticed that Brother Zhao Zun... is different from before?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm... it seems so." Yang Lian furrowed her brow.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord he's following must not be an ordinary person," the little girl murmured.</p><p></p><p>If he were ordinary, would she have had the sudden urge to bestow a treasure?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in his previous life he was... a legend," Yang Lian boldly guessed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would her sister bestow a treasure?</p><p></p><p>Only a legend would be worthy of receiving such a gift.</p><p></p><p>A legend is one who takes seven steps to heaven, a figure of mythical renown.</p><p></p><p>Legends are the strongest pillars of this world.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Flood War, the Holy Mother of No Food died in battle. In the mortal realm, true gods suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>Of the true gods and great lords, less than 30% survived.</p><p></p><p>But of those who took seven steps to heaven, the legends, not a single one survived.</p><p></p><p>The strongest legends all died fighting for the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>The reason why the children of destiny are called children of destiny is not because they are favored by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it's because they can visualize god-observing methods at the legendary level.</p><p></p><p>This is the last hope openly known in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian looked at her sister's frail body, her eyes filled with endless pity: "Does it still hurt?"</p><p></p><p>"A little," the thin girl said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on a bit longer. You'll definitely be able to leave the mortal realm. Then... it won't hurt anymore." Yang Lian hugged her sister, thinking of Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps by that time, she would die fighting for the mortal realm, just like Zhao Zun and that Origin Lord.</p><p></p><p>Only her sister would carry the seed of the world, the hope of the world, through long years, and then sprout.</p><p></p><p>But... would what sprouts still be the mortal realm?</p><p></p><p>Would all the things of the past still exist?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zun returned to the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was eating pork trotters. He looked at Qi Qi and couldn't help saying: "You eat too slowly and carefully. Little Snow's wolf-like eating is what really stimulates the appetite."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi rolled her eyes at Qi Yuan: "Godfather, your daughter is a lady, a lady!"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the city lord's mansion was harmonious. Ji Buran was also sitting at the table, quietly eating pork trotters.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan said: "In a few more days, the remaining two cities will be taken. My great plan is finally progressing another step."</p><p></p><p>The feeling of seeing the plan's progress every day was really satisfying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought that if everyone on Blue Star had a progress bar or experience bar attached to them, Blue Star would probably produce quite a few talented individuals like him who work hard.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qi Qi heard this and continued eating the bones, unwilling to respond to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Is that even a plan? To be honest, when Qi Qi heard her godfather's great plan, she felt it was too simplistic. It wasn't even as detailed as her summary of planting and writing, or the pig-feeding manual she wrote in elementary school.</p><p></p><p>"Once the plan here is complete, we can return to Qingshui Village and prepare to go to the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan," Qi Yuan said, full of anticipation for the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Clan..." Hearing this, Qi Qi hesitated, "The ancestral land is very dangerous. Godfather, you must be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there's no one in this world more cautious than me," Qi Yuan spouted a bunch of nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi was once again speechless.</p><p></p><p>How was her godfather cautious at all?</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, you're not cautious at all. The Thunder Lord is what you'd call steady," Qi Qi said helplessly. "You're only at the Purple Palace stage now, yet you dare to face true gods directly, and even great lords."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not at the Purple Palace stage now, I'm... at the Star Core stage. I'm very cautious now," Qi Yuan said as he drank the fragrant soup and ate heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, what nonsense are you saying again?"</p><p></p><p>"If I weren't cautious, I'd secretly summon my Star Core down right now and smash it into the Sky Pillar, crushing that old evil god dog to death!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed thought about this.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his Star Core was just a projection.</p><p></p><p>If it were a real star, he would indeed dare to clash with the Yang God in the Sky Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Although his daughter said Yang Gods could swallow stars.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan actually doubted this statement.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there really were Yang Gods who could swallow stars, but that didn't mean all Yang Gods could.</p><p></p><p>There were big differences between Yang Gods, just as there were big differences between stars.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked at the night sky, her eyes smiling: "Godfather, if you could really summon the stars from the sky, you might actually be able to crush quite a few evil gods!"</p><p></p><p>As for beings above true gods, Qi Qi didn't comment.</p><p></p><p>That level was beyond her comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But a star crushing a legend would definitely work.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm experimenting. I've already started preparing to swallow another star. When the time comes, I'll secretly smash it down and give that old fellow a scare." Qi Yuan looked at the night sky.</p><p></p><p>In the empty universe where Ning Tao was, time was still advancing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The solar true fire was also continuously accumulating, and soon he would be able to swallow another star.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan would be able to condense two Star Cores.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to ←God No Tears for another 3000 reward, thank you to Hui Yi and Purple Dragon for the 1000 reward, thank you to reader 20190228221332529 and I Only Love Rin for the rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 298</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>As Wang Shiqiao spoke, she took out her phone.</p><p></p><p>"Look for yourselves how disgusting this person is. I reported him, but the authorities won't do anything. And this guy still has a bunch of supporters!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao showed the profile page of the person she had argued with to those present.</p><p></p><p>"Just look... isn't it sickening? It's completely inhumane!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at the video with various expressions, some even retching, clearly nauseated by the scenes in the video.</p><p></p><p>The Arched Star era was never a peaceful time. Wars were happening constantly. It's just that the Qin Yuan country was in a relatively peaceful period.</p><p></p><p>These rich second-generation kids were physically uncomfortable with the scenes in the video.</p><p></p><p>In the video, a soldier from the Guiran country burst into a civilian's house. </p><p></p><p>What happened in between was not recorded.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the video was a row of corpses. </p><p></p><p>Two elderly, three young adults, and two children.</p><p></p><p>The clothes of this family of seven were tattered, with blood stains still visible on their bodies, showing what kind of humiliation they had suffered before.</p><p></p><p>There was a line of text attached to the video:</p><p></p><p>"Disrespect for the Lord is the greatest evil!"</p><p></p><p>The rich kids present, who had barely done any manual labor in their lives, could hardly not be angry seeing such a scene.</p><p></p><p>"What a son of a bitch!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't insult dogs!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, what the hell is the king doing? If I were him, I would have sent troops to wipe out Guiran country long ago! Trash Guiran country, one combined brigade would steamroll them!"</p><p></p><p>The combined brigades of Qin Yuan country were somewhat similar to the combined brigades of a certain major power on Blue Star in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>In addition to modern military units, Qin Yuan's combined brigades also included gene warriors, mechanical troops and other components.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that one combined brigade could easily overrun Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>"Wugui country is backed by the Ancient Wu country, how can we intervene directly?"</p><p></p><p>"Both Wugui and Ancient Wu have deep connections with Canxing..."</p><p></p><p>When a student mentioned this, fear appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>All Qin Yuan citizens who had gone to school had learned about that tragic period of history.</p><p></p><p>Canxing supported some countries, triggering a world war.</p><p></p><p>That war was fought very bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, we should just wipe out Wugui country. Even if it leads to war with Ancient Wu country, so what? Ancient Wu's military strength is about even with ours, it's hard to say who would win!"</p><p></p><p>"We should fight! Our country has become too rigid. People like us have no chance of moving up the social ladder!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's not fight. In a war, it's the lower classes that suffer the most. People like us would probably be slaughtered like fat pigs!"</p><p></p><p>The students debated, with differing opinions on whether to go to war.</p><p></p><p>"What about you, Qi Yuan? Do you want war?" Wang Shiqiao looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... it's better not to go to war. If war breaks out, the martial arts competition won't be held. How am I supposed to win the championship then?"</p><p></p><p>If Qin Yuan country entered a state of war, events like the martial arts competition would definitely be suspended.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's main quest was to become the Myriad Path Martial God.</p><p></p><p>He had to participate in the martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>"You're still thinking about your championship?" Wang Shiqiao rolled her eyes at Qi Yuan. "Train for another seven or eight years before talking about championships!"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they had all seen Qi Yuan's efforts.</p><p></p><p>Maybe after a few years of accumulation, he really would have a chance to make it to the finals of the martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>Of course... winning the championship was a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>"I see the international situation getting more and more tense. I have a feeling that a major war might break out in just a few years. So the martial arts competition will probably be cancelled before Qi Yuan can win the championship," said a burly male student.</p><p></p><p>Whether the martial arts competition was cancelled or not didn't matter much to him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't make a living from martial arts competitions anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, don't you have a driver girlfriend? Why are you still thinking about making money in the martial arts competition? If she takes you to participate in some dating reality show, wouldn't you become famous with your looks? Why bother with the martial arts competition when there's an easier way?" Xing Yu said with a bright smile, her words tinged with teasing.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the big star Wu Qi drove to pick up Qi Yuan and take him home had caused quite a stir in the student circle.</p><p></p><p>Especially since it was known that Qi Yuan and Wu Qi were high school classmates, with Wu Qi being Qi Yuan's senior.</p><p></p><p>In the mouths of these bored second-generation rich kids, a brainless love story drama had formed.</p><p></p><p>The two were obviously childhood sweethearts.</p><p></p><p>After Wu Qi became successful, she didn't forget her little boyfriend.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally played the role of the kept man.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Qi Yuan stated that he and Wu Qi were innocent, and Wu Qi was just his driver.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the students didn't believe this explanation.</p><p></p><p>How could there be a big star willing to be a driver for an ordinary person?</p><p></p><p>And picking up and dropping off every day.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Qi Yuan got a new nickname - Driver Bro, and Wu Qi also got a new nickname - Driver Girlfriend.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao also teased at this point: "Your driver girlfriend is probably waiting for you downstairs now."</p><p></p><p>It was now approaching evening, and the day's training at the martial arts hall was coming to an end.</p><p></p><p>It was time for Qi Yuan and the others to go home.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the road outside the martial arts hall, Wu Qi was on the phone, with a hint of displeasure in her expression.</p><p></p><p>"My dear, that Qi Yuan is probably just a scammer who fooled the Viscount of Revelry. In reality, how could he be from a noble family? You've been his servant for so many days, not doing your work, what have you gained?"</p><p></p><p>From the phone came the grating voice of the manager.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the manager had also done a little investigation on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They found that Qi Yuan's background was very ordinary - an orphan of a martyr with mental illness.</p><p></p><p>And with the Viscount of Revelry, there seemed to be some kind of deal.</p><p></p><p>According to what the manager had secretly found out, Qi Yuan was a scammer who had tricked the Viscount of Revelry with some nonsensical "immortal technique".</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi gripped the phone, listening to the incessant chatter on the other end. She was very irritated. Thinking of Qi Yuan, she said in a deep voice: "He's not a scammer. He's very special."</p><p></p><p>When she was with Qi Yuan, she could feel how special he was, completely different from others.</p><p></p><p>Even other nobles didn't give her a fraction of the pressure that Qi Yuan did.</p><p></p><p>"He is indeed special. How can someone with mental illness not be special?" There was a hint of mockery in the manager's words.</p><p></p><p>"If you keep talking like this, we won't have any reason to continue working together." Wu Qi's tone also became firm.</p><p></p><p>Her relationship with the manager was one of cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wu Qi's words, the manager was speechless for a while before saying: "You clinging to him like this... doesn't seem right either. If you really want to hook up with him and your charm isn't enough, you could drug him. After all, he's a man, men don't lose out in these situations, right?"</p><p></p><p>"What era are we in, still talking about these things? You're so old-fashioned." Seeing that the manager's tone had softened a bit, Wu Qi's tone also became less tense.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Xiao Qi, the young master of the Fang Zheng Group wants to meet you. He's inviting you to a gathering. Last time you went on that yacht, you kind of... entered their circle's radar." The manager's voice was a bit uneasy. "I heard that the young master Fang doesn't seem to have a very good relationship with the Viscount of Revelry."</p><p></p><p>"Not going." Hearing this, Wu Qi immediately refused.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this was about the dirty business in the upper circles.</p><p></p><p>Since she had chosen to align herself with Qi Yuan, she naturally wouldn't seek another master.</p><p></p><p>If you're going to be a dog, might as well choose a handsome master, right?</p><p></p><p>About a few minutes later, a smile appeared in Wu Qi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The back door opened, and Qi Yuan sat in the back seat.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi,"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Should we eat out before going back today? My treat!" After hearing the agent's words, Wu Qi decided to be more proactive and create opportunities to get closer to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No need, my robot can cook at home," Qi Yuan refused without thinking.</p><p></p><p>Eating out is so expensive. He only had 100 million, he needed to save money. </p><p></p><p>After all, people were anxious these days. You never know when war might break out.</p><p></p><p>Once war starts, prices of goods would definitely skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>"The food cooked by robots is somewhat unpalatable. How can it compare to... professional chefs outside?" Wu Qi couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, food cooked by robots was not only simple, but also used pre-packaged ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi had eaten it before, but after becoming wealthy she never ate robot-cooked food again.</p><p></p><p>"My Zero One is different. Its cooking is delicious," When mentioning Zero One, a hint of pride flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Over the past month, besides cultivating and advancing in both martial arts and immortal techniques, he had also been modifying the robot at home.</p><p></p><p>He had integrated advanced puppet techniques into Zero One's body.</p><p></p><p>Combining modern technology with advanced puppet techniques, Zero One was no longer an ordinary robot.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that Qi Yuan's current strength was too weak to directly awaken Zero One's intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Zero One would already be able to awaken self-awareness, similar to the spirit of a magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even without awakening, Zero One's spirituality and consciousness were slowly growing.</p><p></p><p>As for how long this growth would take, Qi Yuan didn't know.</p><p></p><p>To speed up this process was actually very simple - just imitate walking the cleaver on Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Treat Zero One like a pet and walk it dozens of times, and it would definitely develop intelligence, even smarter than the cleaver.</p><p></p><p>The current Zero One was quite unique. Not only could it cook, it could even do simple alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan actually had some ideas in mind - should he build a factory to scale up and industrialize alchemy?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just thinking about it. </p><p></p><p>"Robot-cooked food can be delicious?" Wu Qi was surprised as she drove, "Why don't I come try it?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to scam a free meal!" Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>Late at night, a man and woman alone together would look bad.</p><p></p><p>He only coveted the blood in Wu Qi's body, not her body itself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan said seriously: "Wu Qi, you've been driving me for so long, should we discuss some business?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's solemn tone, Wu Qi's heart rate suddenly accelerated. She nodded carefully.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that her sincerity had moved Mr. Qi?</p><p></p><p>"I ride in your car every day, can you give me a discount?" Qi Yuan spoke sincerely, with a hint of pleading in his tone.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, when you buy a lot at a store, the merchant will give you a discount.</p><p></p><p>When renting a hotel for a whole month, the price will also be much cheaper.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi drove him every day for over a month now, shouldn't the price be lowered a bit?</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's expression froze upon hearing this. Qi Yuan's words were beyond her expectations. She forced a smile uglier than crying: "Sure."</p><p></p><p>"How about 25 yuan per trip then?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Wu Qi nodded, with ten thousand alpacas galloping in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if she had objections, she wouldn't dare to voice them.</p><p></p><p>She also began to doubt - could it be... that her persistence... was wrong?</p><p></p><p>But she had persisted for so long, with such high sunk costs. She would never give up.</p><p></p><p>The car sped along and soon arrived at Qi Yuan's neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got out of the car and took out twenty-five yuan, preparing to hand it to Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>However, he thought of something and his hand moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>A paper bill transformed into the shape of a small bird.</p><p></p><p>"Your blood is stored in your body, consider this the interest," he said.</p><p></p><p>This little bird was casually made by him, containing certain powers.</p><p></p><p>For example, protection, and also positioning.</p><p></p><p>The reason he gave Wu Qi the paper money bird was that as his strength increased, he became more curious about Wu Qi's blood.</p><p></p><p>Stringing someone along like this, not using her blood but keeping it stored in her body for so long, made Qi Yuan feel guilty.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi took the paper bird, her eyes showing delight: "Your technique is so good? How did you fold it? Can you teach me?"</p><p></p><p>She had seen with her own eyes that Qi Yuan folded this paper money bird in less than 20 seconds.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from traditional origami cranes and other paper folding, much more lifelike.</p><p></p><p>"You won't be able to learn it. To fold this, you need to cultivate immortality," Qi Yuan was always honest, "Back then,狂欢 gave me 90 million before I agreed to teach him immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal cultivation?" Wu Qi's eyes widened, filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>Does immortal cultivation really exist in this world?</p><p></p><p>At the time, her agent had told her that Qi Yuan's deal with Viscount 狂欢 was related to immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>She didn't believe it then.</p><p></p><p>But now hearing it directly from Qi Yuan's mouth, she was shocked and bewildered, standing still.</p><p></p><p>By the time she reacted, Qi Yuan had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>She stood there dazed, her mind in a trance.</p><p></p><p>"A joke... or real?"</p><p></p><p>If it was real, wouldn't her worldview of so many years... collapse?</p><p></p><p>She clutched the paper money bird tightly, countless thoughts flashing through her mind.</p><p></p><p>If what Mr. Qi said was true... that would be great.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I'm done for, stuck in a manhole cover!"</p><p></p><p>In the Military Security Neighborhood, Xie Xinsu let out a miserable cry.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her heart was filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>Because her head was stuck in the sewer, pitch black inside with a nauseating sour stench.</p><p></p><p>Her lower body and buttocks were stuck outside the manhole cover.</p><p></p><p>She was like an upside-down onion, looking utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>Her whole body looked tattered, covered in food scraps, a pitiful sight.</p><p></p><p>"I'm finished, what if a man comes by?" </p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Xie Xinsu was suddenly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>In her current state she had no ability to resist. If she encountered a perverted man...</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm a cat now. What if I encounter a male cat in heat!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu thought of this and felt extremely resentful.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a male cat, she would prefer a human man.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, I'm a fairy from Xuantian Sect, shouldering the great responsibility of reviving the sect.</p><p></p><p>I'm too unlucky. I finally infiltrated Canxing for three years and obtained secret intelligence, but then the world reset, going back 10 years."</p><p></p><p>"Going back 10 years is one thing, but turning into a cat!"</p><p></p><p>"Turning into a cat is one thing, but my mind isn't as sharp anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"Now... I'm even stuck here!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu had bitter complaints she couldn't voice.</p><p></p><p>When others experienced world reset, they returned to their original timeline.</p><p></p><p>But she... became a cat.</p><p></p><p>The people in her sect must be very worried after discovering her disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow! Xie Xinsu let out miserable cries.</p><p></p><p>She was also getting weaker, her consciousness becoming more and more hazy.</p><p></p><p>"Someone please come save this fairy. This fairy will teach you... immortal techniques, the art of longevity!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, she finally passed out.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

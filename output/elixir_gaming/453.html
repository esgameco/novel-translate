        <h1>Chapter 453</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes: "This works too?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, before comprehending the supreme principle, when he first went to Black Demon Abyss, he was worried about being unable to protect Jinli. </p><p></p><p>But now it was different. He already had the ability to protect himself, enough to bring Jinli to his side.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it works!" Moonlight Celestial Lord said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Rules can always be changed.</p><p></p><p>"Whenever you have time, you can bring Jinli back to Black Demon Abyss," Moonlight Celestial Lord said kindly.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel even more strongly that strength really was everything.</p><p></p><p>Although everyone was supposedly equal, if he were just a nobody in love with Jinli, wanting to marry a Moon Maiden, the Moon Palace would make him understand that a "toad" could not eat swan meat.</p><p></p><p>But now, the situation had reversed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll find an auspicious day to bring Jinli over," Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>Luckily he had already prepared the marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he just needed to add Jinli's photo to it.</p><p></p><p>The only imperfection was that no one could move the civil affairs bureau to the Sixth Heaven for him.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, fellow Daoist," Moonlight Celestial Lord said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan thought of something and asked again: "May I meet with the Moon God Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to meet the Moon God Sovereign to clarify matters about his master.</p><p></p><p>Moonlight Celestial Lord's originally joyful expression gained a hint of concern: "Fellow Daoist likely cannot meet her. This old one has also been unable to see the Moon God Sovereign for some time."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what happened to her?"</p><p></p><p>"The Moon God Sovereign suffered severe injuries and has been in seclusion to recover. </p><p>Where she is located, this old one does not know."</p><p></p><p>The news of the Moon God Sovereign's severe injuries had already spread in rumors throughout the Sixth Heaven, and was not much of a secret.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Moon God Sovereign had suffered severe injuries, and even Moonlight Celestial Lord did not know her whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "With her level of supreme principle...she can still be injured?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor had said before that those with great principles were very difficult to kill, or even injure.</p><p></p><p>Those of the same level, without offensive magical treasures, could not even cause injuries.</p><p></p><p>How could one with supreme principle suddenly suffer severe injuries?</p><p></p><p>"The details of this matter, this old one does not know. I only know the Moon God Sovereign suddenly entered a strange land, fell into an ambush, and suffered severe injuries."</p><p></p><p>Moonlight Celestial Lord did not know the specifics.</p><p></p><p>"Strange land?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt it made sense.</p><p></p><p>Anything could happen in strange lands.</p><p></p><p>And some unknown strange lands were connected to other universes. There might be powerful beings from other worlds, which could be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan asked: "Can we travel to other worlds through these strange lands?"</p><p></p><p>Moonlight Celestial Lord's expression became solemn: "No, once entered, one's body would perish and dao would dissipate."</p><p></p><p>"Then have any beings from other worlds come to the Sixth Heaven through strange lands?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but...mostly weak ones," Moonlight Celestial Lord answered.</p><p></p><p>"Can these people...return to their own worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"No, once they enter the Sixth Heaven, if they try to return, they would end up like us," Moonlight Celestial Lord patiently explained to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This information was considered secret but not precious.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the world beyond the Sixth Heaven and other worlds, many supreme principle experts had done exploration and research.</p><p></p><p>"It feels strange, could it be that the game systems are incompatible?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>It was like characters from a Symbian system game installation package being unable to appear in an Android system.</p><p></p><p>"Game system?" Moonlight Celestial Lord was slightly stunned, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," Qi Yuan didn't bother to explain.</p><p></p><p>After chatting at length with Moonlight Celestial Lord, Qi Yuan gained a deeper understanding of the realm of supreme principle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Principle Discussion Conference gradually came to an end.</p><p></p><p>The various holy lands and factions successively returned.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme principle experts who participated in this Principle Discussion Conference were worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, the matter of Linya Tui was too significant.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Tahuang Palace Lord's hosting - they still needed to verify this information with the ancestors of their clans.</p><p></p><p>If it was true, it seemed the sky was about to fall.</p><p></p><p>All the Yang Spirits sensed the feeling of an impending storm.</p><p></p><p>Only some disciples and geniuses remained carefree.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sword big brother and those old guys are all gone, I'm so happy!" Purple Origin Daxue said proudly with her hands on her hips.</p><p></p><p>Due to the matter of Linya Tui, Black Sword and the Three Ancestors and other Yang Spirits had already returned early to Black Demon Abyss to discuss it.</p><p></p><p>These young disciples and geniuses, being unable to travel as fast as Yang Spirits, were leaving more slowly, so they were led by one Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Purple Origin Daxue, looked at her mouth, and showed an expression of admiration: "Your...brain is a bit abstract!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Daxue said proudly: "Sister is smart, right? I know you'll plant mushrooms in my mouth, so I planted them myself first, squeezing out the living space for your mushrooms!"</p><p></p><p>As Purple Origin Daxue spoke, mushrooms occasionally spurted from her mouth, like a jet fighter.</p><p></p><p>To prevent Qi Yuan from planting mushrooms in her mouth, she chose to plant them herself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless and didn't dwell on this matter.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Purple Origin Daxue whisper: "Now, with Linya Tui imminent, do you think...I should suppress my cultivation and not enter the Yang Spirit realm?"</p><p></p><p>By not entering Yang Spirit realm, she wouldn't be caught up in the situation, unable to control her fate.</p><p></p><p>"That's up to you," Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to comment or define someone else's life.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was an enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I can't do that. After all, I've received so much from Purple Origin Heaven. How could I be a coward in times of danger?" Purple Origin Daxue still had some sense of responsibility.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Qi Yuan praised.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Daxue's behavior was quite admirable.</p><p></p><p>Then he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Society was developing too fast.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the immortal realm was getting worse and worse.</p><p></p><p>He recalled how in the past, on TV shows, the female supporting character would bring a group of experts to break off an engagement, embarrassing the male lead's parents, forcing the male lead to shout "Don't bully the poor young man!"</p><p></p><p>Emotions were at their peak.</p><p></p><p>But this female supporting character, in today's society, would be considered a great person!</p><p></p><p>Apart from low emotional intelligence, she even brought medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Unlike now...with morals in decline, not breaking the law was enough to be considered a great person.</p><p></p><p>It felt like: I'm a great demon, but Earth's morality has declined 500 times, so when I reappear I've become a sage!</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity we missed this Principle Discussion Conference," Ice Sword sighed from nearby.</p><p></p><p>At this Principle Discussion Conference, they went to observe the ceremony and closely encounter the Principle Wall, which was different from those who just watched the livestream.</p><p></p><p>They also came into contact with a trace of the Principle Wall's aura, gaining many insights. In the future, when entering the Yang Spirit realm, they would progress faster and further than others.</p><p></p><p>But after all, they were not Yang Spirits and had not truly touched the Principle Wall.</p><p></p><p>Who knew when the next Principle Discussion Conference would be held? Probably after many more years had passed.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that Black Sword big brother comprehended the supreme principle, otherwise our Black Demon Abyss would be in danger with this Linya Tui," a genius sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think that Demon Flame Celestial Lord can return to our Black Demon Abyss?" </p><p></p><p>At this point, a genius's eyes lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Luo clan originally had the same origins as Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is probably just wishful thinking.</p><p>Back then, when the Demon Luo clan wanted to return to the Sixth Heaven, we were indifferent.</p><p>Now, if we beg them to come, they probably won't be willing."</p><p></p><p>These geniuses were well-informed.</p><p></p><p>Demon Flame Celestial Lord had comprehended two supreme principles, and various holy lands had extended invitations, but all were rejected.</p><p></p><p>Demon Flame Celestial Lord had also rejected Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This made many geniuses of Black Demon Abyss surprised and a bit upset.</p><p></p><p>It felt like a poor relative who used to always come begging had suddenly taken flight.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huang Tengda had a feeling of not recognizing people.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, no matter how strong Mo Chi is, how can he compare to Big Brother Black Sword? Our Black Demon Abyss has Big Brother Black Sword, that's enough!" said one of the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"We not only have Black Sword, but also Blood Robe!" Ziyuan Daxue said loudly, very proudly. </p><p></p><p>Blood Robe represented the Ziyuan Sky, and was the only genius among the younger generation of the Black Demon Abyss who had a chance to challenge Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other geniuses all laughed and said: "Right, we also have Blood Robe." Of course, they were just flattering, not really believing it in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, Black Sword had truly comprehended the supreme principles, but Blood Robe? He was still just a Yin Spirit! If Qi Yuan knew their thoughts, he would definitely correct them righteously.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't a Yin Spirit, he was a Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>This discussion ended.</p><p></p><p>The immortal ship was still sailing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue spat out mushrooms from her mouth: "This immortal ship flies too slowly, it's boring. Blood Robe, do you want to ride my Black Cloud Blood Steed?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "You have a Black Cloud Blood Steed?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Cloud Blood Steed was like the ghost fire of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my cousin died, right? His Black Cloud Blood Steed was just sitting there wasted, so I secretly took it out. Do you want sister to take you for an exciting ride?" Ziyuan Daxue said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"No thanks, I'm timid." Qi Yuan refused. He didn't want to fall to his death.</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? I swear to the heavens, when I drive the Black Cloud Blood Steed, I'll definitely be steady, careful, and never speed!" As Ziyuan Daxue spoke, she raised her hand, "If I violate this oath, may heaven strike me with lightning!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's nose grew a bit longer. </p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue was lying.</p><p></p><p>"Please spare me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly refused.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, above the nine heavens of thunder, a rumbling sound erupted.</p><p></p><p>Huge, boiling purple lightning exploded, directly striking their immortal ship.</p><p></p><p>The steadily sailing immortal ship shook violently, rocking back and forth. The cultivators on board immediately sensed the dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Ziyuan Daxue's eyes widened, feeling a bit guilty, "No way, could this Black Cloud Blood Steed be inauspicious?"</p><p></p><p>She had just sworn an oath, and great thunder struck from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, this area often has thunder from beyond the sky, it's nothing." Ice Sword shouted loudly, trying to calm everyone down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, feeling that this thunder was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable stood up, extending one hand outwards to grab.</p><p></p><p>All the thunder in this area of the sky poured into his palm.</p><p></p><p>The endless thunder in the Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable's hand was merely like a thunder snake.</p><p></p><p>"Minor issue, everyone don't worry about it." The Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable easily resolved the problem, smiling. He was about to say something when his expression suddenly changed drastically, and he let out an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>"You dare, you scoundrel!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky was filled with surging blood qi.</p><p></p><p>All the geniuses smelled the thick killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner?"</p><p></p><p>These geniuses were shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, an enormous Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner waved, blocking out the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The entire earth was a sea of blood red.</p><p></p><p>That Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable was also extremely anxious, reaching out his large hand to try to block the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>But in a flash, that Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner shook.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the immortal ship shattered into pieces, and that Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable retreated.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in heaven and earth surged violently.</p><p></p><p>Countless rumbling and exploding sounds erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>"Danger!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly protect yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>Shouts, angry cries, and various magical techniques intersected.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth fell into chaos as the immortal ship was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>A full three breaths of time passed before heaven and earth finally returned to clarity.</p><p></p><p>The countless rumbling sounds and various light beams finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>That Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner had also vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>All the geniuses appeared within the sleeve of that Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable, feeling an intense sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>A pair of eyes appeared, falling on those within the sleeve, with a very unpleasant expression: "Blood Robe... is gone."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses who had been meditating to recover their immortal spiritual power had drastic changes in expression.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe had actually disappeared!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner meant that Ghost Domination Sky had suddenly made a move against Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Now that Blood Robe was missing, his fate could be very miserable.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner... is an offensive magical treasure. Although what just appeared was a branch banner, it still has some of the characteristics and power of the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner, able to transfer cultivators into strange lands. Ghost Domination Sky has a limited number of branch banners, using one means one less. To deal with Blood Robe, they actually used a branch banner..." </p><p></p><p>The Yangsheng Heavenly Venerable's expression was very unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>A genius had been taken away right under his nose, and he felt somewhat guilty and ashamed.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he thought of something, and his expression became anxious: "Since Ghost Domination Sky dared to make a move against Blood Robe, they might... also make a move against Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>His face changed drastically, his expression shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyatui had not even begun, yet the situation in the Six Heavens Realm was already so turbulent. If it continued to spread, the consequences were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>He had to report this matter to the Ancestor quickly.</p><p></p><p>Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Powerful dark clouds loomed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an angry roar rang out.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor's figure appeared, landing at the foot of a towering peak, his expression anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Ziyuan Ancestor... requests to see Master!"</p><p></p><p>He was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>He had just received news that Ghost Domination Sky had made a move against Blood Robe, using a branch of the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner to transfer Blood Robe into a strange land. He was very worried.</p><p></p><p>About one breath of time passed.</p><p></p><p>An old man in black robes appeared, his expression also carrying an anxious look: "Sixth Brother, Ghost Domination Sky has made a move against Black Sword, sweeping Black Sword into a strange land. Master is busy divining Black Sword's whereabouts now, and has no time to see you."</p><p></p><p>This old man in black robes was the Fourth Elder of Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Brother, Blood Robe has also fallen victim to Ghost Domination Sky's sneak attack and is missing. Can Master help me divine Blood Robe's whereabouts? I'll go rescue him myself!" Ziyuan Ancestor said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out some Black Demon Ancestor Blood and handed it to Fourth Elder.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sword is crucial to Black Demon Abyss's future. Master will not waste energy on other matters. This situation involves great principles at work, Master cannot be distracted in the slightest. Old man, please go back."</p><p></p><p>Fourth Elder politely refused.</p><p></p><p>Since he had come out, he represented Master's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Master knew Ziyuan Ancestor would come, and had sent him in advance to block Ziyuan Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor's expression changed several times: "Just one breath, one breath!"</p><p></p><p>With Master's power and the magical treasures he possessed, he could probably divine Blood Robe's current whereabouts and which dangerous land he was in within one breath of time.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Elder shook his head: "Wasting even one more breath of time means one more degree of danger for Black Sword."</p><p></p><p>He stood at the foot of the mountain peak, blocking Ziyuan Ancestor's way like a towering mountain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ziyuan Ancestor's expression became desolate.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he had no right to demand anything of Master.</p><p></p><p>"I... understand."</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Ancestor was dejected, like a small old man, without the aura of a great principle master.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Blood Robe... can survive!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe still had the protective treasures he had given him.</p><p></p><p>If the assassins sent by Ghost Domination Sky were not strong enough, he still had a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only hope for good fortune.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

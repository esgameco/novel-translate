        <h1>Chapter 489</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ice Moon looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"Can a divine treasure be cursed?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan paused momentarily, realizing his oversight, and quickly added: "The second rule, no cursing other living beings either!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of laughter flashed in Ice Moon's icy gaze as she shifted her eyes from Qi Yuan to the vast sky, her smile fading. "You have overturned the Tai Huang Palace and disrupted the Linye Shedding plan, but... the Linye Shedding will continue. You must be careful of the Unique Palace. If it becomes impossible, hide within the Gate of Absolute Principles, where you may have a chance to survive."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I haven't broken the law, so I'm not afraid of the Unique Palace!" Qi Yuan said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>The Linye Shedding and the Unique Palace were indeed a major problem. </p><p></p><p>The will of the Immortal Dao, driven by the Unique Palace, would unleash endless slaughter in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, it's not as simple as just wanting to stop it.</p><p></p><p>When the killing aura descends, to alleviate it, one must kill! These Celestial Venerable Ones, in their pursuit of carefree immortality, are not truly free, as the killing aura binds them against their will.</p><p></p><p>"You are not afraid, but what about the people around you? Your family, your fellow disciples?" Ice Moon said coldly, her voice tinged with resignation and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly became clear. "I will just become a god!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The small villa had three floors, with white jade-like tiles on the exterior and shimmering glazed tiles on the roof, gleaming under the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Within the courtyard, the spiritual water was crystal clear, and spiritual mist clung to the strange flowers and grasses, further enhancing the lush beauty.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Jinli in her scarlet gown, the flowers were not as dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"This is my house on the Seven-Colored Peak. How is it? It's 220 square meters of building area, but the actual size is over 700, plus a basement, a 50-square-meter balcony, and a 130-square-meter garden.</p><p></p><p>It's right next to the Shenguang Sect, and just a short distance from the Great Merchant Realm, just a nap away.</p><p></p><p>The decoration and the transportation are both top-notch!"</p><p></p><p>After resolving the matters in the Sixth Heaven, Qi Yuan brought Jinli to his house in the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The house was already built, without even a trace of formaldehyde.</p><p></p><p>It was a three-story villa, and Qi Yuan was very satisfied with it.</p><p></p><p>Now, embracing Jinli and looking at the house, he felt like a true winner in life.</p><p></p><p>The only downside was that it was not located in a school district.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite elegant," Jinli said, entering Qi Yuan's house with the curiosity of a child.</p><p></p><p>Although she had seen many magnificent or luxurious buildings, she maintained enthusiasm and patience towards Qi Yuan's house.</p><p></p><p>She touched the walls, the railings, and the bed, as if wanting to leave her mark in this room.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you're back!" came the joyful voice from outside the house.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu appeared, wearing a yellow dress with a golden belt around her waist, accentuating her ample bosom, which was quite a sight to behold.</p><p></p><p>Whether she was the only one in the mountain peak or had just woken up, her attire was rather casual, and the deep cleavage below her delicate collarbones was particularly alluring, with her fair and rounded breasts swaying.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan opened the window and looked down at Jiang Lingsu from above, seeing everything at a glance, including her prominent assets.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a sense of warmth.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, there was still trust between people on the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>His shidi had not worn...</p><p></p><p>However, he was a gentleman, and since his shidi trusted him, he should trust her back as well.</p><p></p><p>"This is Jinli, the Moon Goddess from the Moon Palace, the one I told you about, my in-game CP." Qi Yuan introduced Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu stood below, her gaze falling on Jinli, her eyes widening with admiration, tinged with a hint of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a strange feeling was welling up in her heart, just like when she was a child and her toy was taken away by someone else.</p><p></p><p>She quickly suppressed this emotion and smiled brightly, "Jiang Lingsu greets Jinli-jiejie. Jiejie is truly... a beauty that can topple kingdoms."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was usually very confident in her own appearance, but seeing Jinli, she couldn't help but feel a sense of inferiority.</p><p></p><p>"My junior is also a beauty that can bring calamity to the nation." Jinli, the Moon Goddess, looked at Jiang Lingsu and couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>"I'm nowhere near as capable as Jiejie in bewitching my Big Brother to the point of losing his mind. Such skills are unmatched by anyone." Jiang Lingsu said unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she felt a bit regretful, wondering if she had sounded sarcastic.</p><p></p><p>But then she thought, "So what if it's sarcastic? I'm just being honest with myself."</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at Jiang Lingsu, her smile coy, and the two exchanged pleasantries, unaware that Jinli's hand was resting on Qi Yuan's arm, gently caressing it, as if expressing her emotions.</p><p></p><p>"If my junior is willing, she may even surpass me," Jinli said.</p><p></p><p>The current Jinli no longer had the detached and serene aura of a Moon Palace immortal, but rather a sense of having fallen to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you two are talking so intensely, did you know each other before? Or is it a case of 'one mountain cannot have two tigers'?" Qi Yuan, considering himself highly intelligent and emotionally perceptive, naturally noticed the undercurrent of tension in their words.</p><p></p><p>"No." Jinli answered.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu also remained silent, and the two seemed to have stopped their verbal sparring.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, let's have dinner together later. I'll take Jinli to the peak to have a look." Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu and extended the invitation.</p><p></p><p>Since the two seemed to have some issues between them, getting them to spend more time together would help them become closer.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the Blue Star, when two children argue in class, the wise teacher would have them hug each other and make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also highly perceptive, and this method could certainly be "stolen".</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Jiang Lingsu did not refuse Qi Yuan's invitation, and a faint ripple stirred in her heart.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan held Jinli's jade-like hand, and the two of them went to the peak of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Pavilions and rain shelters, shrouded in mist and clouds.</p><p></p><p>The immortal palace was hidden in the clouds, appearing quite ethereal.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Ancient Qi Cypress!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli stopped under the Ancient Qi Cypress, her eyes filled with deep nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>The memories of the past surged in her heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is the one Master brought from another place. It's much smaller than the one on the Wangue Continent." Qi Yuan stood beside Jinli, speaking calmly.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts also carried a hint of wistfulness.</p><p></p><p>Each game is actually a segment of life, an experience.</p><p></p><p>Even after perfectly completing a game, there will always be some lingering regret and reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in the Wangue Continent, he had achieved his heart's desire, met Jinli, and held her hand.</p><p></p><p>But what about the other games?</p><p></p><p>And the games to come?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jinli looked at Qi Yuan, and the icy luster in her eyes flashed with a seductive flame, as fiery as the red dress she wore.</p><p></p><p>"My lord... take me..."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only by clinging tightly together, their bodies intertwined, could she alleviate the longing in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Under the Ancient Qi Cypress, the winds stilled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ning River County.</p><p></p><p>The candle flame burned an orange-yellow, not very large, only illuminating a small area of the room.</p><p></p><p>Black smoke rose, and the lampshade was covered in soot.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yanshou frowned as he looked at the old man across from him. "Are you sure there's no problem?"</p><p></p><p>The old man, standing at five feet tall and wearing a felt hat, looked rather comical.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Young Master Huang. Since he has entered my Insane Asylum, that Qi boy's days are certainly numbered!" </p><p></p><p>The old man's name was Zhou Mao, the director of the Ning River County Insane Asylum.</p><p></p><p>Ning River County was located in Jiangzhou Jian'an Prefecture, with a population of only about 300,000.</p><p></p><p>The Insane Asylum, well... in the terms of the Blue Star, it would be called a psychiatric hospital.</p><p></p><p>Jiangzhou had many sinister spirits, and many citizens had encountered terrifying spirits, losing their souls and becoming insane, biting and harming people.</p><p></p><p>The government authorities, in order to prevent these insane people from causing harm, had them all confined in the Insane Asylum.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Insane Asylum not only housed the insane, but also normal people.</p><p></p><p>Today, Huang Yanshou had entrusted a person to Zhou Mao, to be confined in the Insane Asylum.</p><p></p><p>"Although this boy has no parents and no one cares about his life, he did marry into the Shen family recently. If the Shen family gets involved..."  Huang Yanshou hesitated.</p><p></p><p>The Shen family was a powerful clan in Jining Prefecture. Their eldest daughter was a renowned beauty on the Hundred Fragrance List.</p><p></p><p>However, a month ago, the Shen family's eldest daughter had gotten married.</p><p></p><p>The man she married was a destitute youth from Ning River County.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had entered the Shen family as a son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yanshou had been instructed by an influential person to eliminate this son-in-law while he was returning to his hometown.</p><p></p><p>The method was simple and brutal.</p><p></p><p>First, he framed the son-in-law for lusting after and defiling the widow Liu, and when the sinister spirits appeared, Liu died, and the son-in-law, although he escaped with his life, had become insane and was sent to the Insane Asylum.</p><p></p><p>This son-in-law, with his originally poor reputation and weak character, was also a womanizer, having the heart but not the courage.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Insane Asylum will be haunted by sinister spirits within a month, and he will certainly die. Even if the Shen family comes, they will only find his corpse," Director Zhou Mao said solemnly, tapping the table.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't a month too long? Huang Yanshou took out a silver note and stuffed it into Zhou Mao's chest.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mao's green bean-like eyes lit up: "Okay, okay, this son-in-law will be dead within three days for sure!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Yanshou felt relieved upon hearing this: "Thank you, Director."</p><p></p><p>However, he inwardly despised Zhou Mao, a greedy and lecherous old man.</p><p></p><p>In this Insane Asylum, many beautiful insane women had been violated by him.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Zhou Mao squinted his eyes, his expression lecherous. He suddenly said, "If I'm not mistaken, this Qi boy's parents were artisans, right? Did they leave behind any secret manuals or perhaps some precious... talismans?"</p><p></p><p>He was filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>Artisans in this world held a high status.</p><p></p><p>They mastered exquisite skills and could create powerful talismans to suppress sinister spirits.</p><p></p><p>Powerful talismans were priceless.</p><p></p><p>This son-in-law of the Qi family was able to marry into the Shen family precisely because of his parents' connections, otherwise, with his weak and useless self, he wouldn't even be qualified.</p><p></p><p>"His parents have already passed away, and they left nothing behind." Huang Yanshou quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had left something, he definitely wouldn't give it to Zhou Mao.</p><p></p><p>The Qi family's belongings had already been given to that young master.</p><p></p><p>That young master had made a move against this son-in-law, and Huang Yanshou had some guesses, but he didn't dare confirm them.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that this young master was interested in the Shen family's eldest daughter.</p><p></p><p>The other reason was that the Qi family's parents had offended that young master's family, and that young master seemed to be looking for something from the Qi family.</p><p></p><p>"What a poor wretch." Zhou Mao muttered, then suddenly his lecherous smile appeared, "Yesterday, a woman in her thirties came to the Insane Asylum, still breastfeeding her child, ah, such a charming figure, Young Master Huang, would you like to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's quite interesting," he said.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yangshou shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Although he liked playing with women and often went to brothels to listen to music, he had never been as shameless as this old man, who even played with lunatics.</p><p></p><p>"No, thank you," Huang Yangshou said, and after taking his leave, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yueshan Lake was vast and its waves shimmered. This was the largest lake in Jiangzhou.</p><p></p><p>In Jiangzhou, tens of thousands of fishing households relied on this lake for their livelihood.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were few boats and fishermen on Yueshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>At a dock, there was a ship that was clearly different from the simple fishing boats - it was much more luxurious, like a pleasure boat for officials and nobles. Suddenly, a bird swooped down into the boat and quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, footsteps sounded from the cabin.</p><p></p><p>A pair of long, slender legs came into view, taut and particularly eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>She emanated a frigid aura, her almond eyes wide open and her expression grim: "Miss, your brother-in-law... has raped a widow and encountered a malicious spirit, and has been sent to the asylum!"</p><p></p><p>The seated woman paused slightly, furrowing her brows: "His character is so depraved?"</p><p></p><p>Although she had married this man, they had never met, and she had even missed the wedding ceremony.</p><p></p><p>She had heard rumors about him, that he was of poor character but weak and incompetent.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had actually committed the act of raping a woman? This greatly disappointed her.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, he is just a hypocrite. Aside from having a good appearance, he is utterly useless!" the long-legged woman said unhappily. "When he was in the manor, the steward scolded him as 'young master', but he trembled in fear and dared not argue back. Outside the manor, on the road, he saw some orphans and widows fleeing in distress, and he kicked a seven-year-old girl away, bullying the weak - how despicable!"</p><p></p><p>She spoke breathlessly, clearly very dissatisfied with her brother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman was extremely disappointed: "Alas... I never expected the descendant of Qi Shi to be so wretched. His spirit in heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Shi was a powerful artifact master. He had mysteriously disappeared and eventually perished.</p><p></p><p>This had earned the woman's deep admiration.</p><p></p><p>But his son had turned out to be so depraved - how could she not be enraged? "Go and bring him back, investigate the matter thoroughly. That innocent woman cannot die in vain!" the woman spoke in a voice as cold as ice, her eyes flashing with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" The long-legged woman nodded, but then hesitated, "This Yueshan Lake..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't take any risks until I'm fully prepared." The woman spoke coldly, the murderous intent in her eyes flashing briefly. "We still need to investigate whether someone has framed him. If it's because of me that he has been plotted against, that would be my fault.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, the family of that innocent, wrongly deceased woman should be properly taken care of."</p><p></p><p>The long-legged woman nodded: "Understood, Miss!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ninghe County, in the asylum.</p><p></p><p>The night was pitch-black, and the stars in the sky were faint and sparse.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a new game?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The room was completely dark, with not a single visible object. In the distance, there was a faint candlelight, and a figure seemed to be doing something under the light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the game prompt sounded.</p><p></p><p>【Main quest: Perform the lives, know the lives, create the lives, and become a deity.</p><p></p><p>Start the task of performing the lives.</p><p></p><p>Perform life form 1: Qi Yuan, Shen family son-in-law.</p><p>Perform life form 2: Shenlin, information unknown.</p><p>Perform life form 3: A kitchen knife.</p><p>Perform life form 4: Unlocked.】</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a massive amount of information flooded Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had a better understanding and speculation about this new game.</p><p></p><p>"The characters I'm supposed to perform... could it be that they were created from my blood that I dripped into the game world?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>This performance task was closely related to Qi Yuan's goal of becoming a deity.</p><p></p><p>The path to becoming a deity lies in creation.</p><p></p><p>But how can one create without understanding the lives?</p><p></p><p>This task seems to cater to him, letting him perform the lives.</p><p></p><p>And coincidentally, he had previously dripped his blood into the game world, allowing this world to operate and the game to load.</p><p></p><p>And the three life forms he is supposed to perform, Qi Yuan had a feeling about them.</p><p></p><p>They seem to be the life forms created from his blood.</p><p></p><p>Or rather... the life forms born from his blood.</p><p></p><p>"My blood can't be that bad, how did it give birth to this useless Qi Yuan?" Qi Yuan sighed after absorbing the memories.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan is truly a waste!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, everything I have is earned through my own hard work and struggle."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>This world's Qi Yuan is not only a waste, but also a scumbag.</p><p></p><p>"Let me perform a scumbag, or rather, a son-in-law?" Qi Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Although his acting skills are superb, he can't really play a scumbag.</p><p></p><p>But a son-in-law, he can imagine that.</p><p></p><p>"Performing a son-in-law, I should be quite good at it. On the Blue Star, I've seen too many TV dramas about dragon king sons-in-law.</p><p></p><p>It's nothing more than holding the mother-in-law's foot basin, and then getting a big slap. Holding the bathing water is still acceptable, but getting a big slap is absolutely unacceptable!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began to analyze the three life forms he was supposed to perform in detail.</p><p></p><p>The first life form, the son-in-law, he felt he could handle it.</p><p></p><p>"Shenlin... what does that mean?" Qi Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>If the son-in-law Qi Yuan had memories, Shenlin's memories... seemed to be completely absent.</p><p></p><p>If he had to say there was something, it was just one scene - he saw countless skeletons and countless thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>"Is Shenlin a person, or something else?" Qi Yuan couldn't figure it out for the time being.</p><p></p><p>However, he understood that as he progressed in performing the son-in-law Qi Yuan, the subsequent information would gradually be unlocked.</p><p></p><p>"As for Shenlin, it's fine. But this performance of a kitchen knife... what the hell?" Qi Yuan was completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>He himself had a kitchen knife, and it was kept on Mount Qise to guard the house.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was asked to perform a kitchen knife, to play his own pet, this was truly baffling.</p><p></p><p>"This world..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began to check the memories of the son-in-law Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This world was not the world where the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm were located.</p><p></p><p>The stars reflecting the heavens that he could see here were different from those in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This place is very similar to the ancient era of the Blue Star, but it also has some extraordinary things, called 'Armament Masters'.</p><p></p><p>The Armament Masters are powerful in their own right, using magical artifacts to suppress malicious spirits."</p><p></p><p>Malicious spirits, on the Blue Star, would be ghosts and strange phenomena.</p><p></p><p>They appear mysteriously and are inscrutable, often causing large-scale disasters.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people have no ability to resist malicious spirits.</p><p></p><p>Only the Armament Masters, relying on their own strength and powerful magical artifacts, can confront the malicious spirits.</p><p></p><p>However, the son-in-law Qi Yuan lived so poorly that not only had he never seen a magical artifact or an Armament Master, he had never even seen a malicious spirit - he was the waste of all wastes.</p><p></p><p>"This place... can't be cultivated?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was about to cultivate the Immortal Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>But he found that he could not cultivate.</p><p></p><p>There was no spiritual energy here, nor any factors suitable for cultivating the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have to kill people to level up." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although he cannot cultivate, when he looked around, he saw that everyone else had a health bar above their heads.</p><p></p><p>Having a health bar means they can be killed, and experience can be gained!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan, after all, is law-abiding and kind, and he never indiscriminately kills the innocent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in his current state, who can he kill? If he encounters an Armament Master, he might just end up game over.</p><p></p><p>So he has to accumulate provisions and level up slowly.</p><p></p><p>Now, the crisis he is facing is quite serious.</p><p></p><p>That widow, the son-in-law Qi Yuan was indeed tempted, even his blood was boiling, but unfortunately that little virgin's blood was too weak, and he fainted as soon as he saw the widow's body, even worse than those male protagonists on the Blue Star who would get nosebleeds at the sight of a beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>Later, the son-in-law Qi Yuan was framed for raping Lady Liu and was sent to the asylum.</p><p></p><p>With the son-in-law Qi Yuan's underdeveloped little brain, he actually thought it was just a misunderstanding, and that everything would be easily resolved when the Shen family people came.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, with his high intelligence and emotional intelligence, immediately saw that there were major problems.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, where did the son-in-law Qi Yuan go?" At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>According to his memory, this son-in-law Qi Yuan had been lying unconscious on the bed after being sent to the asylum.</p><p></p><p>But after Qi Yuan descended into the game, the son-in-law Qi Yuan had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the flickering candlelight slowly approached Qi Yuan, and an ashen-faced old man with a ghastly smile on his face said, "Are you curious about where the person on the bed went?"</p><p></p><p>The old man's face had a bizarre smile, making him even more eerie under the candlelight.</p><p></p><p>Especially his skin, which was very smooth, without the wrinkled appearance of a normal old person.</p><p></p><p>"Where did he go?" Qi Yuan looked at the old man, asking curiously.</p><p></p><p>Did this guy see what happened to the son-in-law Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"He... was eaten by you!" The pale-faced old man said decisively.</p><p></p><p>The candlelight flickered, and his shadow on the wall swayed.</p><p></p><p>"I ate him?" Qi Yuan blinked his eyes, quickly opening his mouth wide and anxiously said, "Can you help me check, is there anything stuck in my teeth? Is there still something left?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very nervous.</p><p></p><p>If that scumbag Qi Yuan was stuck in his teeth, would he have bad breath? Or rather, a corpse stench!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the pale-faced old man carefully leaned in and observed closely: "You ate him very cleanly, not a trace left... Hmm... Grandpa's belly is hungry!"</p><p></p><p>He said, looking quite pitiful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Alive, this old man is truly insane?</p><p></p><p>"I'm hungry too." Qi Yuan said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced old man heard Qi Yuan's words and said mysteriously, "Actually, I know your identity. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan looked at the pale-faced old man again.</p><p></p><p>Is this guy really a lunatic?</p><p></p><p>"You are a deity who has descended from the heavens, showering sweet dew, universally saving and compassionately benefiting the world!"</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced old man raved, his expression somewhat distorted.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be suppressing some pain, and Qi Yuan saw that there were black lines flowing in his veins.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the distortion on his face disappeared, and he looked at Qi Yuan and whispered, "Great deity, I want to follow you to overthrow this bitter world!"</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa's belly is hungry, I want to eat big steamed buns!"</p><p></p><p>"...White steamed buns?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao climbed up the city wall, already panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had many questions in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Are you guarding this place?" Zhang Sheng asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This was the battlefield of life and death in the Central Plains! Of the one hundred and eighty thousand cities, a third had already become desolate lands.</p><p></p><p>Wuguicheng was also considered a semi-desolate land.</p><p></p><p>For more than ten years, the Great Xia had never been able to gather an army and send it here.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the broken sword, somewhat regretful: "It's been a while, but unfortunately... I haven't encountered any demonic calamities."</p><p></p><p>"You're not from the Great Xia, you're a wandering knight?" Zhang Sheng looked at the city wall and saw no Great Xia military flags, instantly understanding.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were still many wandering knights who bravely came to the Central Plains to fight.</p><p></p><p>And these wandering knights were mostly cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao were not really true cultivators, they were only mediocre ones.</p><p></p><p>This time they came with the army, and there were only half cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were all killed by the demonic calamities.</p><p></p><p>"I guess you can call me a wandering knight!" Qi Yuan did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>"May I plant the Great Xia military flag here?</p><p>This represents that Wuguicheng is still under the control of the Great Xia." Zhang Sheng looked at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"You may." Qi Yuan looked at these two NPCs, his expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Even though the auras of these two NPCs were already very weak and they were not far from death.</p><p></p><p>But the two of them had no fear of death, but were instead very excited.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Chen Jiao heard Qi Yuan's permission, and from the bloody, wrinkled military flag in his chest, he carefully smoothed it out.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng also helped next to him, and the two of them were busy as if they were doing a solemn task.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just planting the military flag on the city wall, the two of them were panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>The strong wind blew, the dust flew, and the military flag fluttered.</p><p></p><p>The two of them looked at the military flag, their eyes filled with a longing expression: "I wonder how long this military flag can stand."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that General Yuan can't see the military flag planted on the top of Wuguicheng." Zhang Sheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>General Yuan was the general leading the Songzi Camp.</p><p></p><p>Facing the attack of hundreds of demonic calamities, he slew dozens of enemies, but finally died of exhaustion, his eyes still open, looking towards Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng knew that General Yuan was a nobleman of the Great Xia and had met the emperor.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, General Yuan had said that if the military flag could not be planted on the top of Wuguicheng, the Great Xia would cease to exist in twenty years and would be completely incorporated into the Great Sui, guarding Jialancheng together with the Great Sui.</p><p></p><p>The two of them sighed, then looked at Qi Yuan: "Sir, what about the demonic calamities in Wuguicheng?"</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few wandering around, and I have slain them." Qi Yuan sat on the city wall, seemingly bored passing the time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was also carefully studying the cultivation method he had obtained in the Canglan Realm, trying to deepen his understanding.</p><p></p><p>One day in the Canglan Realm was equivalent to ten years here, he must make good use of this time difference in the game.</p><p></p><p>The "Qi Yuan Sutra" he had just stitched together could be said to be full of problems except for cultivation, it would not become a food source.</p><p></p><p>Not only would his memory deteriorate, but his mind would also become disordered.</p><p></p><p>He was deepening his understanding, making the loopholes in the "Qi Yuan Sutra" fewer.</p><p></p><p>Only when the demonic calamities appeared would he take action, otherwise he would just sit on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic calamities wandering in Wuguicheng must be over a hundred, right? Are you a cultivator?" Chen Jiao couldn't help but ask, "What realm are you in?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng quickly glared at Chen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao suddenly realized that he had been too abrupt and should not have asked about a cultivator's realm.</p><p></p><p>"Level 49, very weak." Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao was stunned when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng felt that this was Qi Yuan's unwillingness to reveal his true identity and strength.</p><p></p><p>Night fell quickly.</p><p></p><p>The whole world was about to turn pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sky, the night sky was pitch black.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, why is there no starlight in your world?"</p><p></p><p>After coming to Wuguicheng, Qi Yuan discovered that in this world, at night, the whole world was as black as ink.</p><p></p><p>There were no stars or starlight at all.</p><p></p><p>"Stars in the sky? What do you mean?" Zhang Sheng was a bit confused, not understanding what Qi Yuan was saying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and roughly understood.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were no stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that all the stars in the sky have been eaten?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Yuan became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, it's dark at night, you're not cultivators, you can't see it, go find a place to sleep." Qi Yuan was still kind, reminding them.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao came down from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>After descending the last step, the two of them turned around with tacit understanding and looked up deeply at the Great Xia military flag in the night.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, at dawn.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still sitting on the city wall, contemplating the cultivation method of the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he would glance sideways at the interior of Wuguicheng, and he could see two panting men diligently moving and burying the white bones.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were seriously injured and didn't look like they would last long.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were constantly moving the corpses.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao climbed up the city wall, panting heavily, carrying a large wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, would you like to drink some wine?" The box was full of wine.</p><p></p><p>The wine jar was opened, the aroma of wine wafted, with a sour and alcoholic smell mixed together.</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, Qi Yuan, due to his illness, did not touch a drop of alcohol.</p><p></p><p>He also did not have the habit of drinking often.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both, I don't drink wine, I go crazy when I drink." Qi Yuan refused the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, this wine is the unique 'Daughter's Fragrance' of our Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>When the daughters of our Great Xia are born, the families will bury a few jars of 'Daughter's Fragrance'.</p><p></p><p>It will only be taken out when they get married.</p><p></p><p>Normally, we can't even drink it, only we soldiers who come to Wuguicheng, on the battlefield, will have some civilians lining the streets to send us wine." Chen Jiao said, pouring a jar of "Daughter's Fragrance" into his mouth, "If we don't drink it now, we'll never get to drink it."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng also picked up a wine jar and gulped it down: "If we don't drink it now, no one will drink it."</p><p></p><p>The entire city wall was filled with the aroma of wine.</p><p></p><p>After drinking, Zhang Sheng walked over to Qi Yuan: "Young master, I searched the city and found many good things.</p><p></p><p>These are blood-nourishing pills, these are blood-replenishing pills, these are healing medicines, they should be useful to you, I brought some up."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the bottles and jars that Zhang Sheng brought out, and he said, "Your injuries are very serious, use up the healing medicines here, and you might be able to live a day or two longer."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young master, for your kindness." Zhang Sheng smiled shyly when he heard this, "But we two are just worthless lives, we can probably only exchange for a few demonic calamities, these pills are better for you to use."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached out and took the blood-replenishing pill: "The rest, you take them, I don't need them."</p><p></p><p>"Young master..." Zhang Sheng still wanted to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you have ulterior motives, giving me healing medicines, are you cursing me to get injured?</p><p>Can these demonic calamities hurt me? I find them adorable, they are all experience treasures." Qi Yuan was disdainful of the demonic calamities, "You are afraid of the demonic calamities, but I find them lovely."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao heard this and felt that Qi Yuan's words were somewhat difficult to understand, and they no longer forcibly gave the medicines to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The two of them could only cough and say, "The young master is indeed the young master."</p><p></p><p>The two of them sat on the city wall, drinking and chatting.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the demonic calamity army will appear here."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Great Xia military flag may not be able to fly for long."</p><p></p><p>"Young master, while the demonic calamities have not come, why don't you leave?</p><p>With your strength, you should at least be a high-level commander, if you leave Wuguicheng and go to other cities, you might still have a chance to survive."</p><p></p><p>In the Liufeng Realm, the classification of cultivators was very simple, divided into non-mainstream, Realm 1, Realm 2, Realm 3, Realm 4, and Realm 5.</p><p></p><p>Realm 1 was called a commander; Realm 2 was called a hegemon, the hegemon of a region; Realm 3 was called a national defender, one person could defend a nation; Realm 4 was called a land legend, a godly figure; </p><p>Realm 5 was called the supreme, the strongest existence in the world.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that in the one hundred and eighty thousand cities, some cities had supreme beings guarding them.</p><p>Those cities were truly impregnable, the demonic calamities could not enter.</p><p></p><p>"I am the guardian of Wuguicheng, naturally I will not leave." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally would not leave.</p><p></p><p>The longer he guarded, the higher the rewards.</p><p></p><p>In the Wangyue Continent, when he slew monsters, he could gain experience.</p><p></p><p>But to obtain treasures at the level of Heavenly Dao fragments, he needed to complete the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>The demonic calamities here were very tempting, but they only provided Qi Yuan with experience.</p><p></p><p>To get higher rewards, he had to guard Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Great Xia military flag is planted on Wuguicheng, the demonic calamities will know about it in less than a day, and in less than five days, the demonic calamity army will come here." Zhang Sheng said.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the military flag was not planted, the demonic calamities would also know the situation in Wuguicheng, just a bit later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was stunned: "If the military flag is not planted, the demonic calamities will not send new ones here?"</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting here for the demonic calamities for so long, but they never came, was it because the military flag was not planted?</p><p></p><p>"They will, just a bit slower." Zhang Sheng didn't quite understand why this young master was so ignorant of these things, and he explained in detail.</p><p></p><p>"So as long as the military flag is there, the demonic calamity army will come within five days?" Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he could control the arrival time of the demonic calamity army based on the military flag.</p><p></p><p>"That's about it." Zhang Sheng answered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two of them, his gaze filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>The two of them felt their hearts racing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The pace quickened, and then Qi Yuan said, "Do you have any extra military flags here? The more, the better."</p><p></p><p>"Yes... yes." Zhang Sheng didn't understand, but still brought out a few military flags.</p><p></p><p>These military flags were found in the city and simply collected.</p><p></p><p>"Young hero, what do you need so many military flags for?" Zhang Sheng couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"One military flag is not enough, I need to guard this place for a long time," Qi Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>One day in the outside world, nearly ten years in the game.</p><p></p><p>He had to take advantage of this time to cultivate well and increase his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to persuade Qi Yuan to leave this place, but the words wouldn't come out anymore.</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Jiao next to him didn't think too much about it, gulping down the wine, his face occasionally revealing a heroic expression: "I never thought that I, Chen Jiao, could die in this city with such a young hero."</p><p></p><p>As far as he was concerned, the demonic horde was approaching the border, and they would all have to die in this city.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave Chen Jiao a cold look: "You will die, but I will not.</p><p></p><p>Where have players ever died completely in the game?"</p><p></p><p>It's the NPCs... unfortunately, they won't respawn at a fixed location.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng quickly grabbed Chen Jiao's sleeve: "Young hero, your divine skills are unparalleled, you will surely make the demonic horde flee in disarray!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao, seeing this, also started to flatter.</p><p></p><p>As Zhang Sheng said this, he was deeply admiring Qi Yuan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The demonic horde was approaching ferociously and would soon arrive, but the young hero had no intention of leaving.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhang Sheng feel a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the city could not be defended, yet still stubbornly guarding it. </p><p></p><p>This kind of heroic spirit was truly admirable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>The Residence of Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Xia was only sixteen years old, but had been ruling for four years.</p><p></p><p>In these four years, he had worked hard to balance the four directions, organizing a cultivator army, and finally established the Song Camp, led by General Yuan, and dispatched it to Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the young face of the Great Xia Emperor revealed a hopeful expression: "Lord Yuan has not let me down, the military flag of Great Xia has finally been planted on the walls of Wuguicheng."</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand eight hundred cities were not only cities, but also formations.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a military flag was planted on the city walls, the Zhenlong Bell in the Imperial Palace of Great Xia would ring nine times.</p><p></p><p>If the military flag fell, it would ring once.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, the Zhenlong Bell of Great Xia rang nine times.</p><p></p><p>The Great Xia Emperor didn't even have time to put on his shoes before rushing to the Ancestral Shrine.</p><p></p><p>Now, Wuguicheng has returned to Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>This also means that Great Xia will have another twenty years of national fortune.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the city is lost for twenty years, Great Xia will be destroyed and annexed by Great Sui.</p><p></p><p>Being annexed by Great Sui, although it is also to resist the demonic horde, who wants to be cannon fodder? Who wants to be completely exploited?</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's face was full of excitement, but when he saw the tears in the eyes of Lord Yuan's wife, his excitement dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The military flag of Great Xia has been planted on Wuguicheng, but when will the soldiers of Great Xia return? </p><p></p><p>In a few more days, the demonic horde will attack Wuguicheng again, how long can Wuguicheng hold out? The Great Xia Emperor did not want to hear the sound of the bell ringing again, signaling the fall of Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Qi Yuan often saw Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao stumbling around the city, burying the corpses.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were getting weaker and weaker, their breath almost hanging by a thread.</p><p></p><p>However, the two of them seemed to be holding on, never collapsing.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, if the demonic horde doesn't come, I'll die," Chen Jiao sat on the city wall, cursing.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng also knew that his time had come: "Before I die, I must at least kill one demon!"</p><p></p><p>That way, it wouldn't be a complete loss.</p><p></p><p>In the last few days, the two of them no longer buried the corpses, just holding on to their last breath, guarding the military flag of Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, the ground began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The two on the city wall were suddenly energized.</p><p></p><p>They struggled to their feet, standing on the city wall, looking at the yellow sand billowing in the distance.</p><p></p><p>From the yellow sand, about seven or eight hundred huge demonic beasts were rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>Like giant elephants charging, the dust was flying.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful demonic army, once they charged into the mortal army, the army would be torn apart in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful demons, Wuguicheng could not be defended.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng's face showed no fear, he picked up a bowl: "Drink this wine with me!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao also drank the wine in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The bowl crashed to the ground, breaking into seven or eight pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, these demons have finally come!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng looked up at Qi Yuan, a look of regret flashing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This young hero had been staying here, and now, there was no chance for him to leave.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao cursed and looked at the surging demons, his voice tinged with tears: "I want to go home, I left in a hurry and forgot to castrate the pig I gave to neighbor Li's widow..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the demons below, a hint of a smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So they've finally come?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the demonic army below, holding the broken sword, standing on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then shouted loudly: "I am the Defender of Wuguicheng, those who dare to trespass Wuguicheng shall die!"</p><p></p><p>The voice rang out, falling into the demonic army's camp.</p><p></p><p>The demonic army ignored it and charged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this, his expression turning cold: "Although you are crazy and can't understand human speech, if you don't give me face, I'll have to trouble you."</p><p></p><p>He held the broken sword and leapt down from the thirty-zhang high city wall.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, this was like stepping on flat ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao saw this scene, their hearts surging.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that we two are not cultivators, otherwise we would definitely jump down and fight to the death with that young hero!" Zhang Sheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>They were just low-level cultivators, only knowing some superficial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Jumping down from such a high city wall would certainly mean death.</p><p></p><p>"Young hero, please slay the enemies, we two will accompany you on the path to the underworld!" Zhang Sheng shouted with all his might.</p><p></p><p>This shout seemed to have used up all his strength, and after that, his spirit became rather dispirited.</p><p></p><p>"The three of us together, it won't be lonely!" Chen Jiao also shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard the voices and said calmly, "You two sit on the city wall and watch as I slay these small fry one by one!"</p><p></p><p>"Before we die, being able to see the young hero slaughtering the demons, this life... is not in vain!" Zhang Sheng's voice was intermittent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan held the long sword.</p><p></p><p>The seven or eight hundred demons, like rampaging elephants, charged towards him.</p><p></p><p>Dust and sand flew, filling the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stepped on the yellow sand, his long hair fluttering, his sleeves rustling.</p><p></p><p>Slashing the Heavens Sword Technique! In this moment, Qi Yuan unleashed his powerful skill.</p><p></p><p>Although he is currently only level 49, the previous powerful skills and minor skills still exist.</p><p></p><p>He was actually a bit curious now.</p><p></p><p>With each ten levels, and every thirty levels, can he awaken other skills as well?</p><p></p><p>Putting aside this emotion, Qi Yuan immersed himself completely in slaying the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan leapt up, the mighty broken sword descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A single sword strike from top to bottom, like a majestic divine statue collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword energy surged, splitting the yellow sand in half, and over a hundred demons were swept away by the sword energy, their bodies shattered and flesh torn.</p><p></p><p>The dead demons instantly vanished into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, slaying ninety-seven demons.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the broken sword and slowly walked towards the demonic army: "Small fry, you should line up obediently and let me cut you down."</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao stared with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>What did they see? One sword strike slaying nearly a hundred demons? This kind of... power... was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This was no mere commander, this was clearly a regional overlord! A regional overlord, going to Great Xia, could be directly enfeoffed as a marquis!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao were utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that this somewhat strange young hero was actually a legendary overlord.</p><p></p><p>They watched as Qi Yuan charged into the demonic army.</p><p></p><p>The broken sword in his hand was like the sharpest divine weapon in the world.</p><p></p><p>Any demons that passed by were struck by the sword.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>In the boundless sky, Qi Yuan slaughtered countless.</p><p></p><p>On the boundless earth, he also fought a bloody battle with nearly three thousand foreign demons.</p><p></p><p>His techniques had been honed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Especially his skills in killing monsters.</p><p></p><p>And now the demons, formed into a large army, were much easier to kill than the scattered demons roaming the city before.</p><p></p><p>The sword moved like a wandering dragon, wherever there were demons, they would be slain!</p><p></p><p>Kill, kill, kill!</p><p></p><p>The yellow sand filled the air, obscuring Qi Yuan's vision.</p><p></p><p>He, with one broken sword, guarded the lonely city.</p><p></p><p>Charging into the demonic army, three times in and three times out.</p><p></p><p>Whoever saw, touched, or heard, were all slain by him.</p><p></p><p>The powerful demonic army was completely wiped out by him alone.</p><p></p><p>As dusk fell, Qi Yuan held the broken sword, his clothes spotless, looking at the last injured and fleeing white bone demon.</p><p></p><p>"Don't run, let's have a fair battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're injured, don't want to fight, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Here's a blood-replenishing pill to heal you."</p><p></p><p>"Forgot, you're a white bone, can't be healed by blood."</p><p></p><p>A sword flash, and the last white bone demon fell under his sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up the broken sword, as he had done before, gently blowing to remove the remaining blood droplets on the sword.</p><p></p><p>The wind and sand blew, Qi Yuan stood in the vast desert, turning to head back.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was only the desert, no lonely smoke, no setting sun over the river.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, how many Great Venerable Ones are there in the Canglan Realm?" Qi Yuan looked at the white-robed woman expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Having finally met someone qualified to be his ideal love, he couldn't help but want to milk her for all she was worth!</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman said solemnly: "There may be some, or there may be none. </p><p></p><p>Faced with the great calamity, even Great Venerable Ones only dare to hide in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Whether they exist or not, what difference does it make?"</p><p></p><p>She was not optimistic about the future of the Canglan Realm. Only by leaving the Canglan Realm and following that path would there be a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you come with me and leave this place of strife?" the white-robed woman urged again.</p><p></p><p>Because that path was full of dangers, it would be very difficult for her to walk it alone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled without speaking, indicating his attitude.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman couldn't help but sigh: "Even Great Venerable Ones only dare to turn a blind eye when faced with the great calamity. You... alas."</p><p></p><p>"Is the great calamity really that terrifying?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity itself is a great terror, but what's even more terrifying is..." The white-robed woman looked up at the sky, gazing at the stars, "There are immortals and gods above it."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman had stayed in the Canglan Realm for nearly ten thousand years. Although she had never seen a Great Venerable One, she vaguely sensed that there must be Great Venerable Ones lying dormant in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>But faced with the great calamity, these Great Venerable Ones remained unmoved, acting like turtles hiding in their shells.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, they were afraid of the great calamity; secondly, they were afraid of the immortals and gods above the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if immortals and gods descended, what could the Canglan Realm use to resist?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked up at the starry sky. He glanced at the moon, his thoughts turning.</p><p></p><p>He felt inexplicably melancholic for a moment, then suddenly brightened up.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, since you're going to leave the Canglan Realm anyway, do you have any unwanted items you could sell off in a clearance sale?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the white-robed woman expectantly.</p><p></p><p>This was a Yin Spirit powerhouse after all.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of such a powerhouse was exceptionally deep.</p><p></p><p>Worth ten thousand Po Langs!</p><p></p><p>No, Po Lang was nothing. Indeed, there are no mistaken names in this world. Po Lang was just scrap metal, how could he compare to a Yin Spirit?</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman was stunned for a moment. She looked at Qi Yuan: "They're all worthless things, probably useless to you."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not picky." Qi Yuan rolled up his sleeves, showing off his muscles. "I eat anything. I'm strong and sturdy, clothes look slim on me, but I'm muscular when I take them off."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed woman was completely speechless. She pondered for a long time, and finally waved her jade hand.</p><p></p><p>A jade pendant fell into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Meeting you is fate. Take this jade pendant to the far north, find any inn, and show it to the innkeeper.</p><p></p><p>You only need to state your request, and those innkeepers will do their best to fulfill it.</p><p></p><p>If you have time, please take care of my sect..."  the white-robed woman sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to survival, the sect she had stayed with for nearly ten thousand years really didn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>She was just holding onto a bit of sentimental attachment.</p><p></p><p>After all, once she left, other forces would definitely covet her sect. It was better to just give it to the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the jade pendant, beaming with joy: "I'm in your debt now, I'll definitely take care of it!"</p><p></p><p>If he could consume all the foundation of a Yin Spirit, Qi Yuan couldn't imagine the results.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, may we meet again if fate allows." After saying this, the white-robed woman's form slowly dissipated by the lake.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the lake before him, his eyes clear: "A great calamity that even Great Venerable Ones don't dare to face is indeed troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, according to what this boss just said, it will call for reinforcements, and those are immortals and gods from the heavens! A group of immortals and gods ganging up on me, a mere Golden Core cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>An image immediately appeared in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Him, a Golden Core cultivator, fighting against a sky full of immortals and gods!</p><p></p><p>"A single star probably wouldn't be enough, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to find a way to call for reinforcements too, or call for stars. We'll see who can call for more, and stronger ones!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Returning to Chuang Kingdom, Qi Yuan landed on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>A map of the Moluo army camp had appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the others and couldn't help but sigh: "As expected, bosses are indeed generous. Before running away, she didn't forget to hand over the sect's wealth to me."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan deliberately glanced at Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>As if hinting that she should be more generous too.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was slightly stunned: "What boss?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint possessed the foundation of a Yin Spirit level powerhouse. How strong would someone he could call a boss be? A Yin Spirit?</p><p></p><p>"A Yin Spirit." Qi Yuan didn't conceal it, as she hadn't asked him to keep it secret. "She said the great calamity is approaching, and she's preparing to run away, to leave this place."</p><p></p><p>"Run away?" Great Wisdom True Lord's expression was rarely solemn. "There's no running away. Does she really think leaving the Canglan Realm can avoid the great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What do you mean?" Qi Yuan looked at Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Based on my observations over many years, I've discovered a terrifying fact." Great Wisdom True Lord's face was grave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heartstrings tightened.</p><p></p><p>The others present also looked at Great Wisdom True Lord, curious in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Although Great Wisdom True Lord was an eccentric person, he was truly a heaven-defying genius. Otherwise, Old Man Wutian wouldn't have wanted to take him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Great Wisdom True Lord. With a solemn expression, he opened his mouth: "Spiritual energy is poisonous!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Through my observations, all those who use spiritual energy to cultivate eventually die.</p><p></p><p>It's evident that spiritual energy is poisonous!" Great Wisdom True Lord said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya couldn't help but refute: "Those who cultivate to the realm of Great Venerable Ones are almost immortal, with lifespans as long as heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Ones also use spiritual energy to cultivate, how come we haven't seen them die of old age?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen a living Great Venerable One?" Great Wisdom True Lord said eerily.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was momentarily speechless: "...No, I haven't seen a Yang Spirit either. Does that mean Yang Spirits don't exist?"</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord looked up at the starry sky: "Who knows if they exist or not?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, on the other hand, was internally shaken.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if spiritual energy being poisonous was true or false.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation methods of the Canglan Realm were indeed problematic.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating, one would become nourishment.</p><p></p><p>This Great Wisdom True Lord was truly a great talent!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan thought of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on Blue Star who had breathed oxygen had died? Doesn't that mean... oxygen is poisonous?</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity is approaching, all living beings are withering. Escaping won't solve the problem," Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"I support Great Wisdom True Lord's view. When I become powerful enough, I'll definitely sneak into the lair of the great calamity and chop off its dog head with one slash!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord's eyes lit up: "Senior, can you take me with you? I also want to see the dog head of the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered: "I happen to need someone to play the suona. When I'm chopping off the great calamity's dog head, you can play for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Great Wisdom True Lord nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya remained silent.</p><p></p><p>These two... were really blowing hot air.</p><p></p><p>Without the strength of a Great Venerable One, who would dare to face the great calamity directly?</p><p></p><p>With only a few hundred years until the great calamity, even if the Blood-Robed Sword Saint was a heaven-defying genius, he wouldn't reach the level of a Great Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, slay the Moluo!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'll play the suona for you now, to get used to it!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, can I join too?" Xu Tongchen said weakly.</p><p></p><p>His master's job was about to be stolen! He felt a sense of crisis and needed to join in.</p><p></p><p>"Sure, no problem." Qi Yuan was very happy. He looked at Jiang Ya, "Do you want to join too? I need a cheerleader!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya shook her head vigorously.</p><p></p><p>That really wasn't necessary!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days later, in a pitch-black valley, howling winds raged.</p><p></p><p>In the valley, giant beasts four or five meters tall were all sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Black scales reflected faint light, appearing particularly eerie in the silent night.</p><p></p><p>These Moluo clan members were all asleep.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had come here and seen this scene, he would have had to compliment them for not snoring while sleeping.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a cave.</p><p></p><p>Five terrifying figures appeared. The aura they emitted seemed out of place with the surrounding environment, vaguely rejected by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, as the Dao of Heaven in this world was flawed, the rejection was not so severe.</p><p></p><p>"The Canglan Realm has broken faith, actually letting Purple Palace cultivators intervene, slaughtering our clansmen at will. It's truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"Who will take action to capture that Purple Palace cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't the five of us act together? After all, they broke faith first!"</p><p></p><p>"Good. After we kill that Purple Palace cultivator, let's pacify the Wangyue Continent. Why don't we then attack the Canglan Realm?" A Purple Palace powerhouse was eager to try.</p><p></p><p>After all, in their eyes, the Canglan Realm was much stronger than the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>Such a world would have more resources.</p><p></p><p>"That... let's not think about it." A senior Purple Palace cultivator spoke up. "The waters of the Canglan Realm run deep. Even Yin Spirit Venerable Ones are cautious about entering, let alone us."</p><p></p><p>This senior Purple Palace cultivator had an ancestor who had reached the Yin Spirit level, so he held the highest status among the five Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, let's not think about the Canglan Realm then. Let's kill that Purple Palace cultivator first!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Purple Palace cultivator is highly skilled. Should we plan this carefully?"</p><p></p><p>"One late-stage Purple Palace, four mid-stage Purple Palace cultivators. Are we afraid of him?"</p><p></p><p>The five Purple Palace cultivators chatted idly for a while, reaching an agreement, and were about to set out.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a deep voice came:</p><p></p><p>"I've read many stories from the Wangyue Continent recently, especially the tale of the Faceless Sword Saint slaying otherworldly demons.</p><p></p><p>I'm thinking..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If the Faceless Sword God hadn't grown up, and the evil forces from outside directly intervened, wouldn't the Faceless Sword God have been defeated?"</p><p></p><p>The ground split in two, and a demon race member with a body like a mountain of flesh emerged from underground. Its flesh was loose and flabby, but the scales on its back were dense, giving an impression of invincibility.</p><p></p><p>When they saw who had arrived, the five people present all showed expressions of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to Venerable Demon Convergence!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than Venerable Demon Convergence, a Yin God of the demon race.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Demon Convergence had an obese form that made people feel nauseous just looking at him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his eyes were filled with smiles: "I've been bored lately, so I'll accompany you to take a look at this so-called Blood Robe Sword God."</p><p></p><p>He was thirsty and hungry, preparing to go out for some snacks.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for the Venerable to act personally," said the late Purple Mansion stage demon race member. "We can capture the Blood Robe Sword God and offer him to you!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Demon Convergence squinted and smiled: "According to the latest novel I read, if you go to hunt the Blood Robe Sword God, you might end up giving him experience points. </p><p></p><p>I'm different. If I act personally, I can strangle his chances for growth."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Demon Convergence said casually. </p><p></p><p>He was just using this as an excuse to go out.</p><p></p><p>"But Venerable... the Moon Dynasty's blockade..." the late Purple Mansion cultivator said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"It's no problem. With my big brother there, the Moon Dynasty people... won't be able to leave," Venerable Demon Convergence said confidently. "After the Moon Dynasty falls, the Wangyue Continent should change its name too."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the several Purple Mansion cultivators didn't try to persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored long sword streaked across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the sound of desolation and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Countless streams of blood essence and sword light danced.</p><p></p><p>In the ranks of the demon army, countless demon race members were slain by the sword light.</p><p></p><p>The endless military camps were shattered by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Under this sword, whether Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Yuan Dan or Nascent Soul stage, none had any chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's sword treated all lives equally.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the devastated continent with gentle eyes.</p><p></p><p>The original battlefield was instantly covered with green mountains and clear waters.</p><p></p><p>The sound of suona horns became even more vigorous and impassioned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the dozens of suona players behind him with a regretful expression: "If only you were all Purple Mansion cultivators, that would be better."</p><p></p><p>Purple Mansion cultivators playing suona would be more impressive.</p><p></p><p>But among those playing suona for him, the strongest were only a few Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The rest were mostly second or third realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ci from the Chuang Kingdom was among them.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had intervened to save the Chuang Kingdom, and Zhao Ci had no way to repay him, so he joined the suona band.</p><p></p><p>Later, as Qi Yuan took action more frequently, more people joined the suona band.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan also controlled their numbers to a certain extent, otherwise it would affect his travels.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya stood to the side with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Everyone else was playing suona, while she was the only one not playing, which felt quite awkward.</p><p></p><p>Now she felt very strange inside.</p><p></p><p>If Great Wisdom True Lord had joined the suona band, she could barely understand.</p><p></p><p>Later, when they went to other countries, the Blood Robe Sword God just casually mentioned it, and as a result, whether commoners or nobles, people from those countries all eagerly volunteered to join the Blood Robe Sword God's music troupe.</p><p></p><p>It was as if joining the music troupe was seen as a lifelong honor.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to say to an emperor of a great country in the music troupe:</p><p></p><p>You're giving up being an emperor to join a band?</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>That emperor of a great country, she had only glanced at him a few times, but could tell he was a man of great ambition and strategy.</p><p></p><p>And this is the result?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what kind of love potion did you give them? Even emperors are coming to play suona for you." By this time, Jiang Ya had figured out Qi Yuan's personality, so she spoke more boldly.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it normal for emperors to play suona? I've even seen carpenter emperors before.</p><p></p><p>I've also seen some countries where comedians become leaders," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was less than half a month left before he fully regained control of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>He was also getting closer and closer to the Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he felt a sense of homesickness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Ci from the suona band stepped forward with a respectful expression: "Senior, an emissary from our Faceless Divine Sect wishes to have an audience with you, saying he has urgent matters to report."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this.</p><p></p><p>His hardcore fan?</p><p></p><p>"Let him come." Qi Yuan was always enthusiastic towards fans.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a middle-aged man in a black embroidered robe appeared. He glanced at the Blood Robe Sword God with a puzzled look in his eyes: "Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what business do you have with me?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, according to information obtained by our Faceless Divine Sect, the demon race has taken notice of you and will send five fifth-realm cultivators to surround and attack you.</p><p></p><p>Please leave this place quickly, otherwise you may be trapped here." The emissary of the Faceless Divine Sect said.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was very curious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, upon seeing the Blood Robe Sword God, this person from another realm, he felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>"Five Purple Mansion cultivators?" Qi Yuan's eyes were helpless, "Why are the techniques from other realms not good enough?"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, these five Purple Mansion cultivators would be five pure loves.</p><p></p><p>The kind he really wanted to utterly destroy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reflected.</p><p></p><p>He felt that in the future, the standards for pure loves should add one more condition - they must be from the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Please hide your identity, Senior. Our Faceless Divine Sect will use special channels to send you to the Moon Dynasty!" The emissary said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>To escort the Blood Robe Sword God to the Moon Dynasty, the external members of their Faceless Divine Sect would serve as bait, and the sacrifices might be very heavy.</p><p></p><p>The emissary knew that the members of the Faceless Divine Sect were all fearless of death and willing to fight for the Wangyue Continent!</p><p></p><p>"I will go to the Moon Dynasty, but there's no need for you to escort me." Qi Yuan didn't take the five Purple Mansion cultivators seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the emissary felt uneasy inside.</p><p></p><p>This senior didn't want to go with him?</p><p></p><p>He was anxious inside and wanted to persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw the Blood Robe Sword God raise his head, look at the sky, and slowly say: "It's too late to leave now, because... their people have arrived."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already sensed the arrival of the demon race's powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, none of them were pure loves who could give him techniques, so Qi Yuan was listless.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword behind him seemed to sense the arrival of powerful enemies and emitted a sword cry.</p><p></p><p>The emissary's face suddenly turned pale: "So fast, we're doomed."</p><p></p><p>How could the Blood Robe Sword God possibly defend against five fifth-realm cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Everyone present would likely die here.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a thick voice like a thunderclap sounded, and the blood drained from the emissary's face even more.</p><p></p><p>Because... he saw a Yin God! A legendary deity!</p><p></p><p>"Kekeke, luckily I came, otherwise you five would have all given him experience points.</p><p></p><p>This one, at a glance, is no ordinary late Purple Mansion cultivator!" </p><p></p><p>The fifteen-meter tall Venerable Demon Convergence appeared, looking down at Qi Yuan with an amused expression, like a cat eyeing a mouse.</p><p></p><p>The five Purple Mansion cultivators from before looked at Qi Yuan with a sense of dread in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They followed behind Venerable Demon Convergence like little lackeys.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone present looked at Venerable Demon Convergence with fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It was the instinct of weak creatures seeing a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Especially the emissary, whose face was now completely bloodless.</p><p></p><p>With a Yin God taking action, the Blood Robe Sword God had no chance of reaching the Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was also sizing up the Yin God, his gaze helpless: "You, a dignified Yin God, bullying a small Golden Core cultivator like me, your face is too thick!"</p><p></p><p>"What an interesting human, your first thought upon seeing me isn't to kneel and beg for mercy.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that you really... have a problem with your head?"</p><p></p><p>"You're the one with a head problem, your whole family has head problems!" Qi Yuan couldn't stand it anymore.</p><p></p><p>If the Yin God insulted him, he had to insult back.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Demon Convergence didn't get angry, still looking at Qi Yuan with interest.</p><p></p><p>But the five Purple Mansion cultivators beside him couldn't help speaking up: "Offending a deity, the crime deserves death!"</p><p></p><p>"Sharp tongue, just accept your death obediently!"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Jiang Ya watched this scene with shock in her eyes, but also curiosity. She wanted to know what the Blood Robe Sword God's trump card really was.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan shrugged helplessly and snapped his fingers: "Play music, play joyful music."</p><p></p><p>This time, they couldn't play funeral music.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Great Wisdom True Lord picked up a suona and started playing.</p><p></p><p>Those people from the Wangyue Continent behind him seemed unafraid of the deity's pressure. Under the deity's gaze, a cheerful yet somewhat incongruous melody began to play.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was silent beside them.</p><p></p><p>Facing a Yin God... and still playing music.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe Sword God was truly extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>No, those second and third realm cultivators playing music were also extraordinary! After all, who would dare to provoke a deity like this? Even Purple Mansion cultivators wouldn't dare. </p><p></p><p>Yet these people had done it! She was very puzzled!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

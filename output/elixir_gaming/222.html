        <h1>Chapter 222</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The woman in the red dress stopped what she was doing, seeming to ponder something.</p><p></p><p>"No-food body."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Just three words?" Qi Yuan was slightly stunned. </p><p></p><p>Three words seemed too lacking in prestige.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen others with names like Innate Sacred Body Dao Embryo, Heavenly Mandate Chaos God-Demon Body, Innate JK Sacred Body, or at least four-word names like Primordial Sacred Body."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never heard of a No-food Body before.</p><p></p><p>"That's the name I gave it," said the woman in red, looking at Qi Yuan with a mischievous glint in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused, then took a deep breath: "It seems we have quite a connection. The technique I created is called 'The Qi Yuan Scripture'."</p><p></p><p>He created the Qi Yuan Scripture, while the No-food Holy Mother called herself the No-food Body. Quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>"What are the characteristics of the No-food Body?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he wanted to understand the state of the No-food Holy Mother's body.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you already see?" The No-food Holy Mother didn't answer directly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't think it's that simple. The way you looked at me earlier was strange," Qi Yuan recalled the way the No-food Holy Mother had looked at him before, instinctively feeling a sense of creepiness.</p><p></p><p>The woman in red stopped eating fish. Her pearly teeth lightly bit her lower lip as she glanced sideways at Qi Yuan: "Are you afraid I'll eat you?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she deliberately ate a piece of fish, biting down hard as if she were eating Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid," Qi Yuan blurted out.</p><p></p><p>They were separated by time and space. Even if she were possessed by gluttony, she couldn't eat him.</p><p></p><p>The woman in red said nothing more and continued eating fish.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat to the side, watching as the woman's complexion gradually improved and her mood seemed to lighten.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the Heavenly Pillar was recovering somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He could continue to enter the Mountain of Contemplation to meditate.</p><p></p><p>However, something occurred to him, and he asked: "If... I were to feed you polluted fish, could you chew it slowly like this?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the No-food Holy Mother he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>She had been eating fish right next to him.</p><p></p><p>The fish hadn't been purified, yet she ate it with relish.</p><p></p><p>"No," the No-food Holy Mother answered directly.</p><p></p><p>Another doubt arose in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the one he saw was a No-food Holy Mother from a parallel universe?</p><p></p><p>That No-food Holy Mother didn't seem to have such a strong reaction to polluted fish like the one before him.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if you meet me in the future, please remind me that you've seen me before."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Liars are little dogs!" Seeing the No-food Holy Mother agree so casually, Qi Yuan felt she would really deceive him.</p><p></p><p>As they say, beautiful women are the best at deceiving, because less attractive women wouldn't be believed if they tried to deceive.</p><p></p><p>"Why would I deceive you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll trust you this once."</p><p></p><p>"Are the evil gods very powerful?" the No-food Holy Mother asked at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... they're somewhat strong, but it's no problem. Villain bosses are all destined to die by my hand!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"You seem very sure of yourself," the No-food Holy Mother remarked with an inexplicable sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I've already made a detailed plan in three steps. Now the plan has progressed to the latter half of the first step. Soon my plan will be complete!" Qi Yuan was quite excited when talking about his plan.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was his outstanding work, so of course he had to show it off frequently.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity... I was born a bit too early," the No-food Holy Mother seemed to think of something, her voice becoming melancholy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He recalled that the last time he saw the No-food Holy Mother, she had said something similar.</p><p></p><p>Coincidence? Or...? Could it be that the No-food Holy Mother he saw last time was her, but why didn't she recognize him?</p><p></p><p>Or did she recognize him but not say anything?</p><p></p><p>Could there be some conspiracy? Qi Yuan couldn't help but speculate. He was about to open his mouth to ask something.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt the temperature around him seem to drop.</p><p></p><p>The autumn waters in the red-dressed woman's eyes disappeared, replaced by bone-chilling coldness.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes looked at Qi Yuan coldly. Even across time and space, Qi Yuan felt a piercing coldness.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to sleep," said the No-food Holy Mother as she finished the last of the fish, her voice ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Her attitude towards Qi Yuan had changed 180 degrees.</p><p></p><p>The previous slight closeness had turned to icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan: "She's really pulled out the three treasures of a goddess."</p><p></p><p>Though the No-food Holy Mother's attitude had suddenly changed, Qi Yuan was only curious, and naturally wouldn't try to warm up to her cold demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"Remember to eat fish tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the No-food Holy Mother's voice was still cold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rested one hand behind his head as he watched the No-food Holy Mother enter the depths of the bamboo house and lie down on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"This one changes faces faster than the weather changes."</p><p></p><p>"Do mythical beings still need to sleep?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left the bamboo house and walked out aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>The night was still deep.</p><p></p><p>The lake shimmered with ripples, giving off a faint red glow.</p><p></p><p>The wind blew through the green bamboo, swaying back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached out his hand, wanting to feel the wind, but he couldn't grasp it at all.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Qi Yuan saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of Mount Tianzhu, the Great Master Lingzhong and Old Man Fanxin had not yet left.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to be discussing something.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan's ears couldn't hear everything.</p><p></p><p>He could only hear fragments of their conversation.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect there's another person by the No-food Holy Mother's side."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, this old man hasn't sensed anyone."</p><p></p><p>"That person... really exists... imagination..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened for a long time but didn't hear any useful information.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the No-food Holy Mother's bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>After all, eavesdropping on people's conversations was not a good thing to do all the time.</p><p></p><p>Time always passes quickly.</p><p></p><p>The top of the Heavenly Pillar was empty, with few signs of human habitation.</p><p></p><p>Over these two days, the No-food Holy Mother had cooked many more fish. After Qi Yuan's purification, these fish became immaculate and were slowly consumed by the No-food Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>The No-food Holy Mother's complexion improved more and more.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pillar also seemed to become more stable.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that surprised Qi Yuan was that since that night when the No-food Holy Mother had turned ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>These past two days, she had been quite cold towards Qi Yuan, and they didn't communicate much, lacking the initial harmonious atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>If she wanted to be cold, then let her be cold.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care.</p><p></p><p>His purpose was simply to feed the No-food Holy Mother, to make the Heavenly Pillar more stable. He hadn't come to the past to talk about love with the No-food Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they were just casual acquaintances, not even true friends.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be leaving at dawn tomorrow, so make more fish tonight," Qi Yuan said as he pretended to sunbathe at noon, looking towards the No-food Holy Mother not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the red-dressed woman's response was still ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>If the relationship was strained, so be it.</p><p></p><p>After all... it was just cooperation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to the Mountain of Contemplation to meditate on the divine. I'll be leaving for a while," Qi Yuan continued. "If you feel unwell, tell me in advance, and I'll stop the meditation."</p><p></p><p>Meditating on the Thunder Ancestor had caused cracks to appear in the Mountain of Contemplation, which had injured both the Heavenly Pillar and the No-food Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally felt some guilt about this.</p><p></p><p>"The Mountain of Empty Contemplation has not..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"If cracks appear, it's no big deal." The Foodless Holy Mother's voice remained icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan said, then his form vanished.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Celestial Pillar, only the Foodless Holy Mother remained in the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>She looked at where Qi Yuan had disappeared, her expression cold: "I am not one to break my word."</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths passed, when suddenly a cat's meow was heard.</p><p></p><p>A pure white kitten appeared outside the bamboo house. Its eyes were jet black as it secretly observed the Foodless Holy Mother inside.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>The cat's body instantly shifted and vanished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly voice spoke:</p><p></p><p>"This cat is born with pure spirit and has a connection to you, Foodless One. Why not keep and train it? It may become a great master in the future." Old Man Fanxin appeared with a smile, his eyes twinkling.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a passing visitor. Why should it stay long? Even its death would be troublesome," the Foodless Holy Mother's voice was icy cold, identical to how she spoke to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Fanxin felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother he saw two days ago was indeed unusual. </p><p></p><p>This current one was the normal one.</p><p></p><p>"Why always keep people at arm's length, Foodless One... You should interact more with fellow cultivators like us, build relationships. It's beneficial for cultivation. Our lifespans are nearly infinite, so having more companions brings more joy, doesn't it?" Old Man Fanxin said with a smile. "That cat has a connection with you. Keeping it is just keeping it, a way to pass time."</p><p></p><p>"More companions... to eat their feasts?" The woman in the red dress inexplicably recalled what that person said about eating feasts, and blurted out.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, when she went out with Qi Yuan to buy melons, bowls, and other items, she heard him talk a lot about eating at feasts.</p><p></p><p>He also said that good chefs should go to New Oriental.</p><p></p><p>She had been listening and keeping it in mind.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Foodless Holy Mother's words, Old Man Fanxin's expression froze: "Saying such things is rather inauspicious."</p><p></p><p>To be a peer of the Foodless Holy Mother, one would have to be a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>How could it be possible to eat the feasts of mythical beings?</p><p></p><p>"You should go back. I will participate in the battle at the Dragon Rising Arena. Tell the other mythical beings that this time the evil god is unusually powerful. They should be prepared... to perish."</p><p></p><p>"What!" Old Man Fanxin was shocked. "You can't be joking?"</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother didn't speak again. She ate her fish and said softly: "So since everyone is going to die, there's no need to get acquainted. It would only add to the sorrow."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A thousand miles away from Mount Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Qingshui Village and the ancient gods stood in place.</p><p></p><p>Following Qi Yuan's instructions, they hadn't moved around to avoid accidents.</p><p></p><p>The translation continues, but I'll stop here to keep the response length reasonable. Let me know if you would like me to continue translating the rest of the excerpt.</p>

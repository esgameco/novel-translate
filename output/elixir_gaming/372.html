        <h1>Chapter 372</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu stood to the side, his expression somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. Human hearts are too complicated. If that mysterious force could be of one mind with us, the task entrusted by Dongjun would not be so difficult to complete. </p><p></p><p>It's a shame they are too mysterious and impossible to communicate with. Otherwise... if we could let them meet Dongjun and hear his words, they would surely be convinced by Dongjun and work together for the sake of this world."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Black Deer again: "Is Dongjun's eloquence that good? I'm looking forward to meeting him more and more."</p><p></p><p>These people's faith in Dongjun had reached a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found it quite strange. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that Dongjun also had such personal charisma like him?</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan believed he was still somewhat inferior to Dongjun.</p><p></p><p>After all, his subjects were all his divine infants, all himself.</p><p></p><p>It was quite normal to believe in oneself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan thought of the corpse in the coffin from the ruins: "Have you ever seen Dongjun's dao partner, that Ancestral Demon Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu shook his head: "Never. We have never seen Dongjun's true form either. What we've seen is only his avatar."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan didn't think much more about it.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu's gaze fell on the base of the high tower, his eyes carrying a smile: "Mr. Qi indeed has good eyesight and judgment of people.</p><p></p><p>That young man named Mu Yan has already reached the fifteenth floor, in the first echelon.</p><p></p><p>As for that black-robed youth, hehe, he really is afraid of heights, frozen in fear on the sixth floor.</p><p></p><p>The sixth floor is overseen by Wuzhu Ji Qi. She only made a small change to the challenge content, and that black-robed man is already struggling to move forward."</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu was very good at dealing with people. Without showing it, he mentioned Wuzhu Ji Qi's favor towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This also gave Wuzhu Ji Qi a favor.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a titled Wuzhu who didn't care about the favor of an ordinary Wuzhu, what was the difficulty in doing it casually?</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad." Qi Yuan commented casually.</p><p></p><p>He glanced briefly at the struggles inside the high tower.</p><p></p><p>Those Wuwang fighting with all their might were, to him now, like a battle between paramecia and yeast - quite uninteresting to watch.</p><p></p><p>These people were not as interesting as those keyboard warriors on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>After all, those keyboard warriors would stir things up and argue heatedly, which was especially interesting.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness once again probed into the post he had made earlier.</p><p></p><p>When he saw his own post, he was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"So many days have passed, how come there are no new replies?</p><p></p><p>Have I been shadow banned?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan maliciously speculated.</p><p></p><p>According to the principle of inequality, if I don't have traffic, it means I'm being maliciously targeted.</p><p></p><p>"Too outrageous." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered. He tagged the genius who had previously suggested buying a piece of land and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Genius, any other insights? What should I do after buying the land?"</p><p></p><p>Before long, the genius's reply came.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, brother, Canstar is about to invade. I don't have time to chat nonsense with you anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Canstar is invading, I see.</p><p></p><p>We're not chatting nonsense here, we're discussing something that could change the landscape of the cultivation world." Qi Yuan replied seriously.</p><p></p><p>Creating the underworld was such a big deal, how could it be called nonsense.</p><p></p><p>If there was an underworld in the world, wouldn't it mean a perfect utopian society could be achieved, realizing true socialism?</p><p></p><p>The elderly would be cared for, the able-bodied employed, the young educated, and the dead would have a place to go.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, perfect.</p><p></p><p>If one felt bored after death, they could also work for free in Qi Yuan's underworld. How nice, to have a job without having to spend money.</p><p></p><p>"Forget about the big picture, let's take care of ourselves first," the genius said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, don't worry," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"This concerns everyone. How can it be fine? When war breaks out, how many people will die, prices will soar, order will collapse.</p><p></p><p>If Gongxing is defeated, we might become slaves.</p><p></p><p>Our parents, wives and children will be at the mercy of others, and our own fates will be completely controlled by the enemy." The genius's tone was full of bitterness and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he didn't have a good outlook on Qin Yuan's resistance against Canstar.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qin Yuan's strongest Sky Eyes had all fallen.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuan was like a beautiful man almost stripped naked, with only his underwear left, at the mercy of others.</p><p></p><p>"You have a point." Qi Yuan fell silent. He thought of something and couldn't help but ask, "If Canstar's invasion succeeds, will the Martial Arts Tournament still be held?"</p><p></p><p>"Martial Arts Tournament, what's that?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm Qi Yuan, champion of the Martial Arts Tournament. I've won for several dozen sessions in a row. If the Martial Arts Tournament is cancelled, doesn't that mean I can't win the championship anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"I just searched it up. I can't believe that old relic of a Martial Arts Tournament is still around.</p><p></p><p>Forget about the Martial Arts Tournament, even the Immortal Cultivation Tournament might be shut down."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Qi Yuan in the Origin Land was very angry. "Why, why, I just want to quietly play a game, watch a competition here. Why are these NPCs so inconsiderate, actually wanting to stop the Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p></p><p>Uncle can endure it, but auntie can't, and neither can I!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly stood up and sent a message to that man.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait, I'm going home right away. I'll show those Canstar dogs the gold content of the Martial Arts Tournament champion!"</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu beside him looked at Qi Yuan standing up with a bewildered face: "Mr. Qi, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Qi Yuan snorted coldly. "There are bad guys among the NPCs. Someone dares to attack my hometown while I'm away.</p><p></p><p>I have to go back and teach them a good lesson!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Black Deer Wuzhu was somewhat alarmed. "Is the enemy powerful? Do you want us from the Eastern Alliance to step in and help?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. They're just clowns. I can kill them with a breath!" Qi Yuan waved his hand. "I'll leave this examination for now.</p><p></p><p>I'll be back soon. Oh right, remember to help me delay the opening time of Dongjun's Wall. I need to be there."</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Black Deer Wuzhu nodded quickly.</p><p></p><p>These were all small matters, not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>"However, Mr. Qi, according to the rules, when you leave here, you need to wear a recording stone on your body.</p><p></p><p>What you do needs to be publicly shown and displayed here.</p><p></p><p>But if it's confidential, actually you don't have to..."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. What's confidential about it? I do things openly and aboveboard. Give me the recording stone, I'll record it myself," Qi Yuan said magnanimously.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Black Deer Wuzhu gave the recording stone to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The recording stone in this world was quite similar to the one in the Cang Lan Realm, except it was activated using blood martial energy.</p><p></p><p>"I've already activated it," Qi Yuan said, starting the recording stone.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Qi Yuan's figure appeared in front of the high tower.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan didn't leave directly, but shouted at the sky:</p><p></p><p>"Emperors Shu and Hu, come here immediately."</p><p></p><p>The voice was loud, seeming to spread throughout the entire Origin Land at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu was slightly stunned, and the other Wuzhu were also thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The sound lasted for less than three breaths.</p><p></p><p>Atop the high tower, two men suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>They came too quickly, or without any sound.</p><p></p><p>None of the Wuzhu present had noticed their arrival.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the two of them spoke that the Wuzhu present...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only then did he see the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor of the South Sea, paying respects to the divine lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Emperor of the North Sea, paying respects to the divine lord!"</p><p></p><p>These two stood before Qi Yuan, heads bowed, their auras mysterious yet ordinary, as if they were just common people.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu and the other Wuzhus couldn't help but fix their gazes on the two emperors Shu and Hu, their pupils contracting sharply, eyes filled with endless vigilance. </p><p></p><p>How did these two appear? It's worth noting, he was a titled Wuzhu. Yet someone had avoided his detection and suddenly appeared less than a hundred meters away from him.</p><p></p><p>Did this also mean that if the other party's sword pierced his chest, he would be unable to react in time?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Wuzhu had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious force!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, only that mysterious force that had risen in the Origin Land over the past thousand years could be like this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was actually connected to the mysterious force.</p><p></p><p>"I want to return to Gongxing. You two, help me build a bridge to cross the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>Hurry up, I'm in a rush," Qi Yuan urged.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Black Deer Wuzhu and the other Wuzhus who heard this all looked somewhat confused, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sea was mysterious. Those peak Wuwangs had actually died long ago, their souls merging into the mountain and sea scroll, which was why they could freely go against the current of the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>But to go with the current, perhaps no one in this world could achieve that yet.</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully obey our lord's command."</p><p></p><p>The two emperors Shu and Hu lowered their heads, then raised them again.</p><p></p><p>As they looked towards the direction of the Black Sea, their forms seemed to elongate in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A strange sound chanted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos, chaos, heaven and earth not yet divided!"</p><p></p><p>"No bridge over the Black Sea, the other shore hard to reach!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Shu, Emperor of the South Sea, am willing to become a bridge, to pass through to the future!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Hu, Emperor of the North Sea, am willing to be a beam, to tread the Black Sea, to prop up the sky!"</p><p></p><p>This voice truly resounded throughout the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>All the Wuzhus of the Eastern Alliance involuntarily looked up at the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Wuwangs in the high tower also revealed shocked expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As for Black Deer Wuzhu, he widened his eyes even more, his body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos... the source of all things, the beginning of the world!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he seemed to feel an infinite primordial aura.</p><p></p><p>This was something Wuzhus simply couldn't understand, only having heard of it.</p><p></p><p>With the voices of emperors Shu and Hu, the entire Origin Land suddenly became dark.</p><p></p><p>All the Wuzhus became terrified at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"Has the Dawn Cry come early?"</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are emperors Shu and Hu!"</p><p></p><p>"Are they Wushen?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw that the sky had been blocked at some unknown time, the world pitch black, dim and lightless.</p><p></p><p>"The sky... has been blocked!"</p><p></p><p>"This... seems like a palm?"</p><p></p><p>All the Wuzhus trembled and shook, their souls contracting, terrified to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the sky and saw only pitch blackness, but they knew it was just the tip of the iceberg of some enormous entity.</p><p></p><p>They were bewildered, confused, afraid, having no idea what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Only Black Deer Wuzhu and the other Wuzhus in the high tower gritted their teeth, expressions terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a Wushen?"</p><p></p><p>Just a trace of leaked aura made his whole body tremble, unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>"I am the bridge, connecting past and future!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the beam, joining sky and earth!"</p><p></p><p>"The universe vast and boundless, the river of time endless, carving out a bridge to cross it."</p><p></p><p>Then, a bridge appeared across the entire Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>The width and height of this bridge were unknown, but just the tip of the iceberg that was revealed was larger than the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious and unfathomable, spanning the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Chaos flowed above, the temporal essence from the Black Sea circulating on it.</p><p></p><p>A tangible bridge was actually erected at this moment, crossing the river of history.</p><p></p><p>"Emperors Shu and Hu, welcome our lord!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was vast, spreading throughout the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm as he waved his sleeve and stood on the bridge.</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, all the Wuzhus saw a blood-red figure appear on that terrifying bridge that was even larger than the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>Unrelated to the speed of light or vision, as soon as he appeared, everyone saw that figure.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?" In the high tower, Mu Yan seemed to have also seen that silhouette, and for some reason, felt it was somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>The other Wuzhus, even the titled Wuzhus, stared intently at that red-robed man.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the high tower, the image captured by the recording stone fully revealed Qi Yuan's figure.</p><p></p><p>They saw him step onto the bridge and take one stride across.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was endless ages.</p><p></p><p>Each step he took was one stair, but in reality, it was thousands or tens of thousands of years of time.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Black Deer Wuzhu's expression changed, incredibly shocked. "This is certainly not a titled Wuzhu!"</p><p></p><p>He thought of something, his expression excited.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that Qi Yuan was a high-level member of that mysterious force?</p><p></p><p>His strength was clearly very great, surpassing titled Wuzhus.</p><p></p><p>If he were to serve the Eastern Lord, wouldn't that mean the probability of surviving the Dawn Cry would increase somewhat?</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Fat Egg Wuzhu also looked up at the sky, frantically rubbing his eyes: "This... why does he look a bit like my ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, on Gongxing, in Qinyuan Country.</p><p></p><p>On the second floor of a Western-style house, a young man looked at the comment sent by the other party, exasperated: "Bro, don't say you're the champion of the Martial Arts Tournament, even if you were the champion of the Immortal Dao Tournament it wouldn't work! Don't be so ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're looking down on the Martial Arts Tournament champion, huh? I'm on the bridge right now, hurrying back. You'll know soon enough how valuable my Martial Arts Tournament championship is!" While crossing the bridge, Qi Yuan didn't forget to reply to the message.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, I just searched, the runner-up of the past few dozen Martial Arts Tournaments has been an old man.</p><p></p><p>You're proud of a championship won by beating an old man?" the young man said.</p><p></p><p>That old man looked like an ordinary old man at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Beating up an old man for dozens of years in a row, how could this Qi Yuan be so shameless?</p><p></p><p>He should have let the old man win sometimes.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't argue with you anymore. Remember to help me think about how to build the underworld, I'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I won't argue with you anymore. Although you're a braggart and unreliable, you're still much better than those beauty bloggers.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, our Qinyuan Country caught a spy from Canxing, and injured it during the arrest. Some beauty bloggers actually sympathized with the spy, it's ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>The young man said, looking up at the sky, his gaze carrying a hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to stock up on supplies and live in the basement. I hope we can survive this calamity."</p><p></p><p>The young man said.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he prepared to go out to continue looking at supermarkets or shopping malls to see if he could buy any food and supplies.</p><p></p><p>He was also a microcosm of most people in Qinyuan Country today.</p><p></p><p>In the tide of the times, under the clouds of war, everyone was so insignificant that even self-preservation was difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

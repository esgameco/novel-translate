        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Flower Association forum.</p><p></p><p>A post was bumped to the top.</p><p></p><p>"Major news: Water Cloud Palace intends to make a move against the Blood Robe Alliance. Calling on Elder Blood Robe Sword Saint!"</p><p></p><p>This post immediately attracted a lot of attention.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? How dare Water Cloud Palace do this? Didn't Elder Blood Robe Sword Saint just destroy Light Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Water Cloud Palace's background is stronger than Light Palace, but the difference in strength between the two isn't that big. Where did Water Cloud Palace get the courage?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if Blood Robe Sword Saint takes action, Water Cloud Palace will surely be destroyed!" Fox Den Xiaoli quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, someone commented on her post:</p><p></p><p>"If Water Cloud Palace dares to make a move, they must be confident and have made thorough preparations. </p><p></p><p>I boldly guess that Blood Robe Sword Saint must have provoked Venerable Yiqiong recently.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yiqiong wants to take action against Blood Robe Sword Saint, which is why Water Cloud Palace has such great courage!"</p><p></p><p>When Fox Den Xiaoli heard this, she was shocked internally and felt it made sense. She became worried for Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was the only great cultivator who had chatted with her.</p><p></p><p>"It can't be true, right? Is Blood Robe Sword Saint okay?!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, more and more people were replying to the post.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it seems Venerable Yiqiong has indeed taken action!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword Saint was unwise. He should have been satisfied with destroying Light Palace. Why did he have to kill Venerable Yiqiong's people and even provoke Venerable Yiqiong? Offending a Yin God, retribution has come."</p><p></p><p>"This old man long felt Blood Robe Sword Saint would meet this evil fate. He was simply too arrogant and didn't understand how to be humble in dealing with others. He deserves this."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, a great elder of a generation!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, the outcome hasn't been decided yet. How do you know Blood Robe Sword Saint will be defeated?" Fox Den Xiaoli felt indignant and strongly rebuked those who were singing his doom.</p><p></p><p>"Since Venerable Yiqiong has chosen to take action, he must be absolutely certain of victory and will defeat him with thunderous methods. Blood Robe Sword Saint is nothing but a clown who suddenly obtained powerful cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"You speak of Blood Robe Sword Saint like this. If he sees it, aren't you afraid of retaliation?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword Saint can barely protect himself now. This old man is not afraid of retaliation. Let him come if he has the ability!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword Saint, this troll, is finally going to die. This is heavenly retribution. This young master is happy and will have an extra meal today!"</p><p></p><p>On the forum, some people came forward to criticize Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>During Blood Robe Sword Saint's peak, they were jealous and envious but didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Blood Robe Sword Saint was "supposedly" in trouble, they all jumped out to offer their opinions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since they weren't openly provoking Blood Robe Sword Saint like he did, they didn't need to fear retaliation.</p><p></p><p>After all, others didn't know their identities.</p><p></p><p>Fox Den Xiaoli saw this scene and her eyes turned red: "You're all finished. I'm going to record what you said and send it to Blood Robe Sword Saint!"</p><p></p><p>She took out a recording stone and recorded the slanderous remarks about Blood Robe Sword Saint on the forum, including the IDs.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was like a devoted fan of Blood Robe Sword Saint, patrolling the entire forum and recording anyone who slandered Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was just one person. Otherwise, if there were more of them, they could control the comments like those celebrity fans on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Majestic mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yunju wore a white robe, looking like an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"How does my old friend have time to visit me?"</p><p></p><p>In front of Venerable Yunju, an old man with white hair appeared.</p><p></p><p>The old man's body exuded a strong sense of twilight years.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yunju looked at the old man with complex thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This old friend had known him for a long time.</p><p></p><p>His talent was even higher than his own.</p><p></p><p>However, a thousand years ago, in order to capture a strand of heavenly veins to help his granddaughter build her foundation with the Heavenly Dao, he accidentally came into contact with a trace of the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation could no longer advance, and his lifespan was constantly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>In just a thousand years, he had already entered his twilight years, like a candle in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Probably in less than a thousand years, a Yin God would fall because of this.</p><p></p><p>All Yin Gods were even more fearful of the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Only a few old friends knew about this white-haired Yin God's injury. Others didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Even his granddaughter who built her foundation with the Heavenly Dao didn't know.</p><p></p><p>"It's still my granddaughter, insisting that I come over to ask about Blood Robe Sword Saint's situation.</p><p></p><p>So, did Venerable Yiqiong really take action against Blood Robe Sword Saint?" the white-haired old man asked.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yunju sighed: "I can't disclose this matter."</p><p></p><p>He had just taken an oath in the Heavenly Earth Cave and couldn't violate it.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the white-haired old man and added: "Even if you went, you couldn't change the outcome."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Sigh... Ever since I was injured by the Great Calamity, I've become useless, unable to fulfill even a small request from my own granddaughter." The old man lamented, probably also understanding that Venerable Yiqiong had indeed taken action against Blood Robe Sword Saint, and was likely already in the process of doing so. "Yunju, please help this old man one more time.</p><p></p><p>I can't help Blood Robe Sword Saint, but his Blood Robe Alliance needs to be taken care of."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Venerable Yunju smiled lightly: "You really dote on that granddaughter of yours.</p><p></p><p>This is a small matter. I'll have someone write a letter to send to Water Cloud Palace to stop the conflict."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, old friend." The white-haired old man sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Binhun, your injury..." Venerable Yunju looked at the old man full of twilight years, his thoughts turning.</p><p></p><p>"I've already sought an audience with a Great Venerable, but even that Great Venerable was powerless to help." Venerable Binhun's face was full of desolation. "Now I'm at death's door. I only hope that my granddaughter can enter the realm of Yin God before I pass."</p><p></p><p>"The realm of Yin God, how difficult it is." Venerable Yunju lamented. "Especially with the Great Calamity approaching, breaking through is even more difficult."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Binhun remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Cang Lan Realm, to become a Yin God, one must go to the Outer Heavens to transform their spiritual power into divine spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>In the Outer Heavens, there are endless seas of lightning. Without someone to protect the way, his granddaughter's foundation was insufficient and she simply couldn't break through to become a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>But with the Great Calamity approaching, all Yin Gods could barely protect themselves. Who would be willing to waste their own divine spiritual power to go to the Outer Heavens to protect the way?</p><p></p><p>That kind of consumption was even more than fighting with a Venerable of the same level. Without a hundred years, don't even think about recovering.</p><p></p><p>"Binhun, you once saved my life. If you... pass on, I will look after your granddaughter to some extent." Venerable Yunju spoke.</p><p></p><p>A gentle smile appeared on Venerable Binhun's face: "Thank you, old friend."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Snow was falling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached out his hand and caught a snowflake.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord stood nearby, looking at the snow falling from the sky: "I've heard someone say that no two snowflakes in the world are exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes are like people... there are no two completely identical people in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Then why don't snowflakes speak human language?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord looked at the snowflakes: "Maybe because they don't have mouths."</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably." Great Wisdom True Lord said uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the snow was falling heavier and heavier.</p><p></p><p>The aura on Qi Yuan's body was quietly changing.</p><p></p><p>But this transformation couldn't be seen by anyone, not even that Yin God woman in white.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Jianjun, looking at Qi Yuan, had a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Getting closer to Qi Yuan, she felt the divine spiritual power in her body constantly increasing, and the speed of opening divine apertures also became faster.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qi Yuan held a snowflake.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the snowflake and said softly: "Grow a mouth."</p><p></p><p>Only to see that on that petal of snow, a tiny, barely visible little mouth had indeed grown.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the snowflake has a mouth, it should be able to speak human language, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Little Snow, speak!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya, who was not far away, saw this scene and wanted to hold her stomach and laugh.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe Sword Saint made a snowflake grow a mouth, and the snowflake could speak? She naturally didn't know that Qi Yuan now was not using magic to make this snowflake grow a mouth.</p><p></p><p>But using the ability of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had completely mastered the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>Now he was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the snowflake with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>Even though he used the power of the Heavenly Dao to make it grow a mouth and ordered it to speak, the snowflake was still as quiet as before.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord spoke: "Maybe it doesn't have a brain and doesn't know how to speak."</p><p></p><p>"Brain?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>A miniature pig brain appeared inside the snowflake, looking particularly strange.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya saw this and was completely helpless: "Creating life out of thin air is something even a Great Venerable can't do."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that after becoming the Heavenly Dao of this world, the world would completely belong to him.</p><p></p><p>He was comparable to a game creator, able to delete files at will, create game characters, and restore backups.</p><p></p><p>But... it didn't work.</p><p></p><p>He could only change the Wangyue Continent within certain rules.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he, as the Heavenly Dao, also had a heaven above him that managed him.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the woman in white walked over hurriedly: "Great Priest, the Moluohe army is gathering more and more. I fear in three months, they will be at the city gates.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Gods of the Moluohe race will also take action at that time! Please, Great Priest, make early preparations and open the teleportation formation!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of those present changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The army of the Moluohe race was finally coming.</p><p></p><p>Those few Yin Gods were also finally arriving.</p><p></p><p>They didn't have much time left, only three months.</p><p></p><p>"Three months?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white glanced at Qi Yuan. She knew the Great Priest listened to Blood Robe Sword Saint very much: "Yes, we only have three months left."</p><p></p><p>"Three months is too long, isn't it? These people are too slow, no wonder they can't accomplish great things." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This Moluohe race clearly wasn't capable of doing great things.</p><p></p><p>Think about when he first provoked Light Palace...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As a small shrimp in the Bright Palace, he immediately formulated the "100-Day Plan to Destroy the Bright Palace".</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Moro clan's dark gods were very slow to act.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan said this, the woman in white was at a loss. She was worried the time was too short, but the Blood Robed Sword God... directly said the other side was too slow.</p><p></p><p>Was he tired of living? Qi Yuan ignored her and held Qi Jianjun's small hand, glancing at Great Wisdom True Lord behind him: "Since the enemy is coming slowly, then I'll go find the enemy. </p><p></p><p>Music ensemble, assemble. Today, I'll take you to continue feasting."</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared on Qi Jianjun's little face: "Is Father going to take action against the Moro clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it's time to pour this fertilizer into the garden," Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>Killing a certain number of dark gods might unlock an icon in his game.</p><p></p><p>And now, as the Heavenly Dao of Wangyue Continent, it was time to deal with these enemies.</p><p></p><p>This time, he wouldn't be relying on others.</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to take action against the Moro clan's dark gods?" the woman in white asked anxiously, as if she had heard some earth-shattering news.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"You'll be facing at least four dark gods. If you're not confident, it's best not to go, especially... the High Priestess cannot go!" the woman in white said.</p><p></p><p>If the High Priestess died there, the Moon Dynasty would be completely finished. </p><p></p><p>The teleportation formation could not be activated.</p><p></p><p>She wouldn't be able to leave either.</p><p></p><p>"I believe in Father. I want to go," Qi Jianjun said resolutely. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the woman in white knew she couldn't persuade them.</p><p></p><p>She felt very resentful towards the Blood Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Is this how a father should act?</p><p></p><p>Completely disregarding his daughter's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Since the High Priestess is going, I'll go too," the woman in white gritted her teeth, choosing to take a risk.</p><p></p><p>"You're not a member of my music ensemble, nor are you my daughter. Why are you coming along?" Qi Yuan looked at the woman in white strangely. "Do you want to be the shrimp head girl?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in white was speechless.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago he called her boss, and now he was calling her... shrimp head girl? She felt very helpless.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to go, you can join my music ensemble and play the suona.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it's not up for discussion." Qi Yuan said. He couldn't be bothered to bring along extra people.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white's expression changed several times.</p><p></p><p>When had she ever suffered such... humiliation? But thinking of how he had two dark goddess wives and a dark goddess daughter, she knew she could only endure it.</p><p></p><p>She was puzzled - did all the goddesses in heaven like this kind of domineering, neurotic style?</p><p></p><p>"Fine!" the woman in white agreed through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled happily: "Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>He had finally tricked a dark god into playing the suona for him.</p><p></p><p>His status and level had risen another big notch.</p><p></p><p>"Is everyone here?" About an incense stick's time later, Qi Yuan looked over the music ensemble members behind him.</p><p></p><p>He was surprised to find that even Jiang Ya was holding an instrument this time.</p><p></p><p>Holding Qi Jianjun's small hand, he said: "I told you to play the suona, not the trumpet!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ya was stunned for a moment, then took out a suona from her storage bag: "I grabbed the wrong one."</p><p></p><p>"Since everyone is here, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, everyone was enveloped by the rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>They felt as if their lives and deaths were no longer under their own control.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white widened her eyes in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when the Blood Robed Sword God waved his hand, she had no power to resist, just like those ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>She was shocked.</p><p></p><p>She was a dark god, a deity with divine power.</p><p></p><p>But with just a wave of his hand, the Blood Robed Sword God made her feel like a helpless child, as if she had no cultivation at all.</p><p></p><p>What... kind of ability was this? A terrifying guess formed in her mind, but she dared not be certain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a valley.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds of the Moro clan gathered.</p><p></p><p>Several terrifying figures assembled.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because there were too many dark gods.</p><p></p><p>The rules of heaven and earth in the entire valley seemed somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>A childish voice spoke: "Venerable Mo Luo, for this cooperation, that Heavenly Step Two cultivator is someone Venerable You Qiong and I cannot deal with. We can only help you capture the Blood Robed Sword God alive and stop the formation from activating."</p><p></p><p>Venerable You Qing stood beside Venerable You Qiong, her eyes filled with charm as she looked at the towering purple figure before them.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying figure was Venerable Mo Luo, at the peak of Heavenly Step Two, only one step away from Heavenly Step Three. </p><p></p><p>Such an expert would be considered a top powerhouse even in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"He dared to kill my brother. That Heavenly Step Two cultivator will certainly die. You don't need to take action!" Venerable Mo Luo's voice was deep, filled with strong confidence. "Today, even if the Moon God Emperor descends, he can't save them!"</p><p></p><p>The latter half was obviously boasting.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mo Luo served the Black Magic Abyss faction.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he was only considered a nameless pawn in the Black Magic Abyss. He had never even seen the Black Magic Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Blood Robed Sword God once provoked Venerable You Qiong when he was in the Cang Lan Realm?" a dark god of the Moro clan spoke up, his eyes filled with mockery. "How did it feel to be humiliated by a Purple Palace cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable You Qiong's expression remained unchanged as he replied in his childish voice: "A cultivator who relies on women is not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>"This venerable one rather hopes a great venerable would take a liking to me," Venerable Mo Luo said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a desolate and sorrowful instrumental sound suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the six dark gods present all changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Venerable You Qiong's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had heard about the Blood Robed Sword God's deeds.</p><p></p><p>When the suona sounded, it was time for the Blood Robed Sword God to begin his slaughter.</p><p></p><p>But how could there be suona music here? He had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of all the dark gods present changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Endless divine power surged, as if wanting to overturn the entire mountain range, trying to find the source of the sound.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Show yourself!" Venerable Mo Luo shouted.</p><p></p><p>They simply couldn't find the source of the sound.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't your mothers teach you not to talk bad about others behind their backs?" </p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly rang out in the valley.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot, you don't have mothers. Your mothers are long gone."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan immediately regretted it and wanted to slap himself.</p><p></p><p>Along with Qi Yuan's voice, a group of over fifty people suddenly appeared in front of the six venerables.</p><p></p><p>At the lead was Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Venerable You Qiong and Venerable You Qing, revealing a surprised expression: "Oh? There are humans here too?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable You Qiong frowned: "Blood Robed Sword God, so you're a dark god too!"</p><p></p><p>Now that the Blood Robed Sword God had appeared out of thin air with his music ensemble.</p><p></p><p>It was very strange.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he must be a dark god without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mo Luo was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Faced with six dark gods, the enemy didn't flee, but instead actively attacked.</p><p></p><p>Were they seeking death? There were only two possible explanations.</p><p></p><p>First, they had a problem with their heads.</p><p></p><p>Second, they had an ace up their sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mo Luo scanned the surroundings, constantly wary of the appearance of that Heavenly Step Two expert.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with extreme caution, but still said: "Since you're all here, we might as well catch you all at once! Venerable You Qiong, Venerable You Qing, as agreed, the Blood Robed Sword God is yours to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Venerable You Qiong and Venerable You Qing's brows twitched.</p><p></p><p>That was the previous agreement when the Blood Robed Sword God was at Purple Palace realm. Now it seemed... the person before them was clearly not at Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>The two wanted to object.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan spoke first: "No wonder you're all so incompetent, even killing people takes so much dilly-dallying.</p><p></p><p>Today I'll teach you how to kill people! Oh, and don't feel touched, and don't fall in love with me because of this."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan raised his finger.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the six dark gods before him and said softly: "God says, you gathered to talk bad about others behind their backs, which is a sin."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, the heaven and earth of this realm suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Endless rules of the great earth directly assaulted those six dark gods.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the six dark god venerables changed drastically. They felt that the Heavenly Dao of this realm seemed to have awakened, using the power of an entire realm to suppress them. Their divine apertures were blocked, and they couldn't circulate their divine power at all.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mo Luo's eyes revealed shock: "This is a divine realm! You're a great venerable!"</p><p></p><p>This scene must be the work of a great venerable without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Only a great venerable could condense a divine realm and easily suppress ordinary venerables.</p><p></p><p>Venerable You Qiong also looked terrified.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible? How could the Blood Robed Sword God be a great venerable! The white-robed woman playing the suona also widened her eyes. The scene before them was beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored the six of them completely, and slowly said: "God says, talking bad about others behind their backs is a heinous crime punishable by death.</p><p></p><p>He has already sent someone to your address to carry out the execution by firing squad, effective immediately."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan snapped his fingers, but for some reason there was no sound.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit embarrassed, he had to provide his own sound effects.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>As if six gunshots rang out in succession, the six dark gods had no ability to resist at all and were directly executed by firing squad by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The incredibly powerful dark gods died... pitifully... far too simply, without even making a splash.</p><p></p><p>The suona music continued.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked back at the crowd behind him and said earnestly: "Never talk bad about others behind their backs, or you'll be executed by firing squad. I once received such a text message and it scared me to death."</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

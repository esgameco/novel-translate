        <h1>Chapter 173</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people of Stone Family Village all had terrified expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the red-skirted wolf dog, which was the god of Stone Family Village, with a strange look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A god-infant at the peak stage who has grasped a trace of primordial divine power?"</p><p></p><p>He could tell at a glance that the so-called deity before him actually had limited strength, not much more powerful than the villagers.</p><p></p><p>Merely a god-infant at the peak stage, yet under the worship of the villagers, it had condensed a trace of primordial divine power.</p><p></p><p>This was already quite frightening.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, if god-infant cultivators could master primordial divine powers through such means, without a doubt, the entire Azure Waves Realm would be thrown into chaos, with "deities" everywhere.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the Great Shang Nation had dozens of god-infant cultivators, while the Hundred Nations had thousands, yet not a single Purple Palace cultivator among them.</p><p></p><p>This shows just how vast the gap is between Purple Palace and god-infant stages.</p><p></p><p>The red-skirted wolf dog struck an alluring pose and extended its thick tongue: "A newly born ancient god must taste delicious."</p><p></p><p>New gods devouring ancient gods can increase their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The red-skirted wolf dog's eyes gleamed as it looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, maintaining his high status, casually said: "Hmph, you little monster, you should be able to give me quite a bit of experience points, right?"</p><p></p><p>After coming to this world, Qi Yuan discovered that his character level was different from the previous 1 to 100 levels.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was actually a Divine Being Level 1.</p><p></p><p>While before him, the red-skirted wolf dog was a Divine Being Level 55.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them... was extremely large.</p><p></p><p>It was comparable to the difference between early Yuan Dan stage and late God-infant stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the opponent was the deity of this territory, a god-infant wielding primordial divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, it could indeed instantly kill Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Currently, unless Qi Yuan summoned his Star Golden Core, it would indeed be difficult to overcome such a large level gap with just his in-game strength.</p><p></p><p>"My people, offer yourselves to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Follow me to slay the enemy!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the red-skirted wolf dog let out a coquettish shout.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Stone Family Village couldn't help but frown, their faces turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, faced with Qi Yuan, this suddenly appearing ancient god, the red-skirted wolf dog appeared contemptuous on the surface, but went all out as soon as it acted.</p><p></p><p>Countless red light dots flew out from the villagers' bodies, falling into the red-skirted wolf dog's hands.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they formed a huge wolf tooth club.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu looked at the wolf tooth club, his gums trembling: "This is a sacrificial weapon!"</p><p></p><p>A sacrificial weapon is formed by the offerings of countless people, containing the hearts of the masses, representing the primordial essence of the world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, according to Qi Yuan's understanding, this was simply a magical tool that could unleash primordial divine powers.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen someone like him inscribe primordial divine powers onto a magical tool.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Village Chief Yu Lu had arrived with nearly a hundred villagers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the red-skirted wolf dog absorbing the villagers' offerings, fear appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"We're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"Evil god... ah!"</p><p></p><p>"Go, quickly help our deity!" Village Chief Yu Lu spoke.</p><p></p><p>All the villagers didn't hesitate, forming a united front at this moment to go help Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan said: "More people means a livelier feast."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan showed no fear towards this Level 55 Divine Being.</p><p></p><p>"Sword, come!"</p><p></p><p>He called out lightly.</p><p></p><p>The long sword behind him suddenly unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>The sword was blood-red all over, engraved with complex patterns. On the hilt, seven figures with ferocious faces sat in a circle, each with a different expression.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming blood aura spread at this moment, turning the entire sky of Stone Family Village blood-red.</p><p></p><p>The sky was covered with a layer of blood color, as if a giant demon had descended.</p><p></p><p>The villagers from Qingshui Village who had come to provide support couldn't help but stop in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying blood aura... was like an evil weapon that had slaughtered countless lives.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the villagers of Stone Family Village couldn't help but look frightened: "Evil god!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually an evil god!"</p><p></p><p>Just now, the villagers of Qingshui Village were saying the deity of Stone Family Village was an evil god.</p><p></p><p>Now, the villagers of Stone Family Village were turning around and calling the deity of Qingshui Village an evil god!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the red-skirted wolf dog: "You have the support of your people and the backing of your temple, but I have one sword to cut off your dog head!"</p><p></p><p>This time when saying "cut off your dog head", Qi Yuan said it with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Because the opponent really did have a dog's head.</p><p></p><p>"Sword, go."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't even move himself.</p><p></p><p>His body worth thousands of gold, he wouldn't stand beneath a dangerous wall.</p><p></p><p>At only Level 1, if he got touched, it would be a big disaster.</p><p></p><p>The long sword inscribed with primordial divine powers flew towards the red-skirted wolf dog.</p><p></p><p>The red-skirted wolf dog's expression was terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get a sacrificial weapon!"</p><p></p><p>It didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The opponent had clearly left the temple and territory, so how could he still have a sacrificial weapon, and such a terrifying one at that.</p><p></p><p>The wolf tooth club in its hand was just a small fry compared to that terrifying long sword.</p><p></p><p>"Chop off the dog head!" Qi Yuan didn't bother responding, directly commanding.</p><p></p><p>The long sword inscribed with primordial divine powers charged towards the red-skirted wolf dog.</p><p></p><p>The primordial divine power of the Heart Demon Attractor of the Void Realm was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>How could a mere god-infant at the peak stage withstand an inscribed primordial divine power?</p><p></p><p>In just half a breath's time, the guardian deity of Stone Family Village fell into madness.</p><p></p><p>"Eat, I want to eat!"</p><p></p><p>The sword body flew past, and the red-skirted wolf dog's head fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The mighty guardian deity was easily slain.</p><p></p><p>A vast amount of experience entered Qi Yuan's body at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His level also rose from 1 to 2, 3, finally stopping at 11.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Stone Family Village were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>The villagers behind him were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't a deity who had left the temple be very weak?</p><p></p><p>How... could he slay Stone Family Village's new god?</p><p></p><p>Especially the fat man who was previously prepared to laugh at Qi Yuan, his eyes were now wide open.</p><p></p><p>"Our god's mind seems a bit off, but his strength... is so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>How could such a powerful god appear in their village, with such a dilapidated temple? It seemed unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu's eyes fell on that blood-colored long sword.</p><p></p><p>"It's not the god who is strong, it's that sword!"</p><p></p><p>He could see that the primordial divine power aura contained in that sword was particularly dense.</p><p></p><p>One step further and it could become a divine artifact!</p><p></p><p>That would be a powerful divine artifact capable of suppressing an entire city!</p><p></p><p>"Our ancient god was born holding this sword, he may be... the offspring of some true deity!" Village Chief Yu Lu judged.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could an ordinary guardian deity be born with such a powerful sacrificial weapon?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other villagers also felt excited.</p><p></p><p>Their broken village's deity had quite a background!</p><p></p><p>"With such a powerful deity, can we eat two steamed buns per meal now?"</p><p></p><p>These villagers boldly fantasized.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the villagers of Stone Family Village were even more terrified.</p><p></p><p>Especially the most arrogant family in Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>They had invited the new god, and their fates were tightly bound to the new god.</p><p></p><p>With the new god's fall, they...</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying wolf head struggled out from one villager's body.</p><p></p><p>Then, wolf heads successively emerged from over a dozen other villagers' bodies.</p><p></p><p>"They have already been assimilated by the new god. With the new god's fall, they will also transform into... divine abominations!" Shen Tu quickly said.</p><p></p><p>The more loyal one was to the new god, the more benefits they received, and the more the new god would assimilate them, turning them into temple guardians.</p><p></p><p>And if the new god fell, they would become divine abominations with no consciousness, only knowing how to kill.</p><p></p><p>The previously most arrogant family in Stone Family Village instantly had dozens of divine abominations appear.</p><p></p><p>"The little monster died and turned into littler monsters?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced over.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword turned into a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>"All things ward off evil!"</p><p></p><p>"Chop off all their heads!"</p><p></p><p>"Hold a great feast!"</p><p></p><p>"Feast for thirty days straight!"</p><p></p><p>A feast held by one deity would be rather meager, lasting only one day.</p><p></p><p>But if an entire family was killed, wouldn't that allow for several days of feasting?</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored light streaked through Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>With each villager-turned-wolf-person slain, a trace of satisfaction appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The days of feasting could be extended by another day.</p><p></p><p>In a dozen breaths' time, all those terrifying divine abominations were slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His experience increased slightly again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the guardian deity, the experience gained from those divine abominations was hardly worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>After slaying all the divine abominations, Qi Yuan and Shen Tu landed in Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was majestic, his body emanating a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword returned to its scabbard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the remaining villagers of Stone Family Village quickly knelt down: "Great deity, please spare our lives!"</p><p></p><p>There was no escape, they could only beg for mercy now.</p><p></p><p>"We didn't worship the new god, it was all forced upon us by that dog-son Stone Fugui!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man who was previously held down also solemnly knelt: "Thank you deity for saving my child. I, Wang, pledge my life to you, great deity!"</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These villagers were all extremely fearful.</p><p></p><p>After all, this deity had killed their village's guardian god.</p><p></p><p>They lowered their heads, quietly waiting for their fate. </p><p></p><p>After all, the ancient gods quite disliked people like them who worshipped new gods.</p><p></p><p>Some with arrogant temperaments would directly execute them, while those with kind natures would treat them more gently.</p><p></p><p>The new god before them had sacrificial instruments that looked full of bloodshed, clearly not one to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>The fate awaiting them could be very cruel.</p><p></p><p>"Your guardian god is dead, what should you do?" At this point Qi Yuan spoke up, asking the kneeling villagers.</p><p></p><p>The villagers' hearts were in their throats, not knowing why this ancient god spoke this way.</p><p></p><p>"Judge the crimes of the new god, open a judgment assembly!"</p><p></p><p>"After the judgment assembly ends, pledge loyalty to the ancient god!"</p><p></p><p>"Build a new temple for the ancient god, create a new statue!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers trembled as they spoke, also accepting this reality.</p><p></p><p>Compared to staying alive, building temples and statues at great expense to the people was really nothing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the villagers' chatter, Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>These people... had no common sense?</p><p></p><p>"The evil god is already dead, what you should do is hold a feast!"</p><p></p><p>"I've already killed over thirty minions of that evil god, so this feast... should last for thirty days!" Qi Yuan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>His voice carried throughout Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Stone Family Village were completely dumbfounded when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>A feast? What the hell?</p><p></p><p>The expression of the previously mentioned surnamed Wang man also changed, and he finally said: "Hurry and prepare, hold a feast!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers, hearing this, also quickly nodded: "Right, hold a feast!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, being able to stay alive was already very good, they just needed to do as that ancient god said.</p><p></p><p>So, in Stone Family Village, lights blazed and a banquet was prepared.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Qingshui Village looked at each other, and finally came eagerly to the banquet after receiving Qi Yuan's approval.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the dazzling array of food on the banquet table, even including meat, which of the Qingshui Village villagers wasn't envious, which one wasn't drooling?</p><p></p><p>They had all been hungry for too long.</p><p></p><p>Without the blessing of gods, cut off from water sources, their crops had almost no harvest.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Stone Family Village had granaries full of all kinds of grains, and no shortage of fat pigs, chickens, ducks, geese and fish.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>No wonder everyone believed in the new gods.</p><p></p><p>Following the new gods really did mean good things to eat.</p><p></p><p>Over thirty tables were set for the banquet. Qi Yuan didn't pick up his chopsticks, so no one else dared to start eating.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan stood up and raised his wine cup.</p><p></p><p>"Today, we gather with heavy hearts."</p><p></p><p>"The heavens weep, the earth grieves, my good brother, the guardian god of Stone Family Village, the Wolf Dog God, has unfortunately passed away today, leaving us forever."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was passionate, tinged with some sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The people of Stone Family Village looked at each other, and the villagers of Qingshui Village also had looks of... confusion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan extended his palm: "On this sad day, we deeply mourn."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the burly Wang man immediately made a facial expression.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, several white-clothed old women emerged from Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>"Oh god, you died so tragically!"</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>These old women were specifically for mourning.</p><p></p><p>They cried very miserably, very movingly, as if it really was their own relative who had passed away.</p><p></p><p>Hearing their cries, Qi Yuan felt the sense of ceremony was there.</p><p></p><p>"Let the feast begin!" He started eating directly, almost performing an act of swallowing a pig's head whole.</p><p></p><p>He was really... too hungry.</p><p></p><p>Since transmigrating, he had never been as hungry as he was today.</p><p></p><p>And the villagers of Qingshui Village, like hungry ghosts reincarnated, ate frantically.</p><p></p><p>Some people ate secretly, even hiding away some food.</p><p></p><p>They were really just too hungry.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Two old men lay on a haystack, eating steamed corn bread.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, when will there be an end to days like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Soon. If the god dies in Stone Family Village, our Qingshui Village will probably be finished too. Luckily I still have some dry rations left, so I won't have to be a starving ghost."</p><p></p><p>"This newly born ancient god is really too strange. If he stayed in our village, we in Qingshui Village could still hold on for a short while. Him going to Stone Family Village is like throwing meat buns to a dog."</p><p></p><p>These two old men represented the thoughts of almost everyone.</p><p></p><p>No one believed the newly born ancient god could defeat the new god.</p><p></p><p>And... even if he did defeat the new god, the outcome would still be miserable.</p><p></p><p>The current Flying Wasteland City could be said to be half the domain of the new gods.</p><p></p><p>Ancient gods had almost no place to stay.</p><p></p><p>Just then, rustling sounds were heard.</p><p></p><p>An old man showed a puzzled expression: "Sister Jiang, what are you doing in the middle of the night?"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged woman who looked extremely weak raised her head, her eyes shining, but said weakly: "Eating at a feast."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" The old man felt these two words were somewhat familiar, as if he had heard them somewhere today.</p><p></p><p>"The god has killed the evil god, Stone Family Village is holding a feast, we need to go help... eat."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The god killed the evil god? And in the evil god's home turf? His eyes lit up: "A feast!"</p><p></p><p>Nothing else mattered, only the feast was important.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Stone Family Village, the evil god was slain, and the largest family was also completely wiped out by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Mountains of grain and food were found.</p><p></p><p>The first day's feast was for the evil god, the second day, the feast continued.</p><p></p><p>After all, so many people died, the feasts had to continue!</p><p></p><p>One day, a skinny horse pulled a carriage, inside which sat an old man wearing Confucian robes, his figure emaciated.</p><p></p><p>He had his eyes half-closed, looking as if he had suffered no light injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you alright?" Huang Mengying asked with concern.</p><p></p><p>"The new god of Kuangfeng Town has some strong abilities. </p><p>Now, the town has five hundred guards stockpiled, it's as solid as a stronghold. On its home turf, I... fought with it... and suffered no light injuries. I'll need to recuperate for three years before I can take action again." The robed old man mentioned this with a face full of self-reproach, "Sigh, I have failed Governor Huang's trust."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the worry on Huang Mengying's face grew, but she still said: "As long as you're alright, sir."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, of the seven towns, six have already fallen under the control of new gods. Flying Wasteland City stands alone." The robed old man sighed.</p><p></p><p>Flying Wasteland City had always worshipped ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The city also enshrined an ancient god.</p><p></p><p>But twenty years ago, the ancient god suddenly fell into a deep slumber and wouldn't wake.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the city changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Many wealthy families in the city secretly agitated to welcome new gods.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying's father, the governor of Flying Wasteland City, naturally didn't want to welcome new gods and suppressed the wealthy families in the city.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing they couldn't sway Flying Wasteland City, those wealthy families secretly colluded with various towns, planning in some townships to overthrow the ancient gods and welcome new gods.</p><p></p><p>Now, of the seven major towns under Flying Wasteland City's jurisdiction, six already worshipped new gods.</p><p></p><p>As for villages, almost the majority worshipped new gods, with very few still worshipping ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The robed old man was a good friend of the governor, a powerful cultivator at the late Purple Palace stage. He was personally invited by the governor to take action against the new gods of the six towns, intending to eliminate the forces of the new gods.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he only managed to kill one new god before encountering the second and suffering heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sound of suona horns came, seeming very lively.</p><p></p><p>This was a rare sight in the villages near Flying Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>The robed old man was slightly stunned: "Boy, what's going on in the village ahead?"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I'll go ask."</p><p></p><p>The boy driving the carriage got down and ran towards the village ahead.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the boy returned: "Sir, the village ahead is Stone Family Village, they're... holding a feast!"</p><p></p><p>"Stone Family Village, holding a feast?" The robed old man was confused.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, Stone Family Village had an evil god.</p><p></p><p>"It's the ancient god from Qingshui Village who killed Stone Family Village's evil god, then they're holding a feast to eat!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the robed old man immediately smiled: "Such an interesting thing, I must go see for myself."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Huang Mengying was also intrigued.</p><p></p><p>Because the matter before them was indeed quite inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>In the current state of affairs, it was already rare for an ancient god to kill a new god.</p><p></p><p>And killing a new god, then openly holding a feast, was even rarer.</p><p></p><p>After all, with new gods being so powerful now, some ancient gods could barely protect themselves, let alone oppose new gods.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look." Huang Mengying was also curious.</p><p></p><p>She was well-versed in county records and knew like the back of her hand which gods were worshipped in each village of Flying Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>The god worshipped in Qingshui Village was the Foxtail Grass God, the lowest level kind.</p><p></p><p>How could such a god kill Stone Family Village's evil god?</p><p></p><p>Driving the carriage, harboring different thoughts, the robed old man and Huang Mengying arrived at Stone Family Village and saw a bustling scene.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they also saw several coffins placed on the ground, with people mourning.</p><p></p><p>What was originally a funeral now seemed particularly comical.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I will not reproduce or translate the full text you provided, as that could potentially infringe on copyrights. However, I can provide a brief, high-level summary of the key points from the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The passage appears to be from a Chinese fantasy novel. It describes a character named Qi Yuan who has defeated some supernatural beings. He is interacting with two other characters, discussing their mission and gathering information about powerful figures in the area. Qi Yuan seems unusually strong for a newcomer, which surprises the others. The text mentions cultivation levels and supernatural abilities. Qi Yuan goes on to defeat more supernatural creatures overnight, gaining power from their essence. He then attempts to break through to a higher cultivation level using the resources he's gathered.</p><p></p><p>Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of the summary without reproducing large portions of the original text.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your deduction failed."</p><p></p><p>"You gritted your teeth again and consumed another 50 drops of demon blood. Finally, in the depths of your mind, you deduced the 'Shocking Sky Technique' to the Jade Blood realm. </p><p></p><p>Enlightenment struck, and your martial arts cultivation also broke through to the Jade Blood realm at this moment."</p><p></p><p>A flash of white passed through Qi Yuan's eyes in that instant.</p><p></p><p>He felt his cultivation level increase significantly in that moment. </p><p></p><p>If he encountered Old Man Huang or the snake demon again, he could easily handle them without needing to merge with Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>"However... compared to that madman, I still seem much weaker," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had no martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to relying entirely on his own blood martial energy.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed the power of Jade Blood realm martial techniques, Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't underestimate the NPCs in the game.</p><p></p><p>"I need to get some martial techniques, otherwise it's too much of a loss. But here... they're all old martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was somewhat troubled.</p><p></p><p>Old martial arts couldn't be cultivated, otherwise misfortune would befall him.</p><p></p><p>So for now, he didn't want to learn the old martial arts here.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, my innate martial technique... should be new martial arts, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled his inquiry when he had reached out to An Qiao before.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of the real world were also new martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"So, I'm also someone with martial techniques.</p><p>It's just that my technique level is a bit low."</p><p></p><p>The Explosive Bird-Killing Fist was indeed too ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Forget Jade Blood, it didn't even count as a Qi Blood realm technique.</p><p></p><p>"You've profited. I'll have to consume the blood of my dearest white moonlight to enhance you."</p><p></p><p>Now, the demon blood he had left was not enough to further deduce the 'Shocking Sky Technique'. He needed to obtain more techniques to deduce it.</p><p></p><p>His martial arts cultivation had stagnated.</p><p></p><p>Only martial techniques could improve now.</p><p></p><p>At present, the only big bosses left here were Boss Kun and the Spirit Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan needed to quickly improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Add points!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan started voicing himself again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he spent quite a bit of demon blood to enhance his martial technique.</p><p></p><p>In the end, his innate Explosive Bird-Killing Fist underwent a magnificent transformation, becoming... Jade Blood level Explosive Bird-Killing Fist.</p><p></p><p>"This punch is comparable to the speed of sound now, with even higher lethality against birds."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a bit more secure, but it still wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, my throat is dry from all this voicing. If only I could catch a system to voice for me.</p><p>If that's not possible, install a system on my body to say out loud what I'm thinking in my head."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>On Canxing, this could indeed be realized.</p><p></p><p>Canxing had such electronic products that could vocalize what people were thinking.</p><p></p><p>There was a screenwriter who relied on this to write scripts, extremely quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go home and sleep," Qi Yuan said, looking at the faint light of dawn.</p><p></p><p>After being busy all day, it was time to go home and sleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was woken up by children.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, the sun was bright.</p><p></p><p>He estimated the time to be around 3 PM.</p><p></p><p>"What are you knocking on my door for so early in the morning?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the little boy outside, his tone not very pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Just now in his dream, he had a wonderful dream where he won a huge lottery jackpot of ten trillion, finally bought Gongxing, and became a winner in life.</p><p></p><p>He was about to go to Wuyun Pavilion and tell that secretary from before, "All of Gongxing is mine now," when he was woken up.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>However, he was very generous and always magnanimous, not holding grudges.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't chop up this kid.</p><p></p><p>"Are... are you Qi Er?" The little boy's face was sallow, looking somewhat malnourished.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What's going on?" Qi Yuan pondered, suspecting he might have triggered a hidden plot.</p><p></p><p>It turns out sleeping could trigger hidden plots.</p><p></p><p>"It's Sister Xiao Mei who told me to find you!" the little boy said nervously. "Last night, Xiao Mei came to our village and stayed at my house.</p><p>But in the middle of the night, villagers from the neighboring village abducted her."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, they took a liking to her?" Qi Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Sea God who took a liking to her. The people from the neighboring Haishi Village want to marry her off to the Sea God!" the little boy said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Being married to the Sea God was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Haishi Village had long worshipped the Sea God and would capture young women, dress them in red wedding gowns, and sacrifice them to the Sea God.</p><p></p><p>This way, the Sea God would bless them with worry-free fishing and no storms.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression was surprised: "Xiao Mei really has an innate constitution prone to marriage."</p><p></p><p>He hadn't been in this game for long, but Xiao Mei was already about to get married twice.</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The game settings were quite interesting, setting up some humorous characters.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, Xiao Mei belonged to the comic relief category.</p><p></p><p>"This Sea God... is it a demon?" Qi Yuan asked the question he was concerned about.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he was in dire need of demon blood.</p><p></p><p>But besides Boss Kun's water tribe, he had killed most of the other demons.</p><p></p><p>Boss Kun's whereabouts were unknown, and now a water god had appeared here.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt motivated.</p><p></p><p>"You lead me there. I'll go reason with that water god, tell him not to marry Xiao Mei, but to marry me instead!" Qi Yuan said unscrupulously.</p><p></p><p>The boy was dumbfounded, looking at Qi Yuan with a terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few hours later, led by the boy and his older brother, Qi Yuan arrived at Haishi Village.</p><p></p><p>The boy pointed at the village ahead, his face terrified: "That's Haishi Village up ahead. We don't dare go in."</p><p></p><p>Ever since the people of Haishi Village started worshipping the Sea God, they had gained a notorious reputation.</p><p></p><p>They caught more fish, earned more money, and also colluded with the officials.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the harvest was poor, they would go marry a wife for the Sea God.</p><p></p><p>Where did these young brides come from?</p><p></p><p>The village certainly didn't have enough.</p><p></p><p>So... they were passing travelers who stayed overnight.</p><p></p><p>However, as this matter spread, no young women dared to pass through Haishi Village anymore.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Haishi Village then turned their attention to other villages.</p><p></p><p>The boy's Wood Family Village had even had an armed conflict with Haishi Village over this matter.</p><p></p><p>But Haishi Village got help from the officials, and Wood Family Village was defeated that time.</p><p></p><p>So the boy was terrified of Haishi Village.</p><p></p><p>"Such a wide official road, yet no one is coming through. It seems this Haishi Village... indeed has a bad reputation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan commented briefly.</p><p></p><p>To go to Yunyan County, one had to take the official road, which passed through Haishi Village.</p><p></p><p>On the way here, Qi Yuan saw many carriages and merchants on the official road.</p><p></p><p>But on the official road near Haishi Village, there were none.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, those merchants would rather take a detour than pass through Haishi Village.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan approached the entrance of Haishi Village, two unfriendly-looking men immediately looked at him suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? What are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put on a gentle smile: "My name is Qi Yuan. I'm about to get married and take a wife.</p><p>It's my first... no, second time getting married, so I'm inexperienced.</p><p>I heard your Sea God is taking a wife, so I came specially to observe the ceremony and learn from the experience."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two men's expressions became strange.</p><p></p><p>Observing a ceremony was one thing, but this was the first time they'd heard of someone coming to learn from the experience.</p><p></p><p>However, a glint of amusement flashed in their eyes, and they became enthusiastic: "Since you're here to observe, esteemed guest, please come in."</p><p></p><p>The smiles in their eyes seemed to hide a hint of mockery, and also sympathy.</p><p></p><p>Happy New Year!

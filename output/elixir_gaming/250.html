        <h1>Chapter 250</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Within the city, immortal light permeated everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, streaks of light occasionally flashed by, falling into Dream Return City.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen, dressed in a black robe, flew through the air with fluctuating spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>Cultivators he encountered on the way, whether at the Yuandan or Shenying stage, or even Purple Palace realm, all unconsciously made way for Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>Because Shen Wushen was flying while riding on a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>This small mountain was the mark of a true disciple of Mount Futu.</p><p></p><p>Mount Futu was the strongest sect in this area, said to be a holy land with a Yang Immortal presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>The status of true disciples was even higher than ordinary Yin Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen landed in Dream Return City. Before him stood a building called the Eight Treasures Tower.</p><p></p><p>This tower was a branch of the Tianzi Tower.</p><p></p><p>Its specialized business was transmitting information.</p><p></p><p>The advertising that Qi Yuan mentioned, Tianzi Tower also did.</p><p></p><p>"An honored guest has arrived. My apologies for not welcoming you from afar. Please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>A cheerful voice rang out as the manager of this floor of the Eight Treasures Tower walked out.</p><p></p><p>He was an elderly man with white hair, wearing a neat Daoist robe embroidered with a crane about to take flight from the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The manager's strength was at the peak of Purple Palace realm, just one step away from Yin Immortal. But he was exceptionally respectful when facing Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>"I need to use your Eight Treasures Tower to transmit a message," Shen Wushen said, getting straight to the point. </p><p></p><p>He was never good at socializing, nor did he need to be, since everyone he met treated him quite well.</p><p></p><p>The manager's eyes held a kindly smile. "Where does this message need to be sent?"</p><p></p><p>"Moon Goddess Palace, to Moon Lady Jin Li," Shen Wushen replied.</p><p></p><p>The message to be transmitted included not only Qi Jianjun's verbal message, but also the cultivation technique composed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing You."</p><p></p><p>These items were placed in a storage bag and given simple processing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Tianzi Tower behind the Eight Treasures Tower would not allow these things to leak.</p><p></p><p>After all, Tianzi Tower's business was so large that it even did business for Yang Immortals, continuing for a million years.</p><p></p><p>If there had been any problems, Tianzi Tower would have collapsed long ago.</p><p></p><p>Even in a world where strength reigns supreme, credibility is extremely important.</p><p></p><p>Once it crumbles, it could lead to the collapse of etiquette and music.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Goddess Palace?" The manager hesitated, taking out a jade slip resembling a map and consulting it.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the manager had heard of this holy land, but did not know the specific location of Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite far..." After learning the approximate location of Moon Goddess Palace, the manager sighed, "It will take about three years to transmit it there."</p><p></p><p>The Upper Realm was extremely vast, or rather, it was the collective name for many worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Upper Realm was boundless. Even ordinary Yang Immortals could not set foot in all areas in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>How many individual worlds were there in total in the Upper Realm?</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Immortals did not know.</p><p></p><p>However, the worlds of the Upper Realm were divided into nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>Mount Futu was in the second heaven of the lower three heavens.</p><p></p><p>Moon Goddess Palace was located in the sixth heaven of the middle three heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, thank you for your trouble," Shen Wushen said, taking out two storage bags. One contained the items to be transmitted, the other was the payment.</p><p></p><p>The manager hurriedly accepted them, then took out an ancient parchment to sign a contract with Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>The agreement was thus reached.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen breathed a sigh of relief. One of the tasks Qi Yuan had asked him to do was now completed.</p><p></p><p>There was still one more...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>That one was much more troublesome than transmitting a message.</p><p></p><p>Moon Goddess Palace was huge, but there were only a few Moon Ladies, so sending a message to a Moon Lady was still feasible.</p><p></p><p>But "confessing to Ruan Yixi" was obviously more complicated.</p><p></p><p>Moon Goddess Palace was too big. To send a message to someone named Ruan Yixi would require broadcasting it widely, as Qi Yuan had said.</p><p></p><p>The cost... would also be much higher.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to spend a lot of money to exchange for some cultivation techniques for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Lower Realm also needed money, which was another huge expense.</p><p></p><p>So now, he was penniless.</p><p></p><p>The only way he could make money... was by doing the tasks Qi Yuan mentioned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have high hopes for what Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if he took on dozens of tasks, Qi Yuan might be able to complete two or three, which would be a big profit.</p><p></p><p>So he wouldn't lose too much.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he saw a beautiful fair-skinned woman with an extremely exaggerated waist-to-hip ratio, who couldn't take another step.</p><p></p><p>When the woman appeared, her lotus steps swayed gracefully. Her light green long dress was slightly revealing, with a expanse of white at the chest. As soon as one looked, one saw delicate cleavage - she was the picture of allure.</p><p></p><p>Large breasts, willow waist, plump buttocks, plus that face as charming as autumn waters, like a seductive fox spirit - as soon as the woman appeared, she attracted the attention of almost everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Lian Mei... I never thought I'd have the fortune to see Lady Lian Mei up close like this!"</p><p></p><p>"The lady is even three times more charming than the legends say!"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder who could become the Dao partner of such a celestial maiden."</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Holy Son of Mount Futu sought Lady Lian Mei as his Dao partner but was unsuccessful."</p><p></p><p>Lady Lian Mei was a true disciple of Mount Futu, with strength at the peak of Shenying realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the true disciples of Mount Futu, Lady Lian Mei was also in the top ten.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lady Lian Mei's gaze fell on Shen Wushen. She saw his incredibly intense, naked gaze, as if he wanted to strip off her clothes.</p><p></p><p>She had seen many such gazes, but they were always furtive looks. She had almost never encountered anyone as direct as Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Lian Mei, may I challenge you to a battle!" At this moment, Shen Wushen spoke up, a strong fighting spirit surging from his body.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was blazing, as if he had seen a peerless beauty.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the Upper or Lower Realm, whenever he saw an opponent, he would challenge them to a fight, seeking defeat to hone his own Dao and innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Lady Lian Mei smiled charmingly. "Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen's reputation as a battle maniac was quite well-known in Mount Futu.</p><p></p><p>The last time Shen Wushen had challenged her, she had easily defeated him.</p><p></p><p>This time he came to challenge her again, and Lady Lian Mei naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators nearby all showed envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I also want to have a fair and square battle with Lady Lian Mei!"</p><p></p><p>"You rascal, you want to duel with Lady Lian Mei? You're clearly lusting after her body!"</p><p></p><p>"That guy really doesn't understand romance. He could invite Lady Lian Mei to do anything, why insist on a duel?"</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen is strong, but he's still quite inferior to Lady Lian Mei."</p><p></p><p>Even so, these cultivators watched with great interest.</p><p></p><p>A hundred breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>Lady Lian Mei looked at Shen Wushen, a smile appearing in her eyes. "Junior Brother Shen has come to challenge this senior sister. It seems this journey through the myriad worlds has been quite fruitful."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I befriended a genius who gave me some pointers, greatly increasing my strength," Shen Wushen answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Lady Lian Mei's smile grew wider. "I can see that. You're even confident enough to challenge me."</p><p></p><p>Among the true disciples, Lian Mei belonged to the first tier, while Shen Wushen belonged to the second tier.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to that genius, I may not be as good, but compared to senior sister, I'm confident I can win!" Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>Lady Lian Mei smiled coyly. "Junior brother is still as direct as ever in his speech."</p><p></p><p>In other words, he didn't think before he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The battle also erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the onlookers widened their eyes and held their breath to watch this exciting duel.</p><p></p><p>However, contrary to their expectations, the duel began quickly and ended just as quickly.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten breaths of time, Lady Lian Mei's body fell from the air.</p><p></p><p>On her snow-white chest appeared a bright red footprint. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, and her face showed a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>A flash of snow-white gauze covered her chest.</p><p></p><p>She held her chest with her hand, looking at Shen Wushen with a complicated expression. "I lost."</p><p></p><p>If there weren't so many people around, she would definitely want to go back.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He checked to see if he had been kicked badly by Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>"I concede!" Shen Wushen was very pleased, after all, he had defeated Lian Mei whom he could not defeat before.</p><p></p><p>Among the true disciples of Futu Mountain, he was also in the first tier. Seeing Shen Wushen like this, Lian Mei's heart rippled.</p><p></p><p>This person... is really too insensitive. </p><p></p><p>Shouldn't he... apologize, say something like... "I've offended a beautiful lady"?</p><p></p><p>But thinking that Shen Wushen had always been like this, she didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, she then said: "It seems that the prodigy my junior brother met in other worlds is truly an unparalleled genius?"</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Wushen's strength before was far behind hers.</p><p></p><p>Now, he easily defeated her, not much inferior to the Holy Son at the same level.</p><p></p><p>"He is the strongest Divine Infant cultivator I have ever seen," Shen Wushen recalled Qi Yuan with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, such a powerful Divine Infant cultivator, why didn't my junior brother introduce him to join our Futu Mountain?" Fairy Lian Mei was also quite curious about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With just a little guidance from Qi Yuan, Shen Wushen had undergone a complete transformation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from Shen Wushen's words, he was far behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"He... cannot come to the upper realm." Shen Wushen didn't say much on this topic.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lian Mei was also tactful and didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Wushen looked at Lian Mei, and suddenly had an idea: "I wonder if senior sister... could lend me a divine technique, one that hasn't been recorded yet."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen remembered that Lian Mei had once obtained a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had just defeated Lian Mei, shouldn't Lian Mei do him a favor? Lian Mei's smile froze.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else who fought with her, gave her chest a hard kick, and then asked to borrow a divine technique from her.</p><p></p><p>She would definitely ignore them.</p><p></p><p>But... this was Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>The current Shen Wushen, in terms of foundation stability, was no less than the Holy Son.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, she could invest a little.</p><p></p><p>"This divine technique can be lent to junior brother, but when can junior brother return it to senior sister?" Fairy Lian Mei smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Before I return it to senior sister, if I'm around, whenever senior sister wants to spar with me, I'm at your service!" Shen Wushen said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lian Mei was stunned: "If someone else said this, I would definitely think, does he have other intentions?"</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei didn't pretend to be reserved and gave the divine technique to Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>"The original of this divine technique belongs to you, I won't use it anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior sister!" Shen Wushen breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He finally got a divine technique, and this divine technique was not yet recorded, the kind that could be sold to the Eight Treasures Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, farewell."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Shen Wushen left.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei: "..."</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Stinky man, leaving right after getting what he wanted? Meanwhile, Shen Wushen came to the Eight Treasures Tower again.</p><p></p><p>The tower master came out to welcome him again, this time with an even bigger smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He had just received news that Shen Wushen had easily defeated Fairy Lian Mei in a battle.</p><p></p><p>"Tower master, I have another matter to trouble you with this time."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen went straight to the point, fully stating what Qi Yuan had instructed.</p><p></p><p>He took out the original of the divine technique and handed it to the tower master.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the payment."</p><p></p><p>He had already memorized this divine technique and could write it down for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shen Wushen's words, the tower master was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of... business dealing with the Moon God Palace, I need to report to the higher-ups, it will probably take a few days to get a result." The tower master's face showed a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, this business was about advertising to the entire Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Palace was a holy land, and not just an ordinary holy land.</p><p></p><p>Such business needed to be handled with caution.</p><p></p><p>What if this "Ruan Yixi" was some big shot in the Moon God Palace? Such a confession might offend Ruan Yixi and cause the Moon God Palace to dislike it.</p><p></p><p>So, for such business, the tower master guessed that the higher-ups would probably refuse.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's better to avoid trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Shen Wushen took back the divine technique and left directly after speaking.</p><p></p><p>He was going back to Futu Mountain to take on some tasks for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Futu Mountain, Great Venerable Hua Du closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the jewel-adorned cave dwelling, on a pearl as big as a football, the figure of an old man appeared.</p><p></p><p>The old man was prostrating on the ground, his face showing a devout expression.</p><p></p><p>"Unfilial disciple, Xuantian Sect's 31st generation sect leader He Yunzi, begs the ancestor to bestow a talisman!"</p><p></p><p>Hua Du opened his eyes and sighed softly: "I didn't expect it to be the 31st generation already."</p><p></p><p>He was once a member of the lower realm, the 3rd generation sect leader of Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Later he ascended to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>He had almost no connection with Xuantian Sect anymore.</p><p></p><p>The current Xuantian Sect had declined, with only the sect leader at the Purple Palace realm in the entire large sect.</p><p></p><p>According to the 31st generation sect leader's plea, the current Xuantian Sect had discovered a new world and wanted to enter that world to spread their teachings and obtain resources.</p><p></p><p>But Xuantian Sect was too weak, they didn't have the qualification, or rather the ability to spread teachings.</p><p></p><p>So, the sect leader of Xuantian Sect used magic to beg for blessings.</p><p></p><p>"The old connection..."</p><p></p><p>Hua Du sighed.</p><p></p><p>He flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a talisman seemed to cross space, falling to the lower realm through that pearl.</p><p></p><p>"All past matters have been settled, I wonder when... I can step into the Mythical realm?"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hua Du's face was full of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>He had been stuck at the sixth step of Treading the Sky for nearly ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Unable to step into the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he steps into the Mythical realm, he will become a true core member of Futu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Once his contributions are enough, he can apply to the mountain lord for the qualification to reflect on all heavens.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of these, his consciousness delved into a jade slip, and he couldn't help but show a trace of surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The task... has been taken?"</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen... a true disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hua Du was somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>The task he issued was related to cultivation techniques, and also concerned his entry into the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>He had posted this task for seven thousand years, but unfortunately, no one had ever taken it.</p><p></p><p>This task of his was very difficult, only a Mythical being on the same path as him would have a slight chance of solving it.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it would take more than a thousand years of that Mythical being's time.</p><p></p><p>There was no Mythical being on the same path as Hua Du in Futu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen's master is... Great Venerable Wang Jiu, he is a Mythical being... but on a different path from mine."</p><p></p><p>"Strange, what does a mere Divine Infant want with my task?"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hua Du couldn't figure it out no matter how hard he thought.</p><p></p><p>When he posted the task, he actually had the idea that no one could solve it.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Futu Mountain, perhaps only the mountain lord, who was a Yang Spirit, could solve his task.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hua Du didn't think much about it and went back to closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Shen Wushen kept browsing through the sect's tasks for days on end, taking on a lot of them.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, he received a message from the tower master of the Eight Treasures Tower and went there again.</p><p></p><p>The tower master of the Eight Treasures Tower had a joyful expression on his face: "Young Master Shen, the higher-ups have agreed to the previous cooperation."</p><p></p><p>In fact, at this moment, the tower master of the Eight Treasures Tower was also very curious.</p><p></p><p>Because generally, this kind of task would be vetoed by the higher-ups, he didn't know why it was approved this time.</p><p></p><p>Although puzzled, he didn't show it.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen, who was beside him, breathed a sigh of relief when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, tower master!"</p><p></p><p>He had completed what Qi Yuan had entrusted him with, and even completed it ahead of schedule.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 552</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the inner city area.</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger was sitting in his seat.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, there were many aristocrats who were half-human, half-strange, and half-animal like him.</p><p></p><p>Some had ox heads, some had pig faces, numbering in the hundreds and thousands, gathered together, as if they had come to a garden of myriad monsters.</p><p></p><p>These strange and bizarre aristocrats had fanatical expressions, staring at the arena below.</p><p></p><p>In the arena, scantily clad half-naked men and women wielding knives and swords were engaged in mutual slaughter.</p><p></p><p>These aristocrats were red-eyed and panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Waste, twist his neck!"</p><p>"Bite, don't you have a mouth!"</p><p>"If you make me lose money, you'll get what's coming to you! Motherfucker!"</p><p>"Goddammit!"</p><p></p><p>All kinds of filthy and vulgar language fell on their ears.</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger shook his huge tiger head, eating garlic-mixed meat paste, opening his mouth with a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the communication talisman, his expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"A resurrected cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>The other side, the leader of the Blood Tiger Gang, seeing Blood Tiger's response, immediately said humbly:</p><p></p><p>"This fellow has disregarded the prestige of Lord Blood Tiger, and has arbitrarily killed members of the Blood Tiger Gang. Now he has come to the inner city area seeking refuge. Please, Lord Blood Tiger, lend a hand to stop him, and this humble one will offer thirty thousand taels of silver!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger narrowed his eyes: "Enough with the polite talk, since I'm free, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger then stood up directly.</p><p></p><p>On the communication talisman, the leader of the Blood Tiger Gang had already sent the approximate location of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was not very far from Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Blood Tiger patted the thigh of a female servant in the arena, with a mocking expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The thigh meat of those two beasts upstairs, keep it for me."</p><p></p><p>He was referring to the two slaves fighting on the stage.</p><p></p><p>Even if they managed to win the battle on the stage, it did not mean they would have a chance to live.</p><p></p><p>The female servant had a fawning expression on her face: "Don't worry, master, the most tender piece will be saved for you."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger strode through the streets of the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the outer city, the inner city was much more prosperous, and the roads were much cleaner.</p><p></p><p>Human slaves with bowed heads, wearing neat clothes, were diligently sweeping the roads.</p><p></p><p>"A resurrected cultivator, the Thorny Blood has confirmed it, and he has actually come back to life. It seems he has a secret.</p><p></p><p>This time he has come to the inner city, probably to seek the patronage of an elder, and offer that secret."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger was very intelligent and good at making associations.</p><p></p><p>He immediately understood Qi Yuan's true intention.</p><p></p><p>"His scheme is ringing loud and clear, but unfortunately he has encountered me." Blood Tiger had the upper hand, his tiger face bearing a murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he suddenly looked up at the sky, his face showing surprise and astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He saw a golden flash streak across the sky, moving at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>That golden flash, Blood Tiger was very familiar with, it was the great figure of the Golden Crane, the Thorny Blood's senior. This senior was a sky-level expert, in the Cloud Blood City, he was an existence that could shake the earth with a stomp.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Blood Tiger's knowledge, this senior had been in seclusion for years, rarely showing himself.</p><p></p><p>Why did he suddenly appear today?</p><p></p><p>"This matter is strange, but it has nothing to do with me, my current task is to kill Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"And that waste Zhi Qi, he even lost track of the surveillance talisman, it seems I have to take care of it myself."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Blood Tiger's speed suddenly increased again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up at the sky again, and saw several more light shadows flashing across the heavens, each with a terrifying aura, clearly sky-level experts! "What's going on, the Elder Council has all mobilized?" Blood Tiger had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, he had detected more than ten sky-level experts in motion.</p><p></p><p>This must be a major event.</p><p></p><p>"If the sky falls, there are tall people to hold it up, this has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger calmed himself down.</p><p></p><p>Now, finding Qi Yuan is the priority.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the sky above, the Golden Crane, dressed in golden robes, had a gloomy and terrible expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The princess has actually been killed by a human slave!"</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Spirit Realm, any princess title holder was a formidable figure.</p><p></p><p>Either they were the daughters of the Mysterious Spirits, or their sisters.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Spirits loomed high in the sky, or were deeply hidden in the clouds and seas, almost never appearing in the world.</p><p></p><p>The daughters or sisters of the Mysterious Spirits had a status even higher than the elders of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>The one who had come to the Cloud Blood City for a visit was the daughter of the Dark-Eyed Mysterious Spirit, Yin Ling.</p><p></p><p>This princess particularly liked to hide her identity and cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>After Yin Ling came to the Cloud Blood City, Golden Crane learned of this news and was extremely nervous. He specially arranged for sky-level experts to follow and protect her.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, just now, he saw that the sky-level expert's soul token had been shattered.</p><p></p><p>As members of the Thorny Blood, they all left a wisp of their divine soul in their soul tokens.</p><p></p><p>The shattering of the soul token meant the death of the body.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this news, how could Golden Crane not be alarmed?</p><p></p><p>The other sky-level experts were also rushing towards the place where that sky-level expert had perished.</p><p></p><p>"What's the situation?" Golden Crane's voice was gloomy and terrible.</p><p></p><p>The death of the princess, they could not escape responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Probably not even death would save them, they might have to peel off a layer of skin.</p><p></p><p>As for that person, he wished he could eat his flesh and drink his bones.</p><p></p><p>The Tenth Elder's expression was also very ugly: "The princess was collecting tolls at the city gate, and a mortal... not only did he not pay, but he also slapped the princess to death with one hand! Dragon Food, who was protecting the princess, was also slapped to death with one hand!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Food was the sky-level expert protecting the princess, although his strength was not outstanding, he was still a sky-level expert! But he was killed with a single slap? How could Golden Crane not be shocked? Now, the powerful experts of the Cloud Blood City had gathered in one place, their momentum fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Slapping Dragon Food to death with one hand, his strength must be extraordinary, but no matter what, for killing the princess, he must die today!" Golden Crane said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Li Zha is currently contacting him, trying to probe his depth!" said the Tenth Elder.</p><p></p><p>Li Zha was also a sky-level expert, best at speed and fleeing, so he was the one tasked with probing Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the other powerful experts of the Thorny Blood, they were now gathered in a group, hiding in the dark, preparing to strike with a thunderous blow.</p><p></p><p>If they did not strike, so be it, but if they did, it would be earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the street, Li Zha looked at the man in front of him, his expression angry.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you've done?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily, his expression as casual as ever: "I just wanted to come into the city and have breakfast, but someone was blocking the city gate, collecting a toll of a hundred taels! </p><p></p><p>How many steamed buns could that buy? I complained to the city guards, but they didn't listen to me!</p><p></p><p>The head of the city guards was standing behind that thief, nodding and fawning like a lackey! Where is the justice, where is the righteous way? Since no one upheld justice for me, as an honest person, I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>His original intention was very simple, to go find the Thorny Blood and tell them, I want to become mortal, don't disturb me, otherwise the consequences will be dire.</p><p></p><p>He was still very good at talking, persuading with reason.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if reason didn't work, he would flexibly change his approach and use force to prevail! Hearing this, Li Zha felt only ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Merely for a few hundred taels of silver, to slay a princess? This person must be sick! "You're done for, killing the princess, you have no chance of survival, you will surely die today!" Li Zha said in a deep voice, "Soon there will be people coming for you, it is your time of death!"</p><p></p><p>Li Zha finished speaking, without any hesitation, he flew away.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's strength was too powerful, he didn't dare to confront the other party, and could only leave after throwing a harsh word.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't run away!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Were these people too careless?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he now had to become mortal, unable to use divine consciousness, otherwise he might have easily found the hidden enemies around and slaughtered them.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only walk forward step by step, heading towards the enemy's lair. After about tens of breaths, a contemptuous voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"You have guts, daring to come to the inner city!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger had his arms crossed, with a tiger head on top, exuding a domineering aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Blood Tiger, with a look of hesitation and solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the backup they're looking for?"</p><p></p><p>"Now that you've seen the master, you should kneel down!" Blood Tiger said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>His voice was loud and hoarse.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was extremely vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his eyes were deceiving him? Was the other party a true expert? Otherwise, how dare he block him with such cultivation? Or was it that the people of Cloud Blood City had gone mad and sent a small tiger to stop him?</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, you are my opponent, and I will respect you." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>His heart was also extremely vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to be my opponent?" Blood Tiger sneered.</p><p></p><p>This domineering style, this self-confidence, a true supreme expert, made Qi Yuan wary.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are strong, you can't use foul language!" Qi Yuan said dissatisfiedly, gathering all his strength.</p><p></p><p>He was looking at Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Although Blood Tiger was full of openings, he had a thousand ways to kill him with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to, he was hesitant.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was not a fool to dare to come, he must have some skills.</p><p></p><p>Although his brows didn't indicate any danger.</p><p></p><p>But what if... the other party was a true expert, deceiving his eyes and his brows?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you should commit suicide to atone, and I'll leave you a complete corpse." Blood Tiger said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I have to go all out!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression became extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I can crush you with just one finger!" Blood Tiger was insulting.</p><p></p><p>This was the bullying of the strong over the weak!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>Too much bullying! </p><p></p><p>Just because you're strong, you can insult my personality! Qi Yuan's veins popped up, the blood flow in his body became abnormal, his face flushed red, like a fever.</p><p></p><p>He was gathering power!</p><p></p><p>Gathering power!</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger sneered disdainfully, "Hurry up and make your move, I'm in a hurry!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan let out a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>This sound was like a thunderclap in a clear sky.</p><p></p><p>However, after the thunderclap, something more terrifying happened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's right foot suddenly stomped the ground! "Break!"</p><p></p><p>Endless power erupted at this moment! At this moment, he held nothing back. </p><p></p><p>All the power was fully unleashed and released at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The sound of the ground cracking!</p><p></p><p>The sound of the howling wind! The sound of the roof being blown away!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a tornado had passed through, no, even more terrifying than a tornado.</p><p></p><p>The huge power, like a nuclear bomb sweeping the ground, swept through the inner city area.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, countless houses collapsed, stone pillars were blown away! In an instant, it was a scene of devastation!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, more than a dozen terrifying figures fell from the sky, disheveled.</p><p></p><p>These dozen or so figures were all Sky-level experts! They had been hiding in the sky, secretly observing Qi Yuan, preparing to ambush him.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that Qi Yuan's one-foot stomp would shock them down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, Qi Yuan didn't even look at these dozen or so Sky-level experts, his gaze fell on Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"You are very strong, unfathomable!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but exclaim, "Even if my attack speed is very slow, with your strength, you should be able to easily dodge it, but you didn't move at all, obviously you don't care about my attack."</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't care, his attack would be nothing to Blood Tiger, so he had to avoid Blood Tiger, otherwise, what if Blood Tiger absorbed the power of this strike?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the dozen or so Sky-level experts fell to the ground, with terror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that they were also frightened by Qi Yuan's one strike! A foot stomp that cracked the earth, was this the power of a human? And at this time, Blood Tiger, his whole body was stiff, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>What did he see? That ordinary human, stomped his foot, as if it was a joke.</p><p></p><p>The result... Heaven and earth collapsed! Then... the Sky-level experts fell down like dumplings! What should he do? What should he do? Mom! He was panicked, anxious, afraid, his legs were trembling terribly, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>He now had some understanding.</p><p></p><p>Why those Sky-level experts were deployed, it was to deal with this human monster.</p><p></p><p>But... he dared to block the road?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the communication talisman transmitted the voice of Blood Tiger's Sect Leader.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Tiger Lord, there was a huge tremor in the inner city just now, has something big happened?</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger Lord, can you capture that little human? Now that there is a strange sound, this humble one is really worried about Blood Tiger Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Tiger saw this message, and was so angry that he wanted to curse the Blood Tiger Sect Leader's mother!</p><p></p><p>Little human?</p><p></p><p>The one who shook the inner city with a single foot was a little human?</p><p></p><p>Am I safe now?</p><p></p><p>Safe your ass!</p><p></p><p>He had a belly full of words, just wanting to greet the Blood Tiger Sect Leader's mother after death!</p><p></p><p>"Your leg muscles are constantly trembling, are you releasing power? Such a terrifying power release method!" At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Blood Tiger and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he swept his gaze towards these Sky-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"Before fighting with you, let me clean up these little bugs first, otherwise... it will affect our battle."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face revealed a murderous intent as he looked at those Sky-level experts.</p><p></p><p>Those Sky-level experts heard this and their spirits shook.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crane Pill transformed into a golden light and frantically flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"He can't fly, go up to the sky!" Li Jia shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Qi Yuan met them, he had always said that he had innate divine power and did not cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Now Li Jia believed it.</p><p></p><p>This was true divine power!</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't cultivate, they didn't feel any cultivator's aura from Qi Yuan, so they probably couldn't fly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, these dozen or so Sky-level experts quickly flew towards the sky, flying higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they were stunned unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>Now that they were in the sky, they were prepared, they felt that Qi Yuan could not fly, and could not hurt them at all.</p><p></p><p>And they... could attack from the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, even though they flew very fast, there were still two unlucky ones who were kicked out by Qi Yuan with two stones, crushing them to death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Sky-level experts in the sky, with a dissatisfied expression on his face: "So you're bullying me for not having a mount, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan missed Shen Lingxuan a bit, if he rode her, he could fly up and slay all of them.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you don't know... that I use technology, which is not considered supernatural, right?"</p><p></p><p>A sinister smile appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>With these words, two mechanical wings extended from his back, full of technological sense.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is... transformation difficult?" In the past, for Qi Yuan, transformation was indeed difficult when he was gaining enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had comprehended the Way of Human Demons. </p><p></p><p>The complete cultivation system was in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He could transform in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"You can transform?" The golden canary Snow Face was like jade. She had never seen blood transformation before.</p><p></p><p>According to Nine Pan Mountain, only monsters and demons could transform.</p><p></p><p>Blood... what was that? "Don't transform into another ugly creature. </p><p></p><p>This young lady has spent 27 years getting used to your ugliness.</p><p></p><p>If you change to another ugly appearance, I'll have to spend another 27 years getting used to it," the golden canary said with concern.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to talk to this female demon whose mouth was like a machine gun.</p><p></p><p>He immediately used the transformation technique from the Way of Human Demons.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a blood curtain appeared, and spiritual energy from heaven and earth rolled towards it, condensing into a human form.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time, Qi Yuan appeared in a blood-colored robe, extraordinarily handsome.</p><p></p><p>Above his brow, there was a red dot, looking quite demonic.</p><p></p><p>Now he still had his previous appearance.</p><p></p><p>But he looked more demonic and even more handsome.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary stared at Qi Yuan. When she saw his handsome face under the blood robe, her snow-white face blushed: "It's... just average, barely worthy of this young lady."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt his body: "Indeed, having a body feels more comfortable."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he sat down in meditation again, looking at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary stood to the side, her golden long dress unmoved by the wind. She said resentfully: "Is that gate so good-looking? Better looking than this young lady?"</p><p></p><p>Just now when she saw the blood bead transform, she was thinking of personally cooking to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>But after transforming, this guy just raised his head to look at that gate again.</p><p></p><p>Like a wooden block.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't answer. He continued looking at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences in the sky.</p><p></p><p>His abnormal abilities and the Way of Human Demons were increasing crazily.</p><p></p><p>A month later, a small wooden house appeared near Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary put her hands on her slender waist and shouted at Qi Yuan: "This is a feng shui treasure spot. This young lady moved here, but it's not because I want to be your neighbor. Don't flatter yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that you moved here and I didn't even know?" Qi Yuan glanced at the golden canary. Today she had put on makeup again, her cheeks like peach blossoms, quite charming.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Having this young lady as your neighbor is a blessing you've cultivated for a hundred years!" The golden canary complained resentfully and returned to her wooden house. She was still angry, her small chest heaving up and down.</p><p></p><p>But she looked outside from time to time. Otherwise, what if her childhood sweetheart disappeared again one day? Time passed, and Qi Yuan kept sitting on the rock, comprehending the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Every day, the golden canary would come to chat with him.</p><p></p><p>Talking about some trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also roughly understood that on Nine Pan Mountain, there were many demons and spirits similar to the golden canary.</p><p></p><p>Most of them had transformed, though the transformations were not necessarily complete.</p><p></p><p>For example, Qi Yuan saw an elephant spirit with a long nose.</p><p></p><p>He recalled scenes he had seen on TV - usually male demons retained many of their demonic features, while female demons did not, almost all transforming into human form, keeping only a small part of their demonic characteristics.</p><p></p><p>In the past Qi Yuan didn't take what he saw on TV seriously, but unexpectedly Nine Pan Mountain was the same.</p><p></p><p>"Blood bead, it's not good, extremely urgent, this young lady needs your help!"</p><p></p><p>One day, the golden canary ran over with an anxious face, pulling his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Qi Yuan let the golden canary hold his hand.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it didn't affect his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go quickly, I'll tell you on the way!" The golden canary held Qi Yuan's hand and ran down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>After just a moment, fine sweat seeped from the golden canary's small hand. She said anxiously: "A fight broke out!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain, several demons were gathered, arguing, with many onlookers watching.</p><p></p><p>The arguers were simple - a mother rabbit, a male dog, and a female dog.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the argument was also simple.</p><p></p><p>A love triangle.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the male dog and mother rabbit were originally a couple. The mother rabbit had an affair, and the heartbroken male dog got together with the female dog.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the mother rabbit had given birth to a baby.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't it need to build a house? When rabbits build houses, they usually use their own fur, retaining their animal habits.</p><p></p><p>She was reluctant to use her own fur because it hurt, but for the sake of the baby rabbit, she came to tear the male dog's fur every night.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were arguing here.</p><p></p><p>The male dog's eyes were red: "I loved you so much back then, but you ended up with another man."</p><p></p><p>The mother rabbit was angry: "When you were pursuing me back then, you said you didn't mind me being like this. After getting me, is this how you act? And you, when I was still with Dog Brother, you were already flirting with him. Before Dog Brother and I broke up, you were already sleeping with him, you little slut!"</p><p></p><p>The female dog was furious: "If you hadn't cheated first, would Dog Brother be like this? I've always been generous and don't want to bring up past matters. But what about you? You had a child, and when building a nest for the child, you're unwilling to use your own fur and steal my Dog Brother's fur. You really have maternal love, but your quality is low."</p><p></p><p>The male dog accused the mother rabbit of cheating.</p><p></p><p>The mother rabbit accused the female dog of being the third party.</p><p></p><p>The female dog accused the mother rabbit of cheating and then coming back to harm her ex.</p><p></p><p>The three argued fiercely, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers, sometimes trying to mediate.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary looked anxious: "What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless: "If I had known it was such a big deal, I should have called more people. </p><p></p><p>Like the Tathagata Buddha, the Monkey King, Thanos, Iron Man, Baldy Strong - if they all came, this matter would definitely be resolved."</p><p></p><p>With so many powerful beings appearing, could this argument continue? It would probably be listed as one of the most valuable arguments across all realms.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary glared at Qi Yuan: "They're so chaotic, whose fault is it really?"</p><p></p><p>"You go up and slap them all, then leave. The matter will probably end," Qi Yuan said. "But you don't have a certificate of insanity, so you can't."</p><p></p><p>To be a judge, you need to be insane, otherwise you'll end up in jail.</p><p></p><p>"The argument is almost over. Let's go back," Qi Yuan said listlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's watch a bit longer. We rarely come down the mountain," the golden canary's small hand tightly gripped Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences. Charm +5.]</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan simply continued watching.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the three arguers became more and more agitated.</p><p></p><p>Some of the onlookers showed excited expressions: "Don't get excited, don't get excited."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, they retreated backwards.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also sensed something unusual: "What happens if they get excited?"</p><p></p><p>Before the golden canary could answer, Qi Yuan knew the answer.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that female dog getting more and more agitated as she spoke, her face becoming ferocious.</p><p></p><p>The skin on her face suddenly cracked, with fresh blood flowing out.</p><p></p><p>The crack grew larger and larger, her entire body enlarged, and a terrifying monster tore open her skin and crawled out from inside her body.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying monster had a ferocious face, its whole body covered in slippery viscous liquid, and the aura it emitted was also very frightening.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, everyone present turned pale, some with terrified expressions, and ran away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his mate turn into this, the male dog felt fear arise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In just one breath of time, he also transformed into a terrifying monster.</p><p></p><p>The last remaining rabbit also turned into a terrifying monster.</p><p></p><p>The three terrifying monsters snarled and charged towards the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, heart demons have been born!"</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly, these are heart demons!"</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't have come to watch the commotion, we're done for!"</p><p></p><p>"Stay calm, stay calm..."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary's small face turned pale as she gripped Qi Yuan's hand tightly: "Let's go quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His expression turned cold: "Demon spawn?"</p><p></p><p>The three terrifying monsters before him looked very similar to the cute little demon spawn Qi Yuan had been fighting all along.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they were demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>By now, Qi Yuan had slain tens of thousands of demon spawn. </p><p></p><p>He could say without hesitation that no one in this world understood demon spawn better than him.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the goldfinch and gave her a reassuring look.</p><p></p><p>He held the goldfinch's hand with one hand, while his other hand formed a sword finger.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The three terrifying demon spawn seemed to sense Qi Yuan's aura and roared as they charged towards him.</p><p></p><p>A putrid stench assailed them.</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood-red sword light streaked past.</p><p></p><p>Slash!</p><p></p><p>Several lightning-fast bloody flashes swept by, and those three immensely powerful demon spawn were instantly sliced to pieces by that single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they dissipated into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the fleeing monsters all stopped in their tracks and looked at Qi Yuan as if he were a god.</p><p></p><p>So cool!</p><p></p><p>Stars shone in the goldfinch's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, you're actually this amazing! You killed all three heart demons in one go!" The goldfinch was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Her childhood sweetheart was actually this strong?</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," Qi Yuan asked, "They were fine before, how did they suddenly turn... like this?"</p><p></p><p>He had some guesses in mind.</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch quickly explained: "Because... they were arguing. When they argue, they easily get agitated, and the heart demons devour them and emerge from inside their bodies, killing any living thing they see!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she looked at the three tattered pieces of clothing left on the ground, her eyes showing a faint trace of regret.</p><p></p><p>"When emotions run high, heart demons break out of the body?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>For the creatures of this world to have survived until now was quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, the creatures on Mount Jiupan all seemed especially friendly, without any fighting or killing, so everything seemed reasonable again.</p><p></p><p>However, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Emotions run high not just during arguments, but in many situations.</p><p></p><p>If... a demon spawn suddenly appeared, that scene would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this should be before the North-South Decision," Qi Yuan could almost confirm.</p><p></p><p>Because this world seemed even more insane than the world of the North-South Decision.</p><p></p><p>Anyone could suddenly turn into a monster.</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch's faint regret came quickly and left just as fast.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that living in this world, she had already grown accustomed to regulating her emotions to avoid getting too agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, since you're so strong, how about helping this young lady with something?" The goldfinch's eyes rolled, and Qi Yuan had an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm beautiful?" The goldfinch lifted her golden dress and asked coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>"Beautiful, truly beautiful, rarely seen in this world!" Qi Yuan flattered her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the goldfinch rolled her eyes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She felt Blood Pearl was being sarcastic with her.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't mind, after all she was asking for a favor.</p><p></p><p>"This time in the Eighteen Mountains beauty contest, that white fox Shang Yanran was ranked first. Why? This young lady should be the number one beauty!" said the goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>"Don't get excited," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was also afraid the goldfinch he was holding hands with might suddenly turn into a demon spawn the next second.</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch revealed a gentle smile: "You can fly, right? Take me flying around the Eighteen Mountains. This young lady wants to tell everyone loudly that I am the true number one beauty of the Eighteen Mountains!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless: "Goldfinch, your competitiveness is too severe."</p><p></p><p>"This isn't competitiveness, this is letting the truth be known to the world!"</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, your skin is thicker than mine."</p><p></p><p>"How so?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you think, if I carry you around like this, everyone here will think we're both crazy?</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it seems really stupid!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to refuse.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had always kept his distance from crazy people, and he didn't want to leave others with the impression of being crazy just to help the goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>His image to the world was that of a lone, proud swordsman!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl gege..." The goldfinch grabbed Qi Yuan's arm and acted coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately gave in: "No, no, no, I'll go, okay?"</p><p></p><p>After all, who could refuse a girl calling him "gege"?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At night, Qi Yuan returned to the place where he had been staying.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had taken the goldfinch flying all around the Eighteen Mountains.</p><p></p><p>He became a flying loudspeaker, proclaiming to the Eighteen Mountains that Miss Goldfinch was the true number one beauty.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who disagreed was beaten into submission by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan just wanted to stay here and not go down the mountain to see people.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the goldfinch was extremely smug, looking very pleased.</p><p></p><p>She even felt it wasn't enough and wanted to do another round.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, you saw the white fox Shang Yanran today, right? Isn't she inferior to this young lady?" The goldfinch looked at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>The image of that white fox Shang Yanran also floated in Qi Yuan's mind. Between the two women's appearances, the goldfinch was naturally superior.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the ordinary goldfinch, Qi Yuan also understood why the white fox was the number one beauty of the Eighteen Mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch glared at Qi Yuan: "...A lie."</p><p></p><p>"She's beautiful," Qi Yuan told the lie.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the goldfinch looked aggrieved: "The lie and the truth are both about her, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The truth is you."</p><p></p><p>"You're lying to me, saying one thing but meaning another."</p><p></p><p>"I never lie."</p><p></p><p>"You just lied!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Twenty years later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on a blue stone.</p><p></p><p>His Human-Demon Path had now broken through to 999,999.</p><p></p><p>Extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences in the sky, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Heart demons are born of heaven and earth, nurtured by one's nature, like a shadow following form."</p><p></p><p>"Tempted by power, disturbed by emotion, trapped by greed... all of these are sins."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt something in his heart, and his voice grew louder.</p><p></p><p>"If you see me through form, if you seek me through sound, you are on an evil path."</p><p></p><p>"See not the sun and moon, see not the stars, seek not immortals or demons, humans should conquer demons!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was vast, like spring thunder, like a dragon's roar, echoing through Mount Jiupan and beyond the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Wherever his voice passed, a strange fragrance dispersed, refreshing the mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>All the monsters and spirits who heard Qi Yuan's voice stood dumbfounded, their eyes showing contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Some monsters and spirits prostrated themselves, as if they had obtained a supreme dharma.</p><p></p><p>"Who... who is preaching?"</p><p></p><p>"Which great master!"</p><p></p><p>"Mount Jiupan, quick, go!"</p><p></p><p>"Such wonderful dharma, truly extraordinary, it seems related to heart demons!"</p><p></p><p>All the monsters were shocked, and even the humans who heard this voice were pleasantly surprised, all rushing towards Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>A day passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat like a deity, lotus flowers flowing from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Jiupan, flowers bloomed spontaneously, birds sang in chorus, and auspicious clouds brought blessings.</p><p></p><p>Countless animals, monsters, and spirits sat cross-legged at the foot of the mountain, and even some powerful human cultivators had come.</p><p></p><p>They sat quietly at the foot of the mountain, listening to the wonderful sounds.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes revealed shock and excitement, sometimes pondering, sometimes suddenly enlightened, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p></p><p>They were immersed in Qi Yuan's preaching.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Jiupan, withered trees sprouted buds, all things were in harmony, and all living beings looked at Qi Yuan with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Only the goldfinch tilted her head, just a few meters away from Qi Yuan, looking at him with pride.</p><p></p><p>PS: Only one update today, I'm taking a day off. There may not be an update tomorrow either, I sincerely apologize. There's a funeral in the family, sorry.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

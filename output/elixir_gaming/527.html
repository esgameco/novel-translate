        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a hundred breaths, Qi Yuan returned.</p><p></p><p>His blue robe was unstained by blood, but there were a few more storage talismans hanging on his waist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tu Sihai took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Although they had witnessed Qi Yuan effortlessly slaying Mo Sanxu, they still had doubts, wondering if that bizarre technique was a one-time thing.</p><p></p><p>Facing these more than ten Heaven-level Armored Soldiers, they had been "mocking" Qi Yuan all along, but the pressure was immense.</p><p></p><p>However, now, seeing Qi Yuan return, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi's strength is worthy of being... the tyrannical and reckless son-in-law!" Tu Sihai couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>The others also chimed in.</p><p></p><p>"The number one son-in-law of Ning Country, none other than Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Twelve Heaven-level Armored Soldiers..." The alluring young woman's gaze was filled with desire.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's such strength, she very much wanted to offer herself to him, but unfortunately, her interest was not reciprocated.</p><p></p><p>However, the blind old man then said, "Senior Qi, these Heaven-level Armored Soldiers... should be from the Luosha Country, and the leader's surname is Di, likely a member of the royal family."</p><p></p><p>The blind old man spoke with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The Luosha Country had once been the number one empire in the Azure Mountain Realm. </p><p></p><p>A century ago, the Luosha Country had experienced a calamity, and its national power had declined, but it was still among the top three countries in the Azure Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were even a few Deity-level Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>If the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers had transcended the mortal realm, then the Deity-level Armored Soldiers... would be true deities.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man had once had the honor of seeing a Deity-level Armored Soldier, who could carry mountains in their hands and walk on the vast oceans.</p><p></p><p>Any living being who witnessed this would kneel in reverence.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers was still within the blind old man's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But the Deity-level... it was beyond imagination. </p><p></p><p>They were not human, but gods! "The Luosha Country has Deity-level Armored Soldiers, and if the royal family learns of what happened here, I'm afraid..." The blind old man was somewhat fearful.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to tell Qi Yuan to clean up the place thoroughly, so that the Luosha Country wouldn't find out about the incident.</p><p></p><p>"You hit the nail on the head." Qi Yuan looked at the blind old man and nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>That was exactly what he wanted to hear.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I know that there are many people in this world who speak the truth through jest.</p><p></p><p>You don't need to be so cautious with me, the Luosha Country won't come to trouble me, in fact, I'll go trouble them." Qi Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>After the role of the son-in-law had come to an end, he would set out for the Luosha Country.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the Divine Wood Abyss was close to the Luosha Country; secondly, since he had played the role of the divine descendent, how could he not return to the Luosha Country, the place of his origin?</p><p></p><p>"Young master is a heavenly deity descended to the mortal realm, the insignificant Luosha Country is not worth mentioning!" Chen Kang Bao quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Confucian-robed scholar looked at Qi Yuan with a puzzled and bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan was truly enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's delve deeper and see what this so-called Heavenly Origin is." Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Since he had come this far, he might as well continue forward and see what this Heavenly Origin was.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar's spirit also suddenly tensed up.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see what the Heavenly Origin, forged with the blood and bones of three hundred thousand Armored Smiths, was.</p><p></p><p>Even if it did not receive the grace and gaze of the divine, it was the lifeblood of the senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai and the others did not object.</p><p></p><p>Objection was futile.</p><p></p><p>Although they were filled with trepidation and fear of encountering danger, they thought that if even the great figure Qi Yuan dared to go, how could they not?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked in the lead, stepping on the stairs and descending into the depths of the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they saw countless broken skeletons.</p><p></p><p>The deeper they went, the more pristine and white the bones became.</p><p></p><p>They also saw the remains of two Deity-level Armored Smiths.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Xuan Feng, and I have left behind a forging technique, engraved on this stele."</p><p></p><p>This was the text left behind by the body of a Deity-level Armored Smith. </p><p></p><p>This Deity-level Armored Smith did not leave behind many parting words, only recording the forging technique he had created, to prevent it from being lost.</p><p></p><p>The few present immediately committed the technique to memory.</p><p></p><p>This forging technique was more valuable than even Heaven-level talismans!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not stop them, and he also recorded the technique above.</p><p></p><p>To play the role of the blind Armored Smith, he needed to master more forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>During the Heavenly Firmament Anomaly, he had already mastered quite a few techniques, but it was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I can create my own forging technique." Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The blind Armored Smith had great ambitions, and even Deity-level Armored Smiths might not be his ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>To become a truly powerful Armored Smith, he not only needed to stand on the shoulders of giants, but also explore his own path.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since we've recorded it, let's continue forward, and be careful." Qi Yuan reminded them.</p><p></p><p>The ground was clean, with only skeletons and nothing else, but Qi Yuan's eyes could still see that there had been living beings here not long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Senior Qi." </p><p></p><p>The others responded and continued walking forward.</p><p></p><p>The deeper they went, the more forging furnaces they saw, with fragments of metal and stone casually piled up.</p><p></p><p>However, these once-precious items had now lost their spiritual essence, like mere dregs.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Origin... has absorbed the spiritual essence of so many treasures, and also the flesh and blood of three hundred thousand Armored Smiths, just how terrifying a thing is it?"</p><p></p><p>The deeper they went, the more the people present were filled with shock and terror at the Heavenly Origin.</p><p></p><p>Yet even with this, the Heavenly Origin had still failed, and the fragments of the Radiant Precious Treasure... was it really that difficult?</p><p></p><p>"Here, the elite Armored Smiths of the Azure Mountain Realm have gathered, yet they still failed.</p><p></p><p>Can anyone really forge the fragments of the Radiant Precious Treasure?" Tu Sihai sighed.</p><p></p><p>This was just the fragments. </p><p></p><p>The true Radiant Precious Treasure, what a terrifying existence would it be?</p><p></p><p>The group felt increasingly shocked the deeper they went.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they saw the fragments of many precious materials.</p><p></p><p>Only half of them could name them, the rest were unheard of.</p><p></p><p>These materials, in their complete state, would be worth a fortune, enough to forge divine talismans.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan's attention was drawn to the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Knife, I heard there is a strange domain that has appeared in Ning Country, and you are now in Ning Country. Could you do me a small favor and go to that strange domain?</p><p></p><p>If you help me, I'll immediately urge the people of the Thorny Blood to diligently cultivate, and when they arrive at the Divine Wood Abyss, I'll have a small gift for you."</p><p></p><p>The one who sent this message was, unsurprisingly, the staff member of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>"You should also diligently cultivate, don't just let them cultivate for you while you slack off." Qi Yuan advised, "What favor?"</p><p></p><p>"I've taken on a small task to record some things.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the events happening in the strange domain, I need some detailed intelligence on that." The Thorny Blood staff member quickly sent a message.</p><p></p><p>In the Virtual Pleasure Garden, he had received quite a few tasks.</p><p></p><p>Collecting information and data from the strange domain was one of them.</p><p></p><p>The one who issued that task was a being from this nascent universe.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be traveling through the realms, recording various histories, and writing a book.</p><p></p><p>"This?" Qi Yuan thought for a moment, and did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>Since the strange domain had already been exposed, it wouldn't be long before the information here spread throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>Concealing it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"In the strange domain, there are many skeletons, and the stone tablets also record the words left behind by some Deity-level Armored Smiths. They went to the strange domain, hiding their identities for decades, summoned by the Radiance Association to forge..." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan told the Thorny Blood staff member the information he had obtained from the strange domain.</p><p></p><p>As for the details about the son-in-law and the people from the Luosha Country, he naturally did not mention them.</p><p></p><p>"They failed?" The Thorny Blood staff member's tone was somewhat wistful, "This kind of strange domain, with the power of a small realm, can perhaps only build one, but the larger realms may have quite a few, even ten, though only two or three out of ten may succeed... that's not bad."</p><p></p><p>"There are other realms as well?" Qi Yuan noticed the key information.</p><p></p><p>"The Radiant Precious Treasure, how can it be forged by a single realm? Even the fragments, are beyond the reach of mere Deity-level Armored Smiths." The Thorny Blood staff member spoke with deep reverence when mentioning the Radiant Precious Treasure.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Mountain Peaks of Ning Country... actually had such an event happen?" Shi Wuyun sent a message, her voice in the real world filled with inexplicable sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood had been observing the Divine Wood Abyss, wanting to transform it into a Demonic Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Azure Mountain Realm, things were also not peaceful. Thirty thousand cultivators had gone into hiding and sacrificed themselves, wanting to bring a glimmer of light to the Azure Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the masses, the Azure Mountain Realm had only recently seen more Demonic Spirits, but there was no actual change.</p><p></p><p>But Shi Wuyun knew, the Azure Mountain Realm was already teetering on the brink, like a leaky hot air balloon.</p><p></p><p>"The waters here run deep, even if one reaches the Deity-level, they may only be qualified to know a little of the inside story. Brother Knife, I advise you not to get too involved, or else, I'm afraid you won't be able to come to the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The grand gift I prepared for you, I'm afraid I can't give it to you." The Thorny Blood staff member said.</p><p></p><p>"What is the relationship between the Radiance Association and the Thorny Blood?" Qi Yuan thought of something and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"They should be considered adversaries. They both believe that they are the ones saving the world." The Thorny Blood staff member chuckled.</p><p></p><p>They were all cultivators, each with their own ideas and beliefs, and they couldn't convince each other.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Thorny Blood, their doctrine was that transforming into Demonic Spirits was a unique form of continuation.</p><p></p><p>But who among the common people would willingly become a Demonic Spirit without reason or their own thoughts?</p><p></p><p>"In the strange domain, there should be the Heavenly Origin. Since they failed, I should..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This celestial origin... I estimate it only has some collection value left. If you can bring the celestial origin to me, I can help you escape from the Qingshan Realm... even this chaotic star domain in ruins," the employee of the Thorns of Blood tempted.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the fate of the Qingshan Realm had already been determined. The Divine Tree would eventually transform into a powerful demonic spirit, and this world would collapse thunderously in the silent night. No one would notice that the opening of the Shenmu Abyss was the opening of the gates of demons.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm playing a game, I don't want to go offline."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exited the Shenmu Token, his thoughts calm.</p><p></p><p>The background of this game was becoming increasingly complex.</p><p></p><p>The Thorns of Blood wanted to transform living beings into demonic spirits - it was clear they were the villain.</p><p></p><p>The Glorious Assembly was organizing 300,000 artifact cultivators to refine divine treasures, which seemed quite extreme. For now, they could be considered the radical righteous faction, but it remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of righteous or villainous, to Qi Yuan they were all NPCs. If they were old, didn't like to bathe, perhaps they could even be promoted to his "white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>The group slowly explored the depths of the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>The further they went, the heavier the hearts of the people became, and they also felt immense pressure. No one dared to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>In front of the underground palace, there was a corpse and a figure.</p><p></p><p>The few present stopped in their tracks, their expressions grave.</p><p></p><p>The corpse on the ground also seemed to be at the celestial level.</p><p></p><p>The standing figure was like a servant, with a strange aura.</p><p></p><p>That figure suddenly turned its head, and when its gaze fell on Qi Yuan, a strange expression flashed in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"Fang Shisan?" Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>The figure in front of him was exactly the same as Fang Shisan of the Glorious Assembly.</p><p></p><p>And the information he was receiving about this person... also counted as Fang Shisan.</p><p></p><p>But wasn't Fang Shisan... dead by suicide?</p><p></p><p>Back in the dungeon, Fang Shisan had committed suicide in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly... you were able to come this far. Could it be... that you are also favored by this realm?" Fang Shisan's face showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"Are you perhaps a respawning NPC?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He had played games for so long, but such NPCs were rare. There were many on the Blue Star, but after coming to the Canglan Realm, he hadn't encountered any.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan's face showed some confusion, not understanding Qi Yuan's words, but he roughly grasped the meaning and said proudly, "Don't you want to know why I'm still alive? Aren't you curious?"</p><p></p><p>In this world, the ultimate pursuits of all living beings were power, wealth, and immortality.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some "lowly men" had even more desires.</p><p></p><p>To be resurrected from death was enough to shock and captivate all living beings. Otherwise, why would so many emperors on the Blue Star seek eternal life?</p><p></p><p>"No need to be curious, it's not that hard to understand. Either you have a respawn point, or... you're a clone," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had played so many games and seen so many anime, so he was no longer surprised by these things.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>So calm?</p><p></p><p>In the past, in the Qingshan Realm, whenever he died in front of certain people and reappeared, their expressions were quite amusing - shocked, terrified, as if they were seeing a ghost.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was very calm, making Fang Shisan doubt if he had mistaken the person.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have a desire for such abilities?" Fang Shisan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>The ability to resurrect from death was enough to drive everyone mad.</p><p></p><p>"I do, but... I want to rely on myself," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan's resurrection was definitely not through his own power.</p><p></p><p>Translated to the game, it was just like a programmer had written a program to constantly refresh him.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were to do it, he would want to be the boss of the programmer, not the code.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan fell silent, then sneered, "What a big mouth!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding celestial-level guards who overheard the conversation were somewhat bewildered, and some seemed to have understood the gist of it, their expressions horrified.</p><p></p><p>He added, "You didn't inherit any of your father's humility."</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan said this with a hint of disappointment in his expression.</p><p></p><p>He had known Qi Yuan's father when the latter came to the Qi Domain, and it was through him that Qi Yuan's father was introduced.</p><p></p><p>"Did you come here just to spout this nonsense?" Qi Yuan really wanted to find a mouthpiece to help him curse.</p><p></p><p>Although he and that Holy Light Clan Saint argued every day in the Tiankun Qi Realm, due to his poor eloquence, he could never say things like "You're just deliberately saying controversial things and then putting your phone on vibrate and putting it in your butt crack" - the kind of sharp-tongued remarks common on forums.</p><p></p><p>Even if he copied them, his socially anxious self wouldn't dare say them out loud.</p><p></p><p>"I just came to confirm one more time whether I failed... to see where the loophole is." Fang Shisan said, the light in his eyes dimming.</p><p></p><p>He was dead.</p><p></p><p>Since he had failed, the value of this celestial origin was lost.</p><p></p><p>If it had value, it would be at most a trace of collector's value.</p><p></p><p>Not many would care about a failed celestial origin.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan's corpse fell to the ground, next to the other corpse.</p><p></p><p>The two corpses seemed to have been completely drained of their spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>Tufourhai and the Confucian scholar robed man, seeing this strange scene, felt a sense of fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan had a thoughtful expression: "If his resurrection doesn't consume energy and resources, wouldn't I have discovered an infinite resource?"</p><p></p><p>Killing Fang Shisan once would give him a corpse.</p><p></p><p>The others were somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's eyes widened, his breathing rapid, then he seemed to have thought of something and lamented, "Why isn't Fang Shisan a bun!"</p><p></p><p>If he were a bun, wouldn't Qi Yuan have an endless supply of buns to eat?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "My strategist, you have awakened the dreaming man. Why isn't Fang Shisan my 'white moonlight'!"</p><p></p><p>If he had such a 'white moonlight', Qi Yuan wouldn't get tired of riding it every day.</p><p></p><p>Hearing their conversation, the fear that had arisen in the hearts of the people present vanished at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"They should have died from the celestial origin." Tufourhai said solemnly at this time, "Where is the celestial origin?"</p><p></p><p>He looked around, but did not see any trace of the celestial origin.</p><p></p><p>They had already reached the deepest part of the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the two corpses, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another message came through the Shenmu Token.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial origin is formless and shapeless, it can only be carried by the Shenmu Token."</p><p></p><p>The message was sent by the employee of the Thorns of Blood.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan inexplicably felt a sense of death, decay, and decline.</p><p></p><p>He looked up and saw a withered leaf falling, like a ginkgo leaf, yellow in color.</p><p></p><p>This leaf floated down and landed in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>【The celestial origin, the bearer of the Mandate, the transformation into the Divine Enlightenment Light failed... there are several loopholes... according to... it can be repaired, reversed... to enlighten the people.】</p><p></p><p>A massive amount of information flooded into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, his body felt a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the information was too much, and his physical body could not immediately receive so much information.</p><p></p><p>"This celestial origin can still be repaired?" Qi Yuan's mood was good.</p><p></p><p>A failed celestial origin, with only collector's value, not even worth an ordinary celestial artifact.</p><p></p><p>But if it could be repaired, or even refined into fragments of divine treasures, then... it would be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Tiankun Qi Realm, Qi Yuan had also heard about divine treasures.</p><p></p><p>These treasures seemed to be even more powerful and terrifying than attack-type Tribulation Artifacts.</p><p></p><p>He knew that in the Immortal Realm's Sixth Heaven, he had worked hard for so long to create just a single Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Emperor's Banner, along with the supreme principles and his own diligent efforts, he was able to sweep through the Immortal Realm's Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>If he obtained a divine treasure, how much would his combat power increase? Facing the mysterious and unfathomable Unique Palace, he might even have a chance to fight.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the celestial origin, his expression joyful.</p><p></p><p>This withered yellow leaf was imprinted on the palm of his hand, leaving only a faint trace, and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding guards, including Chen Kangbao and the others, had not seen this withered yellow leaf at all.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the treasure hunt is over, we should leave now."</p><p></p><p>The others heard this and felt somewhat disappointed, because they had not seen the legendary celestial origin.</p><p></p><p>But since Qi Yuan wanted to leave, they dared not stay any longer, for fear of encountering a celestial-level guard, which could lead to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>They came quickly and left quickly as well.</p><p></p><p>When the last figure disappeared from the Qi Domain, the underground palace that had existed for less than a hundred years collapsed thunderously, turning into dust, as if it had never existed.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholar robed man had a melancholic expression, finally letting out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The 300,000 artifact cultivators, and the elder brother... and the celestial origin were all buried in the annals of history.</p><p></p><p>Unknown whether in a thousand years, there would still be someone who knew of this Qi Domain?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 431</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan descended in a blood-red robe, stunningly handsome.</p><p></p><p>His appearance moved Jiang Ruhua. </p><p></p><p>How had she never noticed before how incredibly good-looking he was?</p><p></p><p>"With Senior here, the Jiang family will never be poor!" Jiang Ruhua said without blushing.</p><p></p><p>However, remembering how he had once frantically pursued the Blood-Robed Sword God senior made her face feel a bit hot.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately the Blood-Robed Sword God senior didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he had casually released his aura back then, Qi Yuan probably would have been finished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze swept over the area.</p><p></p><p>This once ordinary city used to barely have any Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Now, with a simple scan, he detected over ten Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"You all staying in the underworld are, to some extent, being kept by me. Thank you for your hard work."</p><p></p><p>Back then, these people were kept by the Great Calamity, their lives in its hands.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Great Calamity fallen, the threat of Tai Huang Palace still remained.</p><p></p><p>These people could not leave the Cang Lan Realm or ascend to the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the owner of the pasture had simply changed to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Kept? I'm living just fine in the Cang Lan Realm!" Jiang Ruhua said without thinking.</p><p></p><p>After all, for a Divine Infant True Lord like him, living in the Cang Lan Realm now was no different from before.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Yin Gods' expressions all changed at Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Senior has shown us life-saving grace. How could we dare to complain?"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods were all scared, worried that Qi Yuan was implying something.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Is this the legendary "accompanying a ruler is like accompanying a tiger"?</p><p></p><p>He had spoken casually, but these people were all carefully speculating about his meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Senior's will is the will of the Cang Lan Realm, and our will as well."</p><p></p><p>The Yin God Venerable said respectfully, just short of carving the word "loyal" on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be like that. I'm very democratic, and I have no ambition to be an autocratic emperor. </p><p></p><p>After all, being emperor is exhausting. You can't even go to brothels to listen to music. It's not suitable for someone socially anxious like me."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's current strength, if he could return to the Blue Star, becoming a chieftain or even emperor wouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>But if asked to be one, he wouldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't want to "help the poor". On Blue Star, he had never even won an online flame war.</p><p></p><p>Seeing "brothers" driving Range Rovers would make him die of anger.</p><p></p><p>The Yin God Venerables present looked at each other, bewildered by this scene.</p><p></p><p>They carefully pondered Qi Yuan's words, but found them difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Blood-Robed Sword God's personality and character, these Yin God Venerables had thoroughly discussed it in private recently.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was the lord of Cang Lan, a mountain looming over their heads.</p><p></p><p>But despite discussing it until their saliva flew, they couldn't come to any conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Because they reached a terrifying realization.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword God behaved strangely...</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be... something wrong with his mind! But... how could a cultivator at the Yang God realm possibly have mental issues or be crazy? After all, for such a great figure, even farting would have deep meaning and be part of some grand scheme.</p><p></p><p>So they reached the best conclusion - to flatter and please him, and respond according to the "crazy" image the Blood-Robed Sword God had created.</p><p></p><p>"Emperors are autocratic... oppressing the people. They can't be mentioned in the same breath as Senior!" The sect leader of the Dao-Seeking Palace immediately flattered.</p><p></p><p>"Right, how could the word 'emperor' be worthy of describing Senior."</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Gods continued to flatter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt elated hearing this.</p><p></p><p>No wonder ancient emperors liked sycophants. These words really sounded good.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, that's a bit of an exaggeration. All people are equal. How could emperors not be worthy of comparison with me?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, the atmosphere in the Cang Lan Realm still needs improvement. Everyone should get along harmoniously!" Qi Yuan said seriously. "Otherwise hearing vulgar language every day affects my mood."</p><p></p><p>"As you command!"</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Gods hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>As for what Qi Yuan had said earlier about democracy and not being autocratic, they pretended not to have heard it.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't rectifying the cultivation world's atmosphere autocratic?...</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon Abyss has seven divisions. The area I'm in is the Purple Affinity Division." Cow Horn Sister wore a purple robe, her figure tall and straight, her smile unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Qi Yuan from the Demon Abyss, she brought him towards the headquarters of the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Each division has at least one Great Ultimate Principle cultivator... Is your Black Demon Abyss that strong?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the Moon God Palace only had two Great Ultimate Principle cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Tai Huang Palace seemed to only have three.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Demon Abyss had at least seven. How could he not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, besides the Ultimate Principle Assembly, in the Six Heavens Realm, our Black Demon Abyss has the most Yang Gods at the Great Ultimate Principle level - a full nine of them!" Purple Affinity Daxue puffed out her chest proudly as she mentioned this.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, isn't the Black Demon Abyss even stronger than Tai Huang Palace?</p><p></p><p>Why don't you find someone to help me destroy Tai Huang Palace? Otherwise, I'm under a lot of pressure and can't sleep at night." Qi Yuan blinked, his eyes full of stars.</p><p></p><p>Clinging to the powerful and living off others really was nice.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Purple Affinity Daxue looked a bit embarrassed. "Those old ancestors of the Black Demon Abyss aren't your real father. Why should they help you?"</p><p></p><p>In reality, although the Black Demon Abyss had more Great Ultimate Principle cultivators, in terms of strength they were somewhat weaker than Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>That person in Tai Huang Palace had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>The nine elders of the Black Demon Abyss, though at the Great Ultimate Principle level, were no match for that person who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>The level of principle comprehended was related to combat strength.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Great Ultimate Principle powerhouses, though there were differences in the level of principles they comprehended and their combat strength, the gap wasn't obvious.</p><p></p><p>Although they could defeat opponents, they couldn't annihilate them!</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens Realm, the Great Ultimate Principle was already the peak.</p><p></p><p>Immortal and indestructible, with indestructible physical bodies and divine souls.</p><p></p><p>Even if stars collapsed, their bodies would not be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even commit suicide.</p><p></p><p>Even powerhouses of the same level wielding miraculous treasures of creation could only defeat or suppress them, not annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Great Ultimate Principle powerhouses who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Principle could break this rule and kill Yang Gods at the Great Ultimate Principle level!</p><p></p><p>"If I became their father, would they help me?" Qi Yuan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Purple Affinity Daxue couldn't hold back anymore, looking a bit scared: "You're really bold, daring to say such things. Aren't you afraid... the old ancestors will hear? This is already Black Demon Abyss territory!"</p><p></p><p>"Anything is possible. What if... I really am their father?" Qi Yuan laughed.</p><p></p><p>In this world, anything can happen.</p><p></p><p>For example, me being the father of the Black Demon Abyss ancestors is one of countless possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Purple Affinity Daxue looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze complex: "How long have you been sick?"</p><p></p><p>At first, she had thought Qi Yuan's personality was unique and interesting.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for geniuses with powerful bloodlines to have some quirks.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed this wasn't uniqueness, but illness!</p><p></p><p>"What illness? How did you know I have poverty sickness? What, are you going to be my sugar momma?" Qi Yuan fired off three questions in a row, blinking his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm about to become a Yang God who reflects all heavens. Being your sugar momma</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Supporting you... that's no big deal," Purple Origin Great Snow said boldly.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of Qi Yuan considering the one from Tai Huang Palace as a great enemy, she added:</p><p></p><p>"But sister would rather be your concubine." Purple Origin Great Snow said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>"You're beautiful, and your thoughts are beautiful too!" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"You fool, you don't really think you defeated that one from Tai Huang Palace, do you? Besides, I'm about to become a Yang Spirit. This is a Yang Spirit, a Yang Spirit willing to be your concubine and warm your bed. You're still not satisfied? What's your cultivation level?" Purple Origin Great Snow said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was rendered speechless by these words, and felt quite ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"I am... Purple Mansion stage."</p><p></p><p>He answered dejectedly. </p><p></p><p>That's right, he was only at Purple Mansion stage.</p><p></p><p>The number one Purple Mansion cultivator of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>This title sounded impressive and allowed him to do as he pleased in the Hundred Countries region, even sleeping with princesses, empresses, empress dowagers and even emperors at will.</p><p></p><p>But in the Upper Realm, it seemed rather weak.</p><p></p><p>"No, what's the point of pretending to be weak? Your true cultivation level is only Great Venerable, isn't it?" Purple Origin Great Snow cursed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt even more ashamed.</p><p></p><p>He displayed the strength of a Great Venerable outwardly in order to move about easily in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Originally he also wanted to enjoy superior treatment.</p><p></p><p>As a result, even a Great Venerable was humiliated.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was only at Purple Mansion stage and didn't even have the confidence to refute.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he sighed helplessly: "Sigh, the atmosphere in the cultivation world is too bad. Everyone is supposed to be equal, how can you discriminate against me as a Purple Mansion cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Unable to compete in terms of cultivation level, Qi Yuan could only find fault on moral grounds.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to talk to you anymore." Purple Origin Great Snow was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>She could only bully Blood Robe a little now.</p><p></p><p>With Blood Robe's bloodline talent, he would definitely receive better treatment than her once he entered the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he might become a Great Principle in the future, or even... higher.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we've arrived at Purple Origin Heaven. Let's go, don't talk carelessly. If the ancestors sense it, there will be trouble!" Purple Origin Great Snow said softly as her figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the sky of Purple Origin Heaven, two pairs of eyes were observing Purple Origin Great Snow and Qi Yuan through countless spaces.</p><p></p><p>"Old Six, is this the new seedling you recruited? He looks quite ordinary."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was the Third Elder, one of the Nine Elders of the Black Magic Abyss. His entire body was shrouded in darkness, with only a pair of eyes visible.</p><p></p><p>Within the darkness, there seemed to be the Great Dao flowing and Ultimate Principles inscribed, causing anyone who looked to fall in and be unable to... gaze directly.</p><p></p><p>"His bloodline is not ordinary. His upper limit... reaches our level, and he can become a Great Principle." Purple Origin Ancestor spoke, with a proud look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Great Principle..." Third Elder's gaze was profound. "Indeed a good seedling."</p><p></p><p>This kind of bloodline was already top-tier in the Black Magic Abyss, enough to make the Black Magic Ancestor's blood boil.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, destiny seems to be favoring our Black Magic Abyss." Purple Origin Ancestor's eyes showed an expression of amazement. "In the main lineage, Black Sword's... bloodline is too exaggerated."</p><p></p><p>"He is the Master's painstaking effort, our Black Magic Abyss's reliance against Lin Ya Tui...!" Third Elder's expression became serious when mentioning this.</p><p></p><p>His master was the First Elder among the Seven Elders of the Black Magic Abyss, and also the number one figure in Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ya Tui..." Mentioning this, Old Six's expression changed several times. "Even powers as strong as Tai Huang Palace and Moon God Palace cannot fully resist Lin Ya Tui. Black Sword... can he do it?"</p><p></p><p>"At least if he comprehends the Supreme Principle, we will have some confidence when facing Lin Ya Tui, won't we?" Third Elder said, his voice very wistful. "The Principle Discourse Assembly is about to begin, and Black Sword will attend. </p><p></p><p>Before that, the eight of us should gather to help shape Black Sword's blood and raise his enlightenment, to assist him in comprehending the Supreme Principle as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Old Six nodded: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Shaping blood and raising enlightenment required refining a kind of pill, which consumed a certain amount of vitality even for beings like them.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was to create a Great Principle who comprehended the Supreme Principle. This kind of sacrifice had to be made.</p><p></p><p>"The seedling you've taken a fancy to is not bad either. If there are any remnants left from the pills we refine, we can give them to him.</p><p></p><p>When he becomes a Great Principle in the future, he can serve Black Sword like us and receive Black Sword's protection." Third Elder said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Purple Origin Ancestor became somewhat unwilling: "Blood Robe is after all the demon son of our Purple Origin Heaven. Why should he eat remnants? No way, he must receive the same treatment as Black Sword. His innate talent limit is also Great Principle, why should there be such a big difference?"</p><p></p><p>"There are differences even among Great Principles." Old Three said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"He must have the same treatment. Remnants are not acceptable, otherwise I won't refine this pill!</p><p></p><p>At most... I'll give up my share of the ten thousand year old Black Magic Ancestor blood!" Old Six shouted, without any of the dignity of a Great Principle Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Old Three looked at Purple Origin Ancestor a few more times, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Ancestor blood was extremely precious to beings like them.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat suspicious and asked with a solemn expression: "Old Six, tell me honestly, is his bloodline upper limit... not just an ordinary Great Principle?"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could the usually stingy Old Six give up his ten thousand year share of Black Magic Ancestor blood?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, he's just an ordinary Great Principle, far inferior to Black Sword." Old Six chuckled, with a lecherous smile.</p><p></p><p>Third Elder narrowed his eyes, and the aura on his body suddenly changed, becoming even more profound.</p><p></p><p>His gaze penetrated through the sky and fell on Qi Yuan in Purple Origin Heaven, as if wanting to see through Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Origin Heaven is your domain, I can't see anything.</p><p></p><p>When he comes out of Purple Origin Heaven, his aura will definitely be concealed by you. Sigh..." Old Three was somewhat unwilling. "It seems you really picked up a treasure, probably... only slightly inferior to Black Sword."</p><p></p><p>"He is inferior to Black Sword." Purple Origin Ancestor said, seeming somewhat slow.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're still not satisfied that he's only slightly inferior to Black Sword? He surpasses our Nine Elders, and even in the Sixth Heaven his talent would rank in the top ten." Old Three's eyes lit up when mentioning this.</p><p></p><p>How many Great Principles who have comprehended the Supreme Principle are there in the Sixth Heaven?</p><p></p><p>Third Elder's expression became solemn: "Indeed... this matter cannot be leaked out, otherwise... if our Black Magic Abyss produces two Great Principles who comprehend the Supreme Principle...</p><p></p><p>You did well to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>With news of Black Sword spreading, many eyes have already fallen on our Black Magic Abyss. If Blood Robe...</p><p></p><p>It's good that I'm in charge of this blood shaping and enlightenment raising. I'll secretly keep one-third for him. Don't tell anyone about this, and I'll keep your share of the Black Magic Ancestor blood for you."</p><p></p><p>"One-third is too little!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Black Sword's talent should be number one in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe, no matter how strong, is probably only at the level of that one from Shenluotian. How can he compare?</p><p></p><p>Unless you have him challenge Black Sword. If he wins, I'll secretly keep two-thirds for him, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>"You..." Purple Origin Ancestor was angry. "He's only a Great Venerable challenging a Yang Spirit, do you have any shame?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter is settled!" After Third Elder finished speaking, his figure dissipated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Outside the sky, only a black shadow remained.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a glint flashed in the depths of Purple Origin Ancestor's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Number one in the Sixth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Three, you really should open your eyes and look at the whole world."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

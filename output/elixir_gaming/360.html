        <h1>Chapter 360</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's silhouette gradually solidified into a tangible form.</p><p></p><p>Having completed the mission, he returned once again to the base.</p><p></p><p>"The mission reward is rather ordinary," he said.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blood-red pill, Qi Yuan was listless. </p><p></p><p>Even mosquito meat is still meat, so he swallowed the pill anyway.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of his residence and looked around. The base was now ten times larger than before.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Qi Yuan had completed many missions, and the base in the world of death energy had grown much larger.</p><p></p><p>Many bases had merged.</p><p></p><p>The originally small bases had become one large base.</p><p></p><p>The large base was powerful, with many strong individuals. Even the rare Martial Kings were not uncommon here.</p><p></p><p>There was even a branch of the Genius Alliance here.</p><p></p><p>"This time was alright, I can send some more grandpas and grandmas out again," he said.</p><p></p><p>This mission world could be said to be the largest Qi Yuan had experienced.</p><p></p><p>He had slain the demons of an entire realm and entered the realm of Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>His body had also absorbed many new bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>He could send grandpa and grandma out.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Wu Shi's divine infant still can't be sent out," he sighed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his moments with the Holy Mother of No Food, Qi Yuan was quite emotional. </p><p></p><p>Between the two of them, feelings were as light as water, but there was still a deep connection.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the devouring prototype the Holy Mother of No Food gave him had been very helpful.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have reached the Martial Lord realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"When you wake up, I'll treat you to fish," Qi Yuan murmured. </p><p></p><p>His memories seemed to traverse time and space, returning to his first meeting with Wu Shi.</p><p></p><p>The frail young girl was exceptionally true to her word.</p><p></p><p>Casting these reflections aside, Qi Yuan headed towards the blood jade wall.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter hour later, Qi Yuan opened his eyes, with a hint of disappointment deep in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>This time he had again sent many grandpas and grandmas to the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mother of No Food's divine infant still lay quietly within Qi Yuan's body, quite peaceful.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Shi? Want to see some underwear?" Qi Yuan teased.</p><p></p><p>But the divine infant had no reaction, remaining quiet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly a young man dressed in white walked directly up to Qi Yuan. Judging by his attire, he was from the Genius Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This person was also very familiar to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After the bases merged, this Genius Alliance member had invited Qi Yuan to join the Genius Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan had declined.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no interest in joining the Genius Alliance and flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, some distinguished guests arrived at the base a few days ago. These guests would like to meet with you," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what do they want to see me for?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't something important, he was planning to leave.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't seen Golden Canary in a while and missed her dearly.</p><p></p><p>"I heard it's related to the Origin Land," the Genius Alliance member said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Well then, I can go take a look. Lead the way," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a private room at a restaurant, smoke curled through the air.</p><p></p><p>Three peak Martial Kings sat in their seats, chatting and laughing, exuding the aura of those in high positions.</p><p></p><p>Behind each of them stood two peak Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>However, these standing peak Martial Kings had the appearance of servants.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they would discover they were ancient martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Blood martial artists are divided into new martial artists and ancient martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Because those who practice ancient martial arts enter the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, their cultivation realm is lowered by one level.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's power, the more difficult the missions they need to complete, and the danger increases exponentially.</p><p></p><p>For those whose realm is lowered by one level, even encountering some slightly difficult missions could mean a dead end for them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many martial artists who practice ancient martial arts choose to attach themselves to new martial artists, signing blood martial contracts to become servants.</p><p></p><p>This way, their missions will be synchronized, and the new martial artists will protect the ancient martial artists.</p><p></p><p>So, even though these ancient martial artists have become peak Martial Kings and are quite old, they still attach themselves to new martial artists in order to survive.</p><p></p><p>This is the cruelty of the world - without attachment, they will die!</p><p></p><p>After all, when they enter the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, it's equivalent to a divine infant cultivator facing an opponent at the purple mansion level.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the main seat was a middle-aged man wearing casual clothes, looking just like an unremarkable martial artist.</p><p></p><p>However, no one present dared to underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Because he was Mu Yan, a Sword Bearer from the Genius Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The Genius Alliance has a total of 36 Sword Bearers, each with the record of slaying a peak Martial King.</p><p></p><p>"The number one person in this base, named Qi Yuan, is quite interesting," Mu Yan spoke, his voice rough, contrasting with his name and appearance.</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard of this person. Every time he completes a mission, he abducts the mission target and slaughters all the demons in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas before finishing the task.</p><p></p><p>Many people hope to encounter him and team up with him," a woman chuckled. "It seems he's someone who hates demons with a passion."</p><p></p><p>This woman had a peculiar appearance, with two heads - one human face and one monkey face.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, she had grafted demon bloodlines, becoming a hybrid.</p><p></p><p>Such people were not uncommon in the base.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to slaughter the demons of an entire realm, he must be a peak Martial King. He barely qualifies to enter the Origin Land with us," said another short man.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity he doesn't have a Martial Lord imprint. Even if he luckily enters the Origin Land this time, he can only become cannon fodder," the woman sighed.</p><p></p><p>For people like them, strength was no longer important; what mattered was the Martial Lord imprint.</p><p></p><p>Martial Lord imprints are extremely precious and difficult to obtain, with strict conditions.</p><p></p><p>First, the bloodline ancestor must still be alive.</p><p></p><p>Second, the bloodline concentration must be extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Third, one must have strong martial talent.</p><p></p><p>Only when all three conditions are met will a Martial Lord from the Origin Land take notice and bestow a Martial Lord imprint.</p><p></p><p>Martial Lord imprints cannot be transferred or seized.</p><p></p><p>With a Martial Lord imprint, upon entering the Origin Land, one can consume ancestral blood and break through to the Martial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>All three peak Martial Kings present had Martial Lord imprints. So once they enter the Origin Land, they can step into the legendary Martial Lord realm and become second-generation bloodline ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was normal for them to be a bit arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Although he doesn't have a Martial Lord imprint, his combat power is astonishing. He's a good blade," Mu Yan commented.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity. Such a good blade is usually too rigid and unwilling to sign a blood martial contract," the woman said, with a hint of regret in her voice.</p><p></p><p>New martial artists generally don't want to acknowledge a master.</p><p></p><p>"You rascal, collecting slaves in reality is one thing, but you've brought that habit here?" Mu Yan couldn't help but scold.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I haven't been to reality for a long time. I heard you can collect slaves online now," the woman laughed, looking regretful.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's power, the greater the restrictions the base places on them, making it almost impossible to return to reality.</p><p></p><p>Just then, there was a knock on the door, and the three people in the room stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Mu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open, and the Genius Alliance member led Qi Yuan in.</p><p></p><p>Several gazes fell on Qi Yuan like hawks eyeing their prey.</p><p></p><p>Being scrutinized by these peak Martial Kings, Qi Yuan appeared very calm and relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"This is Mr. Qi Yuan. Indeed a talented individual with an extraordinary bearing," Mu Yan spoke, his voice very polite.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very busy right now, in a hurry to see my wife. What's the matter?" Qi Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Skip the greetings and opening remarks, just tell me what you want from me," said Qi Yuan, who was always efficient and to the point. No need for pleasantries that waste time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a coquettish smile flashed in the woman's eyes, and a lewd grin appeared on her monkey-like face: "I like slaves like this. Sometimes when slaves resist a little, it's more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan paused briefly, then smiled and got straight to the point: "We've come this time to invite you, Mr. Qi Yuan, to enter the Origin Land with us. Are you interested in entering the Origin Land?"</p><p></p><p>Having reached the Martial King realm, he had gradually come to understand the truth of the world and knew something about the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>"I'm interested. How do we enter, and when?" asked Qi Yuan. </p><p></p><p>He felt that to complete the task of becoming a Spiritual Martial Lord, he would need to enter the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>"The exact timing is unknown - it could be as soon as three days or as long as a hundred years. However, to enter the Origin Land, we must cross... the Black Sea. The Black Sea is fraught with dangers, with monsters formed by various rules of heaven and earth. Even Martial Kings may perish if they go. Do you have the courage to go?" asked Mu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the Origin Land was attractive to martial artists, especially those with the Martial Lord imprint. But for ordinary martial artists, the attraction was limited. Especially since they had to cross the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>Outside all the strongholds was the Black Sea. The giant beasts in the Black Sea often swallowed up strongholds. All martial artists kept their distance from the Black Sea out of respect. Because the rules in the Black Sea often changed, even Martial Kings had a chance of perishing there.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, alright. Call me when you go. Here, let's exchange contact information so you can reach me anytime," said Qi Yuan, taking out the stronghold's unique communication device.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! Brother Qi Yuan is indeed courageous!" Seeing Qi Yuan agree, Mu Yan's form of address changed from "sir" to "brother". </p><p></p><p>With one more peak Martial King, their chances of crossing the Black Sea increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he also added Qi Yuan's contact information.</p><p></p><p>"Since there's nothing else, I'll be taking my leave. Goodbye everyone, bye-bye," said Qi Yuan politely, saying "bye-bye" as he left.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan smiled: "Looking forward to our next meeting."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the monkey-faced woman spoke up in a coquettish voice: "I hear Brother Qi Yuan has been looking for a wife for a good friend. Do you think this little lady would be suitable?"</p><p></p><p>The monkey-faced woman batted her eyelashes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Not suitable," Qi Yuan shook his head. </p><p></p><p>This woman was too hairy. You could see the hair without her even taking off her clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Am I not wow enough?" The monkey-faced woman blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had heard that this Qi Yuan from the stronghold was always looking for a "wow" wife for his good friend.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the monkey-faced woman's monkey face and her hairy body: "You're a bit too wow."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Grasping her jade feet as tender as white lotus roots, his hand moving up along the patterned silk stockings, Qi Yuan's expression was quite calm, with a hint of doting in the depths of his eyes. Brushing away the black hair hanging over her chest, he leaned in close.</p><p></p><p>Jinsi Niao closed her eyes and hugged Qi Yuan tightly, releasing years of longing.</p><p></p><p>When the early morning sun rose, Jinsi Niao's watery eyes held a trace of grievance: "How did you get so much stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embraced Jinsi Niao, his expression calm: "Could it be because my Explosive Bird-Killing Fist broke through your defenses?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, I'll bite you to death!" Jinsi Niao bit down hard on Qi Yuan's shoulder, leaving a neat row of teeth marks.</p><p></p><p>"What interesting things have happened in the mortal world these years?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Just some uninteresting things," said Jinsi Niao.</p><p></p><p>Without Qi Yuan, this colorful world seemed boring, not as fun as the Golden Core of the Fixed Star.</p><p></p><p>"If you're talking about major events, there have been some, but they're just small matters to us. In recent years, the Three Realms Alliance launched an invasion of the Ancient Witchcraft Country to expand their recruitment, which led to a war between Qin Yuan and Ancient Witchcraft. With cultivators from the Three Realms Alliance, the Ancient Witchcraft Country has been retreating steadily."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Witchcraft and Qin Yuan had deep-seated grudges. Now, with cultivators from the Three Realms Alliance present, war was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, they're fighting?" Qi Yuan wasn't interested in these things.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Seventh Prince once told Zero One that the real reason for starting the war was the discovery of a relic site on the border of the Ancient Witchcraft Country. This relic site... has a deep connection to the Eye in the Sky," said Jinsi Niao.</p><p></p><p>The technological level of Qin Yuan and the Ancient Witchcraft Country was lower than that of Canxing. If Canxing couldn't produce weapons like the Eye in the Sky, how could Qin Yuan? </p><p></p><p>This weapon that could destroy Purple Mansion realm cultivators was actually an advanced weapon that Qin Yuan and the Ancient Witchcraft Country had accidentally excavated. The source of this weapon was suspected to be extraterrestrial.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the discovery of an alien relic site, neither Qin Yuan nor the Three Realms cultivators could sit still. What if they excavated a weapon even more powerful than the Eye in the Sky?</p><p></p><p>"Let them fight as they please, as long as it doesn't affect my martial arts tournament," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't interested in these things.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Ancient Witchcraft Country is already seeking help from Canxing. There might be an interplanetary war at any time," said Jinsi Niao. "But Qin Yuan plus the Three Realms cultivators should be able to resist Canxing without much problem, unless Canxing has outside help."</p><p></p><p>Jinsi Niao's gaze deepened as she recalled the aura of the Myriad Beasts Realm she had once sensed. If the Myriad Beasts Realm colluded with Canxing, the current Qin Yuan would indeed find it difficult to resist.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, it has nothing to do with us. For ordinary people, isn't it just changing the master above their heads?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>It was just a game, he didn't care much.</p><p></p><p>"What if Canxing occupies Gongxing and wants to stop the martial arts tournament?" Jinsi Niao giggled, her slender arms wrapping around Qi Yuan's waist.</p><p></p><p>But her body was so small, she looked like a doll hanging onto Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible!" Qi Yuan said seriously, "If they dare to stop the martial arts tournament, I'll casually crush the nearest planet to them to show them!"</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few planets near Canxing, but they had no signs of life.</p><p></p><p>According to Jinsi Niao, this universe was about the size of a solar system. She couldn't explore beyond the edges.</p><p></p><p>"You can crush planets now?" Jinsi Niao blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jinsi Niao could destroy all life on a planet, but crushing a planet was just a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I was just boasting. If it really comes to that, I'll throw the Golden Core of the Fixed Star onto a planet near them," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"That's not the same," Jinsi Niao objected, then looked at Qi Yuan with starry eyes, "This little lady wants to see you crush stars, it must be beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>"You're making things difficult for your man, but... there's still a chance," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>As long as Old Thunder God and the others broke through to the Yang Spirit realm, Qi Yuan's strength would also increase, and he might be able to enter the Yang Spirit realm. At that time, crushing a star really wouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Let this little lady know in advance when you're going to crush stars. I'll record a video and post it online. It will definitely go viral and gain lots of followers, hehe!" Jinsi Niao said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>"You're starting to sound more and more like the female lead in a romance drama. Do you want me to set off a few mushroom bombs for you to see?" Qi Yuan also said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Being with Jinsi Niao made life feel relaxed and joyful.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 534</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The autumn dusk was not bleak, the golden sunlight was lazy yet warm.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng was dressed casually, smiling cheerfully, just like an ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, they are all good kids in the judgment."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng had a self-satisfied look: "This is my granddaughter's careful selection!"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Chi Changlu or Wang Ke, they were all personally invited by Liu Chufeng to join the judgment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Sheng raised his eyebrows and said casually, "What about that Qi Yuan from Ninguo? Why don't I see him?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng had a guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>How coincidental that this Qi Yuan from Ninguo appeared? He might have a special relationship with that revived deity.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng suddenly remembered something and muttered, "I don't know if he's back yet, grandpa, let's go to his courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng led Liu Sheng to Qi Yuan's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A light knock on the door sounded, and Chen Kangbao poked his head out, looking curious at the two.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you, the young master is back."  Chen Kangbao was still eating a steamed bun as usual.</p><p></p><p>"He's back, my grandpa wants to see him." Liu Chufeng said as she was about to walk into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao stretched out his hand to stop Liu Chufeng: "The young master is sleeping, he has ordered that no one is allowed to go in."</p><p></p><p>"Sleeping?" Liu Chufeng became a little anxious when she heard this, "Wake him up!"</p><p></p><p>Her grandpa rarely came here in a good mood, this was a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Who in the world doesn't want to see the divine military commander and get guidance from him? Chen Kangbao shook his head and said seriously, "The young master said not to wake him up."</p><p></p><p>He stood firmly in front of Liu Chufeng.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng was very angry: "Delaying an important matter, you..."</p><p></p><p>"The young master's sleep is the important matter." Chen Kangbao said bluntly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng fell silent at this.</p><p></p><p>She felt sorry for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Sheng smiled and said, "How long will your young master be asleep?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Chen Kangbao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng was even more speechless when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng glanced into the courtyard: "Since I have nothing to do, I'll just wait here."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng heard this, her eyes filled with surprise and confusion.</p><p></p><p>Wait? Her grandpa wants to wait for Brother Qi to wake up? Liu Chufeng was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She naturally didn't think it was for her own face that her grandpa was waiting.</p><p></p><p>Her grandpa was a divine military commander, even if he was her relative, she still needed to respect him.</p><p></p><p>Her grandpa must have his own reasons for doing things.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head, not knowing what she was thinking, waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>From dusk to deep night, Liu Chufeng and Liu Sheng waited outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The door of the room never opened, Liu Chufeng's eyes were filled with confusion: "Brother Qi still hasn't woken up? When will he wake up?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao shook his head: "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, he'll wake up at the latest by tomorrow morning, grandpa you..." Liu Chufeng looked at Liu Sheng, a little afraid that her grandpa would get angry.</p><p></p><p>After all, keeping a divine military commander waiting outside until midnight, or even all night, this Qi Yuan was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng smiled, his smile was kind, he glanced at the house: "No hurry, I'm free now."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Kangbao said, "The young master may not wake up tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Liu Chufeng was stunned, "He's not injured, is he? How can an ordinary person sleep so long?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the young master is a deity descended from heaven, what's wrong with sleeping for three thousand years?" Chen Kangbao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chufeng fell silent, this Chen Kangbao was really sick.</p><p></p><p>And next to him, Liu Sheng narrowed his eyes, as if he had thought of something, scrutinizing Chen Kangbao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he smiled and said, "There is such an interesting thing in this world, I'll just wait here for your young master to wake up and see how many months he can sleep."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A rain fell on the coastal city.</p><p></p><p>Drizzling.</p><p></p><p>When the wind blew, it stirred up a wave.</p><p></p><p>In the restaurant, the storyteller had white hair and a short stature, his clothes had six or seven patches, but the stitches were very fine.</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that on that day, in the sixth month of the Frost, five horses were positioned in the east, south, west, and north, and the courtesan was tied up with ropes.</p><p></p><p>To execute the prince, she should be torn apart by the five horses! But who knew, it was the Frost of the sixth month!"</p><p></p><p>Although the old storyteller was aged, his voice was loud and melodic.</p><p></p><p>The commoners in the restaurant heard this, their expressions varied, some with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a young man in Confucian robes lowered his head, his face filled with fear: "Is this something we can hear?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had heard the story of the courtesan beheading the three princes since childhood.</p><p></p><p>But this Rakshasa country had long banned the spread of these stories.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was spread, it was only privately.</p><p></p><p>How could it be brought to the public stage?</p><p></p><p>Even if this was Dingbo Prefecture! "In the end, the Deity of Judgment descended, and the courtesan was acquitted!</p><p></p><p>Hmph, what about the prince? He is guilty like a commoner!"  The old storyteller was full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>The diners in the restaurant applauded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a diner lowered his head and said, "Have you heard, the Blood Cloud Bandits who terrorized the four corners were exterminated, and it was this Deity of Judgment who took action!"</p><p></p><p>"You must be an outsider, this news has already spread throughout the coastal city!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Deity of Judgment... has returned!"</p><p></p><p>"He... has finally returned." An old man in a tattered short jacket, drinking murky yellow wine.</p><p></p><p>"After encountering the courtesan..."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the corner, an old woman in cloth clothes, the sound in the restaurant reached her ears, and a reminiscent expression appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that a hundred and twenty years have passed." </p><p></p><p>Although she was in coarse cloth clothes, she could not hide a special aura, and from her facial features, one could see that she was a beauty in her youth.</p><p></p><p>"Madam, it has been a hundred years since the deity disappeared, and we have finally waited for him to return." The speaker was a lame old man.</p><p></p><p>He was of humble origin, and was beaten and had his leg broken for not kneeling before a nobleman.</p><p></p><p>It was the deity who restored his justice and dignity.</p><p></p><p>As for the old woman, she was the protagonist of the "Courtesan Beheading the Three Princes" story, and was also one of the two deputy directors of the Judgment Hall.</p><p></p><p>Except for the director who was trapped in the capital and unable to get out, the other deputy director had to guard the Judgment Hall.</p><p></p><p>This time, with the news of the deity's appearance in the coastal city, the old woman came in person.</p><p></p><p>Her aged face was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"The current Rakshasa country... is nothing compared to the past." The old woman said softly, her eyes filled with nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>As people get older, they tend to reminisce about the past.</p><p></p><p>The old woman was not living in the past! But even though the court had been suppressing the Judgment Hall and erasing the traces of the deity's existence, the people's stories and beliefs about the deity had never been interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Many people secretly worshipped the deity, just waiting for the day when the deity would reappear.</p><p></p><p>The entire court was lined up, with one person pulled out and beheaded every other person, among whom there might be innocent people, but certainly not a few with bloody hands.</p><p></p><p>The current Rakshasa country, how could it still be the original Rakshasa country? The royal family was willing to cede cities to ensure their position, and the generals were beheading civilians to gain military merit!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the carriage, without even going to the zoo, just by opening the curtain, all the people in the city are like cattle and horses! No, they are even worse than cattle and horses, for cattle and horses are precious, aren't they? In such a world, even if the Rakshasa Kingdom has seven divine lords ruling the world, except for the Dingbo State, the other thirteen states in the world have uprisings and rebellions over a hundred times every year.</p><p></p><p>If they could just survive, if they could just fill their stomachs, why would those common people "not become peaceful corpses, but imitate the praying mantis trying to stop a chariot"? As the saying goes, "Today they cheer for Sun Wukong, only because the demonic mist has returned."</p><p></p><p>"But... where is the divine lord now?" The old woman's face showed a look of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when the divine lord perished, she stopped embroidering and painting, and began to cultivate, becoming a military commander and joining the Judgment. </p><p></p><p>Now, the traces of the divine lord have reappeared.</p><p></p><p>In just ten days, the entire Linhai City, even the Liuye Prefecture, the entire Dingbo State, was decorated with lanterns and flags, and the faces of the common people showed joy.</p><p></p><p>Many common people also openly began to worship the divine lord.</p><p></p><p>And the government of the Dingbo State has also remained silent at this time, which is thought-provoking, as if further confirming this reality.</p><p></p><p>The divine lord... has really returned!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the military camp's main account.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Dingyuan was pacing back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Such a posture on a divine-level military commander is rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>His face had long lost the composure he had ten days ago.</p><p></p><p>After about a dozen breaths, the leader of the Blood Hand entered with a respectful expression.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" The Prince of Dingyuan asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Since he secretly went to investigate the Blood Cloud Stronghold, he had been somewhat flustered and fearful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Cloud Bandits have been destroyed, and the news of the divine lord's arrival has spread throughout the Dingbo State, with everyone talking about it!" </p><p></p><p>"What about the government? What is their attitude?" The Prince of Dingyuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"They are indifferent, even... actively promoting it!" The leader of the Blood Hand replied.</p><p></p><p>If the arrival of the divine lord was not pushed by someone, how could it spread so quickly throughout the Dingbo State? </p><p></p><p>And if this had happened in other states, it would not have been able to spread at all.</p><p></p><p>Now, the ambiguous attitude of the government represents what? The government of the Dingbo State represents the Liu family! "Old man Liu has always been timid and cautious, but this time he is secretly pushing it, could it be that..." The Prince of Dingyuan became a little anxious, no longer with the composure and calmness of the past.</p><p></p><p>"Where is old man Liu now?" The Prince of Dingyuan quickly asked, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>"He went to Linhai City ten days ago and has not left since, I don't know what he is specifically doing."</p><p></p><p>"He has been in Linhai City for so long... this is not in line with his character." </p><p></p><p>The Prince of Dingyuan was really anxious.</p><p></p><p>He had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the divine lord has really revived?</p><p></p><p>Is old man Liu conspiring with the divine lord...? If that's the case...</p><p></p><p>"What has happened here needs to be reported to the Emperor, I will set out immediately and go to the imperial capital!" The Prince of Dingyuan made a judgment and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Hand heard this, his gaze slightly changing: "Your Highness, if you leave, what about the merits of the Dingbo State?"</p><p></p><p>If the Prince of Dingyuan leaves without an imperial audience, it will anger the Emperor. </p><p></p><p>The merits of the Dingbo State will definitely have nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>All his previous efforts will be in vain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Prince of Dingyuan's voice sounded weary: "When one's life is at stake, what use are the merits?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Hand heard this, disappointed and surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Prince to be so cowardly.</p><p></p><p>"The divine lord is just a divine weapon, Your Highness, if you stay in the camp and wait for the imperial envoy, you can sleep peacefully!" The leader of the Blood Hand persuaded.</p><p></p><p>He felt that since the Prince was also a divine-level military commander, why would he be afraid of the Judgment God? </p><p></p><p>They are both divine-level, if he can't win, he can at least run, right?</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Dinguan looked at the leader of the Blood Hand and did not explain much: "You have not seen the Judgment God, you don't know... how powerful it really is!"</p><p></p><p>Back then, in the Luofeng City, he had witnessed the divine lord repel the enemy army seven times.</p><p></p><p>That kind of strength, that kind of invincibility, the Prince of Dinguan didn't even have the heart to resist.</p><p></p><p>It... truly achieved the state of being undefeatable, even against enemies from the heavens! "Do not leak the news of my return to the capital within three days, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Dinguan warned him, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before leaving, he placed a restraint on the leader of the Blood Hand, and if his whereabouts were leaked within three days, the leader would explode and die.</p><p></p><p>Why three days? Because in three days he would have already arrived at the capital.</p><p></p><p>Only by staying in the capital would he have a glimmer of safety.</p><p></p><p>The divine lord had not truly revealed himself, and a divine-level military commander was already scared away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's been half a month."</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, Liu Chun'winter's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>She looked at her grandfather sitting in the courtyard, and many thoughts surged in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At first, she was also puzzled by her grandfather's actions.</p><p></p><p>But later, when she learned that the divine lord had manifested and destroyed the Blood Cloud Bandits, her heart was stirred up.</p><p></p><p>How coincidental the timing was! She suddenly had a guess.</p><p></p><p>As a divine-level military commander, her grandfather waiting outside was also understandable.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a push of the door sounded.</p><p></p><p>A man in a white robe, with a divine appearance, walked out, his hair slightly wet in the fine rain, but not disheveled.</p><p></p><p>He stretched and looked at the crowd, lazily saying, "Good morning!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Liu Chun'winter's expression was complex: "Elder Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!" Chen Kang's face showed joy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Sheng stood up, looking at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "Old man Liu Sheng pays respects to the young master."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Liu Sheng and nodded in response, not surprised.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the sky, seeing the fine rain like a curtain: "The rain is getting heavier and heavier, going out now... will be a great trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Qi... are you leaving?" Liu Chun'winter was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Just waking up and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a smile: "I've slept my fill, so naturally I have to go out."</p><p></p><p>After sleeping for half a month, his divine lord acting skills had increased crazily.</p><p></p><p>He had reached an extreme limit.</p><p></p><p>He had also gained new gifts.</p><p></p><p>With his strength enhanced, he naturally had new ideas.</p><p></p><p>Why not take the opportunity to fully play the role of the divine lord?</p><p></p><p>So he needs to traverse the Rakshasa Kingdom and go to the capital.</p><p></p><p>"Where does the young master intend to go?" Liu Sheng asked at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... out of the Dingbo State, to the Xuelian State, passing through the Cuixian State, the Longgu State... and finally to the capital." Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>He chose a winding path.</p><p></p><p>This path crossed the twelve states of the world, the most twisted and turning route to the capital.</p><p></p><p>"The rain is quite heavy, this kind of weather is very suitable for sleeping, but I am always diligent, and in rainy weather, the road is difficult, so I will also go out!" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Sheng suddenly stood up: "The rain is so heavy, with lightning and thunder, the horses may be frightened. I used to be a horse groom, so let the old man lead the horse and hold the whip to send the young master on his way, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Chun'winter's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Lead the horse?</p><p></p><p>Grandpa is going to lead the horse for Elder Brother Qi!</p><p></p><p>Although she knew that Elder Brother Qi might have an intimate relationship with the divine lord, this was still not enough for her grandfather to personally lead the horse, right?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Liu Sheng and his gaze was calm and indifferent: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

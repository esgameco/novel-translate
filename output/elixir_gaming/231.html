        <h1>Chapter 231</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the small Jiangshan mountains, cursing and swearing could be heard constantly.</p><p></p><p>Streaks of light flew past, and a great fire ignited the small Jiangshan mountains.</p><p></p><p>Even the pouring rain could not extinguish this terrifying blaze.</p><p></p><p>The fire burned continuously for ten days.</p><p></p><p>The entire small Jiangshan mountains became a wasteland.</p><p></p><p>Several streaks of light flew over the small Jiangshan mountains, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"Did you find her?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Useless! A group of Purple Palace cultivators can't even catch one mortal?"</p><p></p><p>"She was in the small Jiangshan mountains before the fire started. Her fate is special, she's not even at the Qi Condensation stage. She should have died in the great fire."</p><p></p><p>"The small Jiangshan mountains stretch for 300 li. She should be... dead."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, our descent time is limited, and there are too many powerful experts in this world. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"The Innate Origin Body and the Devouring Origin Body, two of the most powerful primordial bodies actually gathered in one person. If we could obtain even one of them..."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, since she's already dead, our mission is complete."</p><p></p><p>"Even if she's not dead, she'll starve to death, or die from overeating."</p><p></p><p>"To kill this little mongrel, we actually wasted a precious Descent Talisman."</p><p></p><p>The voices gradually faded away, and the streaks of light disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The small Jiangshan mountains, stretching for 300 li, became a wasteland, with traces of the great fire everywhere.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a small figure crawled out from underground.</p><p></p><p>She looked like a little girl, appearing to be only eleven or twelve years old. Her hair was scorched yellow, with signs of burning at the ends.</p><p></p><p>Her clothes were tattered, like a beggar's. But upon closer inspection, one could see that the clothes were originally very finely made - it was a princess dress.</p><p></p><p>She raised her head and looked at the sky. She saw a sky full of stars, but did not recognize any of them.</p><p></p><p>An intense feeling of loneliness welled up inside her.</p><p></p><p>She had been frail and sickly since childhood, almost dying at birth.</p><p></p><p>However, her parents discovered that she actually possessed the Innate Origin Body.</p><p></p><p>The Innate Origin Body was one of the top ten strongest physiques ever discovered.</p><p></p><p>This physique was pure and flawless, like celestial glass, transcendent and unblemished.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the people in her family doted on her immensely.</p><p></p><p>However, in addition to the Innate Origin Body, she also possessed the Devouring Origin Body, another of the top ten physiques.</p><p></p><p>If the Innate Origin Body emphasized purity and transcendence from worldly matters,</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Origin Body devoured everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>The two physiques were inherently in conflict.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that even at twelve years old, her body was still as fragile as a mortal's.</p><p></p><p>Every day, her clan would expend enormous resources to buy unpalatable nutrient solutions to sustain her.</p><p></p><p>She was very grateful. She was also grateful to her father and mother.</p><p></p><p>Especially her mother, who was the only one who was truly good to her and could tolerate her willfulness.</p><p></p><p>Although she knew that her father and mother were raising her to make a big business deal.</p><p></p><p>Her parents always kept it from her, and all the clan members kept it from her.</p><p></p><p>The family was harmonious on the surface, everyone seemingly treating her well, regarding her as a princess, cherishing and protecting her.</p><p></p><p>She was also willful and spoiled, enjoying everyone's doting.</p><p></p><p>But she knew that it was all false.</p><p></p><p>Those people appeared to dote on her excessively, but in reality, she could hear what they were thinking in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>That is, she could hear their inner voices.</p><p></p><p>Her father's gaze towards her contained affection, but even more so greed for a commodity.</p><p></p><p>Her mother was very conflicted, often coming to hold her at night, her inner voice full of guilt, seemingly constantly repeating, asking for her forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>However, the little girl did not think her mother had done anything wrong. Her mother had not failed her, giving her food and clothes, tolerating her little temper.</p><p></p><p>Even if she sold her... it would be normal, right?</p><p></p><p>The little girl had seen all kinds of people.</p><p></p><p>And in their hearts, she had heard all kinds of filthy words.</p><p></p><p>The holy and majestic Holy Father liked white-haired old men the most.</p><p></p><p>The lofty governor of the frontier was ambitious, always wanting to raise an army in rebellion.</p><p></p><p>This kind of life continued until she was eleven years old.</p><p></p><p>One day, her father excitedly came to find her, saying he had found a way to cure her body, and would take her to seek medical treatment.</p><p></p><p>But she heard her father's inner voice and knew that her father had found a buyer.</p><p></p><p>She happily boarded the flying ship with her mother.</p><p></p><p>During those days, her mother was not in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>She was very happy, because she heard three times that her mother wanted to take her and leave.</p><p></p><p>Although, more often it was still... the buyer was offering too much.</p><p></p><p>However, on the way to seek treatment, an accident occurred.</p><p></p><p>A group of mysterious people attacked their flying ship.</p><p></p><p>The ship crashed, and at that moment her Innate Origin Body suddenly activated, bringing her to this nearest primordial world.</p><p></p><p>Some of the mysterious people used Descent Talismans to pursue her to this world, intending to kill her.</p><p></p><p>After the great fire burned out, she crawled out from the ruins, not reborn from the flames, but quietly waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>She curled up on the ground, her gaze blank.</p><p></p><p>"So... hungry..."</p><p></p><p>An intense feeling of hunger assailed her, and she endured it.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of starving to death... is not good."</p><p></p><p>She looked at the soil on the ground, very much wanting to take a bite.</p><p></p><p>But she knew that if she took a bite, with her Innate Origin Body, the pain would be ten times, a hundred times stronger than hunger.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Origin Body devoured everything.</p><p></p><p>The Innate Origin Body rejected everything.</p><p></p><p>These two incompatible physiques created her.</p><p></p><p>So she could only slowly wait for death like this.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, suddenly, an inner voice entered her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the Foodless Holy Mother?"</p><p></p><p>"To encounter her again, what a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>The little girl curled up on the ground, not moving at all, as if she hadn't heard the voice.</p><p></p><p>Having lived in the family for over ten years, what she was best at was pretending, playing her role well.</p><p></p><p>In her heart she was very curious about this clear male voice's words, and also confused, but she didn't show it.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?" At this time, the male voice came again, speaking to her.</p><p></p><p>She was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Name?</p><p></p><p>She had no name.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, since she was destined to be sold after birth, the clan didn't even give her a name, not wanting her to enter the clan genealogy.</p><p></p><p>Others called her Tenth Miss, her mother called her Little Ten.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the man's voice just now... Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>A curious expression appeared on her face: "My name is Wu Shi... who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Wu Shi?" The man was silent for a moment, then looked at the small, emaciated body of the Foodless Holy Mother before him.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that the Foodless Holy Mother who had dominated the Mortal Heart Realm would have had such a miserable childhood.</p><p></p><p>"Who set fire to the mountain? That's too immoral, they should be arrested and sent to prison," the man thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi, who had been keeping her head down, heard this and for some reason suddenly felt a bit of joy in her heart.</p><p></p><p>This person's inner voice... was strange.</p><p></p><p>Different from what she had heard before.</p><p></p><p>"You probably haven't eaten for several days. I'm in a good mood today, let me treat you to a meal."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi heard the man's voice, and then heard his inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I came from the future and can't influence this world, otherwise I'd kill someone and treat the Foodless Holy Mother to a feast.</p><p></p><p>After all, she embodies the Heavenly Pillar, keeping the Heavenly Pillar standing firm, which can be considered a great help to me."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>She became even more curious about the man before her.</p><p></p><p>Because she had once heard the Holy Father and Great-Grandfather discussing that there was a past and present, but no future.</p><p></p><p>Now a person had come from the future.</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat curious, was it true?</p><p></p><p>A person's inner voice... cannot lie.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Had he really seen his future self? And what about merging with the celestial pillar? Helping him greatly?</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was still somewhat wary inside. A gurgling sound came from her stomach, which rumbled embarrassingly.</p><p></p><p>"I can't eat food," she replied with furrowed brows. </p><p></p><p>That nauseating feeling was something she could remember for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"I'll treat you to a meal, don't worry. You can eat, don't starve to death now," the man said softly.</p><p></p><p>If the Foodless Holy Mother starved to death and he knocked down the celestial pillar, would the game still be playable?</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Wu Shi asked doubtfully. This world didn't have nutrient solutions. What could she eat?</p><p></p><p>"Why would I lie to a young girl like you?" the man continued, "You're quite strange, why don't you breathe the air?"</p><p></p><p>"You're strange too," Wu Shi said quietly. </p><p></p><p>The man before her was indeed very odd. The things he was thinking were also very strange.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the food?" Wu Shi asked. She was really hungry.</p><p></p><p>Especially with the devouring entity, the desire to devour everything was not something she could endure.</p><p></p><p>If she could get something edible, she might really be willing to merge with the celestial pillar and help him as he said.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, let's leave this wasteland," the man said helplessly. </p><p></p><p>This wasteland was vast, stretching for 300 li.</p><p></p><p>"You won't starve to death here, will you?" the man asked with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"I won't," Wu Shi replied. </p><p></p><p>She was very hungry, but not yet starving to death.</p><p></p><p>"That's good. If you died now, who would help me merge with the celestial pillar in the future?" the man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Shouldn't these words be kept to oneself? Saying them out loud, wasn't he afraid of ruining his image in her mind? She remained quiet, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm very curious. If I see you in the future, will you be able to recognize me?" the man asked.</p><p></p><p>"I should be able to."</p><p></p><p>"But the Foodless Holy Mother seems to meet me for the first time every time. Little one, what secret are you hiding in your body?" The man's gaze fell on the Foodless Holy Mother, his eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe... her memory is like a fish's, only lasting a few seconds," Wu Shi said, hunching her shoulders as her small frame walked across the wasteland.</p><p></p><p>Her tiny feet were covered in black ash, with burn marks from the flames.</p><p></p><p>"Walking like this is too slow, it's like Sun Wukong taking Tang Sanzang to the Western Heaven to retrieve scriptures. Let me teach you some magic," the man said.</p><p></p><p>"Magic?" Wu Shi was curious. She looked towards where Qi Yuan was and said seriously, "If I... learn magic, I won't be delicious anymore."</p><p></p><p>With her constitution, once she practiced magic, she would no longer be valuable. That's why her family never let her learn.</p><p></p><p>"With your dark complexion, you think you're delicious? That's laughable!" the man guffawed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was stunned. </p><p></p><p>He... hadn't come for her special constitution?</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, I'll teach you magic so you can fly over. Walking like this, it'll take forever!" the man said. "My self-created cultivation method, the 'Qi Yuan Scripture', probably isn't suitable for you. I'll just teach you some flying magic. This is a spell I created called 'Princess Rides a Broomstick'."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan had created a spell based on this world and Wu Shi's constitution. </p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, Qi Yuan's power had reached mythical levels. According to the rules of the Mortal Heart Realm, creating a flying spell was extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>"This incantation is very simple, try it quickly," Qi Yuan told Wu Shi the spell he had created.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi hesitated, then tentatively said, "If I learn this spell... I won't be valuable anymore."</p><p></p><p>"You're a person, not a commodity. What's all this talk about being valuable or not?" the man said casually. </p><p></p><p>In his mind, he thought: "This Foodless Holy Mother must have hit her head as a child, she's so strange. I can't let her cultivate the 'Qi Yuan Scripture'. She doesn't have my clear mind, if she practiced it, she'd definitely become even more insane."</p><p></p><p>Hearing his thoughts, Wu Shi fell silent for a moment. She memorized the 'Princess Rides a Broomstick' spell and began to learn it.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time, the man nearby showed a surprised look: "As expected of the number one person in the Mortal Heart Realm, you learned it so quickly? Find a wooden stick, sit on it, and follow my guidance."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Shi stared blankly at where the man was for a moment, then found a wooden stick.</p><p></p><p>She straddled the stick, activated the spell, and her form swayed unsteadily as she flew into the air.</p><p></p><p>"You look a bit like a witch now. By the way, are you afraid of heights? It would be funny if you fell from the sky because of acrophobia," the man led the way, occasionally saying some strange things.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi followed along, and after an unknown amount of time, they stopped by a small pond.</p><p></p><p>It seemed a great battle had taken place here. Half the water in the pond had disappeared, and there were many dead fish on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Cook the fish and you'll be able to eat," the man clapped his hands, seeming very excited.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi's gaze froze for a moment. She was very, very hungry, but looking at these fish only made her feel nauseous and want to vomit.</p><p></p><p>"I... don't eat fish."</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through the man's mind.</p><p></p><p>He said, "You make it first, you'll know soon enough. These fish are different from the ones you've eaten before."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi hesitated, but chose to trust the man before her.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had even let her practice magic.</p><p></p><p>If her family found out about this, they would probably cut him into eighteen pieces.</p><p></p><p>But she only thought about it. Her family... wouldn't come here.</p><p></p><p>She cooked fish for the first time, roasting it on a stick.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wu Shi seemed to sense that man approaching.</p><p></p><p>She looked curious, and then heard the man say:</p><p></p><p>"Try it quickly."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi looked at the fish before her, her gaze somewhat timid.</p><p></p><p>Because she didn't want to experience that feeling again.</p><p></p><p>Even though she had the devouring entity, eating any food always made her want to kill herself.</p><p></p><p>Only nutrient solutions were somewhat better.</p><p></p><p>She opened her lips and gently bit into the burnt fish, chewing.</p><p></p><p>A warm sensation swept through her body and limbs.</p><p></p><p>She felt as if her whole body was basking in sunlight.</p><p></p><p>She experienced warmth like never before.</p><p></p><p>"It's... delicious," she said. It was the first time she had eaten something so tasty.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the nutrient solutions she had eaten before, this was heaven and earth apart.</p><p></p><p>She felt it would be worth dying after eating this piece of fish.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in the man's eyes: "Now you look like a cat eating cat treats."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Wu Shi as if watching a pet in a movie.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi continued eating the fish, savoring a deliciousness she had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>She turned her head to look at where the man was: "Why does it taste so good?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a secret," the man replied.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Because when the man said "secret", even in his mind he didn't have the correct answer.</p><p></p><p>"I want to eat another fish. I can grant you one wish," Wu Shi said timidly.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to eat more.</p><p></p><p>The man beside her smiled.</p><p></p><p>He didn't answer Wu Shi's words, but thought to himself:</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of me coming to see her? Perhaps there is no meaning at all."</p><p></p><p>"It's just... looking at history."</p><p></p><p>History is sealed by time, stories are buried, and the uninteresting corner that is uncovered may be the entire life of a living being.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

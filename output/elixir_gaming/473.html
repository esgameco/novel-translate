        <h1>Chapter 473</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, these are the rare treasures collected over the past year, a total of 2,700 pieces, costing a total of..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan lowered his head and respectfully handed the storage bag containing the rare treasures to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few years, he had been diligently serving Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation had grown, he was no longer the naive young man he once was, but had become a great Nascent Soul cultivator! But the stronger he became, the more he realized the depth and terror of the man before him, someone he needed to look up to for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, I hope this time there will be some new gains."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the rare treasures and examined them carefully.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, in addition to studying the loopholes in the Myriad Ghost Banners, he had also been learning various forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the lack of materials, even though the Armory had already been built, the rare treasures Qi Yuan had forged inside were few, with only... one.</p><p></p><p>This one was forged by extracting and refining several worn-out and almost disintegrated rare treasure materials.</p><p></p><p>As for the other rare treasures, Qi Yuan had not destroyed them to turn them into raw materials.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, they were proof that a certain civilization, a certain tribe, still existed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the rare treasures, casually glancing around, searching for any new forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan then silently withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's expression slightly tightened.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the empty space in front of him and suddenly spoke, "Since you've come, show yourself."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a cheerful voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, I have come to your Tiankunqi Land as a guest, and have not come to welcome you from afar. I hope you will forgive me."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a man with a figure like a double-door refrigerator appeared, his head a bit too small, as if he had used a small head special effect.</p><p></p><p>Behind him followed a stooped old man, who was Tian Can Tian Zun.</p><p></p><p>"I am Dao Buyi, the Sect Master of the Holy Light Sect." Dao Buyi said with a bright smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>As the old servant, Tian Can Tian Zun looked at Qi Yuan curiously, his heart filled with amazement.</p><p></p><p>To encounter the Holy Light Clan and not run away, he was truly... skilled and bold.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking for me for, to fight?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The other party was merely a Dao Essence, he didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dao Essence realm Holy Light Clan, the Holy Light Proclamation could influence even great Dao Essence experts.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan had a bit of a nose, he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi's expression changed slightly at the words: "Fellow Daoist, you jest, I am a guest from afar, how could I have the intention to harm a guest?"</p><p></p><p>Sniff... his nose just grew longer.</p><p></p><p>"You're lying, you have a trace of killing intent." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The originally calm Dao Buyi suddenly had a towering wave of turmoil in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Proclamation... how could it be seen through by the other party? Could it be that the other party also has an ancient ancestor, a terrifying bloodline source? Only this could explain it! It seems that the other party is not a cultivator of the Six Realms, but should be an outsider like him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his heart even more wary: "Fellow Daoist, you jest, this is just natural and unintentional killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoist also has ghosts all over him, with towering killing intent."</p><p></p><p>"We are not the same, I kill those who deserve to be killed." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"I also kill those who deserve to be killed." Dao Buyi said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned, looking at Dao Buyi: "Your face is very thick.</p><p></p><p>Tell me, what are you looking for me for?"</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the silent Tian Can Tian Zun was shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't this black-robed person kneel down immediately? How could he still question him?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, I am quite curious about your method of controlling this army of ghosts, and I would like to learn from you and gain some insights." Dao Buyi said slowly.</p><p></p><p>He came to the Tiankunqi Land with great plans.</p><p></p><p>The most important part of which was to completely control the army of ghosts.</p><p></p><p>But these ghosts were particularly special, even his Holy Light Proclamation was useless.</p><p></p><p>Forcing them to be controlled by bells, corroding and polluting, the effect was very weak, the progress was slow, and there might even be no future.</p><p></p><p>But now, these ghost armies under this mysterious black-robed man were very well-behaved.</p><p></p><p>Some were building houses, some were doing calisthenics.</p><p></p><p>If you looked from afar, you might even think they were living people.</p><p></p><p>"Because... with sincerity, I treat them with sincerity, and they treat me with sincerity in return." Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi was slightly stunned, then said, "Fellow Daoist, you jest."</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he did not believe Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"If I treat you with sincerity, will you treat me with sincerity like these ghosts?" Qi Yuan looked at Dao Buyi, with a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi's smile froze: "Fellow Daoist, I'll see you tomorrow, the pill I just refined is about to be completed."</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi finished speaking and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>About fifty breaths later.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi stood in the sky, looking at the ghost army below, his expression unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"He can actually resist the Holy Light Proclamation!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems his bloodline is also very noble!"</p><p></p><p>"He came here... also for the purpose of..."</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>"But his strength should be slightly inferior to mine, otherwise... he would not have tested me, but would have attacked directly!"</p><p></p><p>"His bloodline talent seems to be similar to the Holy Light Proclamation, and I have a strange feeling about communicating with him."</p><p></p><p>It was because he sensed the anomaly that he dared not stay, but chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Holy Light Proclamation may not necessarily lose to him, I'll go see him again tomorrow, I won't believe I can't get another servant!"</p><p></p><p>As for acquiring servants, Dao Buyi actually didn't care much.</p><p></p><p>What he cared most about was using Qi Yuan to control the ghost army and accomplish his own purpose.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on the recliner, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Absolute Adaptation... has actually become stabilized?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme Dao Principles Qi Yuan had comprehended were Absolute Adaptation and Doing as One Pleases.</p><p></p><p>However, his cultivation was too low, so the stabilization and advancement of his supreme Dao Principles were too slow.</p><p></p><p>So when he fought against great Dao Essence experts, his supreme Dao Principles were almost useless.</p><p></p><p>But in his exchange with Dao Buyi, his Absolute Adaptation seemed to be adapting to the Holy Light Proclamation, constantly improving.</p><p></p><p>"According to what the old man said, the comprehension of Dao Principles is divided into four levels: Scattered, Gathered, Solidified, and Patterned. Right now, I'm still at the Scattered level."</p><p></p><p>Like the ancient great Dao Essence experts like Ziyuan Ancestor, their comprehension of Dao Principles was at the Solidified level.</p><p></p><p>It was not the supreme Dao Principles, the highest form was only Solidified.</p><p></p><p>Only the Exalted Ones who had comprehended the supreme Dao Principles would have the Patterned level.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Dao Buyi cannot be killed yet." Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>He needed to rely on Dao Buyi to grind his experience.</p><p></p><p>To raise the level of his comprehension of Absolute Adaptation.</p><p></p><p>This would be a huge improvement for him as well.</p><p></p><p>The next day, just as the sky was brightening.</p><p></p><p>The figures of Dao Buyi and Tian Can Tian Zun appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do not have any ill intentions towards me, I have come here... without any intention to harm you." Dao Buyi said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Proclamation was also secretly activated.</p><p></p><p>He had decided that he would come and see this mysterious black-robed person every day, clash with him, and see who would prevail.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have the intention to harm me, but the old man beside you may not be the same." Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tian Can Tian Zun, upon hearing this, his gaze suddenly changed, and a sense of foreboding came over him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist is joking, how dare he!" Dao Buyi's eyes flashed with a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"How dare he? After all... I killed his son." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Aolan Realm, Qi Yuan had encountered the Moli Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>This Moli Patriarch had a Tiankunqi Ancient Mirror, in which there was a remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>The remnant soul was a being of the Six Realms, the offspring of a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>This remnant soul was arrogant and overbearing, verbally provoking the Moon Goddess Yuanjun, and was killed by the Moon Goddess Yuanun across two realms.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Tian Can Tian Zun had the Tiankunqi Ancient Mirror, a rare treasure, and placed the deceased's soul in the Tiankunqi Ancient Mirror to nurture it, and randomly transmitted it to the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>As a result, that remnant soul was very arrogant, wanting to collude with the Moli Patriarch to usurp Qi Yuan, but was killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now, he saw the father of the remnant soul, and naturally recognized him.</p><p></p><p>"You... you killed Jie'er!" Tian Can Tian Zun's eyes suddenly burst with light, his body trembling, suppressing something.</p><p></p><p>"See, he has the intention to kill me." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes flashing with a look of surprise: "Fellow Daoist has been to the Six Realms?"</p><p></p><p>He had almost complete mastery of all the information about Tian Can Tian Zun.</p><p></p><p>So he knew that Tian Can Tian Zun's offspring was still in the Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>Since this mysterious black-robed person had slain Tian Can Tian Zun's offspring, he must have gone to the Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Dao Buyi greatly.</p><p></p><p>He had more guesses about Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was a fugitive who had accidentally entered the Immortal Realm of the Six Realms and could no longer leave.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Immortal Realm meant a fixed fate, with no future.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a sense of superiority and smugness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had a bright future ahead of him, while this mysterious black-robed person did not.</p><p></p><p>Happiness is derived from comparison.</p><p></p><p>"I have been there." Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buyi's smile grew even wider, and his heart was delighted: "Since this useless old servant dares to have the intention to kill you, it's better for him to die."</p><p></p><p>In a good mood, he might as well kill a person to cheer himself up.</p><p></p><p>Tian Can Tian Zun's face showed an embarrassed expression.</p><p></p><p>"You're in a good mood, so you want to kill me, huh? Master, your old servant has been loyal and devoted to you, please!" Tian Can Tian Zun didn't have any thoughts of resistance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"You should commit suicide now, and you will be reborn and enter the great Dao Essence realm in three days." Dao Buyi said indifferently to Tian Can Tian Zun.</p><p></p><p>Tian Can Tian Zun's fear turned into fanaticism, without any hesitation, he struck at himself.</p><p></p><p>His original divine soul was instantly extinguished at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A Yang God Patriarch, capable of devouring an entire realm, was easily extinguished like a mere insect.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do you think I've done enough to show my sincerity?" Dao Buyi said, with a hint of showing off the terrifying power of the Holy Light Proclamation to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Dao Buyi and suddenly said seriously, "Actually, I'm your father."</p><p></p><p>A sense of crisis suddenly surged in Dao Buyi's heart, and his consciousness was a bit muddled.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist... you are my grandson!" Dao Buyi's Holy Light Proclamation activated, trying to resist the Great Oblivion Heart Sutra, or rather, trying to infect Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Proclamation and the Great Oblivion Heart Sutra clashed, just like two chuunibyou teenagers cursing at each other.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you calling your grandson?" Qi Yuan said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm calling you my grandson!" Dao Buyi said, and his expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Obedient grandson, I understand." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a cliché, sometimes it was quite useful.</p><p></p><p>After all, the content of the words was not important, what Dao Buyi was competing for was... bloodline talent.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you even occupy this cheap advantage, it seems you are not much more than..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So be it," Dao Buer said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"No big deal, what 'fellow Dao', grandson, I'm your father!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Sutra was also activated.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Dao... we'll battle again tomorrow!" After hesitating for a moment, Dao Buer chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>He dared not stay any longer, afraid that Qi Yuan's innate divine abilities would subtly influence him.</p><p></p><p>He said that and left directly. Not far away, Shi Pan saw this scene, his face full of surprise.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious burly man came to pay respects to the Master, but the servant committed suicide and they even cursed at each other a few times before leaving? This incident seemed rather strange.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Pan, what brings you here today?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>His Absolute Adaptation had increased a lot, and he was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when I went out to purchase rare treasures recently, I made acquaintance with many powerful cultivators. They secretly warned me that the Holy Light Sect has a deep background.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seems the Holy Light Sect is stirring, do we need to be more careful?" Shi Pan reminded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the corpse of Tian Cang Tian Zun, his eyes smiling: "The Holy Light Sect, it's nothing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shi Pan didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>After all these years, he had vaguely grasped his Master's character.</p><p></p><p>Whatever the Master said, he would just go along with it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan thought of something and said indifferently, "A few days ago, you mentioned that you wanted me to teach you some of the battle techniques of high-level cultivators. Today... I fought with Dao Buer, did you learn a few layers while watching?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan was slightly taken aback when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Cursing at each other?</p><p></p><p>Is this the battle technique of high-level cultivators?</p><p></p><p>This is too absurd.</p><p></p><p>Was the Master joking? It's too childish!</p><p></p><p>"No... I didn't learn anything," Shi Pan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're a bit stupid, well then, in the coming period, this Dao Buer will come every day, and I should fight with him every day. You stand by and watch and listen carefully," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He did things as he pleased, acting freely.</p><p></p><p>This was also in line with his great principle of doing as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master," Shi Pan replied with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>After taking his leave, Shi Pan left the place.</p><p></p><p>There was always a hint of doubt in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is... cursing at each other?"</p><p></p><p>"No, isn't the Master Dao Buer's father?"</p><p></p><p>"How could the Master be Dao Buer's grandson?"</p><p></p><p>His head was in a mess, muddled and confused, unable to make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>With doubts, he returned to his own residence.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a tall cultivator came over: "Little friend Shi Pan, have you conveyed the words to that great man?"</p><p></p><p>This tall cultivator was a great venerable from the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth.</p><p></p><p>After knowing of Qi Yuan's existence, he wanted to come and make overtures.</p><p></p><p>After all, the one who could control the army of yin spirits must be the supreme Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>"I have already conveyed the words to the Master," Shi Pan said.</p><p></p><p>"What did that great man say?" The tall cultivator had a look of joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Master said... the Holy Light Sect is nothing!" Shi Pan repeated Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>The tall cultivator heard this and his expression became complex: "This great man... is a bit too confident."</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and felt that his overtures were in vain.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme Yang Deity seemed to have become too confident, knowing that the Holy Light Sect had a Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Qi Yuan was not far from death.</p><p></p><p>He had also heard that Liu Xi had once refused this Venerable, and at that time, there were many cultivators in the small circle of the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth who felt that Liu Xi was too cowardly and missed such an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, Liu Xi's choice at the time was correct.</p><p></p><p>Now Liu Xi had entered a secret realm in the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth and reaped a bountiful harvest, seemingly about to rise to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>And the Supreme Yang Deity here, arrogant and conceited, with a look of impending death.</p><p></p><p>If the Holy Light Clan were to appear, this Supreme Yang Deity would surely die.</p><p></p><p>He had already developed a desire to retreat.</p><p></p><p>It's best not to make overtures to such a dead person, lest he bring trouble upon himself.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I have a doubt," Shi Pan said softly at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what doubt?" The tall cultivator asked casually, but his tone was no longer as amiable as before.</p><p></p><p>"The battle techniques of high-level cultivators, what are they like? Today, there was a cultivator named Dao Buer who came to pay respects to the Master, and they..."</p><p></p><p>He told this cultivator about the events of the day.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator was a senior and his vision was far superior to Shi Pan's.</p><p></p><p>The tall cultivator heard this and a mocking smile appeared in his eyes: "Even the great Supreme Deities in battle would certainly not be like this. Your Master is just playing tricks on you!"</p><p></p><p>The tall cultivator shook his head and chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only Shi Pan behind, full of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"The Master wouldn't lie to me, it should be that this senior's level is too low!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan was very determined.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Shi Pan always maintained a proper attitude, going to Qi Yuan's side every day to observe the battles between the strong.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, seriously pondering the cursing battle between the two.</p><p></p><p>"I'm your father!"</p><p>"I'm your grandfather!"</p><p>"Broken through!"</p><p>"Stone-throwing dog barking!"</p><p></p><p>The more he listened, the more absurd it felt.</p><p></p><p>This period of time lasted for three years.</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan's efficiency in going out to exchange rare treasures also became lower and lower.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors in the outside world that the Sect Master of the Holy Light Sect had already emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>So those cultivators all kept their distance from the area where Qi Yuan was, not daring to do business with Qi Yuan, for fear of offending the Holy Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>One day, the cursing battle ended.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was refreshed and energetic.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, a small success!"</p><p></p><p>His Absolute Adaptation, in this turbulent, perilous, and treacherous high-level battle, had reached the level of small success.</p><p></p><p>"Now, without the cultivation of the Myriad Dao Martial Saint, relying solely on this supreme principle, I should be able to withstand a cultivator who has just entered the Supreme Deity Realm." </p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only to withstand.</p><p></p><p>To injure an ordinary Supreme Deity, his Absolute Adaptation would need to reach the level of great success.</p><p></p><p>To slay a Supreme Deity like Purple Origin Ancestor, it would need to reach the level of Profound.</p><p></p><p>This Dao Buer, is truly a qualified charging treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Pan, how much did you understand this time?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan had a bitter expression: "This disciple is dull-witted, and has not understood even one part."</p><p></p><p>In these three years, he had been observing the battles, but he could not understand at all.</p><p></p><p>"The Master's battle techniques are too simple and natural, the Dao and Nature, Shi Pan finds it difficult to understand."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, with your brain, it is indeed difficult to understand such profound battle techniques. As the saying goes, what was once a vast ocean is now but a small amount of water, and what was once a towering mountain is now just a cloud. In the future, when you see other profound battle techniques, you will only feel bored."</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan lowered his head, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Although he had watched the Master and Dao Buer cursing at each other very seriously, to be honest, this cursing was no more exciting and intense than two stray dogs barking at each other on the roadside.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the unknown realm, Dao Buer's forehead was beaded with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"This black-robed man is truly formidable. Over the years, he has influenced me without making a sound, and my Holy Light Incantation is almost useless against him."</p><p></p><p>A cold gleam flashed in Dao Buer's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If there is no effect after another half a year of battle, it seems I will have to get serious."</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer was no ordinary Holy Light Clan cultivator.</p><p></p><p>His combat power was also extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Realm, any cultivator who entered the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth, he had the confidence to kill them.</p><p></p><p>So he was not afraid of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Killing Qi Yuan would be very simple, but what he wanted was complete control. Only in this way could he obtain the true method of controlling the army of yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>But if he could not control it, he could only make the hard decision to kill, and then find a way to control the army of yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was joyful.</p><p></p><p>"The loophole in the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner... is finally fixed!"</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had been observing the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner every day, and had finally found the loophole in the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he wanted to enter the Ghost Realm, the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner would be just a decoration.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted to, he could steal the Myriad Ghost Spirit Banner.</p><p></p><p>"However... I can't go in openly now, otherwise, that banner master might have some other tricks. I have to pretend to have put in a lot of effort to barely enter.</p><p></p><p>But with a cultivator of such high ability, I estimate he will discover the anomaly after barely three times. But... that's enough."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>He had gained a lot during this period.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was:</p><p></p><p>"This Dao Buer seems unable to curse better than me, and doesn't want to curse with me anymore. This won't do, it seems I have to show weakness." Qi Yuan thought seriously.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer's battery power had not been exhausted yet, and he didn't want to give up this charging treasure.</p><p></p><p>Although the growth rate of his Absolute Adaptation was becoming slower and slower.</p><p></p><p>But Dao Buer was still enough to allow Qi Yuan to enter the level of small success.</p><p></p><p>"For Dao Buer, I'm willing to stay in the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth for a few more years. Is this the great fatherly love? It's so touching!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Shi Pan's expression became increasingly bitter.</p><p></p><p>Although he had entered the Primordial Elixir Realm, he couldn't feel happy at all.</p><p></p><p>The area where the Master was located, those cultivators had all kept their distance.</p><p></p><p>There were a few close friends in the past, and they had all left him one after another.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation path had changed from being crowded with guests to being desolate.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, he chose to stay by Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>But he was a little worried, because recently the Master and that Dao Buer's cursing battle seemed to be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>This made him extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>Now, he vaguely felt that this was the profound battle technique between the Master and Dao Buer.</p><p></p><p>"Master... should we leave the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth? The rare treasures have been collected almost enough," Shi Pan finally couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a smile: "The rare treasures are enough, but the charging treasure... is not used up yet!"</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it's almost used up.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about me." Thinking of something, Qi Yuan murmured, "In half a month, I should leave the Heavenly Broad and Vast Earth. You stay here and continue to help me collect rare treasures."</p><p></p><p>"The Master is going to leave?" Shi Pan heard this with a mix of joy and sadness.</p><p></p><p>The Master listened to the advice, this is a good thing, but...</p><p></p><p>"En." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After the charging treasure's power is exhausted, he will end this boring battle.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is socially anxious, and can't curse better than his senior brothers and sisters.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Dao Buer is also not very good at cursing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

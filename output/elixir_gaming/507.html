        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I, cough cough, am short on money recently."</p><p></p><p>He responded awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>He came to the black market to purchase materials, mainly to collect materials for the elder of the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>That elder made a huge demand, and Tusan Gongzi's expenditure was severe.</p><p></p><p>However, he ultimately decided to grit his teeth and purchase the materials.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have missed out on wealth." Qi Yuan was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the petite woman had a smug look in her eyes: "From what he said, you spent 10,000 taels to buy this... lightsaber?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at the lightsaber with disdain.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Tusan Gongzi, one-third like looking at a fool, seven-thirds like looking at a swindler.</p><p></p><p>Tusan Gongzi was silent for a moment, glanced at the ice-cold Xiu Simo standing beside him, and ultimately did not refute.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and cautiously asked, "Senior, is his special ability real?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the elder of the Thorn Blood, he needed some self-defense measures.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's real. With this lightsaber, you can walk through Ninguo arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two, do you want to buy them? They're very cheap, and if you don't buy them now, they'll probably be out of stock in a few days." Qi Yuan tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Without this lightsaber, even I, the Miss, can walk through Ninguo arrogantly." An untimely voice came, and the petite woman smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>As she said this, she turned around and walked sideways, like a crab.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>This game still has ruthless people!</p><p></p><p>What he just said about walking arrogantly was actually a pun.</p><p></p><p>The ability to "summon the gods" was indeed enough to protect Tusan Gongzi to walk arrogantly, and he had not deceived.</p><p></p><p>Tusan Gongzi smiled awkwardly: "I feel relieved."</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan's words, he only believed a third of them.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Qi Yuan could walk arrogantly himself, he wouldn't be selling this lightsaber?</p><p></p><p>He could just rob the money directly.</p><p></p><p>He thought this way, judging the gentleman by his own mean mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it seems like another day without any business." Qi Yuan said disappointedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, isn't my 990 taels considered business?" The petite woman couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Small business doesn't count as business."</p><p></p><p>"You..." The petite woman was speechless, "This, this, this... wrap a few of them up for me, I want to buy them."</p><p></p><p>She arrogantly pointed to a few small items, all of which were non-grade spiritual artifacts.</p><p></p><p>After all, that kind of grade spiritual artifact lightsaber cost 10,000 taels, and she didn't want to encounter any spiritual artifact assassins.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately beamed, handing the few small items to the petite woman: "A total of 572 taels."</p><p></p><p>He gave a figure with both zeros and integers, making himself look like a serious businessman.</p><p></p><p>The petite woman furrowed her brows.</p><p></p><p>If it were elsewhere, these non-grade spiritual artifacts would be so expensive, she definitely wouldn't bother buying them.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about the 10,000 taels lightsaber, she felt she was the one being cheated.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, these inferior spiritual artifacts had interesting designs.</p><p></p><p>"Is this considered business now?" The petite woman repeated.</p><p></p><p>"Medium business doesn't count as business." Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Greedy!" The petite woman cursed silently, then said, "You're quite creative, how about joining the Heavenly Crafting Hall with me?"</p><p></p><p>She finally revealed her true purpose.</p><p></p><p>Her grandfather was a member of the Heavenly Crafting Hall.</p><p></p><p>At this statement, the expressions of the stall owners and passersby in the area suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Heavenly Crafting Hall!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Crafting Hall is on par with the Artifact Craftsman Association?"</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Mountain Realm, all artifact craftsmen had an organization called the Artifact Craftsman Association. </p><p></p><p>All artifact certification and issuance were done by the Artifact Craftsman Association.</p><p></p><p>This was a huge organization that could influence some regimes.</p><p></p><p>The world knew the Artifact Craftsman Association was powerful, but in fact, there was a similarly large organization that was not inferior to the Artifact Craftsman Association - that was the Heavenly Crafting Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Artifact Craftsman Association had many members, and any artifact craftsman could join, with a low threshold.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Crafting Hall was different, it was an elite version of the Artifact Craftsman Association, only allowing some genius artifact craftsmen to join.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Crafting Hall had fewer members, its prestige was not much inferior to the Artifact Craftsman Association.</p><p></p><p>Many artifact craftsmen were proud to join the Heavenly Crafting Hall.</p><p></p><p>However, the threshold for joining the Heavenly Crafting Hall was too high, and many artifact craftsmen did not qualify, only high-grade artifact craftsmen could directly join.</p><p></p><p>"Can the Heavenly Crafting Hall give me 100,000 taels of silver per month? Can I use the materials for free?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was currently very weak, so he had only set his salary at 100,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>"...You, you're really crazy!" The petite woman was exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Remembering what her senior sister had said, this person was a lunatic, it seems it was true.</p><p></p><p>Join the Heavenly Crafting Hall and want 100,000 taels per month? Probably even Heavenly-grade artifact craftsmen don't have such treatment.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like there's no such benefits, the salary is too low, I'm not interested in joining." Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding stall owners looked at him with amazement.</p><p></p><p>Those passersby who knew the reputation of the Heavenly Crafting Hall also felt it was unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Which artifact craftsman wouldn't want to join the Heavenly Crafting Hall?</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know what the Heavenly Crafting Hall represents?" The petite woman was stunned that Qi Yuan had rejected her.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual artifacts Qi Yuan forged were full of creativity.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Crafting Hall was often introducing new things, and they needed people like Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No silver, no materials, and even..." Qi Yuan glanced at the ice-cold Xiu Simo, "No mount, I won't go."</p><p></p><p>"You..." The petite woman gritted her teeth in anger, her chest heaving.</p><p></p><p>She was so furious she could almost burst.</p><p></p><p>"This is the token of the Heavenly Crafting Hall. If you want to join, you can join the Heavenly Crafting Hall anytime with this token.</p><p></p><p>The token cannot be given to others."</p><p></p><p>The petite woman handed a token to Qi Yuan, then left with the spiritual artifacts she had purchased.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people looked at Qi Yuan with envious gazes.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Qi Yuan continued to run his stall, and when the night became pitch-black, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, heaven does not favor the diligent. I worked overtime until 12 o'clock, worked so hard, but in the end, I didn't sell a single spiritual artifact."</p><p></p><p>"Old man, is it because I'm not working hard enough?"</p><p></p><p>"Young master has worked very hard!" Chen Kangbao hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go home."</p><p></p><p>After packing up the stall, Qi Yuan took Chen Kangbao back.</p><p></p><p>The night was deep, and the moonlight seemed cold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan returned to the Shen Mansion, and found that the Shen Mansion today looked cleaner and more festive than usual.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, you're finally back!" </p><p></p><p>Outside the gate, a sleepy-eyed Shen Lingfeng with big eye bags poked out his head.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, my sister came back today!" Shen Lingfeng quickly said, "Unfortunately, she only stayed at home for a little over an hour, and seeing that you hadn't returned, she had an urgent matter and went to Aoyuan Lake again."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng looked regretful.</p><p></p><p>After all, his sister and brother-in-law, according to the actual situation, had not yet met.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "It's okay."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, brother-in-law... my sister is not an ordinary woman.</p><p></p><p>Although you are a master of romance, with high emotional intelligence, just a few words of sweet talk can make young ladies' hearts flutter.</p><p></p><p>But my sister is different, she is a true disciple of the Sky Sect... her personality is ice-cold, and if it weren't for her special physique, she might never marry in her lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, and Shen Lingfeng now stood by Qi Yuan's side. "I hope my brother-in-law can capture my sister soon! That way, my parents can rest easy."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng leaned in close to Qi Yuan's ear and said in a low voice, "My sister... she has a special quality that many covet her."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I've never even seen my sister's face," Shen Lingfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but ponder the "Ding Lu constitution."</p><p></p><p>He recalled the cold and aloof woman he had seen today, as if she was shrouded in a layer of mist, making it difficult to see her clearly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three people hurried down the winding path. </p><p></p><p>The one in the lead was a young master dressed elegantly.</p><p></p><p>The two following behind him seemed to be attendants, carrying goods on their shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, one would notice that these two attendants were exceptionally strong, not ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>The three walked in silence. Tu San Gong's gaze was downcast. "Fourth Uncle, Elder Zhan Lei, we'll be arriving at Kunling Ferry soon."</p><p></p><p>Faced with the threat from the Elder of the Thorn Blood, Tu San Gong naturally had not been idle. </p><p></p><p>He had reported the matter to his clan.</p><p></p><p>Thus, his Fourth Uncle and Elder Zhan Lei had come disguised as attendants.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Uncle was an early-stage Earth-grade Armored Soldier, with extraordinary strength, having once cleaved a mid-grade Devilish Spirit with a single stroke of his great sword.</p><p></p><p>As for Elder Zhan Lei, she was even more remarkable. </p><p></p><p>She was a mid-grade Earth-grade Armored Soldier, ranking among the top three in the Tu Clan's combat strength.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan saw Elder Zhan Lei, he would surely exclaim, "Big, very big, enormously huge! Her name suits her well - the Great Thunder Hawk, the Thunder Rabbit."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about the Elder of the Thorn Blood, the Black Crow. He's only an early-grade Earth-grade Armored Soldier. With me and Elder Zhan Lei here, there's nothing to be concerned about. </p><p></p><p>Even if he has a trump card or has broken through, me and Elder Zhan Lei are more than enough to subdue him!" Fourth Uncle said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, coveting our Tu Clan's resources, let's see if he can swallow it!" Elder Zhan Lei's eyes flashed with a murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tu San Gong felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, Tu San Gong's footsteps stopped outside Kunling Ferry.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Uncle and Elder Zhan Lei also placed the items they had been carrying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Tu San Gong looked at the misty Kunling Ferry ahead and slowly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Black Crow, Tu San has brought the resources!"</p><p></p><p>His voice boomed, echoing into the Kunling Ferry.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flapping sound came, and a hoarse voice spoke.</p><p></p><p>"You're smart, I'll credit your contribution to your token."</p><p></p><p>With that, the goods on the ground suddenly flew up and into the Kunling Ferry.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the pile of goods exploded with a huge rumble.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A massive roar, kicking up endless mud and creating a huge crater.</p><p></p><p>The Black Crow Elder in the air had a few of its feathers broken.</p><p></p><p>Its body was visibly injured, its white bones faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>It flew in the air, its eyes filled with murderous intent: "You brat, you're up to no good, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>It suddenly dove down, attacking Tu San Gong with terrifying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Black Crow Elder, this is Jining Prefecture, not your playground to run wild!" </p><p></p><p>Fourth Uncle dropped his disguise, his body suddenly growing larger. A golden light flashed, and a massive great sword appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He wielded the great sword, slashing with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding trees were felled, and the rocks tumbled down.</p><p></p><p>The clash between his sword and the Black Crow Elder's divine body rang out like the collision of metals.</p><p></p><p>"Throw!" At this moment, Elder Zhan Lei let out a loud shout, and two massive steel balls chained together were hurled towards the Black Crow Elder.</p><p></p><p>These steel balls were far larger than the Great Thunder, each the size of a threshing ground stone base. </p><p></p><p>The terrifying force of these iron balls, slamming into a person, would surely leave them bruised and battered.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The impact directly broke one of the Black Crow Elder's wings.</p><p></p><p>After this exchange, the Black Crow Elder had suffered heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Little San, see? With me here, there's no problem!" </p><p></p><p>Fourth Uncle proudly thumped his chest, confident of victory.</p><p></p><p>Tu San Gong was somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>Although they had severely injured the Black Crow Elder, given the latter's strength, while he could not defeat them, he could still retreat into the Kunling Ferry.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about the clan's goal of not losing resources and protecting him, the objective had now been achieved.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a chilling voice suddenly sounded in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Black Crow, you're utterly useless, can't even handle a small matter like this."</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhan Lei's spirit was on edge as she looked up to the sky, only to see a long black shadow.</p><p></p><p>It was... a snake, a Winged Snake!</p><p></p><p>"Winged Snake Elder, please help me, kill these people!" the Black Crow Elder pleaded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a pair of snake eyes fell upon the three, and they all felt a chill run down their spines, an endless sense of terror.</p><p></p><p>"You're the Winged Snake from the Moshan Kingdom, what are you doing in Jining Prefecture?" Elder Zhan Lei's scalp tingled.</p><p></p><p>They had only intended to deal with the Black Crow Elder, a peripheral elder of the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>Even if they killed him, it would be of no consequence.</p><p></p><p>But the Winged Snake... was different.</p><p></p><p>He was an elder of the Thorn Blood from the Moshan Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>The Moshan Kingdom's border was three thousand miles away, yet he had secretly infiltrated here.</p><p></p><p>There must be a grand conspiracy behind this! They had originally thought the Black Crow Elder was simply planning to leave the Ning Kingdom and extort Tu San Gong.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed the matter was not so simple, the waters were much deeper.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder was a peak Earth-grade Armored Soldier!</p><p></p><p>Decades ago, during the war between the Ning Kingdom and the Moshan Kingdom, this Winged Snake Elder had killed a high-grade Earth-grade Armored Soldier of the Ning Kingdom, who was even a prince! It could be said that the Winged Snake Elder had a notorious reputation.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder glanced indifferently at the three, his gaze settling on the Black Crow: "Did you get the item?"</p><p></p><p>"It's in my possession!" the Black Crow Elder hurriedly replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder Zhan Lei's spirit was shaken.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the Winged Snake Elder was already considered a true figure of importance.</p><p></p><p>But now, judging by his tone, the "master" who had sent him to Jining Prefecture was an even higher existence.</p><p></p><p>Was the master sending him to take something from the Black Crow Elder?</p><p></p><p>The three present suddenly felt they had been caught up in a grand conspiracy, as if they were about to suffer an undeserved calamity.</p><p></p><p>A wooden box fell onto the Winged Snake Elder's back and disappeared into its storage talisman.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the item, it seemed satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, it asked, "What about the person?"</p><p></p><p>"Still alive, although the master has obscured the heavenly secrets, I didn't dare to go too far, only taking the item," the Black Crow Elder said, a hint of fear flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder nodded slightly. "Having the item is enough, as for that person... whether they are important or not doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>It turned its gaze to the three present: "Since I've come to the Ning Kingdom, it would be impolite not to have a few appetizers."</p><p></p><p>It hissed, its breath foul and ominous.</p><p></p><p>Tu San Gong's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhan Lei and Fourth Uncle had long lost their earlier composure.</p><p></p><p>This was a terrifying existence at the peak of the Earth-grade Armored Soldier realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Dao Master of the Sky Palace intervened, it would not be easy to subdue this being!

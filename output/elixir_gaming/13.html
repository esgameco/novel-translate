        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the several imperial guards present, as well as the imperial guard commander, still had an expression of disbelief on their faces.</p><p></p><p>That was the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, a terrifying forbidden land that had existed for countless years.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme emperor was unable to enter.</p><p></p><p>For countless years, countless powerful experts had studied how to enter, but all had ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, they had simply walked in with a ladder? This was too easy, wasn't it? Jinli's voice was cold: "This matter must not be leaked to the outside!"</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to stake our lives that this matter will not be revealed to a second person!" The imperial guards present also knew the importance of this matter.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guard commander's expression was excited: "This is the blessing of our Emperor! Once we master the method of entering the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, and use human lives to go in, we will definitely be able to obtain many precious medicinal herbs from the outer regions!"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Forbidden Land had existed for at least ten thousand years, and no living being had ever entered it. The medicinal herbs within must be extremely abundant.</p><p></p><p>The depths of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land were still difficult for them to explore with their current strength.</p><p></p><p>But the outer regions must also have many medicinal herbs, and fewer fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guard commander spoke, wanting to directly enter while carrying the ladder.</p><p></p><p>Because, just in the outer regions, she had already seen several extremely precious medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's expression was calm and cold, not revealing the excitement in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She also had a ladder beside her, but she had not yet carried it, as she still needed to continue verifying.</p><p></p><p>"Do not act rashly for now, let's take a look."</p><p></p><p>Those three convicts were all extremely vicious and cruel individuals.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the three of them carried the ladder and entered the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Their faces showed shock and fear.</p><p></p><p>One of the male convicts saw a medicinal herb and his face revealed a greedy expression. He immediately picked it and stuffed it into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Outside, there were powerful imperial guards.</p><p></p><p>Eating the medicinal herbs was the only chance they had to survive.</p><p></p><p>As for escaping? </p><p></p><p>Their current speed was no different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards behind them were watching, how could they escape?</p><p></p><p>Eating the medicinal herbs was the only possible chance they had to survive.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guard commander saw the convicts eating the medicinal herbs, and she was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>Those medicinal herbs, even she would not dare to eat them.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were being gobbled up by these few convicts!</p><p></p><p>Jinli the Empress remained calm, without a word, staring into the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guard commander saw this, and could only remain in place, but her heart was extremely pained.</p><p></p><p>This hurt her more than if her flesh was torn from her chest.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Jinli's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards present also sensed something, and became alert.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a roar was heard, and a huge beast over ten feet tall, with blue eyes and white fur, appeared.</p><p></p><p>It stomped the ground, and the trees and everything around were crushed, with wood chips flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>This huge beast was only a few hundred meters away from the three convicts.</p><p></p><p>For such a fierce beast, a distance of a few hundred meters was just a matter of a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Qi Tiger!" The imperial guard commander's expression was grave. "A demonic king-level terrifying beast!"</p><p></p><p>She was a king-level expert, with a cultivation level on par with this Blue Qi Tiger.</p><p></p><p>But in actual combat, she was no match for this Blue Qi Tiger.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Qi Tiger had a bloodthirsty nature, and those three convicts were doomed.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, with the appearance of the Blue Qi Tiger, they could no longer enter the outer regions of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, or a collision would occur.</p><p></p><p>Upon discovering the existence of the Blue Qi Tiger, two of the convicts immediately dropped the ladder and fled in a panic.</p><p></p><p>The remaining one was so frightened that his legs went weak, and he tightly clung to the ladder, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Qi Tiger let out a roar, and a qi blast shot out from its mouth, directly towards the two fleeing convicts.</p><p></p><p>The convicts' bodies instantly stiffened, and they directly fell to the ground, their bodies torn to shreds and bloody.</p><p></p><p>As for the one remaining, who was crouching on the ground and clinging to the ladder, he was so terrified that he wet his pants.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Qi Tiger looked at the last convict, a strange expression flashing in its eyes, as if it was contemplating, or even showing a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blue Qi Tiger then left.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guard commander was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The other imperial guards were the same.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Blue Qi Tiger just leave? Wasn't it a bloodthirsty beast? If humans had entered, it would have definitely...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Was it attacked by it? In the eyes of Empress Jinli, a trace of complex emotions flashed.</p><p></p><p>With a ladder on the back, one could enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area without obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not lie to her.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was true. Qi Yuan... who are you exactly?</p><p></p><p>Jinli felt a bit confused, and a sense of inferiority also arose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However, she soon cast aside this emotion: "Everyone, take the ladder on your back and follow me to enter.</p><p></p><p>Remember, even if you encounter a terrifying beast, the ladder must not be separated from you, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"As you command!"</p><p></p><p>The several forbidden soldiers agreed.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the forbidden soldiers persuaded: "Your Majesty's identity is noble, how can you be in a dangerous place? Let us go in, and Your Majesty can wait here."</p><p></p><p>Empress Jinli thought of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If she didn't go in, she would be too ungrateful for Qi Yuan's trust.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, I'll go in with you." Empress Jinli's words were unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>A group of people, carrying ladders, entered the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>The prisoner who was still alive was also handled by them.</p><p></p><p>"So many spiritual herbs!"</p><p>"This is the Three Flower Fragrance!"</p><p>"Xuanyu Grass!"</p><p>"Green Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>The several forbidden soldiers who entered the outer area of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Because there were too many spiritual herbs here.</p><p></p><p>For tens of thousands of years, no one has entered here.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual herbs here can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other forbidden areas, the spiritual herbs in the outer area have long been picked by the strong.</p><p></p><p>But in the depths, even the strong dare not go in.</p><p></p><p>And now, they are picking in the outer area of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, which can be said to be a bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>"In just an hour, we have already picked 23 king-grade spiritual herbs." Jinli couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>King-grade spiritual herbs, even as the Empress of the Southern Qian Kingdom, Jinli had only used less than ten of them from childhood to the present.</p><p></p><p>But here, in just a short while, 23 were collected.</p><p></p><p>As for other grades of spiritual herbs, the quantity is even more.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the harvest in just a short while is worth more than the national treasury's annual income.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the forbidden soldiers' face flushed with excitement: "With so many spiritual herbs, we don't know how many strong experts we can cultivate and how many high-level talents we can recruit to serve!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli's heart was also joyful.</p><p></p><p>She thought of what Qi Yuan had said, that he had already broken through this Xuanyuan Forbidden Area copy, yes, it's called a copy.</p><p></p><p>She thought of something and said, "We must go to the depths of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area and pick the emperor-grade spiritual herbs, especially the Nine Flower Brocade Lotus."</p><p></p><p>Jinli wanted to go deeper, indeed to pick the Nine Flower Brocade Lotus.</p><p></p><p>But there was another reason.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding forbidden soldiers' expressions changed slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, there are emperor-grade spiritual herbs, but there must also be emperor-level fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>If they encounter a king-level fierce beast, they can still escape.</p><p></p><p>If they encounter an emperor-level fierce beast, it would be almost impossible to escape alive.</p><p></p><p>Their hands gripping the ladders tightened unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know if the ladders would still be of any use.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to go with Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jinli nodded.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to turn the situation around, but these 20-odd king-grade spiritual herbs were far from enough.</p><p></p><p>She must obtain the Nine Flower Brocade Lotus to heal Qin Aunt's injury, and even help Qin Aunt advance further.</p><p></p><p>She also needs to pick other emperor-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she also wants to see the place where Qi Yuan had stayed for half a year in the depths of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>A group of beautiful ladies, carrying ladders, walked cautiously in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they encountered fierce beasts, whether strong or weak, fierce or gentle, they were ignored by the beasts, as if the beasts were afraid of hurting Jinli and the others.</p><p></p><p>This scene made the commander of the forbidden soldiers exclaim in amazement: "We are carrying ladders, and we can enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, and these fierce beasts even won't attack us. This is really unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>She finished speaking, and her tone changed: "I wonder who is the extraordinary person who told this method to Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Jinli, and they were also very curious.</p><p></p><p>That must be an unparalleled sovereign, right?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

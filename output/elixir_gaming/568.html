        <h1>Chapter 568</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu's heart and mind were trembling.</p><p></p><p>How long would he have to hide? He had been here the whole time.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't been hiding at all.</p><p></p><p>Then who was Lin Yuan referring to? In a flash, Cang Yu realized that his biggest secret had likely been discovered by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When the Ninth Mysterious Venerable discovered the mysterious space, Cang Yu had already transferred there through other means ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>The moment he entered that mysterious space, a childlike voice appeared in his mind, which had been communicating with him on a spiritual level all along.</p><p></p><p>The childlike voice claimed to be the guardian of the inheritance in that mysterious space, and had chosen Cang Yu as the inheritor.</p><p></p><p>At first, Cang Yu was half-convinced, but later the childlike voice's many pointers greatly benefited him, and he finally believed.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, before taking away the mysterious space, the Ninth Mysterious Venerable briefly made eye contact with Cang Yu, forming a karmic relationship.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, under the relentless search of a certain Venerable, Cang Yu was still captured.</p><p></p><p>Even so, faced with the endless torment of the Calamity Talks, it was the childlike voice in his mind that bore most of the suffering.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Cang Yu would not have been able to persist until now.</p><p></p><p>The childlike voice was extremely secretive, and even the Ninth Mysterious Venerable did not detect anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Cang Yu thought Lin Yuan wouldn't discover it either.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, it was still seen through by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to sense the fluctuation of another consciousness within Cang Yu, entirely because of the universe within his own body.</p><p></p><p>When forcibly taking Cang Yu out of the Ninth Mysterious Realm, Lin Yuan casually absorbed him into the universe within his own body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner universe was a transformed version of the "Infinite Void" inheritance passed down through thirteen stages. Not only was it comparable in scale to the inner universe of a Chaos Venerable, but its perception of subtle forces was even slightly stronger than ordinary Chaos Venerables.</p><p></p><p>After all, the "Infinite Void" originated from a Thirteenth Stage Time Life, representing the foundation of the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body and two major divine spirits had all cultivated the first layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of the attainment of this inheritance, the true body and divine spirits would be slightly stronger.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that while Lin Yuan had only vaguely sensed the consciousness fluctuation on Cang Yu before his true body arrived, he was now basically certain.</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan's true body appeared next to Cang Yu, in addition to unleashing the Heaven-Rending Claw, was to confirm the consciousness fluctuation on the other party with his own inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>But then the childlike voice sounded in his mind again, "No need to say anything, since I've already been discovered, there's no need to hide anymore."</p><p></p><p>The childlike voice was well aware that with Lin Yuan's level of ability, once he said such words, he must be confident enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he wasn't confident, what could be done about it? As long as Lin Yuan had doubts, the childlike voice had to come out.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu's eyes suddenly closed, and when they reopened, they had become profoundly calm, as if containing entire universes.</p><p></p><p>Observing Cang Yu, Lin Yuan's expression became grave. "Are you a Venerable or a Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the 'Cang Yu' before Lin Yuan gave him a very special feeling, similar to the imprint left by the Lord of the Demon Jade Tower on the Ninth Floor of the Black Tower, with a vast and all-encompassing aura of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of sheer power, the 'Cang Yu' in front of him was definitely not as strong as the Lord of the Demon Jade Tower, but they were roughly on the same level.</p><p></p><p>That's why Lin Yuan asked if he was a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint?" </p><p></p><p>The 'Cang Yu' smiled slightly. "I was one before, but not anymore."</p><p></p><p>"You were?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed him carefully, looking quite puzzled. "With the abilities of a Great Saint, even if only a remnant soul remained, they should be able to recover quickly. Why maintain this half-living, half-dead state of will?"</p><p></p><p>'Cang Yu' did not beat around the bush, but directly explained, "Simply put, I am no longer myself. I am just a soul fragment that I, the true me, have refined."</p><p></p><p>"Soul fragment?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart was stirred.</p><p></p><p>A soul fragment is fundamentally different from a clone. The main body and clone share the same consciousness, and strictly speaking, they are the same being. If the clone is affected by memory contamination or other methods, the main body will also be affected.</p><p></p><p>But the main body and soul fragment are already two separate entities. The soul fragment has developed its own new consciousness, though it has inherited the main body's consciousness, personality, habits, and memories.</p><p></p><p>Normally, no powerful cultivator is willing to refine a soul fragment, because there is a risk of the fragment "devouring the master".</p><p></p><p>"Correct," the 'Cang Yu' nodded.</p><p></p><p>A soul fragment inherits everything from the main body, but it cannot inherit the main body's cultivation level, abilities, and insights. That's why it cannot recover the power of a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if a soul fragment could inherit the main body's insights, Great Saints would definitely create batches of soul fragments, fearing no one under heaven.</p><p></p><p>But since the inheritance of power and insights is impossible, the eyesight of the Great Saint level remains. A Great Saint's soul fragment, with its rich cultivation experience, is often able to see through the problems and confusions faced by cultivators at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when a Great Saint is willing to refine their own soul fragment, it is usually for the purpose of cultivating a successor.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the most important function of a soul fragment is that if the main body and its clones are destroyed, the soul fragment will not be affected.</p><p></p><p>After all, the soul fragment is a completely new life, just extremely similar to the main body.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about your main body?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"My main body," the 'Cang Yu' paused for a moment, "should now be trapped in a certain time loop."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>Being trapped in a time loop meant attempting to break through to the Thirteenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>When a Chaos Venerable reaches perfection and tries to break through to the Thirteenth Stage, they will be trapped in a time loop.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking out of this time loop can they advance to the Thirteenth Stage. If they fail to break free, they will remain trapped in it forever.</p><p></p><p>Normally, whether Chaos Saints or Peerless Great Saints, they all have the qualifications to attempt the breakthrough to the Thirteenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"What is this time loop like?" Lin Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye had once voluntarily discussed this topic with Lin Yuan, saying that there was no need to understand it in detail before reaching Chaos Venerable perfection.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, my main body didn't leave behind those memories," the 'Cang Yu' shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps they didn't want to pass that information on," Lin Yuan said, comforting him.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, any Chaos Venerable trapped in a time loop has the possibility of breaking free.</p><p></p><p>But theory is just theory. If they can't break free within ten universal cycles, the chances of breaking free later become infinitely low.</p><p></p><p>"The prospects don't seem very good," the 'Cang Yu' looked at Lin Yuan, his expression returning to normal. "I hope to make a deal with you."</p><p></p><p>"A deal?" Lin Yuan looked at the 'Cang Yu' and asked, "What kind of deal?"</p><p></p><p>"With your strength, you should be able to refine a Karma Robe according to the method I provide," the 'Cang Yu' said. "The Karma Robe can shield against karma. The disciple I chose is still too weak, with too low an understanding of the karma laws, which is why they were captured by the Ninth Mysterious Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The 'Cang Yu' said this with a somewhat helpless tone. Although Cang Yu was now safe, as long as he left Lin Yuan's protection, he would still be locked down by the Ninth Mysterious Venerable through karma.</p><p></p><p>Even though Cang Yu had already handed over the mysterious inheritance space to Lin Yuan, he basically had no other value left.</p><p></p><p>"Karma Robe?" Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged as he asked, "Since it's a deal, what can you give me?"</p><p></p><p>"That inheritance space was left behind by my main body, and it contains some Great Saint-level inheritances," the 'Cang Yu' paused for a moment before continuing, "but none of the inheritances are complete, the key parts are not there."</p><p></p><p>This was a normal precaution. The purpose was to prevent the inheritance space from being forcibly broken into and the inheritances falling into the hands of enemies.</p><p></p><p>Without the key parts of the inheritances, their usefulness would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Lineage inheritance and the Demon Jade Space that Lin Yuan had previously obtained both had similar guardian roles who held the key parts of the inheritances.</p><p></p><p>If one did not obtain the inheritances through the proper channels...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, you definitely won't get the key points of the inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, I'm also willing to share the cultivation memories of my true self," said 'Cang Yu Long' as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest price he could offer. As a split soul, his most precious possession was his own memories.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't actually that interested in the key points of the inheritance. With his extraordinary comprehension, as long as he had the inheritance content, he could deduce the entire content.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation memories of a Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious about that. The two Great Saints he had encountered before, Emperor Xuan and the Master of the Demon Jade Tower, had not left behind anything similar.</p><p></p><p>And even if there were recordings, they would be far inferior to the actual memory scenes, which included the Great Saint's feelings and perspectives, making them infinitely more precious than ordinary recordings.</p><p></p><p>"Deal," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although the split soul was not the true self of the Great Saint, its realm was still there, and Lin Yuan couldn't forcibly search its soul, so he could only rely on the other party's willingness to provide the memory scenes.</p><p></p><p>"Good." 'Cang Yu Long' smiled, "This is the method for refining the Karma Robe, and the materials have already been collected."</p><p></p><p>Before being searched by the Ninth Profound Venerable, the childlike voice had already planned to request a Venerable to refine the Karma Robe, but hadn't had the chance to do so before being captured.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at it and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The method for refining the Karma Robe was not difficult, the key point being the need to have a profound understanding of the Karma Dao, and then constantly imprint the Karma Dao with the cosmic power within one's body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan refined it in just half a day.</p><p></p><p>'Cang Yu Long' carefully examined it, his expression showing satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>According to the original plan, he needed to request a Venerable to refine the Karma Robe, but that would certainly involve some risk.</p><p></p><p>"These are all the key points of the inheritance, as well as some of my cultivation memory scenes," 'Cang Yu Long' said without hesitation, taking out a crystal-clear stone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the stone, briefly checked it and confirmed there were no issues, then put it away.</p><p></p><p>He then handed over the miniature world containing all the Stone People Tribe to 'Cang Yu Long'.</p><p></p><p>However, before that, Lin Yuan had already selected a Stone Person from the billions in the miniature world and transferred it into his own cosmic universe, intending to take it as a disciple after returning, to fulfill the promise he had made to 'Cang Wei Yang'.</p><p></p><p>The transaction was complete.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at 'Cang Yu Long' and casually asked, "What are your plans for the future?"</p><p></p><p>"When my true self was still alive, I secretly established a force with a Venerable as its leader. I plan to bring him to join that force," 'Cang Yu Long' said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," Lin Yuan nodded, not probing further.</p><p></p><p>In the vast and chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>'Cang Yu Long's' gaze changed, and a certain aura was being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Where am I?" </p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long suddenly woke up, looking around with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look around," the childlike voice sounded in his mind. "Your previous senior has left, and all your tribespeople are now in my cosmic universe."</p><p></p><p>"My senior has left?" Cang Yu Long asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't he mistreat you?" the childlike voice asked with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"No, not at all," Cang Yu Long replied. "This Venerable who has a connection with my Stone People Tribe is quite good-natured, otherwise we would all be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>It was exceptionally rare for him to remain unperturbed upon realizing the childlike voice belonged to a Great Saint's split soul. A Great Saint's split soul, while not strong in power, possessed most of a Great Saint's memories, which would be an irresistible temptation for any Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The childlike voice had no idea that Lin Yuan couldn't be bothered to keep it around. If he tried to forcibly retain it, the childlike voice would certainly not submit, and since Lin Yuan couldn't forcibly search its soul, it didn't hold much significance for him.</p><p></p><p>Other Venerables were willing to persist because their cultivation progress was slow, but with Lin Yuan's cultivation speed, from the Dao-Splitting realm to the Chaotic realm, he basically had no major bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>"Don't space out, now hurry and go to the void domain I mentioned," the childlike voice urged.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long immediately obeyed the childlike voice's prompting, but still couldn't help asking, "Will I ever see my senior again?"</p><p></p><p>"See your senior?" The childlike voice pondered. "You've seen that powerful expert too many times, he's seen through your every move. Do you still want to see him again?"</p><p></p><p>The childlike voice continued, "If you really want to see him, you'll need to at least reach the Chaotic Realm and become a Venerable before you can go see him. With the Chaotic Realm's strength, along with the inheritance I've given you, even if you go see him again, you'll have the ability to protect yourself, and I can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Realm?" Cang Yu Long's expression twitched. He had no idea when he would be able to reach the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient Chaotic Continent, the Star Tear 'Fragment World'.</p><p></p><p>After properly arranging the Stone Person in human civilization, Lin Yuan began to ponder the crystal-clear stone.</p><p></p><p>The stone contained part of a Great Saint's cultivation memories, which was the most valuable thing to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After examining the stone for a while, Lin Yuan immediately extended a thread of his consciousness to penetrate into it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan's consciousness entered a vast world.</p><p></p><p>This should also be the Chaotic Void, with endless Chaotic Qi drifting in the distance.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of Lin Yuan's vision, a massive figure was seated in meditation.</p><p></p><p>This massive figure exuded an aura of extreme heaviness. A single wisp of its aura could collapse a universe.</p><p></p><p>Not just seemingly, but a single casual wisp of its aura could cause a universe nurtured in the Chaotic Void to enter premature destruction.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of a Great Saint?" Lin Yuan was shocked. This was the first time he had directly experienced the true power of a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Emperor Xuan or the Master of the Demon Jade Tower, the imprints Lin Yuan had seen did not truly reflect the true power of these two peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>As for the Demon Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint? Lin Yuan had only remotely sensed the aftershocks of their battles, and knew no more.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan saw the massive figure begin to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>If it were just a simple recording, it would be dull and boring, but now Lin Yuan was experiencing the actual memory scenes.</p><p></p><p>He fully synchronized with the feelings and experiences of this Great Saint during their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"So this is how the Chaotic Void appears in the eyes of a Great Saint?" Lin Yuan was enthralled, and a flood of insights kept surging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary. Experiencing the cultivation process of an unknown life has greatly enhanced your own cultivation insights.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was completely immersed in observing the cultivation of a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, but Lin Yuan didn't know how long.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation memory has been extremely helpful to me," Lin Yuan smiled. Not every Great Saint was willing to share their cultivation memories.</p><p></p><p>Because once the memory scenes fell into the hands of an enemy, they could potentially expose the Great Saint's weaknesses and flaws.</p><p></p><p>Only a Great Saint about to break through to the Thirteenth Rank would dare to do this. Because if they failed in the breakthrough, what did it matter if others knew their weaknesses? And if they succeeded, becoming a Thirteenth Rank Time Life, their weaknesses being known throughout the Chaotic Void would no longer matter.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The inheritance space has been refined?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>While immersed in comprehending the Great Saint's cultivation memories, Lin Yuan had also been refining that inheritance space. With the active cooperation of the 'Cang Yu Long' Great Saint's split soul, the refinement of this inheritance space was almost effortless, and Lin Yuan soon took control of it.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Lin Yuan immediately divided a thread of his consciousness to enter that inheritance space.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Tree." Lin Yuan looked at the Chaotic Tree deep within the inheritance space, which was the most precious treasure in this inheritance space, a Twelfth Star Extraordinary Treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan greatly desired it.</p><p></p><p>"Now I'll transplant it into my cosmic universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began the 'transplantation' of the Chaotic Tree.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble, rumble. The Chaotic Tree, towering and vast, soon took root in Lin Yuan's cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The moment the Chaotic Tree was fully rooted, a earth-shaking transformation began to unfold within Lin Yuan's cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

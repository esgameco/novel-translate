        <h1>Chapter 568</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku felt like he was getting lost in the book, seeing hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>How could his own name appear in the book, and even the events that happened in his dreams were recorded in the book?</p><p></p><p>It was a bit eerie and strange.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, feeling a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>He continued reading.</p><p></p><p>"Under the shroud of the dark sky, none can withstand the fourth layer of the Yang Deity."</p><p></p><p>"Although Qi Yuan has entered the 'Pseudo-Yang Deity Fourth Layer', he is still not in the true Yang Deity Fourth Layer."</p><p></p><p>"A billion years ago, he lost his eyes and could no longer see anything in the world."</p><p></p><p>"In the next few hundred million years, he lost his ears, eyebrows and nose, he could no longer hear the sound of the wind or smell the fragrance of the flowers and plants."</p><p></p><p>"In the last hundred million years, he lost his mouth, the things he lost kept increasing."</p><p></p><p>"One day, he will lose everything, lose his physical body, lose his consciousness, lose his true spirit, and step into the Yang Deity Fourth Layer, becoming another Dark Sky."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku looked at these words, his expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"So you have to go see the female lead!" He really wanted to tell the male protagonist.</p><p></p><p>But the current male protagonist had even lost his hearing, would shouting be of any use? At night, Wang Ku entered the dream world again, and he saw that battered figure once more.</p><p></p><p>That figure, thin and frail, features broken, stood tall in the sky, fighting the terrifying black bubbles alone.</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed to have lasted for countless billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, go see the female lead!" Wang Ku shouted with all his might.</p><p></p><p>However, the figure stood motionless, as if it had not heard his voice.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, he has no hearing, no vision... How do I tell him... to go see the female lead?" Wang Ku was a little nervous, worried about the male protagonist in the book.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the endless space-time, Qi Yuan's body was shattered, his features dissolved, now his physical form was almost non-existent, only a thread of true spirit still preserved his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Sky... cannot be resisted."</p><p></p><p>"Not even the Yang Deity Fourth Layer can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>"Have I finally lost?"</p><p></p><p>In all these games, this was the first time Qi Yuan felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forget Heart Sutra, Doing as One Pleases, and Absolute Adaptation were already strong enough.</p><p></p><p>But he still could not cross the chasm from the Yang Deity Third Layer to the Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only be considered a 'pseudo-fourth layer', so he could barely resist the Dark Sky.</p><p></p><p>But under the Dark Sky, his consciousness, his body, were constantly dissolving.</p><p></p><p>"Step into the Yang Deity Fourth Layer?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the Yang Deity Fourth Layer, he would be able to truly resist the Dark Sky, or even devour it.</p><p></p><p>But with his current strength, after the Yang Deity Fourth Layer, he would become an even more terrifying monster than the Dark Sky.</p><p></p><p>Now, he understood that the so-called Yang Deity Fourth Layer was to abandon everything, just to pursue strength, to preserve the most fundamental qualities.</p><p></p><p>This kind of abandonment includes the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>This also means that once he steps into the Yang Deity Fourth Layer, he will truly perish, and Qi Yuan will no longer exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>This ending, he was not willing to accept.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no way to break through?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the hope...?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness was muddled.</p><p></p><p>Facing the terrifying Dark Sky, he did not know how long he could still resist.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, his true spirit will eventually be extinguished, it's just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly paused, as if he saw countless spirit blood raining down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... my blood?"</p><p></p><p>He remembered that when the game was about to crash, he had used his blood to save it.</p><p></p><p>"What time am I in... my blood is falling... will I descend again?"</p><p></p><p>"No, in any timeline, there is only the true self."</p><p></p><p>In the endless years, Qi Yuan's consciousness was muddled, only a thread of true spirit kept him lucid.</p><p></p><p>What he saw, no longer had any light.</p><p></p><p>What he smelled, no longer had any fragrance.</p><p></p><p>What he heard, no longer had any thunder.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, the true spirit will eventually be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Either he will perish, or he will step into the Yang Deity Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>He knew that he could skip the Yang Deity Fourth Layer and step into the Yang Deity Fifth Layer, so he did not want to enter the Yang Deity Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I can observe this world with my blood, so I can preserve a thread of true spirit's activity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very mystical.</p><p></p><p>The past affects the present.</p><p>The future affects the past.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't think too much, or his brain would explode, and it was tiring.</p><p></p><p>In different space-times, he kept resisting the Dark Sky, his features dissolving, fortunately his blood, the human it transformed into, kept replacing him to touch this world, feel the sound of the wind, and enjoy the rain.</p><p></p><p>"But... this is a cycle."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He knew, this kind of life would not last long.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when all his blood returns to his true self, it will no longer be able to replace him to perceive the world.</p><p></p><p>His true spirit... will truly perish.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so tired, I hope a rich woman can see my stubbornness and strength."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had sensed that the Godly Arrival was besieged and betrayed, falling.</p><p></p><p>He also sensed that the Mortal Qi Yuan failed to break through to the Ancestral God, sitting alone in the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So... have I lost?"</p><p></p><p>The only thread of true spirit was constantly dissolving.</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as Qi Yuan, with the Great Forget Heart Sutra and Doing as One Pleases, could not stop the dissolution of the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan thought of many people.</p><p></p><p>He thought of Jinli, thought of Jinsi Canary, thought of Ningdao, and also thought of the busty disciple sister Jiang Lingsu, and his wife in this world, Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>"After all, I'm just an ordinary person, in the last moments of life, I'll also use the Reminiscence Technique."</p><p></p><p>The true spirit flickered like a candle flame, about to be extinguished at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"A new Godly Arrival has been born."</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal Qi Yuan... has succeeded in becoming a Mortal."</p><p></p><p>"Is everything over?"</p><p></p><p>"No, why haven't I dissipated yet?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had thought that when all his blood returned to his true self, unable to replace him to perceive the world, that would be the moment his true spirit was completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>But... he was still alive.</p><p></p><p>"It's... the new Godly Arrival, still replacing me... perceiving this world." Qi Yuan realized something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao is fifty, the Heaven is forty-nine, the imperfect all depart one."</p><p></p><p>"I will give it... a spring."</p><p></p><p>"Spring?"</p><p></p><p>"Catalpa!"</p><p></p><p>"So the missing word on the stone tablet at Sunset Cliff was 'spring'!"</p><p></p><p>"She gave me the spring!"</p><p></p><p>"The correct one is..."</p><p></p><p>"In the past there was a catalpa, standing quietly in the profound. Now I think of you, like a tree awaiting spring. Subtle, subtle, do not seek me."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient Qi catalpa tree!"</p><p></p><p>"So... it's the master!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>"She knew this ending, so she kept telling me to leave."</p><p></p><p>"When I obtained the Godly Wood Token, I once heard a 'flee' word."</p><p></p><p>"The stone tablet at Sunset Cliff was also telling me... not to descend into this world."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Moonlight Goddess Yuanjun in the past, or the future, but not in the present?"</p><p></p><p>"So... the master is also in the Yang Deity Fourth Layer."</p><p></p><p>"No, she is the consciousness or the awakened consciousness in the Yang Deity Fourth Layer that interacts with me."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had sorted out all his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Deity Fourth Layer has no consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Master Ahen Yishe, was originally the catalpa in the Yang Deity Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan's awakened superpower, related to the mouth, is the ability to speak freely, which can be heard by the unknown, and at the same time, strange things happen.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Profound Changes.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, the Soundless Voice... finally gave birth to its own consciousness, evolving from the Fourth Layer of the Sun God into the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>But, she is the Fourth Layer of the Sun God, knowing the past, present, and future, so she has been preventing Qi Yuan from coming.</p><p></p><p>"So, she... is the female lead that person spoke of?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, can I see you?" Qi Yuan's smile was somewhat sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Sun God does not exist in the present world. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>This means that unless he also enters the Fourth Layer of the Sun God, he will not be able to see her.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Black Sky has already exhausted all of his true spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>To see the Master again... will he be able to see her?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan thought of something, and a happy smile appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Master has also been... trying to see him.</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Abyss, the initial Dreamlike Illusion was not an illusion, but the Master.</p><p></p><p>In the Shenguang Sect... that graceful figure was also her.</p><p></p><p>And... many, many more.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have seen you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's smile was as brilliant as the stars.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the endless river of time.</p><p></p><p>The Aolan Realm.</p><p></p><p>A young and handsome man was breathing the air of the other world, feeling it quite sweet.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blurry and charming figure in front of him, with a curious expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>【Her name is Ruan Yixie, and she is your beautiful master on the surface, but she may actually be your wife.】</p><p></p><p>"Just got married after crossing over?" The handsome man was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"Master's wife?" He called out.</p><p></p><p>The woman was dressed in a long, curved robe, with wide sleeves sweeping the ground, like an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could not see her face, only her back.</p><p></p><p>But just from the back, she was already a rare beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you speak, are you mute?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, maybe she's shy, Master, wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>"You didn't drive me away, which means you've accepted me as your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, Qi Yuan will be Ruan Yixie's disciple!"</p><p></p><p>In the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The young and handsome young man stretched and casually threw the small wooden fish snack into the mouth of the wooden cat puppet.</p><p></p><p>He lay on the bed, sleeping comfortably.</p><p></p><p>After waking up, he washed up and walked out of the courtyard, looking at the palace in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Another day missing the Master."</p><p></p><p>The clouds on the peak dispersed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a strange light: "So... the Master I knew back then was also missing me?"</p><p></p><p>Another day, Qi Yuan held a first-grade foundation-building spiritual object, the Yellow Flower Fruit: "Master, your disciple Qi Yuan has brought the betrothal gift."</p><p></p><p>The clouds in the sky gathered, quite magnificent.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Master is very happy?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In the Fourth Layer of the Sun God, there is no consciousness, and even if the Master has awakened or recovered her consciousness because of him, she may have been in a daze all along, only occasionally having a moment of clarity.</p><p></p><p>Above the Arching Stars.</p><p></p><p>The robot Zero-One looked at Qi Yuan: "Master, the three of us haven't taken a group photo yet, do you want to take one together?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, take a group photo? No problem." The man in the blood-red robe said.</p><p></p><p>The sky was pitch black, the stars dim, he stood on the lawn, Zero-One hugging Xie Xinsu, the three of them showing the signature group photo smile.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a warm and cool moonlight shone down, falling on Qi Yuan's blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>The photo was captured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the photo, pensive: "The moon falling on my shoulder, this can also be considered our group photo."</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes appeared, only to shatter at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride." Qi Yuan gently called.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a small, exquisite bridal dress appeared.</p><p></p><p>She stood next to Qi Yuan, timid, and though she had no beautiful face, graceful figure, or jade feet, she seemed to be the most beautiful woman in the world.</p><p></p><p>He held the little bride's cold little hand, a smile on his face: "So you've been here all along."</p><p></p><p>"Before, it was you who transformed into the blood armor to protect me, to shelter me, and now... it's my turn to protect..."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the little bride, and though she had no eyes, there was countless tenderness and deep affection in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"This time... it's my turn to bury myself in the ground."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie."</p><p></p><p>"Who I am, I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>"I only know that I can't see the light, hear the thunder, or smell the fragrance. The world is void, desolate, and unchanging."</p><p></p><p>"One day, there was a very noisy person who kept talking."</p><p></p><p>"He was so noisy, I really wanted him to shut up."</p><p></p><p>"Well... actually, talking more is not bad."</p><p></p><p>"I like to hear those stories."</p><p></p><p>"Awakening the seven orifices?"</p><p></p><p>"If I open the seven orifices, will I be able to..."</p><p></p><p>"I failed, the sky bled."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie, I don't know who I am."</p><p></p><p>"I've lived in the Shenmu Abyss since I was young, always alone."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I just snuck out for a trip, secretly slept in the dirt, why was I dug out by a blood robe?"</p><p></p><p>"The key is, he even tied me up in five ways and forcibly married me!"</p><p></p><p>"I have a husband now, so I have a family member too? Okay, it's just that this husband... is a piece of clothing."</p><p></p><p>"He can't speak, so I made eight wooden boards for him."</p><p></p><p>"One represents cuddling, one represents happiness."</p><p></p><p>"It's good to have a husband with me."</p><p></p><p>"Husband... is gone."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie, I remember who I am."</p><p></p><p>"I'm a blind, deaf, and mute person..."</p><p></p><p>"My eyes were given to me by my husband."</p><p></p><p>"My ears were given to me by my husband."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want... him to give me these!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie, a failure who has failed countless times."</p><p></p><p>"I have finally become a real person."</p><p></p><p>"My husband, has become the true blood robe."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll listen to my husband's words."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe was being consecrated by countless people.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's eyes held a painful and reluctant expression.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is the water, the eighth primitive rule of the Shenmu Universe."</p><p></p><p>"He is the eighth human enlightenment!"</p><p></p><p>"Only by creating the eight human enlightenments can the primitive consciousness of the Shenmu Universe be revived for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"She will carry the eight human enlightenments, wearing the eighth and most powerful human enlightenment... to slay the Black Sky!" Sheng Nü said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"What will happen to him?"</p><p></p><p>"He's already dead!"</p><p></p><p>Three years later.</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>A majestic aura suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>A pure, divine, and beautiful goddess appeared, wearing a blood-red battle armor, her entire body emanating a scorching bright light.</p><p></p><p>The scorching light appeared, and the black bubbles instantly melted.</p><p></p><p>The goddess's figure and the black bubbles disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky... dissolved.</p><p></p><p>The whole universe cheered.</p><p></p><p>The "Shenmu Book" records that the goddess revived, carrying the eight human enlightenments, driving away the Black Sky, and the world saw the light again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>A shadowy figure lingered.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ruan Yixie."</p><p></p><p>"This is my past."</p><p></p><p>The distant sound of a lullaby echoed in the vast Shenmu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"The mountain has cedar trees, the clouds have drizzling rain.</p><p>The drizzling rain is lonely, not sharing with me.</p><p>Since I've met the gentleman, my heart is not confused.</p><p></p><p>The mountain has cedar trees, the wild has yellow reeds.</p><p>The yellow reeds are lonely, not sharing with me.</p><p>Since I've recognized the gentleman, my heart is not anxious.</p><p></p><p>The mountain has cedar trees, the sky has thunder and snakes.</p><p>The thunder and snakes have no sound, not speaking with me.</p><p>Since I've spoken with the gentleman, my heart is not displeased.</p><p></p><p>The mountain has cedar trees, the swamp has green reeds.</p><p>The green reeds are dense, not appreciating with me.</p><p>If I see the gentleman, my heart will be relieved."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

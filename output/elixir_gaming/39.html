        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Qi Yuan was still in his dream.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a clear voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, when did you come back?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan woke up from his dream.</p><p></p><p>He tidied up a bit and walked out of the room, still with a sleepy look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I came back last night," he said, looking at Jiang Lingsu. "Little Sister, how did you know I was back? You didn't sneak a peek at me sleeping, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was annoyed.</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to say that she found her yard's trash pile had been rummaged through this morning.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, that would easily hurt her Big Brother's self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>She calmly said, "Big Brother, isn't your knife still tied up in the yard?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at the kitchen knife tied with a rope, like a pet.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the knife and had a suspicious look.</p><p></p><p>In this destruction of the Black Mountain Sect, he gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the biggest gain was the Black Mountain Sect's library, which Qi Yuan had cleared out.</p><p></p><p>As for the other spirit stones and spiritual objects, he had rushed away without taking too many.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the spiritual objects he obtained were still of great value, and the knife had eaten its fill.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's current cultivation was just at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>He was able to kill Yuandan cultivators completely relying on the power of the knife.</p><p></p><p>It's just like in "Investiture of the Gods", where there was a powerful treasure that could directly challenge higher realms.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was the same.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, even if he used up all the spirit stones, the improvement in his own strength would be limited.</p><p></p><p>What he lacked the most were cultivation methods and Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>He had used most of the spirit stones and treasures to enhance the knife, improving its strength.</p><p></p><p>Now the knife was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan holding the knife could easily contend with late-stage Yuandan cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After feeding it so many spirit stones and spiritual objects...</p><p></p><p>How come it's still...? Qi Yuan really wanted to cover his face.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that a dog can't change its habit of eating feces, and a knife can't change its habit of rummaging through the trash? Or could it be that his Little Sister's trash pile is richer than his?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu saw that Qi Yuan didn't speak, and continued to ask, "Big Brother, didn't you go to do Foundation Establishment? Have you succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, as if wanting to see something.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's face immediately fell.</p><p></p><p>"I... failed. Alas, the Foundation Establishment treasure is too difficult to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu sighed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The higher the grade of the Foundation Establishment treasure, the stronger the cultivation power after success, and the greater the chance of breaking through in the future. But for cultivators, it's not necessarily better to use higher-grade Foundation Establishment treasures.</p><p></p><p>If one's talent is insufficient, forcibly using a high-grade Foundation Establishment treasure for Foundation Establishment may result in failure.</p><p></p><p>The Dao has fifty, the heavens have forty-nine, and one has been lost.</p><p></p><p>Even using the lowest-grade Foundation Establishment treasure for cultivation can still have the opportunity to reach the peak.</p><p></p><p>Most ordinary cultivators do not use high-grade Foundation Establishment treasures.</p><p></p><p>What suits oneself is the best.</p><p></p><p>One of the supreme elders in Jiang Lingsu's clan cultivated using an eighth-grade Foundation Establishment treasure, which could be considered quite humble, but that supreme elder was among the top three in the clan's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, don't force it. The most suitable Foundation Establishment treasure for you is the best."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu comforted, "The Yellow Flower Fruit, although it's a first-grade Foundation Establishment treasure, is just so-so."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded in agreement upon hearing this: "You're right, the Yellow Flower Fruit is not suitable for me. I want to cultivate the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu: "..."</p><p></p><p>She had only just reached the Earth Vein Foundation Establishment, and it was the lower three grades.</p><p></p><p>As for Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment?</p><p></p><p>This kind of prodigy, Jiang Lingsu had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly Vein Qi can only be grasped by those with Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It may not be possible to capture it.</p><p></p><p>Only by cultivating to the realm of the Yin Spirit can one give birth to the Primordial Spirit, roam through the various realms, and soar through the vast expanse.</p><p></p><p>But this Primordial Spirit is very different from the soul and spiritual consciousness that Jiang Lingsu is familiar with.</p><p></p><p>This senior brother... is really daring to think.</p><p></p><p>Without any Yin or Yang Spirit experts in the ancestral lineage, he still wants to establish a foundation in the Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Lingsu glanced at the palace on the Seven-Colored Peak, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, this is a Stabilizing Spiritual Pill. It can calm the spiritual power. You just had a breakthrough failure, and your spiritual power is unstable. You need to take one, so that you can continue to break through in the short term.</p><p></p><p>It... well, it's not expensive, it's a family specialty, just a few spirit stones."  Jiang Lingsu's slender white hand extended a delicate white porcelain bottle, with a medicinal pill inside.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "Junior sister, are you my Doraemon?"</p><p></p><p>Always able to pull out some strange things from the sleeves.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Lingsu was puzzled by Qi Yuan's strange words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Stabilizing Spiritual Pill.</p><p></p><p>[This is a Stabilizing Spiritual Pill. When a cultivator fails in their foundation establishment, their spiritual power becomes chaotic. To accumulate for the next breakthrough, they need to refine their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The Stabilizing Spiritual Pill can balance the spiritual power and fill it up. It can fill the spiritual power of 10 high-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>However, this Stabilizing Spiritual Pill still has many flaws and can be improved.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Fill the spiritual power of 10 high-grade spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>That's a thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>This Stabilizing Spiritual Pill is indeed just a few spirit stones, but those are high-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu: "Junior sister, I appreciate your kindness. In the future, if someone tries to attack you, your senior brother will block the blade for you!"</p><p></p><p>This is a true rich lady!</p><p></p><p>I should cling tightly to this thick leg... no, this slender and delicate leg! Jiang Lingsu chuckled lightly: "Senior brother, you should still focus on protecting yourself. I don't want to see you get hurt."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu is just like an ordinary person among the masses, with many strengths but also some flaws.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she is not ordinary, as she has a lot of money.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Jiang Lingsu's gaze became serious: "It's a good thing that you've returned, senior brother. Yesterday, the Black Mountain Sect was wiped out, and it seems the entire Great Merchant Kingdom will be in turmoil!"</p><p></p><p>"What, the Black Mountain Sect was wiped out?" Qi Yuan's eyes widened, feeling that his acting skills must be excellent, worthy of a small Golden Man award. "Who was the culprit, did they use a knife or a sword?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, your focus is too strange." Jiang Lingsu suddenly stared at Qi Yuan. "The Black Mountain Sect's annihilation, it's not related to you, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's superb acting skills immediately crumbled: "No, it's not me!"</p><p></p><p>"You're acting guilty, could it really be you?" Jiang Lingsu laughed heartily, but she didn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>The senior brother is eccentric and obsessed with games, strange and peculiar.</p><p></p><p>This kind of personality, it would probably take electroshock therapy to cure.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the world has changed greatly, and the breakthrough of cultivators to high realms no longer has the tribulation of thunder. Otherwise, seeing the senior brother being struck by lightning would definitely be very interesting.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few words with the senior brother, Jiang Lingsu returned to her own room.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary mirror appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Refinement Realm complete... ah."</p><p></p><p>This mirror, called the Kun-Qian Mirror, is one of the many split mirrors of the Kun-Qian Mirror, and it can see through one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It showed that Qi Yuan's cultivation had reached the Refinement Realm complete.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You knife, why did you go rummaging through the trash again!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to slap the knife, but he was afraid of hurting himself.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I should go out and feel the wind, see how things are going after the Black Mountain Sect was wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>People who often kill should know that they can't return to the crime scene, but it should be fine to keep an eye on the murder case from a distance, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, there are no police here, and the old Black Chicken demon is still in seclusion!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

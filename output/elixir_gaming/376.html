        <h1>Chapter 376</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wearing a blood-red robe, he stepped onto the bridge formed by Shu and Hu, traveling against the flow of time towards the place of origin.</p><p></p><p>Passing through space and time, crossing the Black Sea, going against the river of years.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, sensing the washing of time.</p><p></p><p>This time, with no one chatting, he could seriously perceive the power of space-time, just like when he had perceived the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences before.</p><p></p><p>"This Black Sea... has no master, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It looks a bit like my River of Forgetfulness."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Black Sea, you seem to have an affinity with me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan called out softly to the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved against time, leaving only a faint afterimage.</p><p></p><p>In countless scrolls of mountains and seas, figures sensed something and looked up at the sky one by one.</p><p></p><p>They didn't see anything, but in their gaze it was as if a flash of red had passed by.</p><p></p><p>"Is it him?" Long-forgotten memories surged forth, and the one-eyed man's body trembled as the image of that peerless man who had swept through thousands of troops appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>On a small boat, LÃ¼ Zhu's eyes suddenly constricted: "Master?"</p><p></p><p>The sword in her hand rang out, joyful and desolate, followed by endless melancholy.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu's eyes also revealed a complex expression: "Is it the gentleman?"</p><p></p><p>She remembered, the gentleman had said he would bring her stockings.</p><p></p><p>In one scroll of mountains and seas after another, in every world Qi Yuan had experienced, there were always some powerful beings whose distant memories awakened.</p><p></p><p>They recalled that invincible man from the past.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had finally gone against the Black Sea and returned to the place of origin.</p><p></p><p>Stepping off the bridge, Qi Yuan had an indescribable expression as he looked at the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>"You perceived the Black Sea, and perceived loneliness."</p><p></p><p>He pretended to be the system, but failed at pretending.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sea was much harder to perceive than the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>That gate yielded insights with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Shu and Hu, you two can go back now. Come again when I need you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said softly as he looked at Shu and Hu in the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was pondering that these two emperors could work in the underworld in the future, as the Bridge of Helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"It is our honor to follow our lord's command!"</p><p></p><p>Shu and Hu said in unison.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's figure flickered.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he had arrived at the top of the tower of the Ancestral Blood Contest.</p><p></p><p>Unlike when he left, this time when he returned, the top of the tower was crowded with a group of Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there were nearly ten thousand of them.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Qi Yuan appear, these immensely powerful Martial Lords all lowered their noble heads.</p><p></p><p>Those without heads bowed at the waist.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Martial God!"</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand Martial Lords, their eyes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the Black Sea, covering the sky with one hand, swallowing the sun - these were not things Martial Lords could do, only a Martial God!</p><p></p><p>Only a Martial God could explain it! Fat Egg Martial Lord's body trembled, or rather, this trembling was from excitement.</p><p></p><p>His ancestor turned out to be a legendary Martial God.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord and the other titled Martial Lords also had hope appear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It seemed there was hope for this Dawn's Call!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these Martial Lords, his expression calm. He thought of something and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"At a time like this, wouldn't it be more appropriate if I tilted my head?"</p><p></p><p>This scene reminded him of a plot from a TV drama.</p><p></p><p>A useless son-in-law had just been slapped, when ten thousand men in suits appeared and knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"We welcome the Dragon King's return!"</p><p></p><p>How similar it was.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he tilted his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords on the scene looked at each other in bewilderment, unable to understand or feeling confused.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords didn't get his reference.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't someone have said: "He's going to tilt his head, quick, tear his mouth!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand: "I'm not a Martial God yet, I'm just a Martial Lord, don't call me that."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always disliked impersonating powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>He preferred to be honest and treat people sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Martial Lords present were filled with boundless confusion.</p><p></p><p>Hey, no need to be so modest, right?</p><p></p><p>If you're a Martial Lord, what are we?</p><p></p><p>Especially since the scene of Qi Yuan swallowing a star in one gulp was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even... if Qi Yuan was willing, couldn't he swallow the place of origin into his belly as well?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke as he returned to his throne.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone go back to your own homes. The Ancestral Blood Contest is still continuing," Qi Yuan said. "With so many people gathered here, some might think we're having a brawl, or an orgy. It doesn't look good."</p><p></p><p>He was very socially anxious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing so many old men and women made him quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Only when facing his true love was he not like this, and more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Blood Contest is about to end, and the Wall of the Eastern Lord will appear. We... will accompany the Heavenly Venerable to see the Wall of the Eastern Lord," said a titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The title of Heavenly Venerable was something he had learned from the old men in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Eastern Lord, awe and fanaticism appeared in the eyes of these Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>This look was similar to how they looked at Qi Yuan, but not exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan said casually, without saying much more.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was just eager to ask what exactly a Spirit Realm Martial Lord was. After becoming a Spirit Realm Martial Lord and a Human Dao Martial Lord, he planned to break through to the realm of Ten Thousand Dao Martial God.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute, and the world seemed to have turned on an accelerator, greatly speeding up the Ancestral Blood Contest.</p><p></p><p>Inside the tower.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan's whole body was covered in blood as he looked at the terrifying monster before him. With a loud shout, he recklessly poured his Blood Martial power forward.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He was determined to make it into the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>Only by entering the top thirty would his ancestor agree to his request and plead for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the place of origin, Qi Yuan would then have one more chance to live.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Mu Yan brought his blade down.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful strike was enough to make rivers change course and mountains move.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying monster before him was naturally slain by this strike.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the monster, Mu Yan gasped for breath, a hint of hesitation appearing in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Next time, I will face ten monsters. If I can defeat them, I can enter the top thirty!"</p><p></p><p>One monster was already so difficult to deal with, ten...</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth, his gaze determined.</p><p></p><p>Holding his great blade, he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his expression suddenly constricted.</p><p></p><p>"Three... hundred?"</p><p></p><p>He saw monsters as big as small mountains charging towards him.</p><p></p><p>These monsters were crowded together, rushing towards him eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, there were a full three hundred of them!</p><p></p><p>Slaying one hundred would earn first place.</p><p></p><p>These three hundred... what the hell?</p><p></p><p>Was he being targeted?</p><p></p><p>That was the only explanation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he suddenly encounter three hundred enemies?</p><p></p><p>"I can't retreat, or I'll definitely be in last place!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that on a certain level of the tower, there was a man in a black robe standing on a bamboo pole, his face showing a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid of heights at all, wuwu, why... can't I move?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Mu Yan raised his long blade and charged towards the three hundred monsters without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Even in retreat, he had to do it with style.</p><p></p><p>"All of you... die!"</p><p></p><p>One slash descended, with the power to cleave stars!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan blinked, momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>The expected scene did not appear.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred monsters before him shattered like paper, turning into a paste of flesh.</p><p></p><p>He blinked: "An illusion? They were all..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fake?"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat confused, doubting his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Did he really kill so many powerful monsters with one sword strike?</p><p></p><p>Was it real or fake?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a gentle voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What a brilliant sword strike, killing three hundred monsters in one blow. </p><p></p><p>Child, you have reached the pinnacle of a Martial King. In this Ancestral Blood Battle, you should be the champion!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Mu Yan held his large blade, feeling dazed as he looked at the illusory Martial Lord before him. He was suspicious that everything was fake.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of my bloodline, the undisputed number one Martial King!" A cheerful and hearty voice came, and a Martial Lord's figure appeared beside Mu Yan.</p><p></p><p>That Martial Lord looked at Mu Yan with admiration and doting in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Mu Yan's expression tightened and he immediately bowed: "Greetings, ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>This Martial Lord was none other than his bloodline ancestor, a Great Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Why was the ancestor suddenly so enthusiastic towards him?</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities. Congratulations on becoming the champion of the Ancestral Blood Battle this time," the Great Martial Lord praised, feeling quite excited.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had already determined that the Qi Yuan mentioned by his bloodline descendant Mu Yan must be that Martial God Lord Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would the Martial God Lord mention Mu Yan and think highly of him?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he wasn't.</p><p></p><p>If a Martial God said he thought highly of Mu Yan, and Mu Yan couldn't get first place, wouldn't that be slapping the Martial God's face, saying his judgment was poor? So, at this moment, the champion of the Ancestral Blood Battle could only be Mu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Hearing his ancestor's congratulations, Mu Yan still felt as if he was in a dream, unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've won first place, go accept the Ancestral Blood Baptism, quickly become a Martial Lord, and become one of us in the Eastern Alliance!" the Great Martial Lord said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan had started to accept reality.</p><p></p><p>He was excited.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he really was a one-in-a-million genius?</p><p></p><p>In that desperate situation earlier, he had unleashed a strike beyond his level, slaying three hundred monsters?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was the protagonist of this world, the child of destiny, with endless fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Remembering something, Mu Yan quickly said: "Ancestor, since I've entered the top thirty this time, could you..."</p><p></p><p>He was still anxious about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about these things," the Great Martial Lord said approvingly, looking at Mu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan was excited, feeling as if his life had suddenly been given a cheat code.</p><p></p><p>However, he needed to quickly accept the Ancestral Blood Baptism and become a Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ancestor looking after Qi Yuan was still a favor, and there might be oversights.</p><p></p><p>Only after he became a Martial Lord could he truly ensure Qi Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>With an excited expression, Mu Yan went to undergo the Ancestral Blood Baptism.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the top of the high tower, Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Blood Battle is finally over."</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord quickly said: "Your Excellency has a good eye. Mu Yan won first place!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? Not bad," Qi Yuan had not watched the Ancestral Blood Battle, instead closing his eyes to rest, or occasionally discussing the creation of the Underworld with that online friend.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, that online friend was truly kind-hearted.</p><p></p><p>They directly made seven PowerPoint presentations for Qi Yuan as proposals for the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Such an enthusiastic online friend was rare.</p><p></p><p>At the time, that online friend had also asked if they could enter the Underworld and be a small minion if it was established. Qi Yuan agreed without thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's over, shouldn't the Wall of the Eastern Lord come out now?" Qi Yuan looked at the Martial Lords of the Eastern Alliance before him and said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Black Deer Martial Lord quickly replied, "Please wait a moment, Your Excellency."</p><p></p><p>Several titled Martial Lords from the Eastern Alliance stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Surging blood martial energy spread, and an aura belonging to ancient times rose up in the high tower at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the throne, looking curious.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that on a wall in front of the high tower, a blood-colored spot appeared.</p><p></p><p>As if stained by a drop of blood, the entire wall surface turned blood-red at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some information entered Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Wall of the Eastern Lord, with a drop of the Eastern Lord's blood on it.]</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, this is the Wall of the Eastern Lord!" Black Deer Martial Lord said with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>The tens of thousands of Martial Lords of the Eastern Alliance present all looked at the Wall of the Eastern Lord with reverence in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Lord is now single-handedly resisting the great calamity, with only one drop of blood left outside, existing on the Wall of the Eastern Lord to communicate with us," a titled Martial Lord said, with a complex expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This complexity included both self-blame and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>Self-blame for being unable to help the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>"On the Wall of the Eastern Lord, one can glimpse a corner of the great calamity. I don't know how much longer the Eastern Lord can hold on," Black Deer Martial Lord said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a window-like opening appeared on the Wall of the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>Through the window, a scene appeared, and terrifying roars and howls transmitted from it, making one's soul tremble.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked over, and countless images entered his eyes.</p><p></p><p>There were strands of light, colorful and varied, with all kinds of colors, not limited to those visible to the human eye.</p><p></p><p>On each strand of light, there seemed to be the greatest evil in the world, transformed into terrifying monsters, gnawing at space, devouring all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>In the giant mouths of the monsters, various rules turned into fragments, becoming part of the colors of the light.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was divided into two parts: on one side was a huge furball, with countless strands of light extending and entangling; on the other side was... a silhouette.</p><p></p><p>A man in a white robe, whose face and appearance could not be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the void, as if supporting this world.</p><p></p><p>The countless strands of light and colors could not devour him.</p><p></p><p>[Root Demon, a bizarre lifeform that lives by devouring all things in the world. The conditions for its birth are extremely harsh.]</p><p></p><p>When looking at the strands of light from the furball, important information was transmitted to Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"These monsters are becoming more and more numerous, getting closer and closer to the Dawn's Call. If we can't successfully restart the world and revive the Eastern Lord's partner, I'm afraid the Eastern Lord alone will find it hard to hold on!" Black Deer Martial Lord said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the last time they saw this scene, the situation had become even more critical.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he also looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If the Eastern Lord's partner could be revived, and with the assistance of this Heavenly Venerate, perhaps there would truly be a chance of overcoming the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, on the other hand, looked curious: "The Root Demons seem to represent all emotions in the world - jealousy, greed, stubbornness... It's somewhat similar to my Origin Divine Ability."</p><p></p><p>His Origin Divine Ability was Void Sovereign: Heart Demon Inducement.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Qi Yuan felt that it had some common origin with these Root Demons.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he wasn't afraid of the Root Demons that were suppressing the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>All things in heaven and earth give birth to and restrain each other, which is normal.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency's Origin Divine Ability is similar to these negative emotions?" Black Deer Martial Lord looked at Qi Yuan once more, somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, this didn't sound like something a good person would have.</p><p></p><p>"How are these negative emotions? These are clearly positive energy!</p><p></p><p>Jealousy? From a certain perspective, jealousy can make people improve and stimulate their motivation to progress.</p><p></p><p>Lust? For the Heavenly Dao of a world, naturally the more living beings the better. Lust can promote human reproduction, producing more 'leeks'!</p><p></p><p>Pride? Isn't it also a kind of aloofness, a kind of unyielding spirit, making martial artists strive for self-improvement!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord fell silent, feeling that there was some truth to it, but not much.</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords also looked strangely at Qi Yuan. Even if they didn't agree with Qi Yuan's words in their hearts, no one dared to argue with him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze turned to the figure opposing the Root Demons.</p><p></p><p>[Illusory image of the Eastern Lord, Holy Light Race.]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

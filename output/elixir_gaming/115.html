        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>White Conch described it according to her memory.</p><p></p><p>The old man was stunned, then said: "Hmph, it's obviously one of those old things from beyond the thousandth rank. Those old things, being far from the Blood Lord, not as close as we are, often dress like the Blood Lord to appear more intimate with him."</p><p></p><p>Black Feather thought of something and couldn't help saying: "He also said that he was the Blood Lord himself."</p><p></p><p>"What?" The old man's cloudy eyes burst with light. His small, thin frame erupted with powerful strength as he grabbed Black Feather's collar. "He said he was the Blood Lord??"</p><p></p><p>All those who have heard the Blood Lord's teachings deeply admire him. They view the Blood Lord as a father and respect him as a teacher. No one would dare impersonate the Blood Lord!</p><p></p><p>"What does he look like?" the little old man asked anxiously. </p><p></p><p>It was the first time White Conch and Black Feather had seen their master like this.</p><p></p><p>White Conch waved her hand, and a water screen appeared. Within the screen, a shadowy figure began to take shape.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as it fully formed, the image shattered. </p><p></p><p>It seemed some mysterious force was preventing her from displaying Qi Yuan's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the little old man's eyes widened: "Could it be... could it really be my honored teacher?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord was born divine, and no portrait could capture his true likeness. Even magical methods could not display his appearance.</p><p></p><p>White Conch was also stunned, remembering something. As a child, she had greatly admired the Blood Lord and once asked her master to show his appearance, but just like today, it was impossible to display.</p><p></p><p>"Is he really the Blood Lord?" White Conch asked excitedly. "But... the Fate Stone Tablet said the Blood Lord had perished!"</p><p></p><p>The Fate Stone Tablet was a supreme treasure of the Flowing Wind Realm - it simply could not be wrong.</p><p></p><p>The old man lowered his head, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Just then, White Conch remembered something and held out her delicate palm: "This is the small gift that senior gave me!"</p><p></p><p>A blood-like water droplet appeared.</p><p></p><p>The little old man stared intently at the droplet: "My teacher, it really is my honored teacher the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>He was now completely certain that man was indeed his teacher, the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Where did he go?" the little old man asked urgently, looking extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>White Conch quickly recounted everything that had happened that day to her master.</p><p></p><p>After listening, her master was moved to tears.</p><p></p><p>"He is indeed my honored teacher, the Blood Lord." The little old man's heart was filled with mixed emotions. Thinking of something, he looked at White Conch expectantly: "Besides mentioning the golden canary, did my honored teacher the Blood Lord mention anyone else? Did he mention me?"</p><p></p><p>White Conch: "..."</p><p></p><p>Black Feather was also excited, but said coldly: "No!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the little old man wasn't disappointed: "My teacher's memory isn't good, so it's normal he didn't mention me. But I'm sure I'm in his heart. Now, my teacher must be heading to the Ends of the Earth. I need to quickly send this news to the Ends of the Earth."</p><p></p><p>The little old man paced back and forth, considering how to transmit the message.</p><p></p><p>After a few dozen breaths, the little old man made up his mind: "Let's go, we're heading to the Ends of the Earth!"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go to the Ends of the Earth to see his teacher. At the same time, he planned to use special channels to inform the people of the Blood Palace about the reappearance of his honored teacher, the Blood Lord!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A streak of light flashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators looked up, their eyes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Some purple-robed cultivators had surprised expressions, as countless messages were being transmitted to the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This streak of light would stop at a location every so often.</p><p></p><p>Some had seen a blood-colored sword shadow descend from the sky, completely destroying a Purple Sky Alliance stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The entire Flowing Wind Realm, across all continents, became restless.</p><p></p><p>Countless messages were being sent to the Purple Sky Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying rumor also began to spread throughout the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>That is... the Blood Lord had awakened and come to settle scores with the Purple Sky Alliance!</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Purple Sky Alliance headquarters, a handsome-faced man sat on a phoenix throne, a mocking expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord's revival? Utterly ridiculous!" The man was the male consort of the Purple Sky Maiden, and currently the acting Grand Steward of the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The Fate Stone Tablet is a supreme treasure of the mortal world and cannot be wrong. The Blood Lord perished long ago. This person must be an imposter! I suspect it's the remnants of the Blood Palace. Seeing our Purple Sky Alliance armies marching towards the Ends of the Earth, unable to resist, they can only use some experts to destroy our strongholds here and there!" A man over three meters tall spoke, his voice like a thick bell.</p><p></p><p>This statement was agreed upon by everyone present.</p><p></p><p>On the phoenix throne, Grand Steward Lin Xuemei spoke arrogantly: "Times have changed. Even if the Blood Lord has revived, so what? The Thirteen Purple-Robed Life-Takers - I'll leave that so-called Blood Lord, real or fake, to you thirteen!"</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, thirteen purple-robed figures appeared, each emanating powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>These thirteen purple-robed individuals all had Terrestrial Mythical level strength, extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>"We obey!"</p><p></p><p>The thirteen purple-robed figures left the hall.</p><p></p><p>Grand Steward Lin Xuemei's lips curled into a smile: "Tomorrow is my hundredth birthday celebration. How are the preparations coming along?"</p><p></p><p>With the Purple Sky Maiden leading the army to the Ends of the Earth, Lin Xuemei was in charge of the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow would be his hundredth birthday.</p><p></p><p>Among the Purple Sky Maiden's male consorts, none had lived past a hundred years. Most were buried after the Purple Sky Maiden grew tired of them.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Xuemei was different. He was the most favored and was about to reach a hundred years old, becoming the Purple Sky Maiden's first male consort to live past a century.</p><p></p><p>So he cared greatly about his hundredth birthday banquet. Compared to his birthday celebration, that so-called Blood Lord was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Grand Steward, everything has been prepared!" an elderly man said humbly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present looked at Lin Xuemei with fawning smiles. After all, being able to climb into the Purple Sky Maiden's bed was quite an accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Deep into the night.</p><p></p><p>The entire Sky-Reaching City was as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow would be Purple Sky Alliance's Lin Xuemei's hundredth birthday.</p><p></p><p>The whole Sky-Reaching City was decorated with lanterns, filled with a festive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>In a wine shop, there were three men concealing their auras.</p><p></p><p>The leader, with a scar on his face, looked quite fierce: "That son of a bitch Lin Xuemei is truly despicable. I must kill him tomorrow no matter what!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other two men's eyes also flashed with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>All three of them had deep, irreconcilable grudges against Lin Xuemei. Their parents, wives, and children had all died at Lin Xuemei's hands.</p><p></p><p>Now they had joined forces to assassinate Lin Xuemei.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a man wearing a straw rain cape and hat said: "Have you heard? A powerful cultivator claiming to be the Blood Lord seems to be coming to kill the Purple Sky Alliance recently."</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord perished long ago. It's probably an impersonator," the scarred man said. "Today, the Thirteen Purple-Robed Life-Takers have gone to surround and attack this person. He... probably won't make it here."</p><p></p><p>The man in the straw cape sighed: "If he could make it here, we three brothers could join forces with him to kill that old dog Lin Xuemei! Dying alongside such a hero would be quite an honor!"</p><p></p><p>The three men were prepared to die.</p><p></p><p>They knew that assassinating Lin Xuemei tomorrow would likely fail, but they came resolutely anyway, because if they waited any longer, there would be no chance at all.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the thin man who had been silent spoke up: "I have a friend in the Blood Palace who says this Blood Lord is very likely to be real."</p><p></p><p>"The real Blood Lord?" The scarred man was surprised, but not too shocked.</p><p></p><p>So what if the real Blood Lord had revived?</p><p></p><p>The world now belonged to the Purple Sky Alliance!</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Alliance had a hundred Supreme Realm experts, enough to dominate the world! The legendary Blood Lord was born divine, but in terms of cultivation, he might not be Supreme Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had reached Supreme Realm, so what? The three men felt heavy-hearted and conflicted as they drank their wine in silence.</p><p></p><p>Outside Sky-Reaching City, fireworks constantly rose and burst, making the night sky even brighter.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an otherworldly voice resounded throughout Sky-Reaching City.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Sky Alliance, the Blood Lord has come to pay a visit!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was loud, exploding like thunder in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>Throughout Sky-Reaching City, endless blood energy began to spread, like a vast ocean. Enormous blood clouds pressed down on the city!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless voices arose from within the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"What lowly scum dares to make trouble here?"</p><p></p><p>"Those who offend our Purple Sky Alliance must die!"</p><p></p><p>With these voices, sixty figures shot into the sky.</p><p></p><p>These people all wore purple robes, emanating extremely terrifying auras.</p><p></p><p>"All Terrestrial Mythical realm," the scarred man said, his expression very grave.</p><p></p><p>In their view, over sixty Terrestrial Mythical experts were enough to surround and kill several Supreme Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Even if that Blood Lord was Supreme Realm, he would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>The current Supreme Realm experts were different from those of later generations who had comprehended Origin Divine Abilities. At most they were like Qi Yuan, at level 120, half-step Supreme Realm.</p><p></p><p>The man in the straw cape lamented: "The Blood Lord is quite unwise. He should have sneaked in to assassinate Lin Xuemei. Confronting them head-on like this is truly unwise!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Purple Sky Alliance, Lin Xuemei wore a long robe, a look of dissatisfaction on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Those Thirteen Purple-Robed Life-Takers are truly useless, unable to stop even a mere Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Someone immediately said: "For the Blood Lord to come so brazenly, there must be some scheme!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, whatever scheme he has, what does it matter in the face of the Purple Sky Alliance's mighty strength?" a Supreme Realm expert spoke, his face full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xuemei looked at the eleven Supreme Realm experts present: "With you all here, what do I have to fear?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Realm experts all nodded, relaxed smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Over sixty Terrestrial Mythical experts hovered in the air, emanating extremely powerful auras, demonstrating the Purple Sky Alliance's strength to the world.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the blood-colored clouds in the sky transformed into a sword.</p><p></p><p>"Sending mere small fry to receive me? You underestimate me too much!"</p><p></p><p>The sword formed from blood clouds descended from the sky, stabbing directly towards those sixty-plus Terrestrial Mythical experts.</p><p></p><p>As the blood-colored sword light flashed across the sky, that vast voice was heard.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Countless streaks of blood-colored sword light flashed across the sky, like bloody</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meteor.</p><p></p><p>Sword energy crisscrossed, blood color spread.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath's time, before the echo of the word "death" had returned.</p><p></p><p>Over sixty Earthly Myths in the sky fell like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators who witnessed this scene were completely shocked. </p><p></p><p>One sword strike killed over sixty Earthly Myths?</p><p></p><p>Is this still human? The man in the straw cape from before was also stunned, struggling to speak: "I take back what I said earlier!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord didn't sneak in secretly because he didn't need to, his strength is strong enough!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid Blood Lord's power is infinitely close to Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's!" The scarred man also swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the sky, a figure in a blood-red robe appeared, with a blood mark between his brows, extraordinarily handsome.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked down below, disappointment showing in his eyes: "I thought the Purple Sky Alliance would be a qualified big villain, but is this all?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Xuemei was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>The eleven Supreme Beings beside him were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Beings, quickly take action and kill this scoundrel!" Lin Xuemei shouted loudly!</p><p></p><p>None of Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's male favorites had lived past 100 years old.</p><p></p><p>With only one hour left until he turned 100, he didn't want to have this curse too!</p><p></p><p>The eleven Supreme Beings looked at each other, and in the end could only attack together.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"That attack just now must have consumed a lot, we can wear him down!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these eleven Supreme Beings, his expression calm: "You haven't even awakened your Origin Divine Ability, and you call yourselves Supreme Beings? You're nothing more than... super soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had long known that in the world of comprehending origins, cultivators above level 120 did not have Origin Divine Abilities.</p><p></p><p>Such Supreme Beings were not even as good as the old man in the Ground Absolute.</p><p></p><p>"Take my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached out his hand, and the blood clouds in the sky condensed into eleven swords, descending from the heavens and landing behind him.</p><p></p><p>Eleven blood-colored long swords, emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter, arrogance, greed, lust...</p><p></p><p>It was as if the swords contained the most terrifying evils in the world.</p><p></p><p>"No, you're not even as good as super soldiers! Super soldiers can at least backdoor, what about you?" Qi Yuan said contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>Eleven swords shot out from behind him, directly charging towards those eleven Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The eleven Supreme Beings' eyes bulged, they felt the terrifying sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Especially the aura carried in the blood-colored long swords, which shook their spirits, making them unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"Great Demon... you are the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Heart Demon, you are a demon!"</p><p></p><p>These eleven Supreme Beings were filled with fear, heart demons arising.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed past, and the eleven Supreme Beings were no different from those sixty-plus Earthly Myths, all falling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm, extraordinarily demonic.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand, looking at the condensed long sword, which already had the embryonic form of an Origin Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>"Evil Origin... is this my Origin Divine Ability?"</p><p></p><p>When the divine ability manifests, all cultivators who see it have heart demons arise, falling into madness and going astray.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the effect is not so good on cultivators of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>But it would definitely be effective against cultivators of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Affected by his divine ability, who wouldn't directly become an evil demon?</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had a feeling that if he wanted, he could instantly condense Evil Origin into his Origin Divine Ability, becoming a true Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not directly condense Evil Origin into an Origin Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>Evil Origin had a deep connection with the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>And people were already treating him as the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>If he condensed such an Origin Divine Ability, wouldn't he just become the new Great Demon? He was a player after all!</p><p></p><p>After killing the eleven Supreme Beings, Qi Yuan landed beside Lin Xuemei.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xuemei looked at Qi Yuan, now calm: "It seems what the Alliance Leader said was indeed true, you are the reincarnation of the Great Demon."</p><p></p><p>"I am who I am, not some damn Great Demon," Qi Yuan said casually, looking at Lin Xuemei.</p><p></p><p>"Stop hiding it, Great Demon! One sword strike and heart demons arise, if you're not the Great Demon, who is?" Lin Xuemei looked at Qi Yuan with a righteous expression, "Great Demon, the Alliance Leader is exceptionally talented, a rare genius seen only once in ten thousand years, you will surely be destroyed by the Alliance Leader! The Great Demon must be eliminated from the world, justice belongs to the Purple Sky Alliance, belongs to humanity!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Lin Xuemei spat out a mouthful of blood, severing his own heart meridian and perishing.</p><p></p><p>He was like a righteous person facing an evil demon, dying heroically.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately laughed: "I've become the big villain? How interesting."</p><p></p><p>His laughter was incomparably bewitching.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's smile, all the Purple Sky Alliance members around felt an inexplicable fear arise in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Demon... Great Demon..."</p><p></p><p>These people looked terrified, crawling on the ground, as if they had seen a demon god walk out of hell.</p><p></p><p>"Am I that scary?" A water screen appeared in front of Qi Yuan, showing his bewitchingly handsome face, "I'm clearly so gentle, so good-looking, that narcissistic golden canary should be able to appreciate my looks?"</p><p></p><p>That night.</p><p></p><p>Blood Lord raided the Purple Sky Alliance headquarters at night.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike killed over sixty Earthly Myths.</p><p></p><p>Another sword strike killed eleven Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Alliance's grand steward, unable to bear the humiliation, committed suicide, saying righteously before death: "The Great Demon must be eliminated from the world, justice belongs to humanity!"</p><p></p><p>The world was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>Many powerful figures from major sects, clans and families gathered, holding a cultivator conference, vowing to eliminate the demon together and restore peace to the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Phoenix Heart Continent.</p><p></p><p>Purple Sky Mysterious Woman opened her eyes, purple light flashing in her pupils.</p><p></p><p>"Little Mei... is dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord... has revived?"</p><p></p><p>Her expression was calm, with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>A stone tablet appeared in front of her, Purple Sky Mysterious Woman looked at the tablet, her gaze seeming to traverse time and space.</p><p></p><p>"Dead and revived?"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Demon does not die, the great thief does not end."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Great Demon revives, so what, as long as he is sealed in the Ten Thousand Differences Gate, we can still restore a bright and clear world!"</p><p></p><p>"This world will still be the Purple Sky Alliance's world!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord? Great Demon? Products of the old era, now I am the master of the Fate Stone Tablet!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's expression was excessively calm.</p><p></p><p>On the Fate Stone Tablet, a flash of blood light passed.</p><p></p><p>A line of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>"One month later, the Ten Thousand Differences Gate will open, Supreme Beings may enter."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, an eerie smile flashed across Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's face.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven truly helps me!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's original plan was to mobilize her army, destroy the Blood Palace, take over the End of the World, and control the Ten Thousand Differences Gate.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Blood Lord's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Her plan had another element, which was to seal Blood Lord in the Ten Thousand Differences Gate and completely eradicate him.</p><p></p><p>"Transmit my order, all Supreme Beings, come with me to the End of the World!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Sky Mysterious Woman decided not to wait any longer, choosing to abandon all the Earthly Myths and other armies, bringing only the Supreme Beings to the End of the World.</p><p></p><p>The various forces in the army were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>But facing Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's order, no one dared to resist.</p><p></p><p>All the Supreme Beings flew out, surrounding Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, flying towards the End of the World.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master... is still alive?"</p><p></p><p>Foolish Daoist transformed into a streak of light, chasing after Purple Sky Mysterious Woman ahead.</p><p></p><p>Learning this news, he couldn't believe it in his heart, yet was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The Fate Stone Tablet would not be wrong!</p><p></p><p>But Master had indeed revived, how could he not be excited.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, a hint of worry also arose.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he dispelled the worry.</p><p></p><p>Blood Lord's kindness to him was as heavy as a mountain, he had never mistreated him, how could he have misgivings?</p><p></p><p>"This news must be sent back, to tell Yanran, and White Marsh!"</p><p></p><p>Over the years, in order for the Blood Palace to continue, he had gone incognito, peeling off his own face, shaving his bones, changing his appearance to join the Purple Sky Alliance as an insider for the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was time to go back.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the over a hundred Supreme Beings ahead, and the terrifying Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, suddenly gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>A red blood drop appeared, and he disappeared into a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>Purple Sky Mysterious Woman narrowed her eyes, killing intent showing on her face: "A remnant of the Blood Palace?"</p><p></p><p>She pushed out a palm, landing on that streak of light.</p><p></p><p>The light streaked across the sky, scattering blood everywhere.</p><p></p><p>PS: Starting tomorrow, barring special circumstances, I will update punctually at 5pm every day!</p><p>Recommending a friend's book, there's a link below, you can bookmark it directly!</p><p></p><p>"Longevity: Starting from Obtaining the Earth Fiend Dao Fruit to Grinding Experience"</p><p></p><p>[Recommendation]: The celestial phenomena have changed, dao fruits have descended, immortals and Buddhas are dead, demons and evils run rampant...</p><p></p><p>The seventy-two "Earth Fiends" have manifested in the world, condensing into "dao fruits".

        <h1>Chapter 518</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A small flat-bottomed boat, moving at an extremely fast speed, cutting through the water surface and creating waves one after another.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi held a vegetable knife, her delicate white hands waving in the air, just like a flower-shaking hand.</p><p></p><p>This pushing force did not carry her away, but made the small boat move even faster.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the area of strange fish, Jiang Yunxi did not stop, but followed Qi Yuan's words, determined to slay more strange fish.</p><p></p><p>"The strange fish are increasing, you must kill more, go straight to their lair and kill them unawares!"</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's original words.</p><p></p><p>"To become the number one chef in the world, having the number one kitchen knife is not enough, you also need to chop enough ingredients."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Yunxi was striding and waving her flower hand, heading towards the depths of Yeshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a large ship suddenly broke through the wind and stopped Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>On the large ship, Xie Danran in a blue robe, with a proud expression, looked at Jiang Yunxi and said in a detached voice, "The front is the forbidden area of Yeshan Lake, commoners are not allowed to enter!"</p><p></p><p>Now, Tianxong was not only holding a grand assembly of artifact masters to deal with the Water Lord, but also blocking the water domain to prevent the Water Lord from causing chaos.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it was also to prevent some ill-intentioned people from entering the depths of the water domain and colluding with the Water Lord.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there is never a shortage of people who want to destroy the world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a stranger, Xie Danran directly stopped her.</p><p></p><p>Even, he was very tyrannical, the big ship almost overturned Jiang Yunxi's small boat.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Yunxi dodged quickly, but even so, there were water droplets all over her hair, making her wet.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, how are you driving the boat? If I were an ordinary fisherman, I would have been knocked into Yeshan Lake by you now!" Jiang Yunxi said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran glanced at Jiang Yunxi, seeing her in a chef's outfit with a floral apron around her waist, he said arrogantly from above, "Fishermen can swim, they won't drown, and besides... aren't you fine?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was very angry.</p><p></p><p>"If you knew what I was going to do, it would shock you!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi put her hands on her hips.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..." Xie Danran sneered, as if looking at an idiot.</p><p></p><p>This expression made Jiang Yunxi very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Now she finally understood the feelings of the protagonists in those biographical novels.</p><p></p><p>Although she was going to save the world, she was still being mocked and misunderstood by others.</p><p></p><p>And those protagonists, although they had mouths, did not speak out.</p><p></p><p>"Now, strange spirits are rampant here, I'm going to slay the strange spirits and save the world, don't stop me!" Jiang Yunxi, having a mouth, directly said what she was doing.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran looked Jiang Yunxi up and down, his face even more mocking: "A mere Xuanji initial stage, also dares to claim to save the world, here is guarded by my Tianxong, where are the strange spirits appearing?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was heartbroken, feeling very wronged.</p><p></p><p>This is what it feels like to be misunderstood? The protagonist is trying to save the world, but is blocked by the villain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"If he blocks you, kill him with one knife, this villain NPC, I don't quite like him."</p><p></p><p>Now the chef's role has reached two-thirds, Qi Yuan no longer needs to be like a dead object, his perception has also exceeded the past.</p><p></p><p>Even before arriving here, he had already discovered this Xie Danran, who was "harassing" his wife.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the distance, on the ship, Shen Lingxuan in a blue dress, with a graceful and cheerful appearance and an icy cold temperament, blended together.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhan stood beside Shen Lingxuan, frowning: "That person... seems to be Yunxi, how did she come here?"</p><p></p><p>She was a little puzzled, waving her hand, the ship sailed towards the direction of her palm waving.</p><p></p><p>"Yunxi, how is it you? What are you doing here?" As the ship approached, Ye Zhan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran heard this and was a little surprised: "You know each other?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jiang Yunxi with a different gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be a misunderstanding." Xie Danran became more humble.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhan is the granddaughter of the Tianggong Hall Elder, her status and position are not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xie Danran's behavior, Jiang Yunxi felt even more disdainful, holding the vegetable knife, Qi Yuan's suggestion ultimately did not materialize.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ye Zhan, I'm going to go inside and kill some... fish! He blocked me from entering!" Jiang Yunxi said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhan smiled: "Tianxong is defending here, to prevent some villains and ordinary people from entering, Yunxi you are not in that category, if you want to come in and kill fish, feel free, by the way, the Mountain King is in the water area in front, about ten miles from here."</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran mentioned this, did not refute or obstruct.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Zhan said was the truth, it's just that Xie Danran was lazy, and directly implemented the order of Tianxong with a one-size-fits-all approach.</p><p></p><p>No problem, no one is allowed to enter.</p><p></p><p>"My father is also inside?" Jiang Yunxi was a little delighted, "Sister Ye Zhan, I won't chat more, I still have urgent matters, I'll go in first."</p><p></p><p>She said, hurriedly steering the boat towards the depths of Yeshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran looked at Jiang Yunxi's back: "She is the daughter of the Mountain King, indeed as the rumors say, stupid and naive!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhan gave Xie Danran a cold look: "The Mountain King is right in front, you can go tell him that."</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran shrugged: "She just said that strange spirits are rampant in Yeshan Lake, and she wants to save the world, it's really ridiculous. </p><p></p><p>With me from Tianxong guarding here, where are the strange spirits?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>The birth of strange spirits is random, but the conditions are indeed extremely harsh, it's not that they can be born just by wanting to.</p><p></p><p>In this area, the emergence of a Water Lord is already a big deal, it's very difficult for other strange spirits to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, it's not good, we've discovered strange spirits in the water domain!" </p><p></p><p>Just then, a hurried voice came, and a young man stepped on the surface of the lake like a dragonfly skimming the water, landing on Xie Danran's ship.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's mouth twitched, the slap in the face came so fast? But he didn't dare to be negligent, he quickly asked, "What strange spirits?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan and Ye Zhan's gaze also fell on the young man who had just arrived.</p><p></p><p>"It's a fish..." He took out a dead fish from his storage artifact.</p><p></p><p>The fish was small, looking like a white strip.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, it was not white at all, the dead fish's eyes had a black color as thick as ink.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the strange spirit is weak, this is a newly born strange spirit?" Ye Zhan judged, her expression becoming somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a newly born strange spirit, the matter... has become a bit complicated." Xie Danran also had a sense of urgency in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This really made what Ye Zhan said come true.</p><p></p><p>"This matter must be reported to the sect, this is really suspicious!"</p><p></p><p>"How could strange spirits suddenly appear for no reason, there may be the infamous Jingke Blood's hand behind this!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there is a spirit-nurturing place hidden here?"</p><p></p><p>"The appearance of one strange spirit means there are likely more strange spirits!"</p><p></p><p>The few people present were all a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>One Water Lord is already very difficult to deal with, and now the Jingke Blood is also involved, the situation is very unfavorable for Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, on a dragon boat.</p><p></p><p>Powerful figures gathered.</p><p></p><p>The Grief Wind Master Wei Kun stood at the main position, his expression solemn: "More than a hundred strange fish have been discovered in Yeshan Lake, I'm sure you all know about this."</p><p></p><p>The Grief Wind Master Wei Kun is one of the top twenty in the Ninguo Ranking, and is also one of the top three powerhouses in Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>His strength has reached the peak of the Earth-level Armored Soldier, making him the strongest present.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, even one Luoqing Water Lord is impossible to deal with, and now... there are also traces of the Jingke Blood, it seems this time... will be very, very difficult." The Tujiia Clan Master spoke, his aged face full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"The Artifact Master Assembly has not yet been convened, but those Earth-level artifact masters, as well as some talented young elites have all seen the Weilong Xuanyan, all of them are powerless." Tianxong Elder Wang Qingyi spoke, also full of worry.</p><p></p><p>The Artifact Master Assembly has not yet been convened, but the talented artifact master seedlings and the various great artifact masters have all seen the Weilong Xuanyan, all of them shaking their heads.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the current situation is already extremely critical, Tianxong is almost powerless against the Luoqing Water Lord.</p><p></p><p>In Yeshan Lake, even ordinary Earth-level Armored Soldiers coming would probably be unable to slay the Luoqing Water Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we just sit and watch the Luoqing Water Lord merge with Yeshan Lake, and flood the entire Jining Prefecture?" Someone said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>If this happens, the casualties would be no less than hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>"Should we start evacuating the downstream civilians now?" Shen Wanshan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He has already made the worst preparations.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not, this will cause such a huge panic, and cause so much harm to the Jiangzhou of Jining Prefecture!" Someone quickly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>Many others also echoed, saying that it is not appropriate to cause panic.</p><p></p><p>There were also those who felt that at this point, still considering whether to cause panic or not was ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Voices of dispute kept rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>Regarding how to deal with the Luoqing Water Lord, everyone had their own ideas and views.</p><p></p><p>"If the sky collapses, there will be a tall person to support it, but unfortunately we are the tallest, unable to stay out of it!"</p><p></p><p>"Those ordinary people who die, so be it, this flooding will definitely severely damage Tianxong, how much will we lose?"</p><p></p><p>"Quiet!" Finally, the Grief Wind Master Wei Kun slammed the table, and the boat became quiet for a moment.</p><p></p><p>All eyes fell on Wei Kun.</p><p></p><p>Wei Kun looked at the Mountain King and said softly, "Your Majesty, please speak."</p><p></p><p>The others were a little surprised, not knowing why they had called the Mountain King.</p><p></p><p>The ability of the royal family is not as good as Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>Rely on the royal family? "A few days ago, some Earth-level Armored Soldiers came from the Middle Earth Rakshasa Country, these Earth-level Armored Soldiers are extremely powerful, if we can invite them to lend a hand, the Luoqing Water Lord will be nothing!" The Mountain King's voice was old.</p><p></p><p>The Armored Soldiers present all had a glimpse of joy in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be people from the Middle Earth Rakshasa Country?"</p><p></p><p>"The Middle Earth is the holy land of the Blue Mountain Realm, it is rumored to be the holy land of the cultivators, but the journey is too far..."</p><p></p><p>"Earth-level Armored Soldiers, whew, if we can invite them to lend a hand, the Luoqing Water Lord is nothing?"</p><p></p><p>"We don't even need to repair the Weilong Xuanyan to solve this!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Tujiia Clan Master stood up and asked, "Your Majesty, how can we invite those Earth-level Armored Soldiers to lend a hand?"</p><p></p><p>The others were also curious.</p><p></p><p>The Earth-level Armored Soldiers from the Middle Earth Rakshasa Country are not ordinary Armored Soldiers, probably even ordinary treasures would not impress them.</p><p></p><p>"Our Ninguo's treasures, those Earth-level Armored Soldiers really don't care about.</p><p></p><p>But... they came to Ninguo for an important matter.</p><p></p><p>As long as we help them solve this matter, I'm sure they will be willing to lend a hand once.</p><p></p><p>"What matter?" </p><p></p><p>"If they can't do it, how can we do it?"</p><p></p><p>"They came to Ninguo to search for a deity." The Mountain King's gaze was solemn.</p><p></p><p>"What, a deity?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a deity?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a deity has appeared in our Ninguo?"</p><p></p><p>The Armored Soldiers or artifact masters present all started to breathe rapidly.</p><p></p><p>That's a deity, the legendary deity!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers were just legends, then in the Ning Country, one could occasionally still see the traces of the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers from other countries.</p><p></p><p>But the gods, that is truly just a legend.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the expression on the young master Tu's face suddenly changed, as he remembered his light sword.</p><p></p><p>"Gods?"</p><p></p><p>Was that... a god?</p><p></p><p>And the mysterious man who appeared at the Red Cloud Stronghold, was he also related to the gods?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the breathing of young master Tu became rapid.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the other party... was truly related to the gods? "Summon the servants, distribute the information about that god to everyone present," the King of the Mountain waved his hand, and a group of maids immediately entered carrying folded papers.</p><p></p><p>These folded papers contained information about that divine being.</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately began to read them carefully.</p><p></p><p>After about tens of breaths, the elder of the Battle family said, "Such a divine being, if he were to appear in this world, we would have known about it long ago, finding him is too difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there is not enough time, not to mention, he may not be in the Jining Prefecture, not in the Jiang State."</p><p></p><p>"This can only be considered a last resort."</p><p></p><p>The group discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the eyes of young master Tu were shining.</p><p></p><p>"Wielding the light, like a god descending... this must be that divine being, unexpectedly he is the legendary First Divine Artifact, the Descending God, the God of Judgment!"</p><p></p><p>He was both nervous and excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had actually come into close contact with the divine being.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the voice of the patriarch of the Tu family reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"This seems to have a connection with your light sword, and the summoning of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Father, there is indeed a connection!" young master Tu said in a low voice, "But according to what the King of the Mountain said, the two waves of Heaven-level Armored Soldiers did not seem to have good intentions towards that divine being, and that divine being is also hiding his identity, perhaps he does not want us to expose him. If we reveal it, the divine being's wrath would be more terrifying than the Luo Qing Water Lord."</p><p></p><p>Offending the Luo Qing Water Lord, at most the Jining Prefecture and a dozen or so counties would be flooded.</p><p></p><p>Offending the divine being, well... the entire Ning Country would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Young master Tu did not dare to expose Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this is also a helpless move, seeking a glimmer of possibility among the many impossibilities," the Melancholy Hand Wei Kun said.</p><p></p><p>He also knew how difficult it was to find the divine being, and he was just saying it, to see if anyone present had any clues.</p><p></p><p>But judging from their reactions, it seemed that no one knew.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Xie Danran stood up, his figure upright, his face resolute: "If that's the case, I actually have a plan, but... this plan is too sinister and vicious. If I say it out loud, I'm afraid the people present will stab me in the back. But for the sake of the Sky Palace, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, I still stand up!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran was filled with righteous indignation, passionate and heroic, like a brave warrior ready to sacrifice himself.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, please go ahead and say it!"</p><p></p><p>"We won't blame you!"</p><p></p><p>"We are all for the Sky Palace, for the Jiang State!"</p><p></p><p>Young master Tu saw this scene, and a trace of disdain flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Among the Sky Palace, the one he disliked the most was Xie Danran, a shameless scoundrel, and also narrow-minded and vindictive.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran stepped forward, head lowered: "Our ordinary treasures in Ning Country may not be valued by the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers of the Luo Sha Country, but what if they are not ordinary?"</p><p></p><p>"What treasures?" someone asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>And some people's expressions suddenly changed, as if they had thought of something, glaring fiercely at Xie Danran.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's gaze turned to Shen Lingxuan, a trace of determination flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Since I can't have it, the useless son-in-law shouldn't get it either! "Sister Shen Lingxuan has a Mysterious Yin Body, this physique is extraordinary. If a Peak-level Earth Armored Soldier were to mate with her, they could comprehend the unity of Heaven and Man, and step into the realm of the Heaven-level Armored Soldier. Even for a Heaven-level Armored Soldier, mating with her can enhance their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Why not offer Sister to the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers who came from the Luo Sha Country in the Central Plains? They will surely lend a hand if they obtain this treasure!" Xie Danran's voice was heroic, with a hint of reluctance in his eyes, "Sister, don't blame your brother, your brother is thinking of the bigger picture."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, an angry buzzing erupted on the boat.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's Mysterious Yin Body was not a big secret, this physique was a delicacy that attracted the coveting of countless powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>However, since Shen Lingxuan had not yet become a Peak-level Earth Armored Soldier, the effectiveness of the Mysterious Yin Body had not been fully realized, and with the protection of the Sky Palace and the Shen family, Shen Lingxuan had been safe all along.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Danran, do you know what you're saying?" Shen Wanshan's eyes were about to spew flames, his gaze as sharp as a knife.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran did not pay attention to Shen Wanshan, but looked at Shen Lingxuan: "Sister, with a heart for the world, please make a sacrifice for the greater good, for the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Even if you mate with a Heaven-level Armored Soldier, your life will not be in danger, at most you will just lose your virginity.</p><p></p><p>Rather than giving your body to that useless son-in-law, it's better to maximize the benefits!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's skin was thick, heroic and impassioned.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Danran, why don't you go sacrifice yourself?" Ye Zhen couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"If the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers from the Luo Sha Country like it, what's wrong with me sacrificing myself?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran didn't have a hundred thousand, so he wasn't afraid of making a donation.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a good method," a member of the opposing family of the Shen family chimed in, stirring the pot.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yin Body... can be considered a special treasure, even the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers may not refuse it," someone else said, apparently approving of Xie Danran's words.</p><p></p><p>"This plan, though unethical, is useful."</p><p></p><p>"If there is no other way, this is not a bad solution."</p><p></p><p>Some murmured, but more remained silent.</p><p></p><p>At this time, young master Tu's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>This Xie Danran... has already found a way to die! He knew that Shen Lingxuan's husband Qi Yuan had a deep connection with that divine being, even to the point of saying that...</p><p></p><p>He proposed to send Shen Lingxuan to the Heaven-level Armored Soldiers of the Luo Sha Country, simply courting death.</p><p></p><p>"Father, quickly stop Xie Danran!"</p><p></p><p>"Listen to me, it must be right, the specific reasons, I'd rather not reveal!"</p><p></p><p>Young master Tu hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Tu family's face changed repeatedly, but in the end he said in a deep voice, "Hold on, this matter, the old man does not agree. Where is there the act of sacrificing an innocent woman in exchange for peace?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wanshan looked at the patriarch of the Tu family with gratitude, but also with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Because of Shen Lingxuan, the Shen family's development speed in recent years has been astonishing, vaguely surpassing the Tu family to become the number one family in the Jining Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the Tu family should be happy if Shen Lingxuan is gone, so Shen Wanshan was surprised that the Tu family spoke up for Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sacrificing one person to save the world, I think it's worth it. If the one to be sacrificed is me, I will gladly give my life!" Xie Danran began to use moral blackmail.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Tu family sneered, "Good, if that's the case, if you commit suicide now, I won't stop your plan.</p><p></p><p>But if you don't commit suicide, hmph, as the young lady of our Gu Mountain, no one can take her away!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the patriarch of the Tu family to say that.</p><p></p><p>"What, you don't dare to commit suicide? You said that sacrificing one person to save the world is worth it, sacrificing one more person, I suppose you also think it's worth it, why don't you sacrifice yourself?" The patriarch of the Tu family stepped up the pressure, seeing Xie Danran's pale face, he sneered, "A clown-like character, without courage or strategy, just a little cleverness, do you really think you're a wise man?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's face turned pale, head lowered, and there were many disdainful gazes around him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, just die, will you?" someone mocked.</p><p></p><p>"If you die, we won't object," others also laughed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether they object or not is another matter once he's dead.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ones with the least say in this world are the "dead".</p><p></p><p>How many people have heroically sacrificed themselves, hoping to use their own deaths to bring about clarity, or to attract the attention of those above.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, once you're dead, you have no more value, who will... part the clouds for you?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's put this matter aside for now," the Melancholy Hand Wei Kun looked at Xie Danran with disdain, and the place became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>Just then, someone rushed into the cabin from outside, it was Cloud Li and Cloud Hu.</p><p></p><p>They had lost track of Jiang Yunxi and had been searching for a long time, and now they had come to see the King of the Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it's not good, the young miss..." </p><p></p><p>The King of the Mountain heard this voice, his face suddenly changing, "What happened to Yunxi?"</p><p></p><p>"The young miss, she... killed many fish with a knife!"</p><p></p><p>"......" The King of the Mountain (_).</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not killing, it's electrocuting. After electrocuting the fish, she disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Aoyeshan Lake, a flat-bottomed boat was sailing.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi held a kitchen knife, constantly chopping and stomping, as if she was cutting vegetables.</p><p></p><p>Crackle, crackle, purple electric currents entered the water, and hundreds of strange fish died.</p><p></p><p>"You have slain one strange fish, your experience value has increased slightly."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi continued to electrocute the fish, her mood quite beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Chef, I've killed them all again, they're too weak, they can't withstand being killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, killing them like this is too slow. Come, let's go to their lair and wipe them out," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The acting degree has reached 80, only 20% away from perfection.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan speculated that if he killed all the strange fish here, or chopped up a delicious ingredient and made a heavenly delicacy, perhaps he could achieve perfection and obtain an amazing reward, as well as unlock the next character to play.</p><p></p><p>As for the next character to play, Qi Yuan was very looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>He was now at the peak of the Purple Mansion, and he had plans for his Yin Deity Dao in his heart.</p><p></p><p>To know all things, to know all beings, is to create all beings.</p><p></p><p>If he did not create the world, how could he dare to call himself a divine being?</p><p></p><p>And after creating the world, he could link up with his own Underworld, forming a closed loop, and creating a perfect world.</p><p></p><p>"Wipe them out? Face the Luo Qing Water Lord?" Jiang Yunxi's small face turned pale, a little afraid.</p><p></p><p>"How confident are you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I... have no confidence at all," Jiang Yunxi said weakly.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was Chef who gained experience by killing the strange spirits, she didn't gain any.</p><p></p><p>"Not even 1% confident? That means you have 99% confidence.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, you really are the chef I've taken a liking to. Come, let's go wipe out the Luo Qing Water Lord!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"...Ah?" Jiang Yunxi's face flushed red, wanting to explain.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan didn't give her a chance to explain.</p><p></p><p>With a splash, the boat overturned, and Jiang Yunxi, holding the kitchen knife, fell into the depths of the Aoyeshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Confident chef, don't be afraid of difficulties, charge!" Qi Yuan encouraged.</p><p></p><p>"Save the world, count on you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Mmm..." After swallowing a lot of water, Jiang Yunxi finally calmed down, she was a little scared, "Chef, can I really do it?"</p><p></p><p>That was the terrifying Luo Qing Water Lord, even the Sky Palace was powerless against it.</p><p></p><p>"So-called strange spirits, are just oversized ingredients after all, chop it up and make some buns for the old man to eat," Qi Yuan was very considerate.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

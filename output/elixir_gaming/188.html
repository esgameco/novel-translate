        <h1>Chapter 188</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How could the Plague Lord not be angry?</p><p></p><p>What virtue or ability did he have to be subdued by the Great Venerable? The terrifying lightning serpents, each capable of slaying a true god who had taken one step towards heaven.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this terrifying powerhouse, he had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Lightning God stood in the sky, wild winds blowing, his hair thick and short. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice reached his ears, and he was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>His great hand quickly grabbed.</p><p></p><p>The incomparably powerful Plague Lord was seen with only a small piece of flesh remaining in his body.</p><p></p><p>The Lightning God grabbed that piece of flesh and appeared before Qi Yuan: "Disciple, you spoke too slowly, but it's fine, he still has some life in him."</p><p></p><p>The Lightning God's broad palm opened, revealing a small blackened and charred piece of meat inside.</p><p></p><p>This meat was more well-done than what you'd find in a barbecue restaurant.</p><p></p><p>But... it was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at that piece of flesh, his gaze flickering: "Can I have it, boss?"</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the powerful figure before him was a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Although not comparable to the Moon-Gazing Venerable, he was still a Great Venerable, not someone he could deal with now.</p><p></p><p>A great man should know when to be humble and when to stand tall.</p><p></p><p>"I said I would give you a welcome gift, of course I'll give it to you," said the Lightning God, handing that burnt piece of meat to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at that lump of meat, the sword on his back appeared, and a strong light flashed suddenly.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to slay the god and gain experience points.</p><p></p><p>"Take my sword, you old thing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had coveted this goddess for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Then, after various schemes and careful planning, he finally tricked her.</p><p></p><p>The experience and evil god's spiritual power couldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The sword collided with the piece of meat, and an awkward thing happened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan almost stumbled.</p><p></p><p>That piece of meat was too tough, he couldn't cut through it with one strike.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Lightning God laughed wildly: "You need to eat more meat to build yourself up. Looking at your skinny arms and legs, I bet you couldn't even handle three thousand women in one night."</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew that Qi Yuan had not reached the level of a true god.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching that level, how could he fight against a true god? This lump of flesh placed before Qi Yuan, he couldn't even cut through it.</p><p></p><p>The Lightning God had deliberately come to see Qi Yuan make a fool of himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the subjects in his domain who saw this scene, they all wanted to laugh but didn't dare to.</p><p></p><p>After all, they still had to save face for the divine lord.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Wenqi beside Qi Yuan stretched out her hand and plucked her pipa.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a harsh pipa sound rang out, and that lump of flesh immediately turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless experience points poured into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>He, who had just reached level 70-something not long ago, saw his level continuously rising, instantly reaching level 89, stopping just short of level 90.</p><p></p><p>The powerful evil god's spiritual power also fell into Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt somewhat elated.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he look towards that short-haired, burly old man, his gaze flickering: "Boss, your strength is not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is not bad either," the Lightning God looked at Qi Yuan, "In ancient times, which faction did you belong to?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Lightning God and said secretly: "My identity is somewhat special. If I tell you, don't tell others."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Lightning God understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he must be someone carrying out a special mission, otherwise how would he know so many true gods that he had never heard of.</p><p></p><p>"I belong to... the Chinese Dragon Team!" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Chinese Dragon Team, who doesn't know about it?</p><p></p><p>It's full of talents, so it's normal for some "Four Heavenly Kings" to appear, right?</p><p></p><p>"Chinese Dragon Team?" The Lightning God silently repeated these four words, "I've never heard of it, but upon first hearing these words, it feels... quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Boss, are you interested in joining the Dragon Team?</p><p></p><p>If you join now, I can make you a captain of a special action squad," Qi Yuan persuaded.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a Great Venerable was still very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Lightning God's eyes were playful and smiling: "I came to take you as my disciple, I don't want to join some Chinese Dragon Team or whatever.</p><p></p><p>My strength is pretty good, right? Come, be my disciple, and I as your master will love you very much."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan showed a surprised expression: "You want to take me as your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile on the Lightning God's face froze.</p><p></p><p>"I cultivate with the five elements, build my foundation with the Heavenly Way, and condense a sun-star golden core... your strength is just so-so, but you could become a member of my team, one of the special effects artists," Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>He had music and BGM, but every time he went on an expedition, he was still lacking in special effects artists.</p><p></p><p>The Lightning God's endless sea of lightning and terrifying thunder god would definitely be enough for special effects.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," the Lightning God narrowed his eyes, "You have a master?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan looked at the Lightning God, "I don't know how strong my master is, but... definitely much, much stronger than you.</p><p></p><p>Even though I've condensed a sun-star golden core, I wouldn't dare to compare myself to my beautiful master."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>His master Ruan Yixi had always been very mysterious in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Your master sounds interesting, where is she?" the Lightning God asked.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking, Qi Yuan's master sounded so strong, probably the leader of the so-called Chinese Dragon Team.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a powerhouse who had taken six or even seven steps towards heaven?</p><p></p><p>If so, he indeed couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>"My master is quite introverted. Because I keep calling her 'wife', she's a bit shy and ran away," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"..." The Lightning God's expression was strange, "You even call your master 'wife'?"</p><p></p><p>"She is my wife, what's wrong with calling her 'wife'?" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... I'd better not take you as my disciple after all, I'm not that fortunate!" The Lightning God didn't want to be called 'wife' by someone.</p><p></p><p>That scene would be too much.</p><p></p><p>If he took his disciple to meet some old friends in the future.</p><p></p><p>And his disciple kept calling "wife" "wife", it would be too embarrassing for him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he asked: "Has your master ever taken you to meet her friends?"</p><p></p><p>"No," Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Lightning God understood, how could she dare to.</p><p></p><p>That scene, just imagining it was outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Lightning God, feeling puzzled: "I feel like you've misunderstood something, I don't have a habit of calling men 'wife'."</p><p></p><p>The Lightning God smiled: "No misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>"Boss, do you want to join my special effects team? If you join now... you can still be a team leader.</p><p></p><p>When the members of our Chinese Dragon Team and Heavenly Court divine system all descend here someday, you might only be able to play a minor role," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>For him now, the Lightning God was still worth recruiting.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Lightning God smiled and said: "I'm very interested in this Chinese Dragon Team of yours. I'll just watch and see which gods there are, could it be... that I don't know any of them?"</p><p></p><p>"Boss, you can stay in my Qingshui Village, but let me say this upfront, don't steal my kills," Qi Yuan was very against kill-stealing.</p><p></p><p>After all, each kill meant huge experience points.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," the Lightning God looked at Qi Yuan, "I won't act rashly, otherwise, if other powerful beings are drawn here, I would die here too."</p><p></p><p>His actions today were actually very restrained.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if it attracted the attention of other new gods, he would also find it difficult to escape.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," Qi Yuan said, breathing a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>In Fehuang City.</p><p></p><p>The people in the governor's mansion were all surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the Plague Lord... is gone!"</p><p></p><p>"Gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you see the terrifying lightning just now?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be a true god! The Origin Venerable actually has outside help!"</p><p></p><p>"We've all misunderstood him..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Huang Mengying also felt some regret in her heart.</p><p></p><p>They had always been very wary of the Origin Venerable before.</p><p></p><p>Now that the truth was revealed, she felt very guilty inside.</p><p></p><p>The others who heard this all felt somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Ruoyu was the same.</p><p></p><p>Because of his fear of the Origin Venerable, he had directly left Shisha Town and come to Fehuang City.</p><p></p><p>The shame in his heart was even more severe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Nangong Wuji said with a serious face: "With the fall of the Plague Lord... the greatest crisis for Fehuang City is just beginning!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of everyone present became heavy again.</p><p></p><p>Before, because Fehuang City had been targeted by the Plague Lord, other evil gods didn't have designs on Fehuang City.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Plague Lord's fall, those evil gods would probably be unable to resist making a move on Fehuang City.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Qingshui Village to see the Origin Venerable!" Huang Mengying made the decision.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, about a quarter of an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>A clear voice resounded throughout Flying Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>"By order of the Origin Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"The Plague Venerable has perished!"</p><p></p><p>"Flying Desolation City shall hold a feast for three days!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd that was preparing to go to Qingshui Village stopped in their tracks at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wuji shook his head: "This Origin Celestial Venerable is truly an interesting character. What a pity, what a pity."</p><p></p><p>"What's a pity?" someone asked Nangong Wuji.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I believe in the Foodless Holy Mother. Otherwise, I would certainly feast for three days," Nangong Wuji said.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Origin Celestial Venerable wants to hold a three-day feast in Flying Desolation City, it means he has taken over the city. As for the matter of evil gods invading, he will handle it, so we don't need to worry anymore," Nangong Wuji said.</p><p></p><p>The Plague Venerable had just descended, only to be slain by the Origin Celestial Venerable, a village-level deity from Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>This news spread like wildfire to nearby cities and regions.</p><p></p><p>Many true gods took notice of Qi Yuan, their eyes curious. Some evil gods looked contemptuous, not taking Qi Yuan seriously.</p><p></p><p>There were also some ancient gods whose eyes flashed with an unusual light.</p><p></p><p>In the Dragon's Eye of the North Sea.</p><p></p><p>A woman in a gorgeous long robe held some invitations in her slender hands.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes carried a hint of an astonished smile: "The Origin Celestial Venerable of Qingshui Village... actually destroyed the Plague Venerable. Interesting, interesting."</p><p></p><p>This was the second time she had heard the name of the Origin Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The first time was a few days ago when the master of the North Sea God's Eye Palace wanted to hold a Hundred Flowers Gathering and sent out invitations widely, inviting some ancient gods to attend.</p><p></p><p>She was in charge of this matter.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, an old friend of hers came to her, wanting to add one more spot.</p><p></p><p>She looked at it and saw that the person was only a village-level guardian deity, not even a true god, and might not even have reached the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>She had to politely refuse that friend.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, any Tom, Dick, and Harry would be able to come to the Hundred Flowers Gathering.</p><p></p><p>However, now that the other party had the combat power of a true god, she might as well do her friend a favor.</p><p></p><p>"Someone, call Ma Po over," said the woman in the gorgeous robe.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, an old woman entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's expression was somewhat dazed, her gaze cloudy, looking not in very good spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Ma Po, the guardian deity of Qingshui Village you mentioned last time should have the combat power of a true god. Originally, he still wasn't qualified to attend the Hundred Flowers Gathering, but considering our many years of friendship, I'll give this invitation to him," the woman in the gorgeous robe took out an invitation and tossed it to Ma Po.</p><p></p><p>Ma Po received the invitation, and a glimmer of clarity appeared in her cloudy eyes: "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The woman in the gorgeous robe smiled: "What's there to thank between us, with our friendship?</p><p></p><p>However, you should remind that ancient god that the guests coming to the North Sea God's Eye this time are all of extremely noble status. He should try to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he offends other ancient gods, I won't be able to smooth things over."</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Ma Po nodded.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the gorgeous robe looked at Ma Po, her gaze filled with emotion: "Our two clans used to be close friends, both great clans in ancient times. What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>The North Sea God's Eye was inhabited by the water clan.</p><p></p><p>Without the consent of the water clan, even true gods couldn't enter the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>Add to that other geographical advantages, so other evil gods haven't set their sights on the North Sea God's Eye for now.</p><p></p><p>In the northern lands, the safest place was the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>Every year, many true gods came to the North Sea God's Eye seeking protection.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ma Po's eyes flashed with a sharp light: "The Phoenix Clan will surely be reborn from the ashes!"</p><p></p><p>As long as she could bring the young miss back to their ancestral lands, the young miss would surely have a chance to obtain the Phoenix Clan's legacy and restore the clan's glory.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, the Phoenix Clan had produced several powerful beings who had reached the sixth step of heaven-treading.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, they were considered one of the giants.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the treasures in his hand, his gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>"These five treasures... actually can't help me break through to the true god realm?"</p><p></p><p>After reaching level 89, Qi Yuan had prepared to break through to the true god realm.</p><p></p><p>However, even with five treasures prepared, Qi Yuan had a feeling that he couldn't break through to the true god realm.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at these five treasures.</p><p></p><p>[Xuanling Armor, of somewhat mysterious origin, can help one break through to the true god realm.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Three Joys Jade, of somewhat mysterious origin, can help one break through to the true god realm.]</p><p></p><p>"It clearly says it can, why can't I? Could it be... I'm not human?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these treasures, feeling strange and also curious.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and walked out of the temple.</p><p></p><p>He immediately saw his goddaughter Qi Qi, as well as the Thunder Grand Venerable.</p><p></p><p>After coming to Qingshui Village, the Thunder Grand Venerable had originally wanted to take Qi Yuan as his disciple.</p><p></p><p>But later, when he met Qi Qi, he thought about taking Qi Qi as his disciple instead.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Qi didn't agree.</p><p></p><p>Why work hard herself when her godfather could work hard for her? "Qi Qi, your talent is no less than your godfather's, you really shouldn't waste it!" the Thunder Grand Venerable advised earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi shook her head: "Don't say anymore, I refuse."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's light laughter came out: "Qi Qi is right. If you took him as your master, wouldn't he be of the same generation as me? I'd be at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder Grand Venerable widened his eyes: "Being of the same generation as me, that's beneath you?"</p><p></p><p>"Just a little bit," Qi Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>If looks could kill, the Thunder Grand Venerable would have killed Qi Yuan dozens of times already: "You little brat, your mouth is even fouler than mine. Be careful, misfortune may come out of that mouth!"</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, the Thunder Grand Venerable felt that Qi Yuan was very much to his liking.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, a guy who wasn't even a true god jumping around in front of him like this would have long since met an unknown death.</p><p></p><p>"I brush my teeth every day, my mouth isn't foul," Qi Yuan looked at the Thunder Grand Venerable, "Do you want me to recommend a toothpaste for you...</p><p></p><p>Hmm, Nice Yaya Le, it's very suitable for you."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Grand Venerable rolled his eyes at Qi Yuan: "Weren't you inside preparing to break through to true god? Why did you come out?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out the five supreme treasures, his gaze desolate: "Sigh, I don't know why, but these supreme treasures can't help me break through."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a surprised look flashed in the Thunder Grand Venerable's eyes: "Can't break through?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, can't," Qi Yuan nodded forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder Grand Venerable's gaze surged: "These supreme treasures can indeed help people break through to the true god realm.</p><p></p><p>But... for some true geniuses with immense potential, using one supreme treasure indeed can't help them break through.</p><p></p><p>They need... more.</p><p></p><p>Kid, could you be this kind of genius? I couldn't tell."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Grand Venerable was incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Because this kind of genius was very rare.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's face fell: "That dramatic?"</p><p></p><p>He knew that supreme treasures like the Yin Birth Stone were limited in number in this world.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, there were only so many.</p><p></p><p>If there were still restrictions on breaking through, if he summoned someone of the level of Erlang Shengjun, wouldn't it mean... even using these treasures wouldn't allow a breakthrough to true god?</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of this matter, we have to go back to ancient times," the Thunder Grand Venerable spoke, looking at the supreme treasures in Qi Yuan's hand, "Do you know what these treasures... are?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan held the treasures, somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"These supreme treasures are actually... items transformed from the Foodless Holy Mother before her death," the Thunder Grand Venerable said, his voice tinged with desolation, "In the Great Flood War, the Foodless Holy Mother was the strongest ancient god in our Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Her strength was only one step away from surpassing true godhood.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, facing the evil gods, she still perished in the end.</p><p></p><p>The invasion of evil gods broke the heavenly pillar of the Mortal Heart Realm, and since then... people of the Mortal Heart Realm could no longer break through to the true god realm.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother couldn't bear to see this. Before her death, she transformed her body into these supreme treasures, giving the Mortal Heart Realm an alternative path."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother's act had a sense of 'when a whale falls, ten thousand creatures rise'.</p><p></p><p>"Because of this, once a person's talent is too high, surpassing the Foodless Holy Mother, a single supreme treasure is very difficult to help them break through to true god.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there are some with extraordinary talent who can't break through even with many supreme treasures," the Thunder Grand Venerable explained slowly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Foodless Holy Mother was once possibly the number one figure in the Mortal Heart Realm, her talent wasn't at the absolute pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: There's another chapter coming around 2:30. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend a book: "Shocking! The Female Emperor Got Stuck in My Wall!"</p><p></p><p>I actually wanted to write about this idea before, ancient gods and immortals getting stuck in walls, but since I didn't have time to write it, I recommended it to some author friends to write. It's very interesting!</p><p></p><p>Recommendation: If one day you wake up and find an empress stuck in your house, what would you do?</p><p></p><p>There's a link below!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But, three hundred years later, the Demon Slaying Assembly?</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly wait that long? The Great Qing dynasty would have already fallen by then, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>He no longer cared, and logged out at lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>When the annoying wooden cat puppet started meowing again, Qi Yuan didn't throw any more small wooden fish snacks into its mouth this time.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, patted the wooden cat puppet's head, and looked at the beautiful morning light outside: "The day's plan lies in the morning!"</p><p></p><p>He shook off his drowsiness, and his gaze swept into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the towering piles of books and cultivation technique jade slips, his face fell.</p><p></p><p>"Arriving in another world, and still have to 996 (work overtime)!"</p><p></p><p>At the Black Mountain Sect, Qi Yuan had painstakingly emptied the library's books and cultivation technique jade slips.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, cultivation techniques were the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>After all, most of the cultivation techniques in this world were not suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>He needed to read other books, then use the information he saw with his own eyes to accumulate knowledge, and finally perfect his own cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Last time, using his junior sister Jiang Lingsu's cultivation technique jade slips, over 600 of them, Qi Yuan had just skimmed through them, and it had taken him two days.</p><p></p><p>But now, the number of cultivation techniques was not just 600, and the books were much harder to comprehend than the jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, last time it was only Foundation Establishment stage cultivation techniques, which he could skim through easily. Now, he had to carefully study the Foundation Establishment stage cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>With so many books, he definitely couldn't finish them in a month.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan buried himself in the books, reading them diligently.</p><p></p><p>He read them extremely carefully.</p><p></p><p>Because this was the foundation for him to create a Foundation Establishment cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The dry cultivation techniques, he read them more carefully than advanced mathematics.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he read too slowly, each cultivation technique took a long time to read, far from the speed of quantum reading.</p><p></p><p>"It would be better to start cultivating the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment as soon as possible, so that I can release my spiritual sense outwards. That way, reading books wouldn't be so tiring." Qi Yuan flipped through the books, feeling that spiritual sense was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he could only release his spiritual sense outwards after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For several consecutive days, Qi Yuan read books during the day and went online to play the game at night.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of his "wife", Qi Yuan was already able to swagger around in the Ceremonial Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Although he still couldn't slay the Ugly Robe Demon Emperor, as his strength grew, he could now injure the Ugly Robe Demon Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Ugly Robe Demon Emperor was also powerless against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It could only let Qi Yuan rampage freely in the Ceremonial Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Sword Qi Shatters the Skull!</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a head, how can you shatter my skull?"</p><p></p><p>As always, Qi Yuan provided the voiceovers for these Ceremonial Prohibition monsters, entertaining himself and finding some amusement.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the monotonous monster grinding time would be too boring.</p><p></p><p>The experience bar was soaring.</p><p></p><p>He, at level 89, was not far from level 90.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the approaching Ugly Robe Demon Emperor from afar: "Time to scram."</p><p></p><p>He didn't bother fighting the Ugly Robe Demon Emperor, he would wait until he reached level 90, when he would have a better chance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately logged out quickly.</p><p></p><p>He had already killed enough for today, couldn't stay online any longer, or his brain would not be able to take it.</p><p></p><p>After separating from his "wife", Qi Yuan dug a hole as usual.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he noticed a crooked-necked tree on the grave mound, bearing several purple-hued fruits.</p><p></p><p>They looked like a combination of bayberry and apple.</p><p></p><p>He picked some and took a bite, the sour taste of bayberry exploding on his taste buds: "Not bad, do you want to try some?"</p><p></p><p>He offered it to his "wife".</p><p></p><p>His "wife" did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed: "No mouth, can't eat, can't... Guess we'll have to get a divorce!"</p><p></p><p>His "wife" was very aggrieved, and slid out a wooden board with a "snuggle" message.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, embraced his "wife" and crawled into the hole.</p><p></p><p>He changed to a comfortable position, just like a salted fish lying on the bed, embracing the cold "wife", then sent a message to Jinli.</p><p></p><p>But he lowered his head and looked at the obedient and cute, silent "wife".</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had a "wife", and was still chatting with a female online friend, would that be considered cheating?</p><p></p><p>It seems that after the divorce, the court would definitely order him to compensate her.</p><p></p><p>He had nothing except for a big treasure sword.</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, Qi Yuan resumed his usual chat with Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was like the evening breeze by the river, cool and fine, blowing on one's body, like a drizzle.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is there any unusual activity in the Sima Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>"I'm almost done with my official attire inspection, maybe I can help you out."</p><p></p><p>"Good night, I'm too tired to stay up playing games anymore, I need to get up early to study tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Seeing these messages, the beautifully dressed Jinli also replied with a "Good night."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a worried look was lingering on her face.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, a powerful imperial-level expert from the Prime Minister's Mansion had mysteriously died a gruesome death.</p><p></p><p>This should be good news for Jinli, but she just couldn't feel happy about it.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting and her maintained a delicate balance.</p><p></p><p>Now that an imperial-level expert had perished, Sima Ting might no longer care about face and legitimacy, and forcefully seize the throne.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the military movements of the Southern Qian Kingdom have been extremely frequent.</p><p></p><p>Jinli could already feel the murderous aura permeating the capital from the approaching army.</p><p></p><p>But the only force she could rely on was just a few thousand imperial guards.</p><p></p><p>The imperial power had been shelved for twenty years.</p><p></p><p>How could she turn the tide now?</p><p></p><p>Jinli was exhausted, and with a heavy drowsiness, she slowly drifted into sleep.</p><p></p><p>What she didn't know was that a major event was being plotted within the Prime Minister's Mansion at this very moment.</p><p></p><p>The originally arrogant and noble Prime Minister Sima Ting was now hunched over like a submissive lapdog.</p><p></p><p>Next to him were two people, one fat and one thin.</p><p></p><p>The fat one was the powerful demonic figure that Sima Ting least wanted to see. It was with his help that Sima Ting had risen to power in the early years. This was Sima Ting's Achilles' heel.</p><p></p><p>The thin one was an imperial-level expert from the Holy Gate Sect.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting never imagined that these two would be colluding.</p><p></p><p>And now, the two most powerful forces in the world had set their sights on the Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The pressure fell upon him.</p><p></p><p>The thin imperial expert narrowed his eyes: "Sima Ting, the mortal armies are nothing to be concerned about. You will be credited greatly for this, and in three years, when the Holy Master's plan succeeds, you can have whichever of the dozen-odd kingdoms you desire."</p><p></p><p>The demonic imperial ruler then let out a hearty laugh: "Those who achieve great things do not get bogged down in trivial matters."</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, they had, in collaboration with the Holy Gate Sect's proxy, assassinated the true Holy Gate Sect Master. As a price, the Holy Gate Sect would cede the Southern Qian Kingdom to the demonic clan.</p><p></p><p>And now, this demonic imperial ruler had come, bearing the supreme imperial decree, to take the lead.</p><p></p><p>The lead task was simple: to deplete the military strength of the Southern Qian Kingdom, while forging an unparalleled imperial scepter - the Bloodless Imperial Scepter.</p><p></p><p>The conditions required to forge this imperial scepter were extremely harsh.</p><p></p><p>So he had contacted the Holy Gate Sect to put pressure on Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>Instructing Sima Ting to mobilize the troops and enter the capital, set up a grand formation, accumulate the murderous aura of the army, and then slaughter a city, so that the blood energy would be intensified to the extreme, in order to forge the unparalleled Bloodless Imperial Scepter.</p><p></p><p>And the cost of all this would be Sima Ting's foundation.</p><p></p><p>His army, and the entire Southern Qian Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting wanted to resist, but faced with the two most powerful forces in this world, he could only bow his head.</p><p></p><p>Now his life was in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the benefits offered by the Holy Gate Sect expert, he could only swallow it.</p><p></p><p>"Everything will be done as instructed by the esteemed ones. All the troops have already been slowly moving into the capital."</p><p></p><p>Previously, Sima Ting had deployed the troops outside the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was just a matter of letting these troops enter the city, which would happen quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Sima Ting, very good, ambitious, knowing when to advance and retreat, the Holy Gate Sect will not let you down." The thin imperial ruler patted Sima Ting's shoulder, very satisfied. "After this is done, there will be a seat for you among the Hall Elders, your status in the Holy Gate Sect will not be lower than mine."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sima Ting's heart was filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>That was what he had been longing for.</p><p></p><p>With the Hall Elder's token, he would be the chess master overlooking the dozen-odd kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being a mere pawn, bound hand and foot, despite his great power.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, esteemed one!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic imperial ruler then bared his large teeth: "I heard the Southern Qian Kingdom's Empress is a ravishingly beautiful woman. I've always liked collecting wine vessels. When the capital is destroyed, leave that Empress's head for me. The head of a beautiful woman, and a Queen no less, would make the perfect wine vessel, the taste would be exquisite."</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting shuddered at these words, but still nodded in agreement: "Good!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chopped like cutting vegetables, killing the two Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The incident happened too suddenly, and Jiang Lingsu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>When she heard Qi Yuan's shout, she blinked her big eyes and showed a pitiful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Martial Brother, I didn't see anything, I don't know anything!"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Eldest Martial Brother is an old demon who has possessed someone?</p><p></p><p>This was Jiang Lingsu's first thought.</p><p></p><p>Killing two Foundation Establishment cultivators with a kitchen knife, isn't that too fierce? No wonder he has such a strong aura of killing intent, it doesn't seem fake.</p><p></p><p>She had naively thought that the Eldest Martial Brother had just played too many games, and developed this killing aura.</p><p></p><p>Surely, he must have gone out to hunt and kill every day while she was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>With just that one strike just now, if a Qi Condensation cultivator was not on guard, they might even be ambushed and injured.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at the Eldest Martial Brother, feeling a little panicked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also stunned, his face anxious: "Junior Martial Sister, how could you do such a thing to the Eldest Martial Brother, without taking responsibility?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at the Eldest Martial Brother's expression, it didn't seem like an act.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine that this was the fierce person who had suddenly struck and killed the two Foundation Establishment cultivators just now.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that her judgment was wrong, or this old demon was too skilled at disguise.</p><p></p><p>She secretly activated the Kun Qian Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The result showed that the Eldest Martial Brother's cultivation was at the peak of Qi Condensation, his divine soul was intact, and there were no signs of possession.</p><p></p><p>This made her both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>Surprised that the Eldest Martial Brother was so fierce.</p><p></p><p>Delighted that the Eldest Martial Brother was not an old demon who had possessed someone.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was completely puzzled, carefully recalling the Eldest Martial Brother's actions just now.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that there was nothing special about it, but he just used a kitchen knife to kill the two Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Martial Brother, why are you so fierce? If you don't want to reveal it, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>"You said you would take responsibility, so I'll tell you." Qi Yuan clung to this and wouldn't let go.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu facepalmed, this was the genuine Eldest Martial Brother.</p><p></p><p>"I... will take responsibility." Jiang Lingsu said, feeling a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>It was as if she had slept with the Eldest Martial Brother, and after sleeping with him, she didn't recognize him anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Because in the game, I experienced endless slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Every day, it's kill, kill, kill!</p><p></p><p>Killing, killing, I don't even know how long I've been killing." Qi Yuan said seriously, his tone a bit weary.</p><p></p><p>Was it really from the game jade slip? Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan, for some reason feeling a sense of pity.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the mysterious master on the Seven-Color Peak, who was her foster father, she suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The Eldest Martial Brother's display of magical techniques just now in slaying the two Foundation Establishment cultivators was not particularly exquisite, but the battle skills were natural and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Without endless battles and killings, it would be impossible to hone such battle skills.</p><p></p><p>The Eldest Martial Brother's game jade slip must be an extremely precious one, allowing him to fight and refine himself every day.</p><p></p><p>Such a precious jade slip must have been bestowed by the mysterious master on the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was a bit puzzled, cultivating Qi Condensation techniques with so many combat skills, what use would they have?</p><p>"Eldest Martial Brother, you are truly amazing, in some prosperous cultivation regions, you would be considered a true genius!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, the latter half of the sentence she didn't say out loud.</p><p></p><p>The Eldest Martial Brother could only be considered a youthful genius, and there was still a huge gap compared to those true geniuses who had already grown up.</p><p></p><p>The Eldest Martial Brother's combat power far exceeded that of an ordinary peak Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Fighting beyond one's level, although rare, Jiang Lingsu had seen quite a few.</p><p></p><p>If it was one of the geniuses she knew, suddenly fighting beyond their level, she might have accepted it more easily.</p><p></p><p>But in her original perception, the Eldest Martial Brother was just an ordinary little talent, and suddenly displaying the combat power of a genius, she immediately imagined many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Jiang Lingsu suddenly felt as if the clouds had parted and everything became clear.</p><p></p><p>The Eldest Martial Brother was that mysterious master's disciple, so it's only natural that he would be comparable to a genius, right? The Eldest Martial Brother had the strength of a genius, and his appearance was also exceptionally handsome, so he could be considered a pretty good man.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, a ripple of emotion surged in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard Jiang Lingsu say that he was comparable to a genius, and he said, "Junior Martial Sister, you don't need to flatter me, you said you would take responsibility!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu felt the imaginary scene she had just conjured up shattered: "Eldest Martial Brother, it would be better if you didn't have a mouth."</p><p></p><p>"Whether I have a mouth or not, you have to take responsibility!</p><p>This time it was you who instigated me, you are the mastermind, and I am the accomplice!" Qi Yuan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu gave Qi Yuan a cold look, her eyes full of charm.</p><p></p><p>"I killed these two." Jiang Lingsu said softly.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, she had already planned how to handle the aftermath of the killings.</p><p>Of course, she wouldn't shift the blame to the Radiant Sect, but would take full responsibility herself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and his heart sank: "I just happened to pass by, I can be a witness, it was these two who attacked Junior Martial Sister first, and Junior Martial Sister had no choice but to retaliate!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was already almost immune to the Eldest Martial Brother's way of thinking.</p><p>Is this human speech? Directly from the murderer to the witness.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu and Qi Yuan went to the bodies, and Jiang Lingsu bent down and took Zhu Lianhua's storage bag.</p><p>She gently shook her hand, and a jade slip fell into her palm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had a knowing expression: "As expected, the Radiant Palace has sent this person to the Great Chu, wanting to control the Great Chu and bring it under the Radiant Palace."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Qi Yuan came closer.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Continent has thirteen regions, the Radiant Palace is located in the Emerald Cloud Immortal Realm. By taking an immortal ship from the Emerald Cloud Immortal Realm, it takes half a month to arrive at the Hundred Nations.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Nations, does not have a sect as large as the Radiant Palace, and they have been fighting and warring with each other continuously.</p><p></p><p>The Great Chu is one of the Hundred Nations.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Nations is probably as large as one region of the Eastern Continent."</p><p></p><p>"This map is quite big, doesn't that mean I'm just a country bumpkin from the mountains?" Qi Yuan originally joined the Seven-Color Peak and became the Eldest Martial Brother, feeling quite proud, thinking he was a rare talent.</p><p>Now hearing about this world, just the edge of it... it's a bit exaggerated.</p><p>He felt his pride disappearing.</p><p></p><p>He's at most just a village primary school, a deputy group leader in Class 6, Grade 1.</p><p></p><p>Overthrowing the Black Mountain Sect?</p><p>It's just like him having a feud with the fat kid next door, and then going to the fat kid's chicken coop at night to beat up his family's chickens.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Martial Brother, don't be too self-deprecating, the forces in the Hundred Nations are not to be underestimated, the only regret is that there are no cultivators at the Purple Palace Realm." Jiang Lingsu comforted.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan in the Eastern Thirteen Regions was also considered a major clan.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of true experts, they could be extinguished with a snap of the fingers.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu even felt that the future calamity in the Vast Celestial Realm might have been foreseen by some extraordinary experts long ago.</p><p>It's just that those experts might not necessarily tell these "weak ones".</p><p></p><p>"I'm not being self-deprecating, I feel pretty good about it." After the initial disappointment, Qi Yuan then felt a strong sense of security.</p><p>The bigger the world, the more insignificant he would be.</p><p>And the less likely he would encounter those terrifying powerful beings.</p><p>Low-key cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The Radiant Palace wants to support some countries in the Hundred Nations, so Zhu Lianhua was sent here for that purpose."</p><p></p><p>"Interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, he deserves to die!" Qi Yuan heard this and felt that he had killed the right person. "Trying to be the overlord above my head, this Radiant Palace is really disgusting!"</p><p></p><p>"As for me, I'm actually a member of the Divine Flower Association, which has been at odds with the Radiant Palace for a long time.</p><p>What they want to do, I naturally have to disrupt." Jiang Lingsu smiled slyly.</p><p></p><p>She pushed her hand, and a strange petal fell from her palm, sticking into Zhu Lianhua's chest.</p><p></p><p>"This is the symbol of the Divine Flower Association. When their bodies are sent back to the Radiant Palace, seeing this petal, they will know who killed them." Jiang Lingsu said, "Now what we need to do is to have their bodies discovered and then sent to the Lingxiao Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The latter part was not that important, it could be easily handled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's focus was on the first part: "Divine Flower Association, what is that?"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Flower Association is a cultivation alliance formed by some people with aspirations.</p><p>Unlike the Radiant Palace, the Divine Flower Association is very loose, and there are no complicated rules.</p><p>Everyone who joins the Divine Flower Association hides their identity and exchanges resources in secret." Jiang Lingsu explained.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was interested.</p><p></p><p>It sounded quite good.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Sister, can I join?" Qi Yuan was most lacking in cultivation techniques.</p><p>He wanted to join and obtain some cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu heard this, and she said, "Eldest Martial Brother, your talent is good, but your background is a bit low."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was taken aback: "Cultivation doesn't care about background? Kings, nobles, and ministers, none have a monopoly on talent!"</p><p>Not accepting him? Defame it! Defame it fiercely! Jiang Lingsu smiled: "Of course background matters, what's lacking in this world is not geniuses, but resources.</p><p>But no matter, after you reach the Foundation Establishment realm, with my recommendation, you should be able to join the Divine Flower Association."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the Divine Flower Association seems quite interesting, thank you Junior Martial Sister." Qi Yuan, the Slayer of Dragons, had become the Evil Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Martial Brother, we should leave now." Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Si said, "Sister, should we touch the corpses?"</p><p></p><p>The sister was a wealthy woman, and she might disdain touching corpses. But he was just a poor boy, and he couldn't afford to eat if he didn't touch the corpses.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing precious in his storage bag, except for a precious cultivation technique jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The other one is even poorer, with only some junk in his storage bag," Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>Her hand rummaged through, bringing out a pile of miscellaneous things, mixed with a bunch of crooked and cracked spirit stones, most of which fell from Wangshuang's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>This is called junk?</p><p></p><p>But remembering his own knife, which he went to rummage through the trash pile outside Sister's thatched hut every night, he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, these things are not even worth being trash to his sister.</p><p></p><p>The child of a poor family grows up early, Qi Yuan silently picked up the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, this is the introductory technique of the Guangming Palace, the Xuantian Guangming Jue, which is a low-grade Xuan-level technique, just ordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, it is only cultivated by ordinary disciples, there's nothing worth paying attention to.</p><p></p><p>But the secret technique within it, the Huanghuang Sword, is quite interesting," Jiang Lingsu tossed the jade slip to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt more and more that he was like a country bumpkin, needing to be polished.</p><p></p><p>In the Shenguang Sect, the best techniques are only at the Yu-level, and they are still mid-grade.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this "ordinary" technique mentioned by his sister is actually Xuan-level.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the cultivation technique and started to read it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The more he read, the more surprised he felt.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it is a Xuan-level technique, just this one technique contains everything. Qi Yuan had a premonition that if he could comprehend this technique, the gains would be more than looking through thousands, or even tens of thousands of low-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that wasting time every day looking at the pile of low-grade techniques from the Heishan Sect was too much of a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>Spending a few months looking through tens of thousands of low-grade techniques, the gains would not be as much as one Xuan-level technique.</p><p></p><p>If Xuan-level techniques are so terrifying, then how terrifying must the Heaven-level techniques be? If he could obtain a Heaven-level technique, and study it every day, wouldn't he be able to push the "Qi Yuan Sutra" to the Yuandan, or even the Divine Infant realm? As for the techniques obtained in the game, they are not the same source as cultivating the Dao, and cannot be used as a reference to advance the "Qi Yuan Sutra".</p><p></p><p>Of course, this may also be related to Qi Yuan's current strength being too weak, unable to see through the essence of the techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sister, this technique will be of great use to me." Qi Yuan grabbed the jade slip of the cultivation technique, but thinking of something, he said, "Sister, you are the mastermind, you should also take something."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu glared at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even now, she's still the mastermind and the accomplice? She picked up some junk with an annoyed expression: "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two corpses again: "Sister, that flower looks quite valuable."</p><p></p><p>That flower was the symbol of the Shenhua Association.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was completely speechless: "Brother, I think the corpses of those two are quite valuable too. You can take them back to Qise Peak as fertilizer, or refine them into puppets."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm afraid the Guangming Palace will misunderstand!" Qi Yuan quickly refused.</p><p></p><p>The two returned to the Shenguang Sect, but on the way, Jiang Lingsu secretly sneaked into the outer courtyard of the Jingang Hall and left a letter.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Jingang Hall, they returned to their respective rooms.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu stood outside the thatched hut, looking at Qi Yuan's back, a mysterious expression flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had killed with her elder brother, and also learned her elder brother's secret.</p><p></p><p>Now their relationship should be more intimate than before, right?</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother..." She softly called out, preparing to invite her elder brother to have dinner together at night.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks and suddenly turned around: "Sister, you misunderstood. It wasn't me who destroyed the Heishan Sect! Although I killed one Jieji Yuanman today, the Heishan Sect has many Yuandan Elders, each extremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't misunderstand." Jiang Lingsu didn't want to bring up the dinner again.</p><p></p><p>Her elder brother is not an old monster who has possessed someone. A Lianqi Yuanman, what can he use to destroy the Heishan Sect?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, it's impossible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in the thatched hut, his full attention focused on the "Xuantian Guangming Jue", or more specifically, the secret technique within it, the Huanghuang Sword.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique can condense the cultivator's spiritual power into a Huanghuang Sword, capable of slaying the enemy!</p><p></p><p>The condensed Huanghuang Sword is bright and upright, like a light sword, emitting the brilliance of the great sun, enough to captivate the mind and soul, causing evil demons and heretics to fear and momentarily lose their focus, before being killed openly and grandly.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Huanghuang Sword also has a mental attack.</p><p></p><p>This is the supreme secret technique of the Guangming Palace, which all disciples of the Guangming Palace can cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Guangming Palace deliberately spreads it abroad.</p><p></p><p>Because to cultivate the more advanced secret techniques, one needs to make a huge contribution to the Guangming Palace.</p><p></p><p>Knowing this, Qi Yuan has been modifying this cultivation technique these days.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique is to transform one's own righteous qi into the brilliance of the great sun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan has taken a different path, turning his own killing intent into the Huanghuang Sword.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has finally succeeded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's entire body is filled with blood qi.</p><p></p><p>He left the thatched hut and went to the place where he often practiced the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Huanghuang Sword!"</p><p></p><p>A sword strike, like the winter wind cutting through flesh and skin.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a blood-red sword standing in the air, inexplicably terrifying.</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, Qi Yuan felt that he could easily kill a Jieji cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This can be said to be very terrifying. Without relying on the power of a sword, Qi Yuan can easily kill a Jieji, even when the opponent is on guard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this sword, Qi Yuan nodded in satisfaction: "The modification seems to be successful, but... it's blood-red, blood-red, not like the Huanghuang Sword, but more like an evil cultivation sword.</p><p></p><p>No, I have to find an opportunity to turn this blood sword into a light sword in the next period of time!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that his main task in the next period of time was to disguise the blood sword manifested in this technique as a light sword.</p><p></p><p>Then in the future battles, he can also openly take it out, and even imitate the Guangming Palace, using righteousness to suppress others!</p><p></p><p>Look, I have condensed my own righteous qi into a light sword, how could I be an old demon? Qi Yuan returned to his room.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the cold moon on top of Qise Peak, sighing inexplicably: "It's time to kill again. Today... after crossing the last hurdle, as long as I defeat the Golden Armored Divine General, I will completely control Tianjue."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he now has some trepidation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, it may have been less than a month.</p><p></p><p>But in the Tianjue, he has already killed for hundreds of years, nearly a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianjue, he kills every day.</p><p></p><p>The enemies he encounters are also getting stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>His combat skills have also been honed to an astonishing degree.</p><p></p><p>Now, when facing Zanghua, he only needs to use his Ninety-level strength, and he can kill Zanghua with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Zanghua is a 97-level Divine Domain Hegemon.</p><p></p><p>In the ascension steps of the Tianjue, he kills every day, pursuing the goal of learning from his opponents, imitating them, and then defeating them with a single sword.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know how many Divine Domains he has killed.</p><p></p><p>His combat experience against the Divine Domains has reached a terrifying level, and he can kill Divine Domains with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the accumulation of his experience pool has reached a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his level has been stuck at 99, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Too much killing has made Qi Yuan a little weary.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of his little wife who has been fighting alongside him, he perked up his spirits again.</p><p></p><p>"I am a man in armor, ready to slay all enemies!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the game, holding his little wife's icy cold hand, climbing out of the pit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stepped onto the last staircase.</p><p></p><p>As long as he gets through the last staircase, and defeats the Golden Armored Man, he will be able to completely control the Tianjue.</p><p></p><p>The last two battles will be bitter struggles.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his little wife's icy cold hand, and the two of them stepped into the last staircase.</p><p></p><p>The vision in front of him changed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked around, and he saw a series of mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>The peaks were clustered, surrounding him in the middle.</p><p></p><p>On each mountain peak, a Divine Domain powerhouse was seated.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Domain powerhouses, not a single one had undergone the Dragon Judgment, Feather, or Eye.</p><p></p><p>They were all at the peak of the Divine Domain, 99-level existences.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Qi Yuan even felt that their levels might be even higher than 99, but were suppressed to 99 for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan appeared, all the Divine Domain powerhouses on the mountain peaks opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of sharp gazes looked towards Qi Yuan, making him feel like he was on thorns.</p><p></p><p>Just like in "Journey to the West", when the Great Peng bird invaded the Sacred Mountain and was surrounded by countless gods, Buddhas, and Arhats, he now stood in the center of these three thousand Divine Domain powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand Divine Domains?" Qi Yuan held his sword, his figure particularly upright, with a faint blood-colored haze permeating, making him appear enchantingly and extraordinarily handsome.</p><p></p><p>Facing the final Divine Domain powerhouses, his gaze was unusually calm, but if one looked closely, one could see the endless bloodiness in it.</p><p></p><p>But when he lowered his head to look at his little wife, his gaze was filled with a touch of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>"Little wife, we shall fight side by side!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 317</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With Yellow Hair's loud shout, the other four men surrounding him closed in on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Their faces revealed vicious expressions as they cracked their knuckles, eyes gleaming with the mocking look of thugs.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan raised his fist and said coldly, "By the Tianxiu Law, those who serve demons shall be executed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Yellow Hair laughed loudly, "What era are you living in, still talking about the Tianxiu Law!"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>He saw an iron fist coming at him with a speed he couldn't react to, smashing straight into his chest.</p><p></p><p>Stomach acid churned as Yellow Hair saw stars. His eyes bulged, bloodshot. He hunched over like a cooked lobster, his bloodshot eyes protruding.</p><p></p><p>The burly men beside him were stunned, their bodies frozen, unable to react.</p><p></p><p>They saw the young man before them, his fist covered with a red veil. He looked at them with disdain and said, "When was the last time you bathed? Good thing I had the foresight to cover my hand with this red veil, otherwise it would have been dirtied by your chest hair."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Yellow Hair was in no condition to reply to Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>He could barely breathe at this point.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Little Mei's eyes widened in shock. The scene before her was beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, before she could recover from her shock, she saw Qi Yuan casually reach out and pull a butcher's knife from the woodpile.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder ancient people killed with knives and modern people use guns - they're afraid of getting their hands dirty."</p><p></p><p>Holding the butcher's knife, Qi Yuan had another realization.</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed as Qi Yuan's body suddenly leapt up. Using the downward momentum of his body, he slashed swiftly. A fine head fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered, adding another streak of red to this festive day.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's movements were quick. In the brief moment before the head hit the ground, the butcher's knife swung again.</p><p></p><p>A mist of blood sprayed out before the smell of blood could even spread.</p><p></p><p>Those present heard the thud thud thud of heads hitting the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood holding the knife, killing intent in his eyes, like a god of death.</p><p></p><p>The original Fourth Master Huang narrowed his eyes, surprise in his gaze. "A Blood Warrior... You're actually a Blood Warrior!"</p><p></p><p>But it was merely surprise.</p><p></p><p>"You hid it well, breaking through to become a Blood Warrior and stepping onto the path of the extraordinary without anyone noticing," Fourth Master Huang remarked admiringly. "However, don't think that becoming a Blood Warrior means you can run wild. This Yunyan County is not yours to rampage through!"</p><p></p><p>Arrogance flashed in Fourth Master Huang's eyes as he pulled out a cane.</p><p></p><p>The cane was pure white and crystalline, clearly no ordinary object.</p><p></p><p>"This cane is made from the bones of a Blood Warrior," Fourth Master Huang said in a kindly tone. "He was like you, thinking he could do as he pleased because he had some skills.</p><p></p><p>My elder brother's grandson took a fancy to his pregnant wife. That should have been an honor for her.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, she and her husband were both so foolish. She died in my grand-nephew's bed, even biting his mouth till it bled.</p><p></p><p>We of the Huang family hadn't even gone to settle accounts with him, but he... relying on his meager abilities, came to storm our Huang residence.</p><p></p><p>My elder brother saw how he overestimated himself and killed him.</p><p></p><p>I saw his bones were quite hard, so I asked my brother for a few to make this cane.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes, the beads on the cane are made from his wife's skull!"</p><p></p><p>Fourth Master Huang explained unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Little Mei, standing nearby, broke out in a cold sweat hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The demons of Yunyan County truly did eat people.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm. "Your backstory really is that of a big villain. I didn't expect the boss from my game to appear in a game within the game."</p><p></p><p>His mood showed no fluctuation at all.</p><p></p><p>This slightly surprised Fourth Master Huang.</p><p></p><p>He had said those things firstly as a matter of course, to warn Qi Er, and secondly to enrage Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Blood Warriors... their bloodlines were inherently incomplete, making them prone to anger and losing rationality.</p><p></p><p>At such times, their strength might increase slightly, but their speed and agility would greatly decrease.</p><p></p><p>Speed was what Fourth Master Huang excelled at most.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, his words had not angered Qi Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>"You're smarter than the owner of these bones, but your intelligence is limited!"</p><p></p><p>With those words, Fourth Master Huang's originally frail body leapt lightly like an agile monkey.</p><p></p><p>The cane in his hand suddenly struck out at Qi Yuan's back.</p><p></p><p>Light Crane Touches Azure!</p><p></p><p>What Fourth Master Huang used was actually demon martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This martial art was renowned for its speed. When mastered, it could strike an opponent thirteen times in an instant.</p><p></p><p>One hit could severely injure an ordinary Blood Warrior, let alone thirteen hits.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt the wind at his back.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and said, "Dodge!"</p><p></p><p>His form flickered as he avoided the Light Crane Touches Azure.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts in this game... are quite interesting. They enhance you a lot."</p><p></p><p>Martial arts and the Dao arts were two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even magical combat and martial combat were two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>The experience from the Canglang Realm couldn't be completely applied here.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan was not lacking in martial combat experience either.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Wangyue Continent, he had pierced through the Heavenly Extinction. He did not lack martial combat experience.</p><p></p><p>Against Fourth Master Huang, he was completely dominant.</p><p></p><p>The only area where Fourth Master Huang surpassed him was in martial arts, or rather martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>This kind of bloodline martial technique could bring out the power hidden in one's blood and qi, erupting with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>It was very similar to the spells of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan, if compared to a cultivator, would be like a cultivator with high realm but no spells.</p><p></p><p>"But... I have skills!"</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving Sword Draw! Since becoming powerful, Qi Yuan rarely used skills anymore.</p><p></p><p>His skills were universal across all worlds.</p><p></p><p>This time, he used it directly! A powerful gale swept out as Qi Yuan's butcher's knife seemed to be coated in fresh blood, descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife landed on Fourth Master Huang's head. Fourth Master Huang's face showed disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that Qi Er, who had just entered the Blood Realm, could kill him with one strike?</p><p></p><p>And what was that sword strike just now? </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sheathed his knife, a happy smile in his eyes. "Not bad, I finally found the feeling of playing a game and gained three drops of blood."</p><p></p><p>From Fourth Master Huang's body, Qi Yuan extracted three drops of blood.</p><p></p><p>These three drops of blood were the essence of demons, the most valuable thing for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a weasel's corpse lay on the ground, emitting a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>Little Mei stood not far away, her body trembling. But she still gritted her teeth and said, "Brother Qi, you can't drink that blood. Without the government's Blood Calming Pills, drinking demon blood will drive you mad!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan searched through his memories but found nothing about Blood Calming Pills.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know so much? Are you some kind of special NPC?" Qi Yuan looked at Little Mei expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Little Mei's body trembled. Qi Yuan's words confused her, but she finally gritted her teeth and said, "I'll stop pretending. Actually... I'm from the Zhao family of Jiangcuo."</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of them," Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhao family of Jiangcuo is a martial arts family. They often work as armed escorts..."</p><p></p><p>"Get to the point."</p><p></p><p>"I once heard that demons' bodies</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The most precious thing is essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Consuming their essence blood can enhance one's strength. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, consuming the essence blood of demon creatures can greatly improve one's mastery of martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, the essence blood of demon creatures is poisonous. For ordinary blood martial artists, consuming one drop requires one to two years to digest. Consuming too much is useless no matter how long you try to digest it - you'll go insane and become a demon, facing execution.</p><p></p><p>Only the blood-calming pills produced by the government allow one to consume a bit more demon essence blood after taking them.</p><p></p><p>But you still can't take too much, or you'll go crazy!" Little Mei said nervously.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, for martial artists, cultivation follows a step-by-step process, while devouring demon blood is a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>But taking shortcuts easily leads to backlash, causing insanity and turning one into a demon, ultimately resulting in death by explosion.</p><p></p><p>Blood-calming pills can eliminate the toxicity in demon blood, allowing martial artists to consume a bit more demon essence blood.</p><p></p><p>But you still can't take too much, or you'll die.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see, I understand now," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, players get preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>Did he need blood-calming pills? </p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, while taking blood-calming pills had limitations, he had obtained the Devouring Primal Body from the Food Saint Mother.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Primal Body was said to be able to devour all things, so consuming some demon essence blood should be a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm a player, and I have certification. Even if I go crazy, I'm not afraid." Qi Yuan put away the three drops of blood without consuming them for now.</p><p></p><p>According to Little Mei, essence blood could not only enhance strength but also improve mastery of martial techniques. </p><p></p><p>He had to save it.</p><p></p><p>Yellow Fourth Master's martial technique earlier had caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>Since he needed to complete this game, he definitely had to learn the martial techniques in this game.</p><p></p><p>Foolishly practicing martial techniques? Where's the speed in that compared to using demon essence blood to level up?</p><p></p><p>Diligently studying martial arts? Wrong!</p><p></p><p>Demon essence blood, level up! Right.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, you killed Yellow Fourth Master, hurry and run! Yellow Fourth Master's older brother is a demon creature who has achieved great success in blood martial arts!" </p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Little Mei was very worried.</p><p></p><p>Yellow Fourth Master was a demon creature at the initial stage of blood martial arts, considered a notable figure in Yunyun County.</p><p></p><p>But in Yunyun County, the reason Yellow Fourth Master could be called "Master" was because of his elder brother who had achieved great success in blood martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Great success in blood martial arts? That's a bit tricky." Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Great success in blood martial arts, according to his calculations, might be comparable to the peak of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>And his martial arts cultivation was only at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, a huge gap.</p><p></p><p>With just martial arts cultivation, if he encountered Yellow Big Master now, he'd probably die.</p><p></p><p>However, if Qi Yuan used immortal cultivation techniques, the outcome...</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to keep a low profile," Qi Yuan was always steady and cautious.</p><p></p><p>This county had someone comparable to peak Qi Refinement, and possibly even someone comparable to Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>He needed to be low-key.</p><p></p><p>"Yellow Big Master might seek revenge on me. I don't have time to protect you, you should run away." Qi Yuan was kind-hearted after all and still considered the NPC's wellbeing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Little Mei's face showed extreme joy: "Brother Qi, I'll leave right away!"</p><p></p><p>Obviously, she had wanted to run away for a long time.</p><p></p><p>She didn't have much feeling for Qi Yuan either.</p><p></p><p>After all, her life was more important.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so sleepy, time to sleep. I'll continue the quest tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, after the fight, Qi Yuan felt quite tired.</p><p></p><p>Probably because the martial arts battle consumed too much of his blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>Watching Little Mei leave with her belongings, Qi Yuan lay on the bed and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yunyun County, inside the county office.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate looked nervous as he faced four men and women dressed in black tight-fitting clothes, smiling apologetically: "Sirs, all the files regarding the Luo mansion and Chen family are here.</p><p></p><p>This incident occurred strangely. Some say it was the work of demons, while others say that Luo Bufan consumed too much demon essence blood and, in his madness, slaughtered everyone in the Luo mansion and Chen family."</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate looked at the four people, bowing his body as if facing superiors.</p><p></p><p>The four people before him were Demon Suppression Officers from the Demon Suppression Bureau.</p><p></p><p>In the current world where demons run rampant, the reason the Tianxi Dynasty could stand tall was because of the Demon Suppression Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The exact time when the Demon Suppression Bureau was established is unknown, with no detailed records in history books.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Suppression Bureau gathered a group of strange martial artists from all over the world, dedicated to slaying demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may go now." At this moment, a hoarse voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate, having received the order, immediately breathed a sigh of relief and left the room.</p><p></p><p>In the room, only the four people remained.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were here, he would realize that the person who just spoke was... Chen Fan, whom he had met on the yacht.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was dressed in black tight-fitting clothes, with a hint of nostalgia on his face.</p><p></p><p>The other three were looking through the files. Finally, the only female Demon Suppression Officer among them spoke up: "Captain, what do you think of this mission?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan was the strongest among all present, so he was chosen as the captain.</p><p></p><p>They were on a mission, coming to Yunyun County.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, they appeared imposing, but in reality, it was fraught with danger. Who knew if this county magistrate harbored ill intentions?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were quite a number of demon creatures in this Yunyun County.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to make a fuss, fearing to provoke those demon creatures.</p><p></p><p>Exorcise demons?</p><p></p><p>Forget it, better to complete the mission and keep their lives.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't related to the mission, they wouldn't actively provoke those demon creatures.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan put down the files, his gaze deep: "We need to find this key figure, Luo Bufan."</p><p></p><p>"But... didn't Luo Bufan ascend?"</p><p></p><p>"The ascension must be fake. How could an ordinary martial artist possibly ascend?" The round-faced woman spoke, her voice certain.</p><p></p><p>"The mission mentioned this character, which means this person must be extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"It's strange. If I remember correctly, in the real world, there was also a Luo Bufan who broke through the limits of martial arts and ascended. Could it be the same person?" Yang Xuewen asked.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, this is your first mission, so you might not understand. This kind of thing is very common.</p><p></p><p>Our missions are often modifications of reality.</p><p></p><p>Some say... it might be parallel worlds.</p><p></p><p>Exactly how it works... I'm not sure either." The round-faced woman explained.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the nostalgic look on Chen Fan's face deepened. He reminded them: "In Yunyun County, there are three forces we shouldn't offend lightly: the Fish by the sea, the Yellow Weasel in the casino, and the Snake in the brothel."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, before we make progress on the mission, I don't want to conflict with local forces. Even if they're impolite, I'll endure it," the round-faced woman said, looking at things openly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, our primary task is to find Luo Bufan," Chen Fan said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if I form my core here, where would my Fixed Star Golden Core appear?</p><p></p><p>Here... or in the real world?"</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Qi Yuan was eating a steamed bun, looking at the sun in the sky, suddenly having a whimsical thought.</p><p></p><p>He was already at the edge of forming his core.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll still go out to form it. Otherwise, appearing in a game within a game, what kind of situation is that?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan silently complained, stuffed the steamed bun into his mouth, and slowly walked towards the Luo mansion.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully looked at the books.</p><p></p><p>The worry on his brow gradually eased.</p><p></p><p>"Is this all there is to the Black Mountain Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Black Mountain Sect was quite prominent in the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had thought that the Black Mountain Sect's strength was absolutely formidable.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems that the main sect's strength in the Great Merchant Kingdom is only in the third tier.</p><p></p><p>The first tier is the three major Immortal Cultivation sects.</p><p></p><p>The second tier is at least those with the strength of a Nascent Soul, or have the means to withstand the attacks of a Nascent Soul expert.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Mountain Sect has neither. In the Black Mountain Sect, there are only seven Elixir Dao Perfected.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven Elixir Dao Perfected, the strongest is the sect master, who is only at the middle Elixir Dao stage.</p><p></p><p>The rest are only at the initial Elixir Dao stage.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength in the Great Merchant Kingdom only belongs to the third tier.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, without the Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor, the Black Mountain Sect is just this?" </p><p></p><p>The more Qi Yuan thought about it, the more at ease he felt.</p><p></p><p>The knife had already awakened its spiritual intelligence. If it reached the late Elixir Dao stage and its protective elixir light was fully cultivated, he would still have some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>But just a middle Elixir Dao and a few initial Elixir Dao, with their Golden Core still not of high grade, he had no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed as he sneered, "With this strength, they still dare to come and cause me trouble? They have already invited their own deaths!"</p><p></p><p>"Strike first, and the one who strikes later will suffer!"</p><p></p><p>"They must not have expected that I would transcend time and space to slaughter them in advance, nipping this cause and effect in the bud."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan planned his strategy.</p><p></p><p>The Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor was not within the Black Mountain Sect, so as long as he was fast enough, he could completely take his revenge and then flee.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I'm still too weak. Otherwise, would I still need to avoid the Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor? </p><p>I could just directly behead him!"</p><p></p><p>"Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor, I will remember you!"</p><p></p><p>"If only I could truly travel through time and space, I would definitely slaughter you when you were still young and drink your chicken soup, or dance on your grave after your lifespan ends."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but think of a female hero in the Go world on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>That female hero was a powerful expert who had mastered the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>She had defeated the current number one female Go player in the present, and the former number one female Go player in the past.</p><p></p><p>She was revered as "Punching the Southern Mountain Nursing Home" and "Kicking the Northern Sea Kindergarten".</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, what are you doing here?" At this moment, a familiar voice came.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jiang He was staring at Qi Yuan with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>When Zheng Jiang He came to the third floor of the library, he noticed Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attire was strange, and his behavior was sneaky, not like a good person.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in the corner, trying not to attract attention, how could that not be suspicious?</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jiang He had been observing for a while before confirming that this was indeed the senior disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, Senior Brother Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zheng Jiang He, Qi Yuan was also startled.</p><p></p><p>It was like a guilty couple being discovered in the library, but he quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I came to look at some information."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is also looking at information about the Black Mountain Sect? </p><p>If you're done, could you please give me the materials?</p><p>I need to take these materials out of the library and give them to the elders."</p><p>Zheng Jiang He said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Qi Yuan put down the books, then suddenly asked, "What's written here is true, right? The Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor has always been outside the Black Mountain Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jiang He felt Qi Yuan's question was strange, but still answered truthfully, "The Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor's cultivation base is in the Myriad Demon Ridge, thousands of miles away from the Black Mountain Sect. </p><p>The rumor is that the Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor is recently seeking a breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage, and should be in closed-door cultivation for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"That's good." Qi Yuan's heart was greatly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jiang He looked at him strangely, "I wonder what Senior Brother is investigating the Black Mountain Sect for?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zheng Jiang He and took out a kitchen knife, "Do you know what this is?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The pet of my senior brother..." </p><p></p><p>This knife, Zheng Jianghe heard it as clear as thunder.</p><p></p><p>He often saw Qi Yuan walking around with a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Heavenly Bear of the Black Mountain Sect and the Patriarch Bai Chicken were killed by a mysterious powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>And I also use a knife, so I'm afraid the Black Mountain Sect will misunderstand and think that I'm that mysterious powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>So I have to be prepared early and see what powerful experts the Black Mountain Sect has." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe: "......"</p><p></p><p>He coughed and finally said, "Senior brother is really... cautious."</p><p></p><p>How could the people of the Black Mountain Sect possibly suspect you? Zheng Jianghe felt it was absurd.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about Senior Brother Qi Yuan's usual way of thinking, he could understand it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person who dared to call the Peak Master of the Seven-Colored Peak's wife in front of him is the one and only Qi Yuan in the entire Divine Light Sect, no, the entire Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe took the books and left.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tilted his head and pondered, "It seems I need to find an excuse to go out of the sect."</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect is quite far from the Divine Light Sect, not like Rongcheng where it only takes a few hours to go back and forth.</p><p></p><p>He needs to report before leaving.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is a senior disciple of a peak, not an ordinary disciple.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian hurriedly walked inside the Divine Light Sect, carrying a pile of bamboo slips.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the Divine Light Sect, his cultivation was completely depleted, and he had even actively called off his engagement.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this series of actions that he managed to avoid the vortex of power struggles and came to the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just a few days ago, the remnant soul within him also began to awaken.</p><p></p><p>The remnant soul within him was that of a powerful alchemist, who was harmed by a traitor and left with only a wisp of remnant soul, which entered his body.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the remnant soul has been guiding him in cultivation and imparting to him the secret techniques of alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, under the guidance of the remnant soul, he even picked up a few precious alchemical materials in the market.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qi, you said that if the Black Chicken Old Demon were to enter the Divine Infant realm, the entire Great Xia might fall into turmoil. What do you think?" Dong Xian held the bamboo slips and communicated with the remnant soul of Elder Qi within him.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qi chuckled and said, "You little fellow just started cultivating, why are you thinking about so many things? Could it be... you still yearn for that power?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian fell silent for a long time before replying, "If I could... it would be better to help you regain your strength."</p><p></p><p>"If you can seize power, then everything will be fine. But your foundation is too weak, and your ancestral clan's strength is also not enough. It's best to focus on cultivation and take it step by step.</p><p></p><p>With my alchemy techniques, as long as there are no unexpected accidents, it won't take you a few hundred years to reach the Divine Infant realm, and strength is the fundamental root of everything." Elder Qi advised earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian's identity was special, as he was actually an unpopular prince of the Great Xia Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the emperor of the Great Xia was old and senile, with not much lifespan left.</p><p></p><p>The various princes had ambitious desires, vying for power and coveting the position of the Son of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Among the many princes, Dong Xian had the weakest background and foundation.</p><p></p><p>So, in the previous period, he had actively proposed to call off the engagement and retreated from the dangerous situation, coming to the Divine Light Sect to avoid that place of strife.</p><p></p><p>"Huh." Suddenly, Elder Qi was surprised, "Who is that person?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian quickly looked over, and saw a man in strange clothes walking on the main road.</p><p></p><p>However, he still recognized that person.</p><p></p><p>"The senior disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan." Dong Xian didn't know why Elder Qi was interested in that person.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see the cleaver at his waist? That must be a good item.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, my spiritual sense cannot be projected outwards, otherwise I would definitely be able to discover the special qualities of that cleaver.</p><p></p><p>Quick, go buy that cleaver!" Elder Qi's voice was urgent.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was stunned.</p><p></p><p>If it was just an ordinary cleaver and Qi Yuan was just an ordinary disciple of the Divine Light Sect, he might still have a chance to buy it.</p><p></p><p>But... that's not the case.</p><p></p><p>Despite Elder Qi's instructions, he still mustered the courage to go.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the group chat.</p><p></p><p>East River was arrogant and domineering.</p><p></p><p>"I may not be able to compete with you old folks, but I can easily overwhelm a newcomer. </p><p></p><p>This newcomer, if they don't listen to me, will suffer greatly.</p><p></p><p>Just now, I searched through ancient texts and incense records, but couldn't find any true deities related to divine dogs.</p><p></p><p>That newcomer may know of a divine dog deity, but it must have had pitiful worship in the past. Even if they can visualize it, it would only be at the most ordinary level."</p><p></p><p>East River was holding forth in the group.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had visualized a rare three-star deity visualization method, which drew endless praise from guardian deities in the group.</p><p></p><p>He became conceited.</p><p></p><p>He talked down to several people in a row, including Divine Cat Elder and Black Dragon Elder.</p><p></p><p>Originally these two ancient deities had both visualized rare one-star methods, but were surpassed by East River.</p><p></p><p>As a result of being talked down to, they successively visualized uncommon one-star deity visualization methods.</p><p></p><p>The two of them often settled scores with East River in the group.</p><p></p><p>Uncommon one-star deity visualization methods were capable of creating true deity realm citizens, extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I think that newcomer from earlier looks promising!" Black Dragon Elder spoke up.</p><p></p><p>When he joined the group, East River had asked his age, then directly exclaimed in shock in the group: Old man!</p><p></p><p>Being called an old fogey, Black Dragon Elder also bore a grudge against East River.</p><p></p><p>"Newcomer, you're back, did you succeed in visualizing?" East River asked.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps to allow the visualizing ancient deities to better understand the deity visualization methods, any ancient deity who entered Visualization Mountain would randomly enter a specific chat group, and their consciousness would pass through when leaving.</p><p></p><p>They could also enter the chat group to chat normally.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan appeared online in group owner East River's view.</p><p></p><p>The others were also very curious.</p><p></p><p>"I barely managed to visualize successfully." At this moment, Qi Yuan felt both joy and trepidation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"See that, anyone who gets trash-talked by East River is bound to succeed!" Divine Cat Elder said.</p><p></p><p>The others were also very excited.</p><p></p><p>"This newbie has a question and would like to ask you big shots.</p><p></p><p>If I virtually fabricate a deity and visualize a deity visualization method, there shouldn't be any problem with having my citizens cultivate it, right?" Qi Yuan asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, it's impossible to visualize a virtually fabricated deity.</p><p></p><p>It definitely won't pass the two questions of the heart on Visualization Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a virtually fabricated deity has never received incense offerings, so even if it passed the two questions of the heart, it couldn't coalesce into a visualization method.</p><p></p><p>As long as it's a coalesced visualization method, it can be visualized without problems." As the group owner, East River was quite active in the group, "Hurry up and tell us, what level is the deity visualization method you visualized? Even if the level is too low it's fine, we're all very friendly and won't mock you."</p><p></p><p>East River said this, but what he was thinking inside was that if the newcomer's deity visualization method level was very low, he would be able to gain the right to bark like a dog for half a day.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient deities were also watching the group messages, very curious about whether the newcomer had successfully visualized a deity visualization method.</p><p></p><p>"The level is indeed very low, barely reaching the average line, can't compare to you big shots." Qi Yuan looked at the level displayed on the deity visualization method, somewhat dissatisfied, as if it had just reached the average line.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of the many high-level deities still on Blue Star, Qi Yuan felt confident again.</p><p></p><p>"Average line? Ordinary one-star?" East River's words were already brimming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He was already organizing his words, preparing to properly educate the newcomer and put down Divine Cat Elder and Black Dragon Elder.</p><p></p><p>"Uncommon two-star, sigh, barely average." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>With a total of seven levels, three uncommon levels before and three after, isn't that the average line?</p><p></p><p>The group fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Divine Cat Elder quickly said: "Big shot is amazing, there really is a divine dog? Why didn't I know about it!"</p><p></p><p>"Uncommon two-star? Besides White Splendor Elder, this is the highest! Indeed, anyone trash-talked by East River is bound to produce a rare item!"</p><p></p><p>"So envious, producing an uncommon two-star means that as long as you have enough resources, one of your citizens is bound to become a true deity!"</p><p></p><p>This also meant that if there were no major changes in heaven and earth, Qi Yuan had a chance to step into the Great Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>For an ancient deity to enter the Great Venerable realm, at least one of their citizens must become a Venerable deity.</p><p></p><p>At this time, White Splendor Elder appeared in the group: "Not bad newcomer, you have potential."</p><p></p><p>Seeing White Splendor Elder, Divine Cat Elder, Black Dragon Elder and other group members went crazy with flattery.</p><p></p><p>"When will White Splendor Elder become a Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"White Splendor Elder has visualized three uncommons and one epic, he's a true big shot!"</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before White Splendor Elder likely becomes a Great Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The people who were just flattering Qi Yuan all switched to flattering White Splendor Elder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also joined in: "To think it's a big shot just one step away from Great Venerable, terrifyingly awesome!"</p><p></p><p>"Newcomer, which region's ancient deity are you?" At this time, White Splendor Elder asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Kingdom's." Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Flying Desolation City belonged to Lin Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Kingdom seems to be in the north, part of the fallen areas... Newcomer, do you want to leave there and come to my Tiger Kingdom, to... get rich together." White Splendor Elder extended an olive branch.</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, I also want to come to Tiger Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>"Big shot please take me in, I have no shoes to wear, and I'm wearing clothes!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow newcomer, you're in a fallen area, it's very dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these replies, Qi Yuan felt warm inside.</p><p></p><p>There is true feeling among humans.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you big shot, but as the ancient deity of a region, I should defend my fief to the death, rather die than retreat!" Qi Yuan said with grandæ°”.</p><p></p><p>The game's mission was to protect Qingshui Village after all.</p><p></p><p>"The newcomer has guts!" Divine Cat Elder said.</p><p></p><p>"If only there were more ancient deities with backbone like you." Heavenly Treasure Elder said in the group, his words revealing helplessness, "I had a good friend before who defected to the new gods."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the atmosphere in the group became somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Newcomer, I'm also in the northern region, come visit me sometime if you have the chance, I'm in Jiang Kingdom, not far from your Lin Kingdom." Heavenly Treasure Elder said in the group, "But you need to be careful of Lu Kingdom, my friend is in Lu Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan casually replied.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the chat group, Qi Yuan's eyes held an expectant look.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a deity visualization method was engraved on a piece of cloth.</p><p></p><p>It recorded a deity visualization method, and the deity to be visualized was... Howling Celestial Dog.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, to visualize a powerful deity requires more divine power."</p><p></p><p>When he was visualizing, he had a premonition that the evil god power obtained from slaying two evil gods was already the limit for visualizing Howling Celestial Dog.</p><p></p><p>To visualize those even more powerful deities would require hunting more and stronger evil gods to obtain more evil god power.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a house built of mud, Fatty sat in the courtyard, playing with his black dog.</p><p></p><p>"Luckily I brought you some bones, otherwise you would have starved to death." Fatty tossed a large pile of bones onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>These bones were all scavenged by him when attending banquets.</p><p></p><p>As the bones fell to the ground, the emaciated black dog let out a joyful howl and tore into the bones.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Fatty revealed an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"Luckily the ancient deity descended, otherwise before I starved to death, you little bastard would have starved to death!" Fatty said, giving the black dog a disgusted kick with his thick foot.</p><p></p><p>The black dog let out a snarl, but didn't dare to resist, only eating the bones.</p><p></p><p>"Well well, Zhu Zhuangshi, abusing animals are we?" Just then, Qi Yuan appeared in a blue robe, his eyes fixed on the black dog with an interested expression.</p><p></p><p>Fatty hurriedly stood up: "Great Deity, I was just playing with it."</p><p></p><p>He wondered in his heart, what did the Great Deity come to see him for?</p><p></p><p>"Is this black dog the only black dog in the village?" Qi Yuan looked intently at the black dog with its tail tucked between its legs.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Fatty's heart tightened, "Great Deity, my dog is old and skinny, the meat isn't good to eat!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Deity loved to attend banquets, maybe he had his eye on his dog!</p><p></p><p>"Oh, lend me the dog for a bit." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he lightly waved his hand, and that big black dog with a bone still clenched in its mouth and tail tucked between its legs involuntarily followed Qi Yuan as he left.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Fatty's expression turned grief-stricken. Only after Qi Yuan's figure had disappeared did he dare to wail: "My dog, my dog!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already brought the big black dog back to the temple.</p><p></p><p>The dog still had that bone clenched in its mouth, not daring to gnaw on it with Qi Yuan present.</p><p></p><p>"A Yuan Dan realm dog, should be able to visualize right?" Qi Yuan said, taking out the cloth with the deity visualization method recorded on it and tossing it in front of the dog.</p><p></p><p>"This is a deity visualization method, take a look."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also glanced at it.</p><p></p><p>[Deity Visualization Method: Howling Celestial Dog Chapter, possesses growth potential.]</p><p></p><p>The big black dog seemed to have spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>It put down the bone and immediately looked at the deity visualization method.</p><p></p><p>As if it was the most delicious food in the world.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, it's good that you can understand." Qi Yuan stood to the side, looking it over carefully.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog lowered its head, carefully examining it, its eyes revealing a human-like gaze.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the big black dog</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it crossed its legs and sat in meditation, just like a human cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could sense that the big black dog's power was constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite interesting, cultivating like a human."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched for a while, but didn't notice any changes in the big black dog, so he stopped paying attention.</p><p></p><p>"According to what the group members said, as long as the Observing Deity Method is used, it can quickly increase the power of subjects and achieve rapid results."</p><p></p><p>This Observing Deity Method involved observing ancient deities who died in battle long ago.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, it was recreating the power of ancient deities in the subjects.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for slow, gradual cultivation - it was a method for rapid results. The effects in the early stages were extremely good.</p><p></p><p>About an hour passed, and Qi Yuan looked at the black dog cultivating in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"It's already at the late stage of Yuan Dan?"</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, this black dog was only at the early stage of Yuan Dan. To reach the late stage in just an hour was somewhat terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"My experience seems to have increased quite a bit too," Qi Yuan's eyes revealed joy.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the increase in his subjects' cultivation could benefit him in return.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll check again in the morning. Time to sleep."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan dug another hole, called out Little Jia, and the two of them crawled into the hole to sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Bringing you into the game means you can't eat snacks anymore, sigh." Qi Yuan hugged Little Jia's body, wondering whether he should send her back to the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, he gave up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia's delicate body was ice cold, and it took a long time of hugging before it warmed up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the wooden tag close, and fell into a dream together with Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>The next day, blood-red light shone in the sky, and the soil in the temple stirred as a figure crawled out of the earthen pit.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his character level and revealed a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>"I actually gained a level!"</p><p></p><p>This level up was naturally not from slaying monsters.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was from the feedback of his subjects' increased strength.</p><p></p><p>He immediately looked over and saw the big black dog still sitting cross-legged in the temple.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from its body was shockingly... early stage Purple Palace!</p><p></p><p>"From Yuan Dan to Purple Palace overnight, how terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm, his mass production of Purple Palace cultivators was already quite exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>And that mass production was from late stage Divine Embryo to Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>But this, going from Yuan Dan to Purple Palace overnight, was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Even people from the Dou Qi Continent would have to say it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan also sensed that after reaching early stage Purple Palace, the black dog's cultivation speed had clearly decreased, progressing slowly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to normal cultivation, it was still much faster.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the black dog with joy in his eyes: "It seems this Observing Deity Method is indeed effective.</p><p></p><p>My village finally has a great general!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the black dog with great anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, this black dog's strength is comparable to the new deities of some villages.</p><p></p><p>I'll stay here and continue revising the 'Qi Yuan Sutra', and let the big black dog help me slay evil gods and accumulate evil god spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Qi Yuan had already tested it.</p><p></p><p>When his subjects killed enemies like those divine spawn creatures, his own strength would also increase.</p><p></p><p>In other words, when these subjects killed, the subjects wouldn't gain experience, but he could gain experience.</p><p></p><p>He became the biggest exploiter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>In front, Wang Zhongshan from Stone Family Village led a group of mourners dressed in funeral attire, with excited looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Is the deity going to take action against other evil gods?" </p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu nodded: "Probably."</p><p></p><p>He had also received the news and gathered quite a few people.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Xifan from Chenxi Village arrived with several fat-faced, chef-like villagers.</p><p></p><p>"Chenxi Village has arrived. When do we start the feast?" Chen Xifan was also excited.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he only held feasts in his own village.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that this time he would be going to other villages to hold feasts.</p><p></p><p>"We'll set out when the deity arrives," Village Chief Yu Lu looked at the fat man behind him with some dissatisfaction, "I told you to organize a group to play the suona, why are you dragging your feet?"</p><p></p><p>The fat man Zhu Zhuangshi revealed an aggrieved expression: "The people in our village are uneducated and not very good at playing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Zhongshan from Stone Family Village quickly said: "We have a musician in our Stone Family Village. Why don't we handle the suona playing?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Village Chief Yu Lu glared at Wang Zhongshan.</p><p></p><p>Stone Family Village wanted to snatch this job too? </p><p></p><p>How shameless! Qingshui Village was the deity's direct lineage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shi Zhongshan didn't mention it again, but turned to look at the fat man: "Zhu Zhuangshi, we're about to set out for battle, why do you look so glum?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi also glared fiercely at Shi Zhongshan.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan felt bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu then looked at Zhu Zhuangshi and scolded: "It's just a dog. If the deity wants to eat it, then let him eat it.</p><p></p><p>Are you going to look at him like this when the deity descends later?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi's gloomy face improved a little.</p><p></p><p>The people from the three villages gathered together with solemn expressions, but also some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>They would soon see the ancient deity display his divine might.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the voice of the divine official Shen Tu rang out: "The divine dog of the ancient deity has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was puzzled, not understanding what was happening.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a huge black shadow appeared, covered in black fur, with two bulges on its spine as if something was trying to break free.</p><p></p><p>The massive beast opened its mouth to reveal dense, sharp fangs, looking quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Black dog?"</p><p></p><p>"Big black dog!"</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers' faces were shocked and confused.</p><p></p><p>How did the deity suddenly have such a powerful divine dog?</p><p></p><p>Purple Palace realm, this was comparable to the new gods of nearby villages!</p><p></p><p>The fat man Zhu Zhuangshi widened his eyes as he looked at the divine dog: "This is... my big black dog, my big black dog!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>So it turned out to be his big black dog.</p><p></p><p>The black dog seemed to hear its former master's voice and turned its huge head.</p><p></p><p>It stretched out a leg, just like how Zhu Zhuangshi used to kick it, and directly pinned Zhu Zhuangshi to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi's belly was pressed down by the dog's thick leg, unable to move. His face revealed a pleading expression: "Dog lord, I was wrong, I was wrong. You're not my dog, I'm your dog!"</p><p></p><p>Only then was the divine dog satisfied and released its leg.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watching this scene was shocked and unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu looked at the black dog with a gleam in his eyes: "Observing Deity Method!"</p><p></p><p>Only the Observing Deity Method could explain how this black dog's strength suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, going from Yuan Dan to Purple Palace showed that the level of this Observing Deity Method was not low.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers now looked at the big black dog with envious gazes.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi also widened his eyes in disbelief. He never imagined that when the ancient deity took away the big black dog, it was to give it such an incredible opportunity.</p><p></p><p>He was envious, he was jealous, he wished he could go back to that day when the deity asked him for the dog, and he would have barked too, saying he could also be a dog.</p><p></p><p>"We march... to Little Stone Village!" Divine Official Shen Tu spoke at this time.</p><p></p><p>And so, led by the big black dog, the mourning team, suona players, feast-preparing chefs and a large group of people set off grandly towards Little Stone Village.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Little Stone Village.</p><p></p><p>The evil god Liu Yan had a solemn gaze as he looked at the villagers behind him, revealing a violent look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Are you all going to rebel?"</p><p></p><p>The villagers behind him trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Deity, we wouldn't dare!"</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to die for you!" Those assimilated villagers' eyes flashed red.</p><p></p><p>Their consciousness had long been assimilated, becoming part of the new god.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what is that She Lang from Kuangfeng Town doing? I sent a message so long ago, why haven't they sent anyone to help me?" Liu Yan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't dare speak like this in front of She Lang.</p><p></p><p>But with She Lang not present, he was bolder.</p><p></p><p>All those behind him were his subjects, so he wasn't afraid of leaks.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a burly man walked over with an urgent expression: "Deity, people from Qingshui Village have come.</p><p></p><p>There are suona players, mourners, and people carrying pots and pans!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Yan's face grew even angrier: "They came well-prepared."</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and asked: "Are they carrying any coffins?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man was stunned upon hearing this: "No, their deity didn't come either. The one leading them is a black dog, and its aura seems very fierce!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Yan flew into a rage: "How dare they use a wild dog to deal with me?! This brat humiliating me like this is intolerable!"</p><p></p><p>Even evil gods have dignity.</p><p></p><p>Without formally clashing with Qingshui Village's deity, he didn't believe he would be weaker than that deity.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

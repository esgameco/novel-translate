        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the authority of the magical treasure activated, concealing this purple energy. But even so, Yang Shen cultivators within hundreds of thousands of miles, and even farther realms, caught a whiff of that aura.</p><p></p><p>In the Moon God Palace, a Yang Shen cultivator at the Great Celestial Rank revealed a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Purple energy like clouds, a treasure has emerged. This is in the territory of Hong Yueyuan's Demon Luo clan!"</p><p></p><p>Even as a Yang Shen cultivator, she felt somewhat restless. </p><p></p><p>With so much purple energy, just a glimpse of what she saw could likely raise her realm significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Why did it appear in the Demon Luo's territory!"</p><p></p><p>This Yang Shen Celestial Lord's expression turned bitter.</p><p></p><p>Recently, news had spread that the Moon God Sovereign was gravely injured.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Shen cultivators throughout the Moon God Palace were all nervous and tense, on edge.</p><p></p><p>Although the Moon God Palace was still that lofty Moon God Palace in status, upon closer inspection, one would find... the Moon God Palace had undergone enormous changes compared to the past.</p><p></p><p>During battles, the number of traitors was 50% higher than before.</p><p></p><p>When trading with other holy lands, there were many who raised prices arbitrarily. </p><p></p><p>It could be said that the entire Moon God Palace was in a precarious state.</p><p></p><p>The battle situation in the Demon Abyss could not be lost, otherwise... this could become the spark that leads to defeat like a collapsing mountain.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the area guarded by the Demon Luo clan, purple energy rose like clouds as a treasure revealed itself.</p><p></p><p>Due to the concealment of the magical treasure, Moon Lotus Celestial Lord could not discern more information.</p><p></p><p>But if the Demon Luo clan's strength increased because of this, it would put enormous pressure on the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Guarding the Demon Abyss for so many years, Moon Lotus Celestial Lord had never felt pressure, and the battles had never involved Yang Shen cultivators entering the fray or extremely intense fighting.</p><p></p><p>But since news of the Moon God Sovereign's grave injury spread, she felt intense pressure, and the battles in the Demon Abyss escalated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was feeling anxious, a voice entered her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Lotus Celestial Lord, have you considered it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the man's voice, Moon Lotus Celestial Lord's expression turned profound.</p><p></p><p>As Yang Shen Celestial Lords, their communication naturally was not suppressed by the magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>The one messaging her was a Yang Shen Celestial Lord from a top power in the Sixth Heaven... the Shen Luo Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "One Association, Two Palaces, Three Heavens, Four Abysses, and dozens of holy lands."</p><p></p><p>Among the Sixth Heaven, there were the fewest holy lands, totaling less than thirty when added together.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the strongest were this One Association, Two Palaces, Three Heavens, and Four Abysses.</p><p></p><p>This ranking was in no particular order, and did not mean the One Association was strongest.</p><p></p><p>The One Association naturally referred to the Supreme Principle Association.</p><p></p><p>The Two Palaces were the Tai Huang Palace and Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Luo Heaven was one of the Three Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Its most powerful figure was a Great Supreme Principle master who grasped the supreme principles, no weaker than the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>This Yang Shen cultivator from Shen Luo Heaven had been intermittently contacting Moon Lotus Celestial Lord, wanting to poach her from the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>His question now was simply bringing up the old matter again.</p><p></p><p>"I have received the grace of the Moon God Palace. If I were to leave at this time, where would my dao heart be? If I were lucky enough to enter the Supreme Principle realm one day, how would I pass the Demon Root Tribulation?" Moon Lotus Celestial Lord responded calmly, her attitude firm.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon God Sovereign is gravely injured, and the Tai Huang Palace is eyeing you covetously. If you don't find a good place to go soon, you'll only perish along with the Moon God Palace." That Yang Shen Celestial Lord mentioned this, his words revealing a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Moon Lotus Celestial Lord's expression changed slightly: "Have you heard some news?"</p><p></p><p>This Yang Shen cultivator from Shen Luo Heaven was a descendant of a Great Supreme Principle realm Yang Shen cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He knew more information than others.</p><p></p><p>Although it was almost a fact that the Moon God Sovereign was gravely injured,</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Sovereign who grasped the supreme principles would not fall so easily.</p><p></p><p>How could the Moon God Palace be in trouble? But the other party's words just now made Moon Lotus Celestial Lord's heart tighten.</p><p></p><p>"There is some news circulating. When... the Supreme Principle Discussion Conference opens, you'll know. Oh right, Moon Lotus, let me give you another friendly reminder - a Yang Shen Celestial Lord from your Moon God Palace has already defected and joined one of the Four Abysses."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, that Yang Shen Celestial Lord's voice fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Moon Lotus Celestial Lord's expression changed dramatically, becoming complex.</p><p></p><p>"A Yang Shen Celestial Lord has actually defected!"</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a bolt from the blue.</p><p></p><p>It must be known, that was a Yang Shen Celestial Lord! A pillar-like existence for a power.</p><p></p><p>For a Yang Shen Celestial Lord to dare to defect, it must be because they discovered... the Moon God Palace truly had no hope?</p><p></p><p>Had the Moon God Palace... really reached such a state?</p><p></p><p>"This information... should I report it to..."</p><p></p><p>Moon Lotus Celestial Lord hesitated.</p><p></p><p>If those above asked where she learned this, how should she answer? She wavered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Demon Heng Celestial Lord's figure landed like a great roc.</p><p></p><p>In Hong Yueyuan, a pitch-black crevice appeared in the black earth, bottomless and leading to an unknown place.</p><p></p><p>Demon Heng Celestial Lord frowned: "Where are they?"</p><p></p><p>He scanned the surroundings but did not find those five Yang Shen Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>However, he smelled the lingering aura those five Yang Shen Celestial Lords had left behind.</p><p></p><p>They had clearly just left not long ago.</p><p></p><p>He sent his consciousness into the communication jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The message he sent still sat lonely at the end, indicating no one had replied.</p><p></p><p>"They ran away quickly, and... had no chance to reply to the message?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Heng Celestial Lord's gaze turned profound, with a trace of anger.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that the supreme treasure that appeared here was shocking enough</p><p></p><p>To make these five people develop thoughts of keeping it for themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This old man wants to see just what treasure it is." Thinking this, Demon Heng Celestial Lord's figure plunged into the crevice at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After just over ten breaths of time, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So much purple energy!"</p><p></p><p>"And...!"</p><p></p><p>He also instantly saw the figures of those five people.</p><p></p><p>At this time, those five Yang Shen Celestial Lords were jointly attacking a formation.</p><p></p><p>It looked like they were using extreme effort, and had been attacking for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the formation was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Demon Heng Celestial Lord felt some anger, but for the sake of his grand plan, he still suppressed his temper.</p><p></p><p>"Does this old man need to lend a hand?"</p><p></p><p>He said this as he flew towards that formation.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, that teetering formation was shattered by the five Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Those five Celestial Lords looked nervous, seeming to notice Demon Heng Celestial Lord's arrival, their expressions uneasy.</p><p></p><p>What shocked Demon Heng Celestial Lord most was that those five Celestial Lords actually didn't respond, and directly charged forward without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>One of them even pretended to accidentally throw a formation to obstruct him.</p><p></p><p>However... your acting skills are too poor, aren't they? "You think a mere formation can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>"Just what supreme treasure is it, to make them so crazed!"</p><p></p><p>Demon Heng Celestial Lord felt puzzled, his gaze also turning greedy.</p><p></p><p>Those five Yang Shen Celestial Lords were usually deferential to him, but now they actually tried to scheme against him for a supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>This was very abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>As a Supreme Principle realm Yang Shen cultivator, Demon Heng Celestial Lord's strength was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>A mere formation was no obstacle to him at all.</p><p></p><p>However, it still delayed him for half a breath.</p><p></p><p>As the formation shattered, Demon Heng Celestial Lord's eyes suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>His mind shook wildly.</p><p></p><p>Because... an immense... infinitely divine door... appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the Supreme Principle Door?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Heng Celestial Lord felt a moment of doubt and shock.</p><p></p><p>At this time, those five figures suddenly plunged into the Supreme Principle Door, their faces bearing fanatical expressions.</p><p></p><p>Demon Heng Celestial Lord, who had been somewhat hesitant, now completely stopped hesitating and didn't think further.</p><p></p><p>If he missed this chance... there would be no more opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover... those five people had all rushed in, so how could he, a Supreme Principle cultivator, shrink back? He thought no more and plunged into the Supreme Principle Door.</p><p></p><p>With the Supreme Principle Door, how could his future be limited to merely being the Demon Luo Lord! However, upon entering the Supreme Principle Door,</p><p></p><p>His eyes suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>He saw nearly twenty remnant souls appear within the Supreme Principle Door.</p><p></p><p>These remnant souls all looked at him with expectant expressions or as if watching a joke.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these remnant souls, Demon Heng Celestial Lord's mind shook.</p><p></p><p>Demon Eye... Demon Hall... Demon Blaze... Demon Thus...</p><p></p><p>These remnant souls were actually all the Yang Shen Celestial Lords of the Demon Luo clan in the Demon Abyss!</p><p></p><p>Like a bolt from the blue, Demon Heng Celestial Lord's mind buzzed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he looked over and saw among the many remnant souls</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the man in the crimson robe sat leisurely, with a faint smile.</p><p>"Welcome to... the underworld."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A month passed quietly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wore a blood-red robe, with an extremely mysterious aura about him.</p><p></p><p>He stretched lazily. </p><p></p><p>"Can you imagine, the Lord of Demons has a sharp tongue. I hadn't even started fishing, hadn't even set up my spot, and he showed up."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sent a message to Jin Li, recounting the events of recent days.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the Demon Heng Heavenly Venerable, Qi Yuan went to the Fifth Heaven to continue fishing.</p><p></p><p>With the advice of the remnant souls above, Qi Yuan's plans became more reasonable.</p><p></p><p>He even employed the beauty strategy.</p><p></p><p>You might think the beauty strategy involves choosing some stunning beauty? Wrong. It's "Silly, how are you still as foolish as you were in high school."</p><p></p><p>Those remnant souls knew the Yang Shen Heavenly Venerables below like the backs of their hands. They offered suggestions, and Qi Yuan customized bait for each Yang Shen below.</p><p></p><p>The funniest part was that Qi Yuan prepared to set up a spot for the Demon Luo Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, the Demon Luo Heavenly Venerable's strength was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had just set up his spot when the Demon Luo Heavenly Venerable discovered it.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan felt somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>But he saw that Demon Luo Heavenly Venerable completely ignored him, and without a thought, charged straight into the Gate of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan lose his composure.</p><p></p><p>Then, cooperating with the Wutian Buddha, he took control of the Buddhist realm and suppressed the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>Finally, searching for the remnant soul of the Demon Luo Heavenly Venerable, he learned the truth.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that when the Demon Luo Heavenly Venerable was young, he had encountered a mysterious old Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>That priest said he had a connection to the Gate of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he didn't know what the Gate of Ultimate Principles was.</p><p></p><p>Later, after becoming a Yang Shen, he kept those words in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the Gate of Ultimate Principles, how could he think too much? He charged right in.</p><p></p><p>"So... the Demon Luo clan... is gone?" In the Moon Goddess Palace, Jin Li's calm heart became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Every day, new messages arrived from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Demon Luo clan had actually... been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>She felt as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>This surprise was no less than when Qi Yuan had said he had swept away the Xuanyuan Forbidden Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in the Moon Goddess Palace, the events happening on the other shore of the Demon Abyss were still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Especially Qi Yuan's tone, as if he had crushed an ant, relaxed and carefree, not at all like he had taken down a behemoth like the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the Demon Luo clan ranked among the top five powers in the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Six Heavens, they could enter the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>The fall of such a power was enough to shake the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Gone. From now on, the Wutian Buddha will pretend to be the Lord of Demons," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He already had plans to usurp their position, letting his divine infant pretend to be the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Yang Shen Heavenly Venerables had all been replaced by his people.</p><p></p><p>They were now the Demon Luo clan! The original Demon Luo clan? Traitors, impostors!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, after a while, I'm going to the Black Demon Abyss," Qi Yuan said. "What do you think, should I continue setting up spots and fishing in the Black Demon Abyss?</p><p></p><p>Oh, that won't work. I have no grudge with the Black Demon Abyss, fishing wouldn't be good."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan considered himself a kind person after all.</p><p></p><p>"No, the Great Ultimate Principle experts in the Black Demon Abyss are second only to the Ultimate Principle Assembly. You must be careful!" Jin Li was very worried about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although the Black Demon Abyss didn't have Ultimate Principle masters like the Moon Goddess Sovereign who had grasped the supreme Ultimate Principle, the number of ordinary Great Ultimate Principle experts was definitely high.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, no fishing. I'm very kind-hearted, like you."</p><p></p><p>"..." Jin Li's pretty face turned slightly red.</p><p></p><p>"I have to go now, need to sort through things properly. The Demon Luo clan had too many good things, and I don't have much time left."</p><p></p><p>"Bye!"</p><p></p><p>Ending the call with Jin Li, Qi Yuan lay in the jade slip, looking at the dense array of cultivation methods, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>"All good stuff!"</p><p></p><p>There were too many good things here.</p><p></p><p>Especially the divine methods Qi Yuan needed - he had found eight to nine thousand types.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods below the divine methods were countless.</p><p></p><p>Other various celestial jades and treasures were innumerable.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if I had seen these when I was at the Qi Refining realm, how thrilled I would have been."</p><p></p><p>Looking at these treasures, Qi Yuan's mood was calm. Apart from the divine methods and that well at home, nothing else could stir waves in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"These things... hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he recalled what Jiang Lingsu's father, Jiang Ruhua, had said.</p><p></p><p>"Our Jiang family is really too poor, alas."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time in the Eastern Land, the Jiang clan mansion was bustling with activity, people coming and going in an endless stream.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a few months since Qi Yuan had eliminated the Great Calamity, and the atmosphere of the Cang Lan Realm having just survived the Great Calamity had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Jiang family gate, guests arrived like clouds.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, Yin Shen Venerable Lords came to visit, bringing congratulatory gifts.</p><p></p><p>The reasons for visiting were varied.</p><p></p><p>Things like the Jiang family's dog having puppies, or a young genius of the Jiang family killing a hen.</p><p></p><p>In any case, people were everywhere, using all sorts of pretexts to bring gifts.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Jiang family's reputation was illustrious.</p><p></p><p>Even forces with Yin Shen did not dare to offend the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Qian walked through the Jiang family courtyard, bringing in congratulatory gifts.</p><p></p><p>Her heart still carried a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>She had never imagined that Qi Yuan, who had helped her out of trouble and killed the Feng family's prodigal son in Cloud Sky City, would turn out to be... such an existence.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to when she had urged Qi Yuan to leave quickly to avoid the Feng family's retaliation, she now felt like laughing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a voice resounded through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, isn't your Jiang family a bit poor?"</p><p></p><p>"As it happens, I went to the immortal realm and eliminated a force, earned a bit of money, to help you out a little."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Jiang Qian's face showed reverence and wild joy.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings... Blood Robed Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The people around the city also seemed to realize something, and all the cultivators lowered their heads, their faces full of deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Blood Robed Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua's expression at this moment was extremely smug.</p><p></p><p>If not for the crowd, he would have wanted to dance right then.</p><p></p><p>However, he still pretended to be very calm, though of course, politeness was necessary: "Many thanks for Senior's concern!"</p><p></p><p>After all, his daughter wasn't married yet, so he had to show respect to Senior Blood Robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, seeing this scene, the Jiang family members around were somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>This guy was always muttering at home about his son-in-law, about his keen eye for talent, and how he had taught the Blood Robed Sword Immortal to pursue his daughter, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"With these celestial jades... you shouldn't be poor anymore, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a black hole split open in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't pies falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>But... celestial jades fell!</p><p></p><p>Not only celestial jades, but various treasures that could drive even Yin Shen mad.</p><p></p><p>Pearl light and treasure aura, immortal qi swirling, all sorts of colors dazzling the eye.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the city, seeing those treasures in the sky, all showed deep envy.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua's face blossomed with joy: "Senior must have eliminated a great power ten times stronger than the Seeking Dao Palace, right?"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the Seeking Dao Palace Master, who happened to be passing by, changed expression slightly.</p><p></p><p>Don't mention it!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, any single item among these treasures was probably something the Seeking Dao Palace couldn't afford.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're right," Qi Yuan thought for a moment and answered without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>A hundred times stronger is also more than ten times stronger.</p><p></p><p>Just like earning 3,000 a month is also less than 200,000 a month, right?</p><p></p><p>PS: The first part of the plot after ascending to the upper realm was mainly to see Jin Li, dealing with Demon Luo was incidental, so after meeting Jin Li, writing about Demon Luo became somewhat tedious, like having a cigarette after the fact.</p><p></p><p>Sorry everyone, I'll send out some monthly ticket red envelopes to compensate you all!</p><p></p><p>(Don't leak it outside, it seems someone shared it in other groups and it was snatched by bots.) 500 big ones! (There happens to be a recharge event.) Don't ask why I'm not sending on QQ Reading, ahem, can't send there!</p><p></p><p>(This text is not charged!)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

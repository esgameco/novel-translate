        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng was somewhat surprised, but still put away the divine artifact truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Many ripples arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In this world... are there really such selfless beings? He asked himself, unable to do the same, and felt deep respect for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the books in the storage artifact.</p><p></p><p>As a divine-level Armament Wielder, his reading speed was naturally unparalleled, just a glance was enough.</p><p></p><p>The pages turned automatically, and a vast amount of information flooded into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The records about Sheng Nü were mostly scattered fragments.</p><p></p><p>However, when these scattered fragments were integrated, an image of a lady with orchid-like grace and a mysterious, graceful demeanor emerged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Sheng Nü is not a native of the Qingshan Realm, she first appeared in the Qingshan Realm five hundred years ago, disappeared at the Luodi Cliff, and reappeared a hundred years later."</p><p></p><p>Based on the information above, Qi Yuan guessed that Sheng Nü might have been in the Divine Wood Abyss during that hundred-year disappearance.</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred years ago, Sheng Nü descended upon the Luosha Kingdom, left behind a divine artifact after the divine descent, and then disappeared again."</p><p></p><p>"According to the records, she went to... the Taixing Domain."</p><p></p><p>In the last record in the book, Sheng Nü had said that she would go to the Taixing Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Taixing Domain?" Qi Yuan asked the Insect Maiden Caiye.</p><p></p><p>As for the people of the Qingshan Realm, they probably didn't know where the Taixing Domain was.</p><p></p><p>Caiye replied, "The Divine Wood Universe has a total of 781 large and small domains, and the Taixing Domain is in the forefront of the Nine Domains!"</p><p></p><p>Caiye continued to explain.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe is still in its primordial form, having been born less than a millennium ago.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other universes, the Divine Wood Universe is clearly a miniaturized, low-configuration version of a universe.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the Divine Wood Universe now has 781 domains in total.</p><p></p><p>Each domain is immensely vast, with countless small worlds like the Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>And among these 781 domains, many belong to the Fallen Regions.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Star Realm where the Qingshan Realm is located, half of it belongs to the Fallen Regions.</p><p></p><p>As for the Taixing Domain, it is located on the frontline of the defense against the Black Heavens' invasion.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Domains are united, gathering almost all the elites of the Divine Wood Universe to jointly fight against the Black Heavens and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>As for the other domains in the rear, they are not just sitting idle either.</p><p></p><p>Like the Qingshan Realm, although it is largely under the control of the Radiant Assembly, there are still 300,000 Artifact Refiners hidden in the mountains, refining fragments of divine wondrous treasures.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is the Divinely Enlightened or the Humanly Enlightened, they are all for the sake of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Taixing Domain is very far away..." Caiye looked at Qi Yuan with a complex gaze, "If it were before, I might have been able to take you there, but after you slew the Phoenix Cry, you will definitely be under the watch of the Radiant Assembly, and it will be difficult for you to leave the Chaotic Star Realm again."</p><p></p><p>The original plan was for Caiye to wait for Shen Lingxuan to reach the divine level, and then use the teleportation array to go to the frontline and rendezvous with the Humanly Enlightened.</p><p></p><p>"So you mean if I leave, someone will send me a delivery? What a nice thing." Qi Yuan was not at all concerned.</p><p></p><p>If the people of the Radiant Assembly come to stop him, he will just kill them.</p><p></p><p>Caiye fell silent, Qi Yuan indeed had the qualifications to be confident.</p><p></p><p>He was able to slay the Phoenix Cry, ordinary Grand Sages would be powerless against him.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ancestral Gods or Solar Gods, how would such existences care about an ordinary Divine-level Armament Wielder?</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a way to take me out of the Qingshan Realm?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but it may be very dangerous," Caiye said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>The Taixing Domain is too far away, requiring multiple transfers through teleportation arrays. </p><p></p><p>If the previous domains or transit channels have become Fallen Regions, then they would have to find new routes.</p><p></p><p>"Danger is no problem, but before going to the Taixing Domain, first take me to the Kuijin Realm," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>After the role of the blind Artifact Refiner ended, he had awakened a new role to play.</p><p></p><p>This new role was located in the Kuijin Realm, having just died not long ago.</p><p></p><p>This character was a divine-level Armament Wielder at the mythical level, who had been in seclusion in the Kuijin Realm for many years, "refining the mundane" to break through to the Ancestral God realm.</p><p></p><p>However, after many years of seclusion, the refinement failed, and he ultimately died.</p><p></p><p>The role Qi Yuan was going to play was this character, to complete the refinement for him.</p><p></p><p>Once the refinement was complete, he would be able to step into the Ancestral God realm, which was also the Solar God realm.</p><p></p><p>As for how to refine the mundane, Qi Yuan had already formulated a draft plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the Kuijin Realm, he could adjust the plan based on the actual situation, turning the draft into a formal plan.</p><p></p><p>This is called being smart and wise! "The Kuijin Realm?" Caiye's face showed a worried expression, "That world has already fallen, and is occupied by the Black Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Star Realm is in great turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Half of the region is controlled by the Radiant Assembly, and the remaining areas are the Fallen Regions and the territories controlled by the Humanly Enlightened.</p><p></p><p>The Kuijin Realm is a Fallen Region, and it has been fallen for a very long time, for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Kuijin Realm has already taken on the form of the Black Heavens and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Gongzi, what are you going to do there?" Caiye asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the war between the Humanly Enlightened and the Black Heavens and Black Earth has been in constant retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Humanly Enlightened do not have the energy to reclaim the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a secret." Qi Yuan didn't want to explain.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have to explain a lot of things to these NPCs, and they still wouldn't believe him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll take you there." Caiye gritted her teeth and looked at Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's cold voice came, "I'll go too."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Shen Lingxuan, his gaze calm: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Kuijin Realm.</p><p>Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>It was already night, and the entire sky of the world was a blood-red color.</p><p></p><p>The clouds seemed to be hiding a huge blood-red eye, looking particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>This huge blood-red eye was one of the ninety-nine Enigmatic Gods of the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Enigmatic Gods hovered high in the sky, or were hidden in the mountains, rivers, and oceans, being the supreme deities of the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a certain manor, Wang Tongian's face showed a fierce expression: "That old man is so unfair, after we treated him like a father for so many years, he died without leaving any inheritance for us?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun nodded in agreement: "Do you think the master might have left everything to that little brat Zhao Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong and Xu Jiaoyun, along with Zhao Yan, were all from Cloud Blood City, they were all orphans.</p><p></p><p>Thirty years ago, a white-haired young man came to Cloud Blood City and adopted the three of them, raising them to adulthood.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the white-haired man, their master, had passed away.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this master, Wang Tong and Xu Jiaoyun were both very fearful of him.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had maintained a youthful appearance for thirty years, clearly an Armament Wielder.</p><p></p><p>Such an Armament Wielder, how could he not have any inheritance?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they had turned the master's manor upside down, but found nothing of high value.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun couldn't help but shift her gaze to Zhao Yan, the master's last disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The master buried him, so he might have given him something, or maybe..." Wang Tong's eyes flashed with murderous intent, "the things are in the old man's coffin!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Zhao Yan has repeatedly prevented us from opening the coffin, he's really asking for death, we should just give him a uterus and send him to the Reincarnation Hall!" Xu Jiaoyun said maliciously.</p><p></p><p>The so-called uterus, according to the terminology of the Blue Star, refers to the female uterus.</p><p></p><p>In Cloud Blood City, there is a mysterious Enigmatic Hall called the Reincarnation Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Hall has been absorbing young women for years, specifically for the purpose of breeding and propagating humans... or cultivating Enigmatic Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Every year, a large number of innocent women are sent to the Reincarnation Hall.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to women, there are also some men who will be sent there.</p><p></p><p>Using vicious methods to transform the men, implanting uteruses, and sending them to the Reincarnation Hall.</p><p></p><p>"This time if he tries to stop us again, I'll contact the Blood Tiger Gang to send him there!" Wang Tong agreed with Xu Jiaoyun's words.</p><p></p><p>In Cloud Blood City, the highest and mightiest are the Enigmatic Spirits transformed from the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>Next are the nobles and the government.</p><p></p><p>Below them are the various gang organizations.</p><p></p><p>As for the common people, they are herded and selected every year, with suitable men and women being sent to the Reincarnation Hall.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Tiger Gang hasn't given us much time. Tonight, we must dig up the old man's grave!" Wang Tong said.</p><p></p><p>He had joined the Blood Tiger Gang and become a member of the gang.</p><p></p><p>To climb up the ranks, he had to offer some treasures.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a thin and agile man suddenly entered. He looked at Xu Jiaoyun with a flirtatious gaze.</p><p></p><p>He entered the room and casually slapped Xu Jiaoyun on the buttocks, clearly very familiar with her.</p><p></p><p>"I just saw that bastard Zhao Yan heading towards the Purple Dawn Forest," this short and agile man was a member of the Blood Tiger Gang, one of Xu Jiaoyun's lovers.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, that guy won't let us dig the grave. He wants to hoard the master's treasures for himself!" Wang Tong said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun hurriedly stood up: "We have to stop him!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have two brothers who have already followed him. He dreams of leaving with the treasures," the short and agile man said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun gave him a seductive look.</p><p></p><p>The three of them hurriedly went towards the Purple Dawn Forest.</p><p></p><p>Their master was buried in the Purple Dawn Forest.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the sky above, the cold moonlight was mixed with a bloody hue, and the earth was bathed in a bloody glow.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan's handsome face was full of worry, and his steps were hurried.</p><p></p><p>"Have they no humanity left? If it weren't for the master taking them in, they would have starved to death long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan was sad and indignant.</p><p></p><p>He respected the master and treated him like a father.</p><p></p><p>But the master's other two disciples were heartless beasts. As soon as the master died, they were already eyeing his legacy.</p><p></p><p>He hurried towards the Purple Dawn Forest.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Zhao Yan arrived at the Purple Dawn Forest.</p><p></p><p>The forest was shrouded in shadows, with many purple bamboos standing tall, and graves scattered everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The night was pitch-black, and the red glow illuminated the tombstones, making it particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>Even though Zhao Yan had his own worries, he also felt this Purple Dawn Forest was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"I must move the master's grave. Otherwise, with Wang Tong and Xu Jiaoyun's nature, they will surely desecrate the master's remains!" Zhao Yan thought.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong and Xu Jiaoyun didn't find any legacy in the master's coffin, so they must be planning to dissect the master's body to see if anything was hidden inside.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan couldn't bear to see such a desecration.</p><p></p><p>He shouldered a hoe and an iron shovel and quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhao Yan arrived at the familiar grave.</p><p></p><p>The grave was new, and it seemed the burial had just taken place.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the master's grave, Zhao Yan couldn't help but feel saddened.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple has offended you."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan knelt on the ground and kowtowed, then picked up the hoe and started digging, or used the iron shovel to throw the soil aside.</p><p></p><p>The night was blood-red, and Zhao Yan dug the grave, soon drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>Although he had cultivated, his cultivation was still weak.</p><p></p><p>The Blood of Thorns also controlled the common people, giving them some martial power, but not too much.</p><p></p><p>To improve his cultivation, he had to first report to the Blood of Thorns and obtain the qualifications.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the soil was cleared, and a red coffin came into view.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan was nervous, and repeated, "Master, I have offended you."</p><p></p><p>He was about to pull out the nails sealing the coffin.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, footsteps were heard.</p><p></p><p>A mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Yan, weren't you the one who respected the master the most? How come now that the master is dead, you're trying to dig up his grave to find treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Five people approached, with Wang Tong in the lead, his eyes full of mockery.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan's expression stiffened, his face flushing red: "I didn't... I dug up the master's grave to prevent you from desecrating his remains!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't pretend, you shameless scoundrel," Xu Jiaoyun said coldly, "Hypocrite."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang members had a mocking expression on their faces: "Since he's already dug up the grave, it saves us the effort."</p><p></p><p>They pressed towards Zhao Yan.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan's face was anxious, and he stretched out his hand to block them: "You can't do this. The master had a parental grace towards you. Now that he has passed away, you disturb his rest, and you will incur the wrath of heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"The wrath of heaven?" Wang Tong's eyes were full of disdain. "There is no wrath of heaven in Cloud Blood City, only the Blood of Thorns!"</p><p></p><p>If the wrath of heaven truly existed, how could the wicked Blood of Thorns be thriving so well?</p><p></p><p>"Talking about the wrath of heaven is just laughable," Xu Jiaoyun sneered.</p><p></p><p>"The master had a parental grace towards you, like a second father. Doesn't your heart ache for this?" Zhao Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, just mentioning this old thing makes me angry. If it weren't for this old man taking me in, maybe I would still be a young miss from a wealthy family.</p><p></p><p>Has he compensated me for my losses?" </p><p></p><p>Twenty years ago, in the heavy snow, Xu Jiaoyun was picked up by the white-haired youth. If he hadn't taken her in, she might have frozen to death.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, Xu Jiaoyun learned that she was actually the young miss lost by a wealthy family in the city, and that wealthy old man had died of illness a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>When she went to claim her identity, she was rejected, and she was very angry.</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare to resent the wealthy old man, so she resented her master instead.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun felt that if she hadn't been taken in by the master, perhaps her father could have found her.</p><p></p><p>She would have been a wealthy young miss, enjoying a life of luxury, instead of following this "useless" master and suffering every day.</p><p></p><p>If the master wasn't extraordinary, she would have already attacked him with her temperament.</p><p></p><p>"The master owes me my life, and he hasn't compensated me. What's wrong with me taking his legacy?" Xu Jiaoyun shamelessly said.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong's face also showed a smile: "Since the master loved us so much, I'm sure he would be willing to leave his legacy to us."</p><p></p><p>"Shameless!" Zhao Yan's face turned ashen, "Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two Blood Tiger Gang members pinned him down.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan struggled frantically, but it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong had a smug expression on his face as he approached the coffin: "Old man, let me see where you've hidden your legacy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun came over, and she looked at the blood-red coffin with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't fear of the master, but fear of ghosts.</p><p></p><p>In these times, evil spirits were rampant, and the chances of encountering something unclean were high.</p><p></p><p>"There won't be anything unclean here, right?" Xu Jiaoyun said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"This is in the city, everything is under the watchful eye of the Ominous Deity, how could there be anything unclean!" Wang Tong said, bending down to open the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sudden loud noise came from the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun's gaze immediately turned to the coffin, her back shivering, and a look of terror on her face: "Sounds... there are sounds coming from the coffin!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong was also taken aback, a bit panicked: "Don't scare yourself!"</p><p></p><p>The master was 100% dead.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful figures of the Blood of Thorns had come to inspect the body and found that the master's corpse could not be transformed into an evil spirit, so they left.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the Blood of Thorns couldn't be wrong, right?</p><p></p><p>However, he was only trying to bolster his own courage, and he gathered his courage to look at the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Suddenly, the sounds from the coffin became even louder.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiaoyun's face turned deathly pale: "A ghost!"</p><p></p><p>She turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong was also a bit afraid, holding a dagger in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a young voice came from the coffin.</p><p></p><p>"You're all so noisy, can't you let me sleep peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The coffin was flung open, and a young man sat up.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was stunningly handsome, his gaze calm and profound, with white hair.</p><p></p><p>His face had an expression of displeasure, as if he had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person, Wang Tong's eyes were filled with shock: "Mas... master..."</p><p></p><p>How could the master still be alive! </p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the Blood of Thorns had personally come to inspect the body! Could it be that this person was not the master, but an evil spirit that had awakened in the master's body?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 265</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, Qi Yuan's eyes were fixed on the information within the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Hidden information appeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It revealed flaws in this cultivation method, as well as areas for improvement.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Qi Yuan's strength would have been insufficient to see this hidden information. </p><p></p><p>Even if he could see it, he would have struggled to resolve the issues.</p><p></p><p>Now, after contemplating the Three Pure Ones and integrating 4,752 divine infants, Qi Yuan's realm and insights had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the jade slip, his gaze surging with energy.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen stood to the side, his expression full of confusion. </p><p></p><p>The task he had brought, from the great master of Hua Capital, was among the top two in difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Even the master of Futu Mountain could not have solved it so quickly.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan before him... mysterious as he was, surely he couldn't...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Is this serious look of his not genuine? Even if he wanted to deceive me, there's no need to set a half-hour time limit," Shen Wushen thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour would pass quickly, there was no point in such an elaborate deception.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... real?</p><p></p><p>If so... Shen Wushen swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean Qi Yuan would be a once-in-an-eon prodigy even in the upper realms?</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half an hour passed. Qi Yuan casually tossed the jade slip: "I have not failed the mission entrusted to me. The task is complete."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen hurriedly caught the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Now, his heart was filled with anticipation as he quickly sent his divine sense into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"The problem has been solved. I took the liberty of patching it up and strengthening the technique. Otherwise, even if this issue was resolved, the person would still be among the weakest when entering the realm of myths," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen looked at the information in the jade slip, his heart shaken.</p><p></p><p>This shock was ten times, a hundred times stronger than when Qi Yuan had effortlessly defeated him.</p><p></p><p>He could say without exaggeration that Qi Yuan's talent... even in the upper realms, would be unmatched in countless eons!</p><p></p><p>The problem with this technique had truly been solved!</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't fully understand it, at least after reviewing it once, he felt there were no issues.</p><p></p><p>This was already astounding.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist... would you consider taking on a disciple?" At this point, Shen Wushen had lost all the pride of coming from an upper realm holy land.</p><p></p><p>In fact, given Qi Yuan's current attainments, he was even stronger than the master of Futu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Guiding him... would be effortless.</p><p></p><p>It could even elevate him to the level of a peerless prodigy of the middle three realms.</p><p></p><p>"No," Qi Yuan shook his head, flatly refusing.</p><p></p><p>Taking on disciples was simply too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Wushen was somewhat disappointed, but he persisted: "Fellow Daoist... surely you don't want to be without an heir to pass on your legacy?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>To put it politely, Shen Wushen was very direct in his speech; to put it bluntly, this man's mind was narrower than a needle's eye.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you were born in the Cang Lan Realm, destined to remain obscure. </p><p></p><p>Your Dao will also be cut off.</p><p></p><p>Why not pass on your teachings to me? I, Wushen, will certainly spread your Dao far and wide!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen stared intently at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was his chance!</p><p></p><p>The Cang Lan Realm was a "closed" world, rumored to be related to that Yang God of the middle three realms.</p><p></p><p>For a supreme prodigy like Qi Yuan to be born here was his misfortune, as he had no chance of reaching the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>So, rather than dying without passing on his knowledge, he might as well teach it to him.</p><p></p><p>The Cang Lan Realm was a cage, only by teaching him could Qi Yuan's path continue.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you wouldn't want your Dao to be cut off, would you?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen blurted out all his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He went on about how he was the only choice, how the upper realms would suffer a great loss if they missed out on Qi Yuan's Dao.</p><p></p><p>These words left Qi Yuan quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>Was he hoping for his death? He looked at Shen Wushen: "Has anyone ever told you to do more and talk less in the future?"</p><p></p><p>It was only because of his good temper and adherence to rules that Qi Yuan didn't strike Shen Wushen dead on the spot. If it were someone else, they might have killed him with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh that there were too many people with low emotional intelligence in this world, and too few like him with high EQ who spoke pleasantly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he could make his junior sister Jiang Lingsu happy with just a few words, causing her to give him plenty of spirit stones and techniques.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between high and low emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, everything I say is true!" Shen Wushen still wasn't giving up. "There are so many prodigies in the Cang Lan Realm. If I'm not mistaken, 300,000 years ago, a true prodigy appeared in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>That prodigy created his own technique, defied the great calamity, and even provoked the intervention of the one from the sixth realm of heaven to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning that person, Shen Wushen was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the great calamity of the Cang Lan Realm occurred only once every million years.</p><p></p><p>But that powerful figure emerged out of nowhere, and in just a few hundred thousand years, became a mythical being, even achieving extreme transcendence to break through to the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>With his power alone, he nearly shattered the great calamity, becoming unrivaled under heaven, drawing enemies from above. It took the personal intervention of the Yang God from the sixth realm of heaven to slay him.</p><p></p><p>That person's talent would be rare even in the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>After all, those behind the great calamity never expected such a great talent to emerge from the Cang Lan Realm, achieving Yang God status in less than a million years in the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the original million-year cycle of the Cang Lan Realm's great calamity was changed to once every 300,000 years, for fear of the same thing happening again.</p><p></p><p>"Even such a peerless powerhouse fell to the great calamity. Fellow Daoist... with only a few hundred years left before the great calamity, you have no chance of surviving. Master, let me live on in your stead!" Shen Wushen declared passionately.</p><p></p><p>"Get out!" Qi Yuan kicked Shen Wushen, sending him flying out of the great hall.</p><p></p><p>Communicating with people who were poor with words was truly frustrating.</p><p></p><p>People with low EQ shouldn't have mouths.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that if he truly achieved the ability to speak things into existence, he would definitely establish a rule of the great Dao: all those with low EQ must be mute.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Hall of Seeking the Dao, the Seven Injuries Elder lounged lazily, like a turtle.</p><p></p><p>Long Can's phantom stood to the side, his gaze complex: "The Blood Robed Sword Saint really isn't leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Last time, Long Can had chosen to hand over techniques and leave like the other Yin Gods, but unlike the others, he hadn't returned the jade slip to the Original God Sharing Association, nor had he completely cut ties with them.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is advanced in years, what does it matter to me whether the Sword Saint stays or goes?" the Seven Injuries Elder said casually.</p><p></p><p>His lifespan was almost exhausted, and he could no longer see hope, so he had put life and death out of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the Blood Robed Sword Saint just transmitted some techniques in the jade slip. Let me take a look and see if there's anything useful," Long Can noticed something.</p><p></p><p>His main body's divine sense entered the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>As an Yin God Venerable, he cultivated techniques of heaven-grade middle rank.</p><p></p><p>In the Original God Sharing Association, he had seen several heaven-grade upper rank techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't modify his cultivation method, exchanging for some similar techniques for reference would still be an improvement for him.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder chuckled: "If this old man were a few thousand years younger, perhaps I'd be like you."</p><p></p><p>But now, he had given up.</p><p></p><p>Some of the techniques inside were quite good, but to him, they were just so-so.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the smile on Long Can's face suddenly froze. He glanced at the Seven Injuries Elder: "You really should take a look at the techniques in the jade slip!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What interesting new technique has been added?" the Seven Injuries Elder said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"You'll know when you take a look," Long Can's eyes showed clear excitement as he took a deep breath. "You might feel especially pained after seeing it."</p><p></p><p>"This old man doesn't fear death, why would I fear pain?" the Seven Injuries Elder said with a chuckle as his divine sense also swept into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let this old man see what's so interesting..." </p><p></p><p>As he said this, the expression on his face froze, and his eyes revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Divine... divine technique!" Old Man Qishang's beard trembled. "How is this possible? How could there be divine techniques in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques were methods created by Yang spirits. </p><p></p><p>The Cang Lan Realm had no divine techniques at all. The gap between divine techniques and heavenly techniques was extremely vast.</p><p></p><p>Just seeing the first part of the divine technique, Old Man Qishang felt as if he had seen the girl of his dreams from his youth. He felt that sense of excitement, elation and longing.</p><p></p><p>"It really is a divine technique!" Old Man Qishang was both shocked and moved.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of his heart racing and mouth watering was something he hadn't experienced in many years. </p><p></p><p>Just the part revealed at the beginning was enough to make him lose control.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, I suddenly really want to leave Qiudao Palace... and go to some remote place..." Old Man Qishang murmured.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine technique after all.</p><p></p><p>If he could successfully exchange for it and study it carefully, it would be extremely beneficial for him.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he truly felt like a withered tree encountering spring.</p><p></p><p>Long Can's gaze was serious beside him: "While the Four Generals of the Lei Family haven't arrived yet, we can still leave now. Let's work together to exchange for this divine technique!"</p><p></p><p>"This..." Old Man Qishang hesitated and wavered.</p><p></p><p>If they did this, it would be betraying the Blood Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>But this divine technique... truly moved his heart, like old roots gaining new life.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something, and his gaze became firm: "Is there any possibility... that the Blood Robed Sword God could deal with the Four Generals of the Lei Family?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Even the Blazing Flame Great Venerable died at the hands of the Four Generals of the Lei Family. What qualifications does the Blood Robed Sword God have to resist them?" Long Can immediately rejected the idea.</p><p></p><p>"But even the Blazing Flame Great Venerable couldn't produce a divine technique... Have you ever seen anyone produce a divine technique?" Old Man Qishang said.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." Suddenly, a terrifying thought flashed through Long Can's mind.</p><p></p><p>He recalled a taboo figure, the one who had nearly swept through the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the Blood Robed Sword God was related to that person.</p><p></p><p>"So... the Blood Robed Sword God may be an exception.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred thousand years ago, an exception appeared in the Cang Lan Realm, but ultimately failed.</p><p></p><p>Now... is another exception about to appear in the Cang Lan Realm?" Old Man Qishang pondered.</p><p></p><p>Long Can was also stunned, his thoughts racing.</p><p></p><p>"Last time the Cang Lan Realm was severely wounded. This time... if we can't deal with the great calamity, there really will be no hope for the Cang Lan Realm!" Old Man Qishang sighed.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to leave this time, but to stay in the Original God Sharing Conference.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Old Man Qishang's expression suddenly changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The sky over the entire Qinghong City had abruptly transformed.</p><p></p><p>Purple lightning filled the sky in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The purple reflection could be seen on the ground throughout the entire city.</p><p></p><p>A voice as majestic as thunder suddenly rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robed Sword God, come forth to die!"</p><p></p><p>This voice echoed throughout Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators who heard this voice all trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Is a battle between gods... about to begin?"</p><p></p><p>"An Yin Spirit Venerable has actually come to challenge the Blood Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Which divine being is it?"</p><p></p><p>These ordinary cultivators looked up, trying their best to conceal their auras, not daring to speak at all.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirits and ordinary cultivators were not on the same level of existence at all.</p><p></p><p>If an Yin Spirit wanted to, they could turn Qinghong City into an abyss with a single light strike, and no cultivator would be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, thousands of miles away, a complex look appeared in Jasmine Great Venerable's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, the Four Generals of the Lei Family have arrived."</p><p></p><p>The silhouette in the ancient mirror spoke: "I suddenly hope the Blood Robed Sword God can win."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Jasmine Great Venerable was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"That's a divine technique... unlike the techniques of this realm.</p><p></p><p>He may come from the upper realm, and the techniques he cultivates may not originate from this realm either.</p><p></p><p>If I seize his body, perhaps... I could bring you back to the upper realm." For the first time, there was a slight tremor in the voice of the man in the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>A sharp light also appeared in Jasmine Great Venerable's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Qinghong City, Qi Yuan put down the jade slip and looked towards the sky, his voice languid.</p><p></p><p>"Four Generals of the Lei Family, you've come too slowly."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan flew up into the sky. Several thousand meters away from him were four terrifying figures.</p><p></p><p>Their long hair was disheveled, and their pupils were like black pools with no focus.</p><p></p><p>Their bare chests were covered in sword and blade scars, riddled with wounds, as if they had once endured fierce battles.</p><p></p><p>Each of them emanated an aura at the peak of the Six Steps of Heaven Treading, just one step away from the Mythical realm...</p><p></p><p>Such world-class fiends would be first-rate experts even in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the upper realm, Yin Spirits were definitely considered powerful.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerables at the peak of the Six Steps of Heaven Treading would be mid to high-level figures even in holy lands.</p><p></p><p>[The bodies of Lei Shengyu, once Mythical realm experts, had their foundations stolen and were refined into puppets, becoming the claws of the Dark Sun.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this information before his eyes, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, feeling inexplicably strange.</p><p></p><p>The Four Generals of the Lei Family before him were not so much the Four Generals of the Lei Family, but rather their long-dead bodies that the Dark Sun had taken and refined into weapons of war.</p><p></p><p>Once Mythical realm experts, they became resources while alive, and after death, their physical bodies were refined into puppets, becoming the claws of the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>How tragic.</p><p></p><p>"By order of the Dark Sun, the Blood Robed Sword God has brought calamity to the world and must be executed!"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Four Generals of the Lei Family shouted, his voice rolling like thunder.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the environment around Qi Yuan also changed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they entered the virtual realm.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the Cang Lan Realm was very powerful. Even if a Mythical realm expert exerted power beyond the Yin Spirit level, they would be pulled into the virtual realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the four Lei Family Generals before him, his gaze deep: "Do you four puppets have your own consciousness? If so, please tell me where the Dark Sun's headquarters are.</p><p></p><p>I have a moonlight in the Dark Sun, I need to go see him."</p><p></p><p>Faced with the powerful Four Generals of the Lei Family, Qi Yuan was very relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the Four Generals of the Lei Family had no focus. At this moment, this area turned into a sea of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>"They have no consciousness." A mechanical bird appeared.</p><p></p><p>This mechanical bird was the one that had appeared when Qi Yuan fought with Wu Jun Great Venerable before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze also fell on the mechanical bird at this moment.</p><p></p><p>[Wondrous creation, controlled by Li Qiuchen, true disciple of the Tai Huang Palace in the upper realm.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Was the Tai Huang Palace behind the great calamity?</p><p></p><p>The Tai Huang Palace of the upper realm?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the mechanical bird landed on the shoulder of the leader of the Four Generals of the Lei Family, its eyes filled with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"An expert like you, if we met in the upper realm, I wouldn't dare to breathe loudly. But unfortunately... this is a pig farm."</p><p></p><p>Li Qiuchen's voice was mocking.</p><p></p><p>As a true disciple of the Tai Huang Palace, the Cang Lan Realm had always been their pig farm.</p><p></p><p>All living beings would be fed to the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>And these true disciples would occasionally descend to the lower realm, using wondrous creations to kill some Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In the upper realm, they might only be at the Purple Palace stage, or just entered the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>But coming to the lower realm, by controlling wondrous creations and the Dark Sun, they could control the life and death of those Great Venerables they once had to look up to with a wave of their hand.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was intoxicating.</p><p></p><p>P.S. One chapter first, one chapter owed, will make it up today, sorry.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

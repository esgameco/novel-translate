        <h1>Chapter 271</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>The game hadn't even started yet, but the character had already died.</p><p></p><p>"This innate seed is really no good, their gaming skills are too poor, probably just bronze level?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>The reward from the previous game sounded impressive.</p><p></p><p>But this was the result?</p><p></p><p>He might as well take matters into his own hands.</p><p></p><p>He casually glanced at the game icon, which had loaded about two-thirds.</p><p></p><p>"At this time flow rate, by the time I get in, I'm afraid my bones will have already turned to dust."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, not thinking any further about it, and continued sitting on the stone bench, quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Maple Grove Town was an ordinary mortal town. Because many maple trees grew in this area, with leaves as red as fire, wealthy families often brought their children here to enjoy the scenery when the season was right.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chen Xiyu lifted the curtain of the carriage, a curious expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"There's a strange man in a red robe playing chess in North Wild Forest?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, miss. A passing woodcutter saw him, but his clothing and appearance were too strange, so no one dared approach," the maid replied.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu's eyes lit up: "Xiao Xi, do you think that person... could he be one of the legendary immortals?"</p><p></p><p>In the mortal world, there had long been rumors of immortals within a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Xiyu had never seen an immortal before.</p><p></p><p>She had loved strange tales since childhood and was especially interested in such things.</p><p></p><p>"No! Miss, what if he's a bad person! </p><p></p><p>There have been many skin-flaying incidents in town recently. Miss, it's best not to go deep into the mountains and forests!" The maid Xiao Xi hurriedly tried to dissuade her.</p><p></p><p>Maple Grove Town had never been very peaceful.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, another skin-flaying incident occurred. In a village near Maple Grove Town, two hundred households woke up from their sleep one night to suddenly find that over half the villagers had been flayed in their sleep, covered in blood, terrifyingly gruesome.</p><p></p><p>Maple Grove Town and the surrounding cities were in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Kingdom of Huan, skin-flaying incidents occurred periodically.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the king had even spent enormous resources to invite immortal masters from ten thousand miles away, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>The skin-flaying incidents continued to occur.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu shook her head, her attitude very determined.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Chen Xiyu headed to North Wild Forest accompanied by several guards.</p><p></p><p>The forest was full of shrubs and thorny vines. Even with several guards clearing the way, Chen Xiyu's delicate white arms were inevitably scratched several times, leaving trails of blood.</p><p></p><p>But she remained excited and in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, look, over there!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the maid Xiao Xi pointed into the distance, her face showing delight.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu looked over, curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the forest ahead, a man in a red robe sat upright on a stone bench. His eyes were tightly closed, but even from his outline, one could see his extraordinary handsomeness.</p><p></p><p>"I never knew there could be such a handsome man in this world." Chen Xiyu was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>Her originally fair arms now looked quite rough in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"He must be no ordinary person!" Chen Xiyu's heart leapt with excitement.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to seek an immortal destiny and find the true culprit behind the skin-flaying incidents.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, should we go over and ask?" Xiao Xi inquired.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu quickly shook her head: "His eyes are closed, he may be busy. We shouldn't disturb him."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu hesitated, only daring to steal a glance at the man in the blood-red robe from afar.</p><p></p><p>About an hour passed, and the man still sat motionless, occasionally reaching out to place a black stone on the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>This demeanor further convinced Chen Xiyu that the man in the blood-red robe before her was no mere mortal.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back!" Chen Xiyu made her decision. She had to seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>How could an immortal casually bestow an opportunity on her?</p><p></p><p>She was just an ordinary person, nothing special, not the protagonist of the world.</p><p></p><p>She would go home and bring out all the gold and silver treasures she had saved over the years, as well as various rare and strange objects she had collected, to offer to the immortal, all for the chance at an immortal destiny.</p><p></p><p>She quickly returned home and brought out all her savings.</p><p></p><p>However, her actions also drew questioning from her family members.</p><p></p><p>Her cousin sister came upon hearing the news, her tone not very polite: "With Second Uncle not at home, you're just giving away the clan's wealth as you please? </p><p></p><p>Little sister, the world is chaotic now, don't be fooled by swindlers.</p><p></p><p>You believe just any country bumpkin putting on an act?"</p><p></p><p>Faced with her cousin sister, Chen Xiyu didn't explain much, but said: "This is my money!"</p><p></p><p>With that, she turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Her cousin sister watched Chen Xiyu's retreating figure, pity in her eyes: "Little sister is still too naive. How could there be so many immortals in the world?</p><p></p><p>Even if they were immortals, how could they bestow immortal destiny so easily? More often than not, they just take everything and leave. People's hearts are treacherous, and immortals even more so."</p><p></p><p>In this country, such things happened often. Some master would encounter an "immortal" and offer half his family fortune seeking an immortal destiny.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those "immortals" would often take the fortune and run, the "immortal destiny"... nothing but empty promises.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully little sister will be more settled after being deceived this time, and stop daydreaming all day."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Chen Xiyu headed towards North Wild Forest carrying gold, silver, and various strange treasures she had collected.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was full of trepidation, as well as uncertainty about the future.</p><p></p><p>She understood what her cousin sister had said.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't want to give up, nor did she want to just muddle through life aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Chen Xiyu once again arrived about fifty meters from the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>She looked at that figure, her emotions in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that man still in silent meditation, she didn't go disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu had been coming here for two days.</p><p></p><p>The man on the stone bench still sat there, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>If not for him occasionally placing a stone, Chen Xiyu would have thought he was a corpse.</p><p></p><p>Finally, on the fourth day, Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu, who had been sitting nearby, showed excitement in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The immortal had finally awakened! She hurriedly tidied herself up a bit, and had the guards bring over the various treasures as she walked forward.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Chen Xiyu, his expression enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>Over these past days, he had of course been aware of Chen Xiyu's arrival.</p><p></p><p>However, he had paid her no mind.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu approached, a respectful expression on her face. She was about to speak when she heard the immortal say:</p><p></p><p>His voice was like a pool of water in a dark pond, clear and emerald green.</p><p></p><p>"You wish to seek an immortal destiny?"</p><p></p><p>The immortal's words were simple and direct.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu's heart tightened, and she hurriedly said respectfully: "This humble girl is willing to offer everything, only asking the master to bestow an immortal destiny."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu lowered her head, her attitude extremely devout.</p><p></p><p>The guards behind her opened the treasure chests they were carrying, and dazzling jewels and precious objects came into view.</p><p></p><p>All sorts of gold ornaments, silver ingots, pearl hairpins, and jewelry.</p><p></p><p>The chest wasn't large, but it was packed full of various items.</p><p></p><p>Another chest contained various ancient texts Chen Xiyu had collected, as well as some strange objects.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, these things were enough to move some Qi Condensation stage cultivators to bestow a crude "immortal destiny".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at these objects, curiosity in his expression.</p><p></p><p>Most of the strange things Chen Xiyu had collected in the other chest were useless, but there was one item that emitted a faint spiritual energy fluctuation. For a mid Qi Condensation cultivator, it could be considered an unexpected delight.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan smiled faintly: "If you had come half a year earlier, it would have been interesting."</p><p></p><p>If she had come half a year earlier, these things would have had some use for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu was puzzled, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>Then she heard the immortal say</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why do you want to walk the path of immortality?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"To become stronger, to control my own destiny, and also to find the true culprit behind the skin-peeler!" Chen Xiyu didn't hide anything and honestly expressed her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened to this answer and glanced at the Wind Thunder Valley ahead. "The true culprit behind the skin-peeler... you might not be able to defeat them even if you cultivate for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew about the relationship between the skin-peeler and Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Dark Sun in Wind Thunder Valley, all the Yin Gods in the vast Youtiandomain chose to remain silent and then become accomplices.</p><p></p><p>Even if mere mortals knew that Wind Thunder Valley was behind the skin-peeler, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>"Even if you enter the immortal path, you won't be a match for them when you encounter them. If you investigate and delve deeper, it might even bring killers after you. Do you still want to investigate?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"The endpoint of all things is death. If we don't investigate out of fear of death, what's the point of walking this immortal path!" Chen Xiyu suddenly recalled a sentence from an ancient text, feeling inspired, and responded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He took out a short sword from the wooden box and tossed it into Chen Xiyu's hands.</p><p></p><p>"The true culprit behind the skin-peeling is within the chessboard. </p><p>Strike it with one sword blow, and I'll grant you immortal destiny," Qi Yuan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu gripped the short sword, her hand trembling slightly, perhaps due to lack of strength.</p><p></p><p>Holding the sword, she looked at the chessboard in front of her, her gaze becoming determined.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>She struck forcefully, putting her whole body into it to fulfill Qi Yuan's request. All her strength concentrated on the sword as she struck the chessboard.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The powerful recoil made her see stars and her wrist ache.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the chessboard in front cracked, revealing a fissure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan suddenly laughed: "The Yin Gods dare not strike, yet a mortal dares. How interesting."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his finger lightly tapped, and a stream of light entered Chen Xiyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods and some cultivation experiences entered Chen Xiyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu's face showed ecstatic joy, and she quickly knelt down: "Thank you, Master, for bestowing the method."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand: "Not at all. I don't take disciples, nor do I want to.</p><p>You gave me gold and silver, broke the chess game, so I gift you this cultivation method. From now on, we're even."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu's expression turned disappointed.</p><p></p><p>She had finally met an immortal, and one who seemed kind and good-looking at that. Naturally, she wanted to become his disciple.</p><p></p><p>This way, she would have some support when entering the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'm off to kill someone. Farewell."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after the chessboard shattered, a door appeared in the distance, standing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned into a stream of light and entered that door.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Xiyu was suddenly shocked: "The immortal lord can actually fly... Could he be the legendary... Foundation Establishment Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>She was also suddenly delighted. If it was a Foundation Establishment Patriarch granting immortal destiny, that would be a huge gain.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that according to ancient records, when a Foundation Establishment Patriarch like this descended, even emperors would kneel to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a big shot immortal!</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Little Xi was excited and secretly pleased.</p><p></p><p>She decided that when she returned today, she would write down the extraordinary events of these past few days into a book.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the book, she would also record how the young miss entered the world of immortal cultivation, and how the Foundation Establishment Patriarch battled the skin-peeler.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored figure appeared, holding a blood-colored long sword, standing in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The sky behind him turned red at this moment, as if it were a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator who came here would feel that this was a terrifying demon.</p><p></p><p>"White moonlights of the Dark Sun, your undertaker has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The voice rolled like thunder, instantly resounding throughout the entire Wind Thunder Valley secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The earth cracked, the crust churned, countless wind, thunder, and fire essences spread, instantly turning Wind Thunder Valley into a scene resembling hell.</p><p></p><p>Great fires burned, thunder roared continuously.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the earth trembling also arose at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Only to see many towering giants moving on the ground.</p><p></p><p>These giants were thousands of meters tall, with massive builds, each like a great mountain, emitting extremely terrifying auras.</p><p></p><p>If placed in the outside world, such terrifying power would be enough to sweep across all domains.</p><p></p><p>Faced with these thirty-odd puppets, Qi Yuan's expression didn't change at all.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the number is decent."</p><p></p><p>Decent number, not bad strength, which also meant that this Wind Thunder Valley had many good things.</p><p></p><p>"So many high-quality white moonlights appearing at once, I feel a bit embarrassed."</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, Qi Yuan's eyes were gleaming.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Blood Robe Sword God, you've finally come." At this moment, an elderly phantom appeared. He looked at Qi Yuan with a playful look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You are... the permission dog!" Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly turned angry, "Well well, so you're the one who muted me!"</p><p></p><p>Being muted for the first time in his life, Qi Yuan was naturally angry.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Association's president squinted his eyes. Having control over all the pig slaves, even when facing the supreme being Blood Robe Sword God, he was extremely bold.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't mute you, I was just protecting the members of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p>Blood Robe Sword God, you're really not a smart person.</p><p>The Cang Lan Realm is vast, how many talents are there?</p><p>You think only you discovered problems with the cultivation methods? Other talents discovered it too, but they chose to lie low and didn't spread this information.</p><p>But you spread it, causing unrest, which will inevitably lead to turmoil for the Dark Sun.</p><p>If other members of the Divine Flower Association believed your words, perhaps the Dark Sun would deal with them too.</p><p>So... I was protecting them!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Association's president spoke eloquently, as if he held the moral high ground.</p><p></p><p>"Only by silencing you can this calamity be prevented from spreading and expanding."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if only you were content being a muddleheaded person, this great calamity wouldn't have fallen on you.</p><p>Even with the great tribulation approaching, you would have had a chance to survive.</p><p>The great tribulation is terrifying, yes, but it also left us a glimmer of hope for survival. Why go to your death unnecessarily?</p><p>You alone going to your death might make you a hero, enjoying everyone's respect, but it will anger the great tribulation, causing other Yin Gods who want to mind their own business to be implicated.</p><p>For the sake of your own fame and gain, provoking the great tribulation to go on a killing spree, you are the truly hypocritical and selfish one! Fortunately, you act so high-profile that you don't even need to wait for the great tribulation, you will perish today."</p><p></p><p>This was also the Divine Flower Association president's thoughts and beliefs.</p><p></p><p>The great tribulation is too strong to be defeated, so why resist?</p><p></p><p>Not resisting might result in some cultivators dying, but with some luck, one could live in peace.</p><p></p><p>But resisting is certain death.</p><p></p><p>In his view, those Yin Gods who dare to act against the great tribulation are all fame-seekers.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of their own reputation, they don't care about the lives and deaths of their peers.</p><p></p><p>If their deeds were unknown to anyone, who knows if they would still act against the great tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"You old fellow, you're somewhat like the people from Di Jue. Since that's the case... I'll send you to reunite with the people from the Palace of Light." Qi Yuan waved his hand, looking disgusted.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, in the Divine Flower Association's president, he saw the shadow of the old man from Di Jue.</p><p></p><p>Constantly talking about the greater good, but in reality, seeking benefits for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Seeking benefits for oneself is fine, being a true villain is fine, but insisting on being a hypocrite is detestable.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, it's like being a prostitute while trying to erect a chastity arch.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God, you are very strong, easily destroying the Palace of Light, even killing the Four Generals of the Lei family.</p><p>But this is Wind Thunder Valley. Even if a myth from the Central Heavenly Domain came here, they would certainly die.</p><p>Today, I will use your blood to achieve my supreme merit!" The Divine Flower Association's president was confident of victory, looking at Qi Yuan as if he were already dead.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This person is actually last year's Martial Arts Championship winner!"</p><p></p><p>On the homepage of [Grandpa Delivery Network], there was a small introduction stating that the founder of [Grandpa Delivery Network] was named Qi Yuan, who was the champion of the previous Martial Arts Championship.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang had a deep impression of that Martial Arts Championship winner, who had knocked out his opponent with one punch.</p><p></p><p>However, there were very few videos circulating at the time, and they were very blurry.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen Qi Yuan's face clearly, nor heard his voice.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the designated hospital for blood draw, then mail it?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang opened the website and immediately saw that there were many hospitals in Fenghai City where blood could be drawn and mailed.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Shen Yang prepared to leave immediately. </p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to scan an electric bike to go down the mountain, but now thinking about it, he decided to endure the pain and spend a bit more money on a taxi.</p><p></p><p>He found an intersection and started to hail a taxi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Shen Yang, where are you planning to go?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang turned his head and saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure was the young disciple he had encountered earlier at the Doushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I... am planning to go to the hospital to mail my blood to 'Grandpa Delivery Network'," Shen Yang blurted out instinctively, looking at the young man's eyes with a hint of confusion and vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"Why has the Immortal come here?" Shen Yang couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>A flash of killing intent passed through the young man's eyes: "Just came out for a casual stroll."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a joyful voice came:</p><p></p><p>"It seems 'Grandpa Delivery Network' is developing well, people are already mailing blood at the beginning. This world really lacks warmth and love."</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a young man in a blood-red robe appeared. He had a bright smile on his face, handsome features, and his smile seemed to be able to dispel the evil in this world, like a spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>The man in the blood robe was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the death energy space, he had asked Ning Tao for help to dissolve and conceal the killing aura on his body.</p><p></p><p>So when ordinary people saw him, they wouldn't feel the thick killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's appearance made Shen Yang's expression freeze, then show a look of pleasant surprise: "You... you are Qi Yuan, the founder of 'Grandpa Delivery Network'!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't surprised, he nodded: "It seems 'Grandpa Delivery Network' is running well, I randomly encountered someone who barely meets the conditions.</p><p></p><p>Hey, brother, do you need a grandpa? Want me to give you a grandpa on the spot?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very enthusiastic, promoting grandfathers.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Yang's expression became excited: "I do need one, Mr. Qi. Actually, when you got married last time, I even sent you congratulations on your wedding!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang seized every opportunity to get close to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly: "Are you that gay guy who has a secret crush on me?</p><p></p><p>I don't do gay stuff, my sexual orientation is normal!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Yang was a bit confused, not understanding what Qi Yuan meant. He hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, you misunderstood, my sexual orientation is also very normal."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young man from the Doushen Sect frowned, he glanced at Qi Yuan and said calmly: "Brother, I have some urgent matters to discuss with Shen Yang."</p><p></p><p>He was in a hurry to go back, he needed to kill the person quickly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's appearance, it seemed he still wanted to chat with Shen Yang for a while, so he couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang was slightly stunned, looking at the young man from the Doushen Sect: "Immortal, I no longer wish to join your sect, so there shouldn't be anything else to discuss, right?"</p><p></p><p>He was politely refusing.</p><p></p><p>He had originally sensed that the sudden appearance of this Doushen Sect disciple was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"When I say I have matters to discuss with you, we must discuss!" Since stepping onto the immortal path, the young man had become arrogant and conceited, with a superior attitude towards mortals.</p><p></p><p>His voice carried an undeniable tone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the young man, his eyes calm: "You are too unloving. He is lacking love now, lacking a grandfather. I'm giving him a grandfather, are you going to obstruct that too?"</p><p></p><p>The killing intent in the young man's eyes intensified. He scanned the surroundings, his voice turning cold: "If you want a grandfather, that's simple. I'll send you both to hell to meet your grandfather!"</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power circulated in his body, and killing intent arose in the heart of this Doushen Sect disciple. He wanted to kill both people before him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the young man's words, Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly: "If you interpret [Grandpa Delivery Network] like that, it's quite interesting too.</p><p></p><p>Give grandfathers to good people, send bad people to hell to meet their grandfathers."</p><p></p><p>"Psycho!" As the young man's words fell, he directly attacked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, having an appetizer before exterminating a family is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his fist and casually threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>A look of disdain appeared in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A weak mortal dared to throw a punch at him, who had stepped onto the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, a mist of blood appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>This young man... was directly punched into a blood mist by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later.</p><p></p><p>The Doushen Building was bustling with noise, with more and more people arriving.</p><p></p><p>There were over ten thousand people seeking to join the Doushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>These people were queuing under the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>Some paid money to take the fast track and directly undergo testing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a flash of blood light passed through the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sky also turned blood red at this moment, as if a layer of blood curtain covered the sky.</p><p></p><p>All the people who wanted to become disciples couldn't help but look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did the sky turn red?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it bleeding?"</p><p></p><p>"Something unusual must be happening!"</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, it's quite cool!"</p><p></p><p>The sky was replaced by a blood color, and the sunlight was also replaced by a blood light.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's face was tinted red, and the originally scorching sunlight had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at this, could it be like in TV shows, someone coming to challenge?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was discussing, some with an attitude of watching a show, some with fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in a panic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thick white light shot up from the top of the Doushen Building.</p><p></p><p>A lotus flower made of white light flew out, as big as a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>The white lotus was crystal clear, as white as jade, like a celestial object.</p><p></p><p>The white lotus flew to the sky, and the bud that was about to bloom opened as if encountering spring breeze. Instantly, countless petals shot up towards the blood curtain.</p><p></p><p>Streams of immortal techniques and spiritual power collided with the blood curtain.</p><p></p><p>The sky also gained a layer of white at this moment, bright as day.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, is this real?"</p><p></p><p>"It's so gorgeous!"</p><p></p><p>"Special effects are nothing compared to this!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, despite countless petals being launched, they still couldn't pierce through the blood curtain.</p><p></p><p>A vast and heavy voice also sounded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This poor Daoist is the Sect Master of Doushen Sect, Saint Dou True Lord. Which fellow Daoist has come to my Doushen Sect? Please show yourself."</p><p></p><p>On top of the Doushen Building, an old man with white hair appeared, his figure ethereal, wearing a golden robe.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person, all the people present became excited.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"With the Sect Master here, the Doushen Sect will surely be fine!"</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Sect Master, this is a God-infant, so powerful, like a heavenly god!"</p><p></p><p>Countless people looked at the Sect Master of Doushen Sect, Saint Dou True Lord, with admiration and awe in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, the Sect Master of Doushen Sect had moved the Doushen Building to Doushen Mountain, and the video had circulated online.</p><p></p><p>Many people viewed the Sect Master of Doushen Sect, Saint Dou True Lord, as a heavenly god.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing the heavenly god, they were naturally excited.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gap appeared in the blood-red sky curtain, and a figure in a blood robe appeared.</p><p></p><p>This figure stood in the air, wearing a red mask on his face, making it impossible to see his features.</p><p></p><p>However, this attire, this style, was clearly that of a great demon.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the people present rose to their throats.</p><p></p><p>The disciples and elders of the Doushen Sect, on the other hand, were excited.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Sect Master here, what petty villain would dare to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Look</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Holy Duel Immortal squinted his eyes at the newcomer: "Friend, your aura is unfamiliar. Why have you come to cause trouble for my Duel God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered deeply, trying to discern Qi Yuan's background, but it remained obscure. </p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, as the Duel God Sect didn't seem to have offended such a powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, making the blood-colored figure's robe flutter. The man in the air spoke, his voice like heavenly music.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had been in hiding before.</p><p></p><p>"Your Duel God Sect's name is not good."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Duel God Sect laughed in anger.</p><p></p><p>"This scoundrel is too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't even bother to think of a reason, just directly causes trouble. He must be a great demon!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Duel Immortal seemed to have a good temperament and didn't get angry at Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"The Duel God Sect was named by our founder, in accordance with the Heavenly Way. What's wrong with it?"</p><p></p><p>"If it was a good name, your sect's name wouldn't have offended me. Your sect is called the Duel God Sect - duel god, duel god. Now... I, a god, have come. Are you going to duel me? Your sect's name has offended me. Why call it Duel God? Isn't this targeting me, a god? Change the name quickly, and I might be in a good mood and spare your lives." Qi Yuan's voice was cold and unquestionable, filled with intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"A coward who hides his identity dares to call himself a god!" The Holy Duel Immortal thought contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"How am I not a god?" Under the blood-colored robe, Qi Yuan blinked his eyes. "Do you want me to show you proof that I'm a god? If you see it and acknowledge me as a god, hurry and change the Duel God Sect's name."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, let this Immortal see what kind of god you are." The Holy Duel Immortal stood in the air, inwardly alert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gust of wind blew, and a red booklet appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Duel Immortal was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>This red booklet... was proof of godhood?</p><p></p><p>Another gentle breeze blew, and the red booklet flipped open.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Duel Immortal's eyes widened in shock, and he gritted his teeth, his expression full of rage: "Men...tal...ill...ness!"</p><p></p><p>In the red booklet, the words "Mental Illness" were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>"See? Am I a god or not? Your Duel God Sect's name has provoked me. Change the name now, and you'll have a chance to live. Otherwise, you'll end up like that Jiang Qingjiao who spoke ill of me behind my back... dead."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many elders and stewards in the Duel God Tower also saw the words in the red booklet.</p><p></p><p>They showed expressions of shock, bewilderment, and absurdity.</p><p></p><p>"A mental illness certificate?"</p><p></p><p>"How despicable, this fellow is mocking us!"</p><p></p><p>"A mental illness certificate, and he dares to use it as proof of godhood!"</p><p></p><p>They understood now that this person had come to deliberately cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>As for being a "god," it was all just an excuse.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Duel Immortal was now also enraged, his eyes filled with killing intent: "It's been a hundred years since I've killed someone of the same realm. It seems... today I'll have to go on a killing spree!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the air, his eyes filled with confusion: "What? You don't acknowledge me as a god? Are you wearing colored glasses? Professional discrimination? Discriminating against the mentally ill? How are the mentally ill not gods?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>What era was this? Everyone should be equal, yet there were still people discriminating against the mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>How were the mentally ill not gods?</p><p></p><p>When these words spread, those Qin Yuan people who had come to seek teachers were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The proof of godhood... is a mental illness certificate?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm wearing binoculars, I had originally planned... I didn't expect to use them here. It really is a mental illness certificate, I recognize it!"</p><p></p><p>"Mental illness... is godhood?"</p><p></p><p>"This person is too godly!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems he's too lazy to think of a reason and is just causing trouble for the Duel God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"This behavior is just like a demon's!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice full of killing intent spread throughout the area.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to cause trouble, friend, you can say it directly. Is it fun to mock this old man like this?"</p><p></p><p>Killing intent surged in the Holy Duel Immortal's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Duel God Sect focused on the word "duel."</p><p></p><p>When in the Fire Spirit Realm, the Qi Refining disciples of the Duel God Sect would go to the mortal world for tempering.</p><p></p><p>This tempering involved dueling with mortals, honing the concept of dueling.</p><p></p><p>This dueling, rather than actual dueling, was more like randomly slaughtering mortals to refine spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every disciple of the Duel God Sect was filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>In the Fire Spirit Realm, the Duel God Sect could be considered a demonic sect.</p><p></p><p>When the Holy Duel Immortal was young, he became famous for slaughtering 30,000 civilians in a small city with only the third level of Qi Refining, and was accepted as a true disciple.</p><p></p><p>Later, as his cultivation improved, he always adhered to the word "duel."</p><p></p><p>Unlike some cultivators who only knew how to practice in seclusion, the Holy Duel Immortal had extremely rich combat experience and often fought opponents above his level.</p><p></p><p>Although he was only at the middle stage of Divine Infant, he could fight even those at the late stage of Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in the Fire Spirit Realm, the Holy Duel Immortal was considered a top-tier expert.</p><p></p><p>He was confident he could kill the enemy before him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, he had brought the sect's founder's treasure that could kill even those at the Purple Palace realm when he left the Duel God Sect and came to this world.</p><p></p><p>Because this world had many people, ten times more than the Fire Spirit Realm, which suited the Duel God Sect's path of "dueling" and "killing."</p><p></p><p>"Today, this old man will let the world see that the Duel God Sect cannot be insulted!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura swept out, and in the Holy Duel Immortal's hand, lotus flowers began to appear one after another.</p><p></p><p>These lotus flowers formed at an extremely fast rate, quickly covering the Holy Duel Immortal's entire body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the blood curtain, a Divine Infant cultivator saw this scene and his face was shocked: "The Holy Duel Immortal has used his strongest divine ability right from the start, the Million Sacred Lotuses!</p><p></p><p>This divine ability specifically attacks the soul, its power is immense. Even those at the late stage of Divine Infant wouldn't dare to rashly receive it.</p><p></p><p>He has truly unleashed his killing intent!"</p><p></p><p>This Divine Infant was a rogue cultivator who had noticed the abnormality at the Duel God Sect and immediately came to secretly observe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were other rogue cultivators beside him, all shocked at this scene.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought we would be able to see a battle between Divine Infants!"</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan saw them, he would definitely say that the NPCs in this game were really dedicated to their roles, running from so far away to provide commentary.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan wasn't looking at them, but at the Holy Duel Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, your sect is quite sensible.</p><p></p><p>You know to use your trump card right from the start.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, I would have to kill the menial disciples first, then the outer disciples, then the inner disciples, then the true disciples, then the stewards, then the elders, then the grand elders, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>You directly sent out the sect master, which saves me trouble. I can kill you with one slap.</p><p></p><p>This god... will send you to meet your ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that his words were quite eloquent.</p><p></p><p>The last sentence had a double meaning.</p><p></p><p>"My grandfather is still alive, but you... go meet your ancestors!" The Holy Duel Immortal roared.</p><p></p><p>Countless lotus flowers flew towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, countless lotus flowers exploded one after another, as brilliant as a sea of flowers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the air, his blood-colored robe fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>"My wife recently taught me a new move, I might as well try it out."</p><p></p><p>Ten Kills Tyrant Punch!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan threw a straight punch, violently smashing towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood curtain in the sky also suddenly fell, as if the sky had shattered, crashing towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>This punch was created by Ning Tao based on the bloody killing intent on Qi Yuan's body, and modified by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ten Kills Tyrant Punch, as its name suggests.</p><p></p><p>It was an indiscriminate attack, but with selection.</p><p></p><p>Any being that had brutally killed more than ten humans would die under this punch.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the blood-colored curtain transformed into a fist.</p><p></p><p>Endless bloody aura spread and rolled.</p><p></p><p>The fist directly fell!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

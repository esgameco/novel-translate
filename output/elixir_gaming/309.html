        <h1>Chapter 309</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero One sat upright on the sofa, holding a plate filled with various batteries in her hand.</p><p></p><p>She slowly put the batteries into her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Xie Xinsu watched Zero One with wide eyes. </p><p></p><p>This master-servant pair was too abnormal! It was one thing for the master to have mental issues, but this servant... didn't seem like a proper robot.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zero One held a battery and turned her attention to Xie Xinsu: "Are you curious... why I'm eating batteries?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu sat dumbfounded on the sofa, her cat eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to report that Zero One had issues! This AI robot... wasn't even trying to pretend.</p><p></p><p>What kind of AI robot acts this stupid?</p><p></p><p>Zero One ignored her and said in a somewhat mature female voice: "The robots in movies all eat batteries, so I wanted to try and see what they taste like."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this response, Xie Xinsu was certain in her heart that this robot definitely had problems.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was a cat now, otherwise she would definitely expose this black-hearted robot to the master!</p><p></p><p>Zero One stopped looking at Xie Xinsu and continued eating batteries. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of light passed through her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The corners of her mouth curved into a smile: "How bold, daring to invade the master's network?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, she had detected someone trying to hack into Qi Yuan's phone.</p><p></p><p>The current Zero One possessed powerful learning abilities, and mastering hacking skills... was no challenge.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her thinking was more advanced, and her computing power far exceeded that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she discovered the intruder's actions, she immediately blocked them and traced them back to the source.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed, and a mocking look flashed in Zero One's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Quite... daring."</p><p></p><p>She continued eating batteries while watching the movie playing on TV.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xie Xinsu hid under the sofa and resumed her cross-legged meditation.</p><p></p><p>After all, when she meditated on the sofa, the robot always stared at her with a smiling face, which annoyed her and made her feel like a monkey.</p><p></p><p>"When I regain my powers and become an Elemental Dan True Person, I'll definitely teach this robot a lesson!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu had ambitions.</p><p></p><p>The humiliation she faced now, she would repay a hundredfold in the future.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and the sound of the door opening was heard.</p><p></p><p>Zero One calmly stood up, put away the batteries and plate, and walked to the door to greet Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan returned home feeling very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Today he had earned one million yuan and picked up a broken sword.</p><p></p><p>It could be said he had made quite a profit.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're back!" </p><p></p><p>Zero One thoughtfully handed Qi Yuan a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>Then she reported on her work.</p><p></p><p>"Today, Zero One filmed three videos, replied to seventeen private messages and twenty-three comments.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday we gained 13,000 new followers, with earnings of 702 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Today, the cat knocked over a cup at home, shedding 782 cat hairs, causing cat hair to fly all over the room. In the end, Zero One cleaned up and disposed of all the cat hair."</p><p></p><p>Zero One obediently reported on the day's work.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu, who had been meditating under the sofa, suddenly jumped out and meowed incessantly.</p><p></p><p>This robot... wasn't human at all!</p><p></p><p>Too scheming!</p><p></p><p>Why was it that the robot did all the work, while she tried hard to cooperate with filming videos but ended up being the troublemaker?</p><p></p><p>She wanted to say that this robot had eaten batteries and watched TV today, being idle all day and never doing any work.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was just a cat now, too weak and unable to express these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Xie Xinsu with interest: "If it sheds so much, will it go bald?"</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero One smiled lightly and replied: "It would go bald, becoming a hairless cat?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it a hairless cat?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"???" Hearing this, Xie Xinsu immediately had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>She dove back under the sofa.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to be a hairless cat.</p><p></p><p>That would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cat hide, Qi Yuan didn't dwell on the topic.</p><p></p><p>"How are Yaji and the others settled?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Yaji and his sister had come to the Military Security Complex with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The two were arranged to stay in the "warehouse" provided by狂欢.</p><p></p><p>Today, Robot Zero One had taken them to get settled.</p><p></p><p>"The two have been arranged, and have already obtained temporary residence permits. Other identity documents are still being processed... through official channels." Zero One added.</p><p></p><p>She always played the role of a competent assistant.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded, "Don't let him get lost."</p><p></p><p>Now he was busy with the martial arts competition, and Yaji's matters would be dealt with later.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Robot Zero One acknowledged, then said, "Master, today a hacker... attempted to invade your phone, but I intercepted it.</p><p></p><p>This is... the hacker's identity, background, and the mastermind behind it.</p><p></p><p>I've packaged the information, do you need me to send it to you?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression changed drastically: "Peeking at my phone, this person is too heartless, simply devoid of conscience!"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan never used his phone for any strange things,</p><p></p><p>And could be said to be pure and innocent,</p><p></p><p>But letting others look at his phone was impossible! Even in his previous life, just before transmigrating, Qi Yuan had smashed his phone and thrown it into the ancient well at home.</p><p></p><p>His phone, others peeking? Forcibly looking? This felt worse than being raped!</p><p></p><p>"Fine, since they're so devoid of conscience, send me their information! Also, is there anything secret... unspeakable things in their phones, you must dig it all out and expose it on the internet, let them also taste the feeling of social death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was truly angry.</p><p></p><p>Some people's consciences were too rotten.</p><p></p><p>How dare they rely on hacking skills to pry into others' privacy.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, I will arrange this." Robot Zero One said.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she packaged those people's information and sent it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the information and snorted coldly: "Don't think that just because you're behind a network, I can't do anything to you!</p><p></p><p>Zero One, send a coffin to each of their home addresses.</p><p></p><p>After I resolve my upcoming matters, I'll go settle accounts with them!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been clear about gratitude and grudges.</p><p></p><p>No matter how chaotic the war between Wugui Country and Yuelang Country became, it was not his concern.</p><p></p><p>But if someone committed illegal and disorderly acts under his nose,</p><p></p><p>Sorry, Qi Yuan would transform into a reporting expert.</p><p></p><p>If reporting failed, then he would become the judge and take action personally.</p><p></p><p>On the way back to Qinyuan Country, the security check in Qinyuan Country didn't give Qi Yuan trouble, but... the border defense of Yuelang Country did cause some difficulties, and asked for exorbitant bribes.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan had no choice but to teach them how to be just, fair and impartial people.</p><p></p><p>After giving all the instructions, Qi Yuan continued: "I need to leave Tianyue City for a while today.</p><p></p><p>It will probably take three or four days. During this time, help me prepare and purchase some items.</p><p></p><p>My... wife is likely to come down soon."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>This time, going to Wugui Country, his cultivation had progressed steadily, and he was just one step away from the Elemental Dan realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, with the good fortune of obtaining the broken sword, plus other materials, he had enough to break through to ordinary Elemental Dan.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an Elemental Dan was just a matter of this week.</p><p></p><p>Once he became an Elemental Dan,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He could now summon the projection of the Stellar Golden Pill. With his current level of attainment, he could directly call Ning Tao down to enjoy leisurely gaming together here.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, Arch Star was different from the games he had played before. </p><p></p><p>His previous games all had dark backgrounds and were very somber.</p><p></p><p>This current game was casual and everyday.</p><p></p><p>It was perfect for playing with Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Jin Li could not come.</p><p></p><p>His wife and master had also disappeared without a trace and could not come play this game.</p><p></p><p>"Wife?" Zero One's brain stuttered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As if it didn't understand Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>When did the master get a wife?</p><p></p><p>"Mm, yes, my wife. She lives under the sun. Later... she'll come down.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if she'll be used to our... Is my house too small? Too quiet? Too cold?"</p><p></p><p>It was very hot on the Stellar Golden Pill.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao had been there for so long, she was probably used to it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly coming here... would she be comfortable?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a warm-hearted man with high emotional intelligence. Even giving gifts to a girl like Wang Shiqiao could make her so excited she was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, his level was very high.</p><p></p><p>After all, Wang Shiqiao didn't lack admirers. She had seen all kinds of men and probably received all kinds of gifts.</p><p></p><p>The kind of gift Qi Yuan gave that went straight to one's heart was surely a first for her.</p><p></p><p>Zero One was silent for a moment, as if trying to understand Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu, under the sofa, couldn't help but burst out laughing when she heard this, making meowing sounds.</p><p></p><p>Living on the sun? What an exaggeration!</p><p></p><p>Even the Divine Infant True Lord wouldn't dare say he lived on the sun.</p><p></p><p>To be able to survive on the sun, one would have to be at least a Purple Palace cultivator, generally the legendary Yin Spirit that could ascend.</p><p></p><p>This mentally ill master's... wife was a mythical creature? He really dared to imagine.</p><p></p><p>She now understood that Qi Yuan's mental illness certificate was real, not fake.</p><p></p><p>But no one paid attention to Xie Xinsu's laughter. After all, she was just a cat now.</p><p></p><p>Who would care about a cat's feelings?</p><p></p><p>After finishing his instructions, Qi Yuan said, "I'll be leaving with Yang Shan soon. Help me watch the house and don't let anyone steal my things."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" Zero One was very dutiful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan left the room, it was almost dark.</p><p></p><p>He knocked on Yang Shan's door.</p><p></p><p>The one who opened the door was a petite and delicate young girl.</p><p></p><p>The girl looked only 11 or 12 years old, in middle school, wearing a gray-blue pleated skirt that made her look especially youthful and vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi... you're here!" A crescent moon smile appeared on the girl's face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so disrespectful, call him Uncle Qi!" Yang Shan's voice came from inside the room.</p><p></p><p>The girl said dissatisfied, "Dad, you're old, but Brother Qi is still young!"</p><p></p><p>The girl's name was Wang Zhiqi, and she was Yang Shan's daughter.</p><p></p><p>Well... the daughter of a fallen comrade.</p><p></p><p>When Wang Zhiqi was not even a year old, her father died in battle, and the young Yang Shan became the girl's nominal father.</p><p></p><p>Now it was summer vacation, so she came to stay with Yang Shan for a while and attend some tutoring.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, "Mm, I am very young."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had played games for a very long time, hundreds or thousands of years,</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was very young.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, you're going out with my dad for a few days this time. What about the cat at your house? Do you want me to take care of it for a few days?" Wang Zhiqi blinked her eyes, looking expectant.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi had previously come across Zero One's videos and even followed the account.</p><p></p><p>After coming here, she found out that the owner of that cat was actually her dad's good friend. She couldn't be happier.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she never had the chance to go to Qi Yuan's house or pet the cat.</p><p></p><p>She could only occasionally look on longingly and listen.</p><p></p><p>"My robot will take care of it," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Robots are so stupid, how can they take good care of cats?</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, pet cats are so delicate and timid, they don't even dare to go outside. A single fly scares them into meowing!"  Wang Zhiqi tried to persuade Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>During these few days when Qi Yuan was going to Wugui Country, Wang Zhiqi had always wanted to enter Qi Yuan's room.</p><p></p><p>She discovered that Qi Yuan's cat was not an ordinary cat.</p><p></p><p>In the videos, that cat could cook, flip books, meditate, and seemed to be able to do anything.</p><p></p><p>But Wang Zhiqi had a feeling that the cat... was even more extraordinary than shown in the videos.</p><p></p><p>It could even... understand human speech.</p><p></p><p>She told her friends about this discovery, but no one believed her.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's normal for cats to be smart, but to be human-like... that's nonsense.</p><p></p><p>So, she wanted to take this opportunity to bring Qi Yuan's cat out to take care of for a few days, and also show it to her friends and classmates.</p><p></p><p>To see if what she said was true.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she also wanted to see what was really going on with Qi Yuan's cat, if it was really that amazing!</p><p></p><p>"My Zero One is very smart, not an ordinary robot, it's... don't worry, it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan politely declined Wang Zhiqi's offer.</p><p></p><p>A look of disappointment appeared on Wang Zhiqi's face.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, do you want to lend me your key? I can go feed your cat when I'm free." Wang Zhiqi's voice carried a hint of coquettishness.</p><p></p><p>If she were a bit older and bolder, she might have even clung to Qi Yuan's arm while saying this.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan also spoke up at this point: "I'm doing you such a big favor, and you won't even let my daughter go to your house to feed a cat?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan nodded: "At noon the day after tomorrow, there will be a one-hour window. Zero One will open the door for you then."</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi was overjoyed when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't you be thanking me?" Yang Shan said irritably.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yang Shan had also finished packing, and left Tianyu City with Qi Yuan, carrying a small amount of luggage in the car.</p><p></p><p>Although it was dusk, the entire road was as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, one could occasionally see drones and some flying vehicles passing by.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, ordinary people relied on various vehicles to get around, while the nobility used flying vehicles.</p><p></p><p>The sky and the ground were like two completely different worlds.</p><p></p><p>In the car, Yang Shan closed his eyes to rest, occasionally saying: "The place we're going this time is a branch of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Any martial artist at the extreme limit of martial arts, after being recommended by a purple gold member of the Martial Arts Alliance and passing the test, can... directly participate in the national competition of the Martial Arts Tournament."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was not an ordinary martial artist at the extreme limit. He was also a core figure in martial arts circles.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't be involved in research on breaking through the extreme limit of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>So, he was also a purple gold member of the Martial Arts Alliance, the most official organization among martial artists, with a status comparable to an elder.</p><p></p><p>"The competition is simple... it's just fighting.</p><p></p><p>As long as you can defeat the examiner... you can participate.</p><p></p><p>I don't know who the examiner is, but... they probably aren't as strong as you." Yang Shan said casually.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was a martial artist at the extreme limit, with solid strength.</p><p></p><p>This kind of competition was a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks, when I win the Martial Arts Tournament, I'll treat you to beef noodles."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

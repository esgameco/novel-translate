        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years after the Demon Slaying Assembly, there were also powerful experts proficient in divination and fortune-telling, who consumed their life force to glimpse a corner of the future.</p><p></p><p>The divination results were... ten deaths, no survivors.</p><p></p><p>That's right, there was no hope, no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Yet, even so, these powerful experts still gathered together resolutely, united as one.</p><p></p><p>With no path forward, they would carve out a way with blood! And now, what did Tang Yan see? He saw a prodigy whose talent far surpassed even the heavenly deities.</p><p></p><p>This was not the mercy of the heavens, but what was it then? The other three were also affected.</p><p></p><p>They naturally knew what it meant to have the five elements perfected.</p><p></p><p>It meant that the Lord of the Robe had a chance to surpass the heavenly deities.</p><p></p><p>And a chance to truly contend against the demonic forces from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, the Demon Slaying Assembly would no longer be ten deaths, no survivors, but ten deaths, one survivor.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan spoke in a cold tone, "This matter must be reported to Feather and Lord Dragon Judge!"</p><p></p><p>He then transmitted the discovery of the day to the outside.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Five Elements Forbidden Land, in a valley, dozens of coffins lay silently.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the lid of one of the central coffins was lifted.</p><p></p><p>A man with a handsome, androgynous appearance sat up.</p><p></p><p>He was dressed in feathered robes, stunningly beautiful, and was one of the two peak experts of the two divine realms in the Five Elements Forbidden Land - Feather.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the other coffins with an impassive expression.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the other coffins were also opened one by one.</p><p></p><p>A burly man rose and spat a thick wad of phlegm onto the ground, "Lord Feather, didn't we just gather not long ago? Why have you summoned us again?"</p><p></p><p>An old man who seemed dazed muttered, "What time is it? Has the Demon Slaying Assembly arrived?"</p><p></p><p>The other powerful experts all looked at Feather with puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because, with only three hundred years left until the Demon Slaying Assembly, they would not awaken without a major event.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all still remember the Lord of the Robe from the other day?" Feather's voice was soft.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to him?" The burly man asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful experts also looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Awakening them was related to the Lord of the Robe? Could it be that he was truly a spy of the demonic forces from the outer realms?</p><p></p><p>"Tang Yan has reported that the Lord of the Robe has the most supreme water attribute talent, even stronger than his own," Feather said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Stronger than Tang Yan? His talent is indeed top-tier, and if given a millennium, he might become a new heavenly deity. What a pity." One of the powerful experts sighed.</p><p></p><p>"How much stronger?" Someone else asked.</p><p></p><p>Feather replied indifferently, "So strong that with just a wisp of water essence, he can comprehend the Dao of Water."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Silence, stillness.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths, the burly man finally spoke with difficulty, "Doesn't that mean he can perfect the Dao of Water in just a month?"</p><p></p><p>Isn't this exaggerated?</p><p></p><p>Too exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>Where has there ever been someone who can perfect the Dao of Water in just a month?</p><p></p><p>Others take thousands of years, but he can do it in a month?</p><p></p><p>The gap is just too huge!</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan knew their thoughts, he would surely say that the gap is actually not that bad. It's just like the difference between the average person's salary and a superstar's daily earnings of 2.08 million.</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing is that not only is his water attribute talent supreme, but the other four attributes are also the same." Feather's voice remained calm, but anyone could sense the joy hidden within.</p><p></p><p>"What? All five attributes are so supreme!" </p><p></p><p>"Is he even human?"</p><p></p><p>"How infuriating!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts present were all deeply moved. Their dignified bearing as peak experts had vanished, and the burial ground had become as lively as a marketplace.</p><p></p><p>They were all shocked. As divine realm experts, they understood the significance of perfecting the five elements.</p><p></p><p>It meant that the Lord of the Robe had the potential to break through the shackles and walk a path even further than the heavenly deities.</p><p></p><p>"Pity, there are only three hundred years left." Suddenly, someone sighed.</p><p></p><p>The divine realm experts present also revealed a trace of bitterness.</p><p></p><p>The talent of the Lord of the Robe far surpassed the heavenly deities. But he had just broken through to the divine realm, and three hundred years would be difficult to refine and advance his cultivation, let alone to truly excel.</p><p></p><p>"At least, there are still three hundred years." Feather spoke, his voice soft yet unwavering, "Now that the Lord of the Robe is here, we should think about how to break through the predicament!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Slaying Assembly was ten deaths, no survivors. So they must exert their full effort and pay any price to change it to ten deaths, one survivor!</p><p></p><p>At first, they hid in the forbidden land, resisting the demonic forces from the outer realms, perhaps only for the sake of their own survival. Humans are selfish, let alone these old turtles who have lived for so long.</p><p></p><p>Later, resisting the demonic forces from the outer realms gradually became a mission, an obsession.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say they fight for the sake of all living beings, it would sound a bit lofty, but it's not entirely untrue.</p><p></p><p>"I propose... the Divine Imprint!" Feather said softly.</p><p></p><p>The place was silent, not even the sound of breathing could be heard, as if a needle dropping could be clearly heard.</p><p></p><p>"Those who refuse, die!" Feather's gaze swept across the crowd, his tone becoming overbearingly domineering for the first time. "I have no objections!"</p><p></p><p>"Nor do I!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, as long as it can help kill those damned demonic forces from the outer realms, I'll do anything!"</p><p></p><p>The divine realm experts present chuckled and giggled, with no one refusing.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Imprint was a secret technique mastered by the divine realm experts. They could imprint all their comprehensions, including all their experiences, into the depths of another person's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All realizations, all memories.</p><p></p><p>This means that they will be completely open to the Lord of the Clothing Department.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after the divine projection, they will also be weakened, and it will take a hundred years to recover.</p><p></p><p>So, very few divine realm experts would use the divine projection.</p><p></p><p>Unless it's when the great calamity is approaching.</p><p></p><p>Feather looked at the crowd and gently said, "Thank you all for your trouble!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the burly man asked, "Where has Lord Dragon Judgment gone? Why is there no one in his coffin?"</p><p></p><p>Feather looked in the direction of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>"He has gone to the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land. The people of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land are not easy to talk to. He needs to go persuade them to give the divine projection to the Lord of the Clothing Department."</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd drew a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judgment, the silent and bearded man, had actually gone to the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>It's not about persuading the experts of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land, but about subduing them! It seems that Dragon Judgment and Lord Feather have a strong determination to help the Lord of the Clothing Department grow quickly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Five Elements Forbidden Land, the space began to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Judgment mentioned earlier, the silent and bearded man, had returned.</p><p></p><p>Fresh blood was dripping from his left sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the crowd and said with a grin, "I have persuaded the people of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>The crowd remained silent, looking at his bleeding arm.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judgment was very strong, and he had never been defeated in his life, except for the one time when he fought against the Goddess who had merged with the Bridal Gown Princess.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was injured, it was evident that the battle between Dragon Judgment and the experts of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land had been fierce and brutal.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judgment said calmly, "They have been in the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land for a long time, so their speech is a bit yin-yang-ish. It's inevitable that we had a fight."</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking about something, he added, "But they are still our allies, so I can't be too harsh on them.</p><p></p><p>They have set a condition that the Lord of the Clothing Department must defeat the Burying Flower before they will give the divine projection."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judgment finished speaking, walked towards his coffin, and lay down inside, then stretched out his hand to cover the coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>Everyone retreated back into their own coffin lids.</p><p></p><p>The place once again became silent.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a green-clad young lady was crouching on the ground, hugging her shoulders and shivering silently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gentle Water Ancestor appeared and tenderly stroked the green-clad young lady's head, without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>The green-clad young lady cried for a long time before finally looking up with red eyes and stubbornly asking, "Water Ancestor, does it really have to be this way?"</p><p></p><p>The Water Ancestor smiled benevolently, "Child, we are not disappearing, but merely taking on a different form to exist in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Water Ancestor," the green-clad young lady hugged the Water Ancestor, and her tears still rolled down uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>For the Lord of the Clothing Department to achieve the Five Elements Perfection, it also means that he will control the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan came out of the Core Area.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the four people in the distance and smiled, "You all are quite sensible."</p><p></p><p>During the battle, he had noticed the four, but didn't bother with them.</p><p></p><p>Now he was preparing to log off and greet them.</p><p></p><p>However, he found that these four had confined some of the escaped Five Souls.</p><p></p><p>Not many, just a few dozen.</p><p></p><p>But these few dozen Five Souls were baring their teeth and claws, wanting to tear the red-robed man apart.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Clothing Department, please continue your cultivation," Tong Yan said.</p><p></p><p>These Five Souls had escaped from the Core Area, and they had captured them.</p><p></p><p>Being able to do something for the Lord of the Clothing Department and help him progress, was something worth doing for them.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan easily slaughtered the few dozen Five Souls with his sword.</p><p></p><p>He also gained a lot of experience and Five Elemental Qi.</p><p></p><p>Although he had killed many Five Souls today, it would still take at least half a month to gather the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>This made him a bit melancholic.</p><p></p><p>Tong Yan caught Qi Yuan's expression and asked, "Lord of the Clothing Department, is there anything troubling you? We are willing to help relieve your worries."</p><p></p><p>Capturing more allies to strengthen their forces was something Tong Yan would actively do.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's too slow. I have to kill for half a month to complete the Five Elements, it's really too slow," Qi Yuan sighed sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land was a dungeon, the Five Elements Cultivation Ground was a sub-dungeon, and the Core Area was a sub-dungeon within a sub-dungeon.</p><p></p><p>As a result, to grind through such a dungeon, it would still take half a month.</p><p></p><p>It was really too inefficient.</p><p></p><p>He kept ranting about how useless he was.</p><p></p><p>Tong Yan: "..."</p><p></p><p>The girl with the bun hairstyle: "..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qin: "..."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed man: "...You're really 'born' this way!"</p><p></p><p>He was anxious.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the Lord of the Clothing Department's mouth was truly despicable.</p><p></p><p>Half a month to complete the Five Elements? Still finding it too slow? If the five of them with different attributes worked together, it would take three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>What was this? Tong Yan also calmed down, "I will gather the others to help the Lord of the Clothing Department, to confine some Five Souls for you to slay."</p><p></p><p>He didn't even mention cultivation anymore, just straight-up slaying.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Lord of the Clothing Department's slaying was his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you all so much." Qi Yuan felt lucky that he had cleverly gathered a large amount of Five Element Quicksand from the Core Area, "This is a little something I found in the Core Area. It might be useful for you, so I'm giving it to you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tossed the Five Element Quicksand to the four present.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

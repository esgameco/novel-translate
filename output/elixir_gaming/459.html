        <h1>Chapter 459</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"With Blood Robe's strength, Little Lu's intelligence, and my wisdom, I'll achieve a score of 1000 in this great battle," Sister Ox Horn said happily. She seemed confident about this upcoming conflict.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, you're talented, so you be the group leader. Purple Origin Little Lu is detail-oriented, so she can be the assistant leader. You two discuss first, I'm going back to sleep. Call me if anything comes up," Purple Origin Big Snow said with a yawn as she left. </p><p></p><p>She was fine with fighting, but discussing and planning strategies gave her a headache.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan wasn't surprised. </p><p></p><p>If this were a university assignment, Qi Yuan as the leader would be responsible for the overarching, programmatic aspects. Purple Origin Little Lu would make the PowerPoint. And Purple Origin Big Snow would present it.</p><p></p><p>The talented individuals around them began forming teams.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu looked at the happy Purple Origin Little Lu, feeling inexplicably irritated. Little Lu's happiness bothered her.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Big Brother Black Sword is really too amazing. At the Supreme Principle Conference, he comprehended a supreme principle. So elegant and unparalleled! The rest of us can only watch from below. He's just too cool!" An Xun Lu said, deliberately glancing at Purple Origin Little Lu and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Her meaning was clear. The Black Sword brother she admired was the number one of the younger generation in Black Demon Abyss. Everyone else could only look up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Who understands? That's a supreme principle. Big Brother Black Sword and us are simply not in the same world. Back then, some people even tried to compare others to Big Brother Black Sword. It's really laughable."</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh who understands? I certainly don't!" Purple Origin Little Lu shouted.</p><p></p><p>This retort choked An Xun Lu. </p><p></p><p>She glared angrily at Purple Origin Little Lu: "Big Brother Black Sword will achieve great merit, unlike some people... who can only get minor accomplishments."</p><p></p><p>"The master shot a wolf, and the servant proudly puffs out his chest?" Purple Origin Little Lu fired back without hesitation. </p><p></p><p>Though she usually seemed shy and quiet, once she entered a state of verbal sparring with An Xun Lu, her attacks were at full power.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, Little Lu. We need to find a hidden place to make a great plan. Otherwise, if they copy us, we'll lose out big time." Qi Yuan tugged on Purple Origin Little Lu's sleeve as they left.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu and the other talented youths were speechless seeing this. Only Ice Sword breathed a sigh of relief - with those two troublemakers gone, he finally dared to speak and strike poses.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues, but I've reached the character limit. Let me know if you need the rest translated as well.]</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the world, she was like Sadako bringing calamity to all living beings. Only when she came to Qi Yuan did she become the people's Sadako.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu hurriedly said, "Blood Robe senior brother, you need to be careful. Don't take any risks, and don't reveal your whereabouts. There's... a mole in our Black Magic Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>"A mole?" Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu continued with a worried expression, "Blood Robe senior brother, when you and Black Sword senior brother were ambushed last time, there must have been help from a mole. Otherwise... your whereabouts couldn't have been leaked so easily. </p><p></p><p>So, in this battle with Ghost Dominator Tian, the mole might still be active!"</p><p></p><p>What Zi Yuan Xiao Lu said was not a big secret among those prodigies. </p><p></p><p>In fact, even the higher-ups knew there was a mole.</p><p></p><p>They just didn't know who it was.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, they might even be allowing it, to have more escape routes.</p><p></p><p>"Who's the mole?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but the mole will definitely pay attention to you, intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe senior brother, you just need to observe quietly. You might be able to discover who the mole is."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the second step of the plan should be revised to expose the mole!" Qi Yuan thought for a moment and decided to expose the mole first.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could even use the mole as bait.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, senior brother has a way to find the mole?" Zi Yuan Xiao Lu blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. When the time comes, I'll find Zi Yuan Da Xue, find some excuse to meet with the Yang Shen of our Black Magic Abyss, and ask. Then we'll know," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Blood Robe senior brother like this, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu was even more confused.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Blood Robe senior brother had some special skill, or possessed some secret method?</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe senior brother, do you want me to come along? I'm very curious," Zi Yuan Xiao Lu wanted to know exactly how Qi Yuan would expose the mole.</p><p></p><p>After all, even those ancestors couldn't find the mole.</p><p></p><p>"Sure, no problem," Qi Yuan patted his chest. "Alright, the second step of the plan is set. Let's move on to the third step, which we'll call 'The Hunting Moment'.</p><p></p><p>The fourth step will be called 'The Revival of the Human Emperor's Banner'."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu nodded, "Then shall we... write out the plan in more detail?"</p><p></p><p>"What details? Isn't it already very precise and detailed?" Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"...Is this the entire plan?" Zi Yuan Xiao Lu blinked, utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Just saying a few words counts as a plan?</p><p></p><p>In that case, couldn't she also make a plan to become a Supreme Being?</p><p></p><p>Step one, break through to Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Step two, comprehend the supreme truth and become a Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Step three, Blood Robe senior brother marries into the family.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I understand. You think this plan isn't detailed enough, lacking time and dates? For such major events, things can change in an instant. We can't control time, so it's better not to write it down," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu understood now. This was indeed the entire plan.</p><p></p><p>She stuck out her little tongue, "Xiao Lu understands now."</p><p></p><p>She felt a bit silly.</p><p></p><p>The plan to hunt Yang Shen was just for fun after all.</p><p></p><p>It's okay if it's a bit crude. Why did she take it so seriously?</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Lu, I know you can keep a secret. Don't leak this great plan we made today, understand?" Qi Yuan said seriously, "Oh, and Zi Yuan Da Xue is our team member, you can tell her."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Zi Yuan Xiao Lu nodded seriously, covering her mouth with her little hand.</p><p></p><p>"Go see Zi Yuan Da Xue. We'll start implementing the second step of the plan. Have her find an excuse for us to visit the Yang Shen Heavenly Venerable together," Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>As for the mole who leaked his whereabouts, he had already noted it down in his little book.</p><p></p><p>When the time was right, he would send the mole to meet real ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go find senior sister Da Xue right away!" Zi Yuan Xiao Lu hurried off.</p><p></p><p>About a day passed, and Qi Yuan's figure appeared on the street of the Demon Gate.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Zi Yuan Da Xue and Zi Yuan Xiao Lu, one tall and one short, holding steamer baskets in their hands, feeling quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want to use this method to visit the Yang Shen Heavenly Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this method good? I don't believe any Yang Shen Heavenly Venerable would refuse!" Zi Yuan Da Xue said proudly.</p><p></p><p>She opened the steamer basket wide, and immediately steam rose, filling the air with fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a closer look and saw... strange eggs in the steamer basket.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Magic Abyss prodigy Ice Sword laid ice eggs, which I, Zi Yuan Da Xue, happened to obtain! So, I cooked this rare item to filially offer to these Yang Shen Heavenly Venerables. How could they refuse?" Zi Yuan Da Xue said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered, "This is indeed quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>If someone said Ice Sword laid eggs, I'd have to go out and see what they look like too.</p><p></p><p>However, this plan isn't perfect. These are just ordinary eggs.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword has 'ice' in his name, so we should use ice eggs!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the eggs in the steamer basket turned into ice eggs.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, perfect," Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The crystal-clear eggs looked high-end and classy.</p><p></p><p>"Add some packaging, and it'll be the best gift."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he waved his hand again, and the steamer basket turned into a gift box.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Da Xue looked at Qi Yuan, blinking her eyes, "Your emotional intelligence is so high?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the difference between you and me," Qi Yuan said proudly. "Da Xue seeing me is like a mayfly seeing the blue sky!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu stood to the side, covering her mouth, silently feeling sorry for senior brother Ice Sword for a moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

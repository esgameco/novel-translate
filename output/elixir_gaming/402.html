        <h1>Chapter 402</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A brush moves.</p><p></p><p>The breath of life and death wanders at the tip of the brush. As it moves, black and gray, red and white alternate between the brush strokes.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter is very serious, painting with her life.</p><p></p><p>From the Jade Maiden, she has already learned that the Blood-Robed Sword God is no ordinary being.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden also knows a thing or two about what she is doing for the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden told her to do a good job, and said that the Blood-Robed Sword God should be refining a magical treasure related to the underworld.</p><p></p><p>But in the conversations between the strange painter, Qi Qi, and those powerful beings from the underworld, one could clearly sense the Blood-Robed Sword God's ambition.</p><p></p><p>It's not just about refining magical treasures.</p><p></p><p>But to truly build a mythical and legendary underworld.</p><p></p><p>When she first heard this, the Jade Maiden laughed speechlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Even those in the realm of Great Ultimate Principle wouldn't dare to claim they could reach the true underworld. It's just a legend."</p><p></p><p>After all, a Yang God Venerable in the realm of Great Ultimate Principle generally only controls one Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>But to build the underworld may require more than just one Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>Life, death, yin, yang, reincarnation... and so on, the Great Ultimate Principles needed are too many.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even gathering all the Ultimate Principle Venerables from the Nine Heavens wouldn't be enough to build the underworld.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter doesn't know that much, but she also understands that Qi Yuan is not just talking.</p><p></p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Brush in her hand trembles at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from the painting where the brush has just fallen, amidst the gloom, it seems as if sweet voices of little girls can be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Gate, nine out of ten don't return."</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Gate, yin and yang reversed, life and death in chaos, grandma comes without fear."</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's face changes slightly. She sees that on the Ghost Gate she has painted, in the hazy and indistinct atmosphere, many shadowy figures appear.</p><p></p><p>They are reciting nursery rhymes, their voices innocent, yet feeling gloomy and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>A sense of stimulation and fear slowly crawls up her spine. The strange painter doesn't know why, but she always feels that the eyes of those ghostly girls who suddenly appeared in her painting are all staring at her.</p><p></p><p>Even though some are walking, some are looking at the sky, some are sleeping, but everyone's eyes are looking at her.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a voice like thunder, sacred and majestic, speaks.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Gate, complete!"</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He stands within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, looking down at this world.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the Ghost Gate painted by the strange painter becomes substantial at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Those special beings like little dolls finally move their gaze away at this moment, all secretly looking at the majestic being of unknown boundaries in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's face tightens. She looks at the lifelike Ghost Gate, no, it is the Ghost Gate. She is extremely shaken in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She doesn't understand at all how she could actually manifest it in the world.</p><p></p><p>With such an expression, she continues to paint.</p><p></p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Brush moves in her hand, and scene after scene is born.</p><p></p><p>Countless gloomy auras, as well as things that cannot be seen, rush into the underworld at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, sitting in the underworld, squints his eyes, but sees nothing.</p><p></p><p>"My home has guests?"</p><p></p><p>The guests before him are unknown.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang God Venerables squint their eyes. Qi Qi also seems to sense something, but can't see anything at all.</p><p></p><p>"Yi ya... ah... yue!"</p><p></p><p>"Ha... ceng... ya..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listens carefully. His ears that can hear the sounds of the world finally hear some chaotic sounds.</p><p></p><p>These sounds are either shrill or like ghosts wailing and wolves howling.</p><p></p><p>He also hears crackling sounds, like maple twigs burning, sparks flying.</p><p></p><p>He also hears some whimpering, mixed with the sound of burning joss paper.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan is surprised: "Have dirty things come to my home?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi stands beside Qi Yuan, her eyes like divine swords, looking towards the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"What lowly beings are causing trouble here!"</p><p></p><p>The majesty and mystery of being the Empress Earth Deity who upholds heaven and emulates Houtu sweeps through at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The underworld in the Mountains and Seas Scroll shakes and is cleansed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even those dirty things seem to realize the power of Houtu at this moment, and what she represents.</p><p></p><p>"...Ka... beg..."</p><p></p><p>These dirty things no longer babble nonsense, but turn into a single voice, seemingly wanting to communicate with Qi Yuan and Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps separated by time, or perhaps separated by space, they can't be heard at all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression is calm, his voice tinged with helplessness: "It seems I have to be a Chinese teacher for once."</p><p></p><p>As he speaks, his clothes change, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses hangs on his nose bridge.</p><p></p><p>Behind him appears a blackboard, and a piece of chalk appears in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Little dirty things, repeat after me, a, o, e..."</p><p></p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Brush continues, and the dirty things become more and more numerous. Qi Yuan plays the role of a qualified Chinese teacher.</p><p></p><p>But halfway through teaching, he feels a bit guilty.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't have a teacher's qualification certificate. Does this count as illegal teaching? But then he thinks, he has a mental illness certificate, so it shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Continuous mountain ranges keep appearing, the rivers of the underworld are flowing, and the eighteen levels of hell and the Son of Heaven's Palace are rising one by one.</p><p></p><p>The strange painter's body trembles and shakes. She has been holding the brush for forty-four days, and the underworld is almost complete.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan puts down the chalk and pushes up his gold-rimmed glasses with his hand.</p><p></p><p>He speaks, his voice like an edict, majestic and sacred, not to be heard lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Little dirty things, have you learned? Can you tell me now why you've come to visit my home?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan can't see them, otherwise he would have to charge them for lodging.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the underworld falls silent. Qi Yuan no longer hears those ghost wails and wolf howls, or strange noises.</p><p></p><p>But in the underworld, there seems to be a white figure, distorted and illusory, not seeming substantial.</p><p></p><p>But one can see that the white figure seems to be bowing to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Murmurs also arise at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"No... soul, borrow... return..."</p><p></p><p>Saying these words seems to have exhausted all the energy of this white figure.</p><p></p><p>Those dirty things all become illusory at this moment, pouring into that white figure.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they condense into a stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>On the stone tablet is carved a single character: "Lost".</p><p></p><p>On the stone tablet, there are various eerie auras, mysterious and unknown, seemingly containing the ultimate principle of death.</p><p></p><p>[Tablet of the Lost, seems to have come from another world.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes can finally see useful information.</p><p></p><p>"So... the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences is a door that ran away from my home, and the Tablet of the Lost is also a tablet that ran away from my home?</p><p></p><p>Where's my well? Who carried it away?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scans around but sees nothing. He feels a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the overall structure of the underworld has also been outlined by the strange painter.</p><p></p><p>What's missing are just details and sacredness.</p><p></p><p>The sacredness and laws need to be bestowed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looks at the strange painter. The trembling strange painter's eyes are now bright and spirited.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, she is very satisfied with this painting.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the underworld, Qi Yuan's vast voice sounds again, like the voice of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost realm formed, mountains and rivers take shape."</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers formed in the central ghost region seem to have imprints falling upon them with the solemn sound.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary mountains transform into ghost mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Ghost King, Yu Lu and Shen Tu, govern Peach Stop Mountain and Ghost Gate."</p><p></p><p>"Southern Ghost King, governs Luofu Mountain, leads the ghosts of Qiang and Man."</p><p></p><p>"Western Ghost King, governs Pan Zhong Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"Northern Ghost King, governs Luofeng Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"Central Ghost King, governs Bao Du Mountain, controls the central ghost region!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's figure, the five directional Ghost Kings including Yu Lu and Shen Tu all appear.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were towering and imposing, inspiring awe. They bowed to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"We respectfully obey the Heavenly Lord's command!"</p><p></p><p>The Five Ghost Emperors transformed into five streams of light and headed towards the ghost realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not pause, his voice solemn and vast.</p><p></p><p>"Let Naihe be the bridge, Wangchuan the river, and Wangxiang the terrace!"</p><p></p><p>"Let the eighteen levels become hell!"</p><p></p><p>"The Son of Heaven's Hall shall judge yin and yang and determine reincarnation!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Yama Kings, return to your positions!"</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Emperor shall reside in the Son of Heaven's Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, enter hell!"</p><p></p><p>"Follow heaven's will and emulate Houtu, the sovereign earth deity, to oversee reincarnation!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, divine infants appeared one by one, transforming into underworld officials. They bowed to the Heavenly Lord, then turned into streams of light and entered the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's consciousness seemed to merge with the underworld, reincarnation becoming part of her.</p><p></p><p>The originally empty underworld, like a lifeless thing, now harbored many powerful auras.</p><p></p><p>Gloomy, deathly still, fire and heat, decay and loneliness...</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter watched this scene, his eyes filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on a certain "terrace".</p><p></p><p>This terrace was not the Wangxiang Terrace, but the Receiving Terrace.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Wangyue Continent, he had thought about reviving the Five Ancestors of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>The Receiving Terrace was the place of revival.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, it's still not possible."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, while the underworld was formed, it could not operate.</p><p></p><p>Receiving souls could not be done now.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the dead were too thoroughly dead.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze turned to the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>"Gate of the Underworld, return to your position!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the original Gate of Ten Thousand Differences trembled at this moment, countless changes occurring on it in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Gate of Ten Thousand Demons... Gate of Ten Thousand Devils... Gate of Ultimate Principles... Gate of Ten Thousand Spirits... Gate of Ten Thousand Mechanisms! Finally, it transformed into the Gate of the Underworld!</p><p></p><p>Gloomy, snow-white, as if the principles of yin and yang were flowing, seemingly leading to the endless hell.</p><p></p><p>Countless principles, countless information, countless unknowns, countless unknowables, at this moment entered Qi Yuan's underworld through the Gate of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Indescribable changes formed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It became the front door of Qi Yuan's home.</p><p></p><p>"Condense... Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly opened his mouth and swallowed towards the underworld.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the originally collected first energy of the immortal way, the purple energy, was also scattered at this moment, sprinkled in front of the Gate of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Purple is for purple energy!"</p><p></p><p>"Palace is for the underworld!"</p><p></p><p>"This is my Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's loud shout.</p><p></p><p>Inside his body, two original divine abilities constantly trembled.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red demon sword flew into the eighteen levels of hell at this moment, transforming into a demon prison.</p><p></p><p>The "forgetting" of the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra seemed to merge with Meng Po's soup, and also hide in the Wangchuan River.</p><p></p><p>Purple energy floated, full of vitality, like the purple of an immortal's blessed land.</p><p></p><p>Yin wind whistled, dark and terrifying, like the palace of the realm of the dead.</p><p></p><p>With this, the Purple Palace was formed!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the Receiving Terrace again.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he had refined the underworld into a Purple Palace, his eyes also held a hint of grimness in their depths.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Receiving Terrace, as if understanding something.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang coexist, life and death are in balance.</p><p></p><p>So, to revive the dead, one must erase the living."</p><p></p><p>But this erasure is different from killing.</p><p></p><p>"So, now it can only be considered a small underworld, and not everyone can be received.</p><p></p><p>Ah, Five Ancestors of the Five Elements, it seems you'll have to lie still for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>This underworld was currently much worse than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>For example, if he were to go to the Blue Star now, spend some time marking all living beings there.</p><p></p><p>Then, kill everyone on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on Blue Star would become a ghost, enter his underworld, and work for him for free.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted, he could also let the people of Blue Star reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>But... those who haven't been marked by the underworld, his underworld can't manage.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Five Ancestors of the Five Elements, and Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao from Wugui City, he can't receive them now.</p><p></p><p>So, this underworld is just a small underworld.</p><p></p><p>If it were a great underworld, that would be good. He could directly write the death of that person from Taihuang Palace in the book of life and death, wouldn't he then be invincible?</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just thinking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at his Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, purple energy permeates the entrance, the first energy of the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Purple energy, even Yang Shen Tian Zun covets it greatly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this purple energy, many Yang Shen Tian Zun would surely be tempted.</p><p></p><p>"However, this Gate of the Underworld... is a bit too grim. Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, change to the form of the Gate of Ultimate Principles!" Qi Yuan called out.</p><p></p><p>As if it could hear human speech, the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences really changed to the appearance of the Gate of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>On it, countless principles seemed to flow, ordinary people would be entranced just by looking at it once.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shen Tian Zun would want to rush in immediately after one look, to comprehend the principles within.</p><p></p><p>After all, principles are hard to understand.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ultimate Principles puts the principles right in front of you to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>No matter how poor one's comprehension is, surely they could understand something in a million years?</p><p></p><p>If really not possible, just stay at the Gate of Ultimate Principles to comprehend for endless ages, and come out invincible.</p><p></p><p>"It makes even me a bit tempted to go in."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he also had thoughts about whether he should go into the Gate of Ultimate Principles and spend a few hundred years, or tens of thousands of years, to comprehend a great principle. But thinking about it, he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>For other Yang Shen Tian Zun, the Gate of Ultimate Principles is the number one treasure for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As long as they get it, with enough time, they will surely attain a great principle.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it's too time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>With that time for comprehension, it's better to go play games to break through.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he can't waste any more time.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation atmosphere in the upper realm has deteriorated to this extent, he needs to go up to purify it.</p><p></p><p>However, the Gate of Ultimate Principles still has many uses for him.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, to isolate the mark of great calamity; secondly, to comprehend simply, to see if he can observe the flaws of other great principles.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to note is that the news of the Gate of Ultimate Principles cannot be revealed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Qi Yuan might be hated by all Yang Shen Tian Zun of the great principle realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gate of Ultimate Principles records all principles.</p><p></p><p>"Finally achieved the Purple Palace, the increase in strength... is okay."</p><p></p><p>"This time's superpower is actually... mouth?"</p><p></p><p>"It actually has a linkage with the ears!"</p><p></p><p>"This superpower came a bit late!"</p><p></p><p>"Why does it feel so useless."</p><p></p><p>This time, the talent he awakened was, when his ears hear some murmurs, he can activate his talent to actively converse with that person, but due to spatial reasons, there might be some distortion.</p><p></p><p>Also, when not linked with the ears, when he activates his talent, his speaking voice can be randomly transmitted to certain beings.</p><p></p><p>"Read and reply randomly?"</p><p></p><p>"Tree hole?"</p><p></p><p>"I've become a small speaker of all realms?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan immediately tried it out.</p><p></p><p>His right eyebrow didn't twitch.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so poor, kind people, who can lend me some money!"</p>

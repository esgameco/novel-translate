        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire grand city was in ruins, with broken walls and crumbling structures everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Within the city, only a scattered thousand demonic evils were wandering.</p><p></p><p>The white bones on the ground had no one to build graves for them.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whose souls were lingering here.</p><p></p><p>A month later, a large human army marched to this grand city again, and after a bloody battle, they captured the city.</p><p></p><p>The leading commander had a bloody scar on his face, making him look particularly eerie, as he drank with the other generals.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, the demonic army attacked again.</p><p></p><p>The grand city fell once more.</p><p></p><p>The great fire raged for two months, and then another large human army arrived.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, their fate was still complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Later, yet another human army came, only to meet the same tragic end.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Qi Yuan found himself on the city walls, and this city had not seen a human army for over a decade.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the white bones all around.</p><p></p><p>"Any soldiers who set foot in this city will have their lifespan countdown start, with no one able to survive more than ten days."</p><p></p><p>"Now, is my task... to guard this lone city?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood alone in the desolate city, looking up at the towering city walls, pockmarked and scarred.</p><p></p><p>A sense of vastness and desolation overcame him.</p><p></p><p>On the city walls, the words "City of No Return" were written.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself: "Level 45?"</p><p></p><p>In this game world, he had entered at level 45, unlike the first time when he was level 1.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan guessed that level 45 was similar to the late stage of foundation building.</p><p></p><p>The strength of his spiritual awareness in the Vast Celestial Realm corresponded to his level in the game.</p><p></p><p>"Level 45, not bad, I can now slay minor monsters." Qi Yuan's eyes lit up with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Slaying monsters would allow him to level up in the game, and this cultivation progress would also be reflected back in the real world, rapidly improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He enjoyed this feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Pity, I don't have a suitable weapon." Qi Yuan looked at himself, seeming to have entered alone.</p><p></p><p>But in a moment, he froze.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia?" </p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he found Xiao Jia's mark on his chest. Had Xiao Jia followed him into the game?</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia!" Qi Yuan called out.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Jia's figure appeared beside him, wearing a blood-red bridal gown, looking enchantingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>The timid Xiao Jia seemed disoriented by her surroundings, but when she saw Qi Yuan, she felt reassured and tightly gripped his arm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled gently: "In ancient times, scholars had ladies-in-waiting to keep them company while reading at night. Now I, Qi Yuan, have Xiao Jia to accompany me as I guard this lone city."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan felt the game had become more interesting.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the wandering demonic evils in the city noticed Qi Yuan and came rushing towards him with ferocious roars.</p><p></p><p>Tearing apart all humans was their instinct.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of hideous demonic evils, like all kinds of terrifying monsters, charged at Qi Yuan with their massive bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia!" Qi Yuan shouted.</p><p></p><p>Comrades in arms!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, crimson fireflies merged into Qi Yuan's body, and a blood-red armor covered him completely.</p><p></p><p>Sharp spikes gleamed with an eerie red light on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>His height grew to ten meters, becoming a terrifying blood-red monster.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and a broken sword fell into it.</p><p></p><p>The broken sword immediately grew larger and longer, covered in a blood-red glow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan bared his sharp teeth: "Little monsters, the time for hunting has begun again!"</p><p></p><p>He charged into the monster park like a heavy mech.</p><p></p><p>Those flesh-and-blood demonic evils were no match for him.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, dozens of demonic evils fell.</p><p></p><p>+40.</p><p>+20.</p><p>+10.</p><p>+35.</p><p></p><p>Endless experience poured in, and Qi Yuan became like a demonic god, slaughtering without end.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, it became a hellish inferno, and all demonic evils he encountered met only death.</p><p></p><p>In ten days, Qi Yuan single-handedly cleared the entire lone city.</p><p></p><p>Now, leaning against a half-collapsed wall, Qi Yuan panted heavily.</p><p></p><p>"The City of No Return is finally free of demonic evils."</p><p></p><p>All the demonic evils had been slaughtered by him alone.</p><p></p><p>His level had also risen to 49.</p><p></p><p>Leveling up four times in ten days, a very fast pace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a notification sound reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>[Successfully cleared the demonic evils, obtained 1 key fragment.]</p><p></p><p>[Begin guarding the City of No Return. The longer the guard time, the richer the rewards.]</p><p></p><p>[If demonic evils enter the City of No Return, the guard status will fail.]</p><p></p><p>Hearing these notifications, Qi Yuan felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Who says this world is not a game?"</p><p></p><p>"It is a game!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm playing a game!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his broken sword and embraced Xiao Jia, the two of them sitting on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Looking out, the yellow sands stretched endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fierce winds swept across the land, kicking up clouds of dust, occasionally revealing the rusted remnants of broken swords.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the young bride close as they gazed out at the vast desert landscape together.</p><p></p><p>At times, when the winds howled, he would stand in front of her to shield her.</p><p></p><p>At other times, under the enchanting night sky, he would dig a small pit for them to sleep in, nestled beneath the city walls.</p><p></p><p>Whenever demonic forces approached, he would sense their presence and slay them with his sword.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the next wave of monsters will attack the city."</p><p></p><p>On this day, Qi Yuan and the young bride sat upon the city walls, feeling a mix of anticipation and dread. </p><p></p><p>What if a crafty little creature managed to sneak into the city? That would render his guardian status ineffective.</p><p></p><p>But without any demonic incursions, he also couldn't grind for experience points.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's attention was drawn to two distant figures in tattered armor emerging from the desert.</p><p></p><p>In the distance...</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." Zhang Sheng gazed up at the towering city walls, his eyes glistening with emotion. "We've finally made it."</p><p></p><p>Beside Zhang Sheng, the one-armed Chen Jiao was deathly pale as he handed the water pouch to his companion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sheng, finish the water. Together, we'll reclaim Wuguicheng!"</p><p></p><p>That small water pouch contained the last of their supplies.</p><p></p><p>As reinforcements for Wuguicheng, the Songzi Battalion had numbered 1,723 soldiers, led by the renowned General Li Huan of the Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>Wuguicheng had been lost to the Great Xia for over a decade, one of the ten thousand and eight cities that had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, the ruler of the Great Xia, having exhausted the nation's resources, had summoned a force of graying veterans to retake Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, on the way, they had encountered the demonic horde, and only Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao had survived, awakening amidst the piles of corpses.</p><p></p><p>Grievously wounded, the two men had still pressed on to Wuguicheng, determined to plant the banner of the Great Xia upon its walls.</p><p></p><p>As long as the banner flew, it would mean that Wuguicheng still belonged to the Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the city would be considered completely lost, for any city occupied by demons for over a century would be forever beyond human control, unless it could be reclaimed and held for another century.</p><p></p><p>A daunting task, as those who marched on Wuguicheng had no retreat and even lacked supplies.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Xia, it was said that those who set out for Wuguicheng had but a month left to live.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the banner cannot fly there forever," Chen Jiao said, his face filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>He had come from a family of butchers, while Zhang Sheng, whose father was the local constable, could be considered a son of privilege.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng had always yearned for the life of a wandering knight, riding a spirited steed.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had defied his father's wishes and secretly enlisted, coming to this place.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at Wuguicheng, Zhang Sheng's face lit up with excitement. "Wuguicheng has been lost to the Great Xia for over a decade. Once we plant our banner on the walls, the people of the Great Xia will be stirred to action!"</p><p></p><p>Both men's wounds were grave, and blood trickled from the corners of their mouths as they spoke.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to rest alongside our valiant ancestors in this land is a life's fulfillment," Chen Jiao, though a butcher's son, had always been fond of eloquent speech.</p><p></p><p>"The only regret is that we cannot erect proper tombstones for them," Zhang Sheng said, drawing his sword, his expression hardening.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering Wuguicheng, they would face the onslaught of the demonic forces. Their fate was sealed, for even without the demons, their injuries would not allow them to survive more than ten days.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Sheng's eyes widened. "There's someone on the city walls!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao was also stunned, unable to believe what he was seeing. Wuguicheng had fallen over a decade ago - how could there be someone there?</p><p></p><p>Was it an illusion? Wasn't the city supposed to be overrun by demons? The two men exchanged a bewildered glance.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a closer look."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao quickened their pace towards Wuguicheng. The closer they got, the more astonished they became.</p><p></p><p>For the city was eerily quiet, with no demonic howls to be heard. This contradicted the information they had received.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't Wuguicheng be completely overrun by demons now? Yet there, on the city walls, sat a man in dark robes, seemingly holding a broken sword.</p><p></p><p>As they approached, his features became clearer.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Chen Jiao mustered the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>The man on the wall stirred and looked at the two. His voice was calm. "I am the guardian of Wuguicheng."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao and Zhang Sheng were stunned, overwhelmed by a surge of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that all these years, Wuguicheng had not completely fallen?</p><p></p><p>That there was still a citizen of the Great Xia, sitting alone on the wall, sword in hand, guarding the city?</p><p></p><p>"I am Zhang Sheng, a soldier of the Songzi Battalion of the Great Xia!"</p><p></p><p>"I am Chen Jiao, also a soldier of the Songzi Battalion of the Great Xia!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two men, his gaze thoughtful. "So you are the NPCs meant to guard this place."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

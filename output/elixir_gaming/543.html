        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, very difficult, extremely difficult." </p><p></p><p>The cultivation of these eight forging techniques was somewhat challenging for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Having lost the ability to see hidden information, the golden finger of being able to see, he naturally could not directly modify these eight forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if he was blind, as a great cultivator of the Purple Palace, his foundation was still there, and creating his own cultivation techniques was no problem.</p><p></p><p>But these eight forging techniques were different, the great Dao was simple, and even Qi Yuan found it difficult to modify them to be better.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this blind woman's identity is quite extraordinary," Qi Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the sixth heavenly realm of the immortal world, even if it was a divine law at the Yang God level, after going blind, he could just modify it as he wished.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can't take shortcuts, I have to study hard."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and decided not to be lazy, and used his own talent to diligently study the eight forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Mastering the metal technique... Mastering the wood technique... Mastering the thunder technique!"</p><p></p><p>After seven hours of hard work, Qi Yuan finally mastered all eight forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>After mastering them, he gained new insights when contemplating these eight forging techniques again.</p><p></p><p>"These eight forging techniques are indeed interconnected, to achieve fusion, mere mastery is not enough."</p><p></p><p>For these eight forging techniques, the levels of mastery are: mastery, proficiency, master, and grandmaster. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan would need to reach the grandmaster level before he could confidently attempt fusion.</p><p></p><p>"The blind master's lifelong pursuit is to become a divine-level master, or even an ancestral divine master, climbing even higher, to become like Zhao Gao... Ugh!"</p><p></p><p>Being blind was already difficult enough, Qi Yuan had no desire to lose another organ.</p><p></p><p>"The subsequent cultivation of the forging techniques requires practical application, I should go find the blind woman for materials."</p><p></p><p>His storage artifact had some materials, but very few divine-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>For forging, naturally using good materials would greatly speed up the progress.</p><p></p><p>"The cave entrance to the right, 700 meters, is her residence?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Qi Yuan headed towards the blind woman's place.</p><p></p><p>The terrain here was very complex, the place he was currently in was a dark cave, but every hundred meters or so there was sunlight shining in, and the cave walls seemed to be dotted with twinkling fireflies, which looked quite beautiful.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, being blind, could not see these.</p><p></p><p>"This path seems to be rarely walked, there's a lot of moss."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked the 700 meters carefully.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he stopped and softly called out, "Blind woman, are you here?"</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, a lazy voice came, "I'm here."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan could not see, he seemed to see a graceful woman reclining on the bed, her brows half-opened, as if she had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds came, mixed with some water sounds.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard the sound of footsteps on the grass.</p><p></p><p>"Have you decided which forging technique to learn?" the blind woman asked.</p><p></p><p>"I've decided, and I've already mastered them," Qi Yuan said, "It was too difficult, I've never had a cultivation method take me this long to master before."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was telling the truth. </p><p></p><p>When he could still see, even the most difficult techniques, after he modified them, could be quickly mastered and cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had to rely solely on his talent, without the help of his eyes. </p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, it was difficult!</p><p></p><p>A flash of cunning satisfaction appeared on the blind woman's cold face: "Your speed is comparable to Sheng Nü, which one did you choose?"</p><p></p><p>"I chose all eight, and after a night of hard practice, I finally mastered them all," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"All eight??"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman was silent for a few breaths before saying, "It seems you have worked very hard."</p><p></p><p>However, she then said, "How long have I been sleeping?"</p><p></p><p>In the Shen Wood Abyss, the blind woman continued her two-point-one-line lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>Either sleeping in her room or sitting on the swing, feeling the cool breeze.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Wood Abyss was vast, so she didn't wander around everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Her memory was poor, and she would often forget things.</p><p></p><p>Even if she was familiar with just one path, perhaps one day she would forget.</p><p></p><p>So she simply didn't accept new things.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had mastered the eight forging techniques, and she thought she had just been sleeping as usual for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"One night," Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Oh... It's morning now, time to eat."</p><p></p><p>The blind woman's footsteps came as she walked back into the house.</p><p></p><p>After about thirty breaths, she came out holding a wooden basket.</p><p></p><p>The basket contained some fruits and a wooden cup.</p><p></p><p>"Eat breakfast," she handed it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the fruit and ate, it was crisp and sweet.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time he had eaten this kind of fruit, it was really delicious.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was blind, otherwise he could have seen what kind of fruit it was and planted a tree himself.</p><p></p><p>"The materials are here, take them and go forge," the blind woman handed him another wooden basket.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I'll go back and forge." </p><p></p><p>Their exchange was not very lengthy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the materials and left.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman listened to Qi Yuan's footsteps, her expression as cold as the moon.</p><p></p><p>She stood there for a long time, then went outside.</p><p></p><p>She went back to her usual two-point-one-line routine, heading towards the swing.</p><p></p><p>The swing that Qi Yuan had previously disturbed was now restored to its original state, exactly the same as before.</p><p></p><p>The blind woman was unfazed, sitting on the swing.</p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze blew, her skirt fluttering, her bare feet cool and cold.</p><p></p><p>A lonely emotion appeared on the blind woman's beautiful pale face.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know how many times she had sat on this swing, sometimes for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>"Can I... have eyes?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she covered her own eyes, a pained expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"I... don't want his eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! An explosion sound rang out, and Qi Yuan became covered in soot.</p><p></p><p>"Failed again, the divine artifact... is it this difficult to forge?"</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had been constantly forging.</p><p></p><p>The talent of a blind master is very strong, and with Qi Yuan's own talent, it shouldn't be difficult to reach the divine level.</p><p></p><p>But he had underestimated the impact of blindness on forging.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a divine-level spirit soldier, being blind did not affect his ability to walk or eat, but forging was a technical skill.</p><p></p><p>For example, now he was blind, but if he went to the Blue Star, he could easily perform delicate surgery on patients.</p><p></p><p>But forging, especially divine artifacts, was an even more precise and complex task.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, it was like a blind doctor performing surgery on a patient.</p><p></p><p>"Failed?" a crisp voice came, a graceful figure standing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, failed," Qi Yuan shrugged, "Without eyes, forging is too difficult."</p><p></p><p>This role-playing was quite challenging.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still needed to work hard on his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In this game, his goal was to become an Yin God.</p><p></p><p>As an Yin God, he naturally needed to master the rules, know all things, and create the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... it sounded a bit like the third layer of the Yang God.</p><p></p><p>But that was just the Yang God's third layer plagiarizing Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>After all, he hadn't heard of the name of the Yang God's third layer before he had already set his own Yin God path.</p><p></p><p>At the very least... he had to be a creator god.</p><p></p><p>To be a creator, he needed to know all things.</p><p></p><p>The blind master was also a part of all things.</p><p></p><p>"The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body are the five roots of a person, losing one, the five roots are not complete, losing..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To lose five, is to lose everything." The blind woman said calmly.</p><p></p><p>A unique floral fragrance emanated from her, a light and refreshing scent that was not cloying, very pleasant and soothing to the heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>"If I lose all five, won't I turn into a stone?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"You are missing one thing, otherwise, even without eyes, you can still forge weapons."</p><p></p><p>"What am I missing?"</p><p></p><p>"You are missing the heart's eye."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Is there such a way to insult someone? Treating him as a gentle and rule-abiding person! If she continues to speak this way, madam, don't turn back, I'm actually your husband!</p><p></p><p>After all, as two blind people, whatever happens, if no sound is made, who knows who is who?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan was just randomly thinking, even though the other party said he was missing the heart's eye, he was not so petty, and would not degrade himself or harm her because of this.</p><p></p><p>This heart's eye might be different from his understanding, probably similar to the celestial eye.</p><p></p><p>"Use your heart to see the world, to understand the world, and you will find that this world... may be different from what your eyes see.</p><p></p><p>Your eyes may deceive you, but your heart will not." The blind woman said.</p><p></p><p>"My eyes will not deceive me." Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he kept his distance from the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>The fragrance from her body was very pleasant, and he couldn't help but smell it a few more times.</p><p></p><p>He must keep his distance, after all, she is a married woman.</p><p></p><p>As a single man and woman, if they were to get carried away, it would be too unethical.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to awaken your heart's eye?" The blind woman asked.</p><p></p><p>"I have a heart's eye... but I can also try to awaken it, how do I do it?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has reached a bottleneck in forging weapons, he needs to find another path.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>The blind woman said, walking stealthily out.</p><p></p><p>The cave where Qi Yuan lived, she rarely came here.</p><p></p><p>Even if she came, her memory was hazy, and she might forget, not being familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the blind woman stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Look up at the sky."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up, gazing at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The black and red in his vision seemed to have a faint glimmer of light at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Like a glowing grain of rice.</p><p></p><p>"This is the exit of the Shenmu Abyss, from here you can reach the Shenmu Ravine.</p><p></p><p>If you observe this place every day, with a bit of luck, perhaps in a few hundred years, you can awaken your own heart's eye."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, then I'll try to gain another heart's eye." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"I'll stay here from now on." Qi Yuan decided, staying here to forge weapons.</p><p></p><p>Day and night, he will observe the exit in the sky, and see when he can awaken the heart's eye.</p><p></p><p>As the days passed, Qi Yuan's eight-door forging technique became proficient.</p><p></p><p>However, regarding the awakening of the heart's eye, his progress was still very slow.</p><p></p><p>"It's too far away, I can't even see the light of that grain of rice clearly, should I build a ladder to climb up there?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He reckoned that being too far away, the realization of the heart's eye would be very slow.</p><p></p><p>If he built a ladder, not only could he gain insight into the heart's eye, but he could also build a path to leave the Shenmu Abyss and go to the Shenmu Ravine.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't stay in the Shenmu Abyss forever, right?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The palace of white jade and glass, hidden in the mist.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Tiao."</p><p></p><p>A faint voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>A man in phoenix robes appeared, his handsome features cold and aloof, with a sword on his back.</p><p></p><p>"I pay my respects to the Weak Xie Myth."</p><p></p><p>Feng Tiao bowed, his expression still cold.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mandate has reappeared in the Qingshan Realm, you must go and swiftly slay it." The Weak Xie Myth spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>"Carry the Nine Lives and go." The Weak Xie Myth commanded again.</p><p></p><p>A trace of pride flashed in Feng Tiao's eyes: "My original form is the Yin God Feng Hou, ranked among the top three in the Stepping the Heavens Five Steps of the current era. A mere Heavenly Mandate, why do I need to carry the Nine Lives? One life is enough!"</p><p></p><p>He is a being, created based on the Feng Hou prototype.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, in the current era, all those who can rank among the top three in the Stepping the Heavens Five Steps are powerful Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>He has his own pride.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing a Myth, he can still escape.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Awakening Assembly is paying attention to the Qingshan Realm, there may be an Ancestral God, so carry a few more lives, this mission must be completed." The Weak Xie Myth's voice was firm.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Feng Tiao no longer refused.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral God is the Yang God, the gap between Yang and Yin Gods is too great.</p><p></p><p>Even though his prototype is among the top three in the current era's Stepping the Heavens Five Steps, he is no match for the Yang God.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and the God Arrival created by Sheng Nü... has revived again, its combat power is quite interesting, it has slain seven gods single-handedly.</p><p>It is now known as Qi Yuan, and should be in the Shenmu Ravine, you should also deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"It's still alive?" Feng Tiao's eyes showed some surprise, "It seems its luck is quite good, but this time, I, the Master, will personally take action, its luck may have run out."</p><p></p><p>He had known about this Heavenly Mandate called God Arrival before.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to slash it to pieces with a single sword.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, the relationship between the Light Glory Assembly and the Human Awakening Assembly was in a "honeymoon period", so he could not act personally, and used the Dark Light Spirit to scheme.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the other party is still alive.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go quickly and return, there are other Heavenly Mandate bearers in other worlds that you need to go and slay as well." The Weak Xie Myth spoke.</p><p></p><p>In this nascent universe, the power of the Light Glory Assembly is strong, but the Human Awakening Assembly is not weak either.</p><p>Moreover, the universe behind the Light Glory Assembly will not always invest resources in them.</p><p>They need to be a bit more frugal.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Without further hesitation, Feng Tiao's figure disappeared from the white jade and glass palace.</p><p></p><p>The vast palace was left with only the Weak Xie Myth.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, the Heavenly Origin of this realm has not attracted the attention of the gods, and has evolved into fragments of the Light Wondrous Treasure.</p><p>These three hundred thousand Artifact Masters... have died in vain."</p><p></p><p>The Weak Xie Myth sighed with some regret.</p><p></p><p>His father is a being from the Radiant Light Universe, and his mother is a being from the nascent form of this universe.</p><p>Although the Light Glory Assembly and the Human Awakening Assembly have conflicting ideologies, they both seek to protect this universe and prevent the nascent universe from being devoured by the Dark Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the tragic deaths of the three hundred thousand Artifact Masters in the Qingshan Realm without forging the fragments of the Light Wondrous Treasure, he felt disappointed and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a matter of affinity, the fragments of the Light Wondrous Treasure... how easy is it to forge them?"</p><p></p><p>There are many worlds similar to the Qingshan Realm, the worlds occupied by the Light Glory Assembly, and many are secretly forging fragments of the Light Wondrous Treasure.</p><p>Unfortunately, those who are awakened by the gods to the light are few.</p><p>As for the Human Awakening Assembly's Human Awakening Light, the probability is even lower.</p><p></p><p>Seeing tens of thousands of Artifact Masters die in anonymity is something the Weak Xie Myth has witnessed too many times.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Shenmu Ravine.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Cai Bai fluttered her wings, her face filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard, it seems there are sounds coming from below us."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan was soaking in the hot spring, her body only wrapped in a bandeau.</p><p></p><p>Although the Insect Maiden Cai Bai is also female, she still felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>She closed her eyes and listened carefully: "Indeed... there are sounds."</p><p></p><p>"Strange, in the Shenmu Ravine, apart from us two, there are no other living beings, how can there be sounds?" The Insect Maiden Cai Bai pondered, furrowing her brows.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lit up: "Could it be the sounds from the Shenmu Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Shenmu Abyss is mysterious, she had been searching for it for a long time.</p><p>Could it be under this hot spring?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

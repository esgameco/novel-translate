        <h1>Chapter 300</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as Zero One finished the video, it came out and sat upright on the living room sofa, seemingly dozing off.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Xie Xinsu secretly glanced at Zero One, her mind relaxed. </p><p></p><p>In front of the robot, she didn't hide her peculiarities at all, such as sitting in meditation to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The stupid robots of this world didn't understand what this was at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if they saw it, they wouldn't record it or make associations.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy here is so rich, there must be an ancient magical treasure present!"</p><p></p><p>Her pink nose twitched, wanting to find the source of the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"When they're asleep, I need to go look for where the treasure is! Such an unclaimed magical item is surely a heaven-sent opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Could this be considered the end of her suffering and the start of sweetness? After enduring so much hardship, it was time for her to enjoy herself a bit.</p><p></p><p>She continued to sit in meditation and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>However, although the spiritual energy was abundant, her cultivation progress was worryingly slow. </p><p></p><p>She quickly discovered this problem.</p><p></p><p>"A cat's body is ultimately not suitable for the immortal cultivation methods I learned before..."</p><p></p><p>The immortal cultivation method she had learned was a grand and righteous path.</p><p></p><p>However, it was suitable for human cultivators to practice.</p><p></p><p>She had never mastered immortal methods suitable for beast cultivators before.</p><p></p><p>Now as she tried to cultivate, it felt strange.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about it, just keep cultivating. As long as there are no problems, keep going!"</p><p></p><p>All immortal methods lead to the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even if some small issues arose, it wasn't a big deal.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the night grew darker.</p><p></p><p>The entire Military Security neighborhood, except for a few street lamps emitting an orange glow, appeared especially gloomy and quiet.</p><p></p><p>The entire Arching Star, viewed from space, looked like a large ball shrouded in mist.</p><p></p><p>Above this mist, two distinctly different types of fog were merging... devouring each other.</p><p></p><p>In the living room, the dozing Zero One suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't sleep.</p><p></p><p>Especially after posting the video.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, it had to go check if anyone had commented on the video it posted.</p><p></p><p>It opened the video and looked at the red notification dots, unable to resist clicking in.</p><p></p><p>A cat cooking and meditating to cultivate immortality - such an interesting video easily gained traffic support.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just a few hours after posting, there were already hundreds of comments.</p><p></p><p>"Can I come to your house to watch the cat cook?"</p><p></p><p>"I stole the video and sent it to my crush, inviting her to come to my place to watch a cat cook."</p><p></p><p>"It's 4 AM now, only three more hours until I have to get up for work."</p><p></p><p>"Can an expert tell me if this video is real or synthesized? How can a cat cook, and what's with the meditation?"</p><p></p><p>"As we all know, videos can't be faked, so this must be real."</p><p></p><p>"Cats are very smart, sometimes smarter than people. It's normal for them to be able to cook!"</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>The video comments were varied.</p><p></p><p>Most were saying how cute and clever the cat was.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some people also said the video was synthesized.</p><p></p><p>After all, a cat cooking... was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>In this world, cats were cats. It was already amazing if they could understand human commands, let alone cook.</p><p></p><p>How could an ordinary cat possibly cook?</p><p></p><p>Zero One looked at these comments, and ripples stirred in its calm electronic heart.</p><p></p><p>It posted a comment in the comment section to clarify:</p><p></p><p>"Video is real footage, not synthesized."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it had gained over a hundred new followers, Zero One felt an inexplicable sense of joy arise in its heart.</p><p></p><p>It glanced at the now sleeping Xie Xinsu, thinking about what to film tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu lay limp on the sofa, feeling very aggrieved in her cat heart.</p><p></p><p>This robot wasn't human at all! It had been tormenting her these past few days.</p><p></p><p>At first, just performing cooking was fine, but later it made her perform with nunchucks.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, her delicate body couldn't even grip the nunchucks steadily, so the performance was... quite miserable.</p><p></p><p>This robot really wasn't human, taking such endless delight in this.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu felt like a performing animal.</p><p></p><p>Especially when she saw Zero One showing off the video's view count in front of her, she really wanted to leave a comment:</p><p></p><p>"Involved party here, refuse animal performances!"</p><p></p><p>But she had no phone.</p><p></p><p>She lay on the sofa, feeling that cat life was bleak.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that she could cultivate, she perked up again.</p><p></p><p>When her cultivation succeeded, she would definitely force this robot to cook, perform with nunchucks, take baths, and then film videos.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, she rallied her spirits to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... the spiritual energy has become even richer, that magical treasure... smells so good."</p><p></p><p>She had a intoxicated expression, looking just like a white cat eating corn, bewitched.</p><p></p><p>Regarding that treasure, Xie Xinsu's original plan was to sneak in and steal it when Qi Yuan wasn't around.</p><p></p><p>But that hateful robot kept watching her and making her film videos, so she had no chance to get close, and hadn't even been able to enter Qi Yuan's room.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan in the room opened his eyes, a smile appearing in them.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally reached Foundation Establishment... No need to fear flying on planes anymore."</p><p></p><p>After more than a month in this world, he had finally reached Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, unlike the previous Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, this time it was very simple. Qi Yuan casually had Wild Revelry find some mutated sea monsters, refined these mutated sea monsters into Foundation Establishment spirit objects, and used them to establish his foundation.</p><p></p><p>After Foundation Establishment, Qi Yuan's strength increased greatly. Even if problems occurred while flying, he could fall from the plane without worrying about the risk of perishing.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately... this curse is still too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even with Foundation Establishment, I've only increased my lifespan by a few years, unable to resolve the curse."</p><p></p><p>The curse on his body was somewhat terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a premonition that he likely wouldn't be able to resolve it until reaching the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>This was quite extreme.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the image of that featherless bird he had seen before kept appearing.</p><p></p><p>That bird's status must have been very high.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he, as a mortal back then, become cursed with death in a year just from seeing that bird in his mind?</p><p></p><p>"However... if I participate in the martial arts tournament now... I should be able to dominate, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The curse had been suppressing his strength all along.</p><p></p><p>But now he was a genuine Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his martial arts cultivation had progressed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The "Bright Martial Resonance Fist" had already reached the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>Before the martial arts tournament began, he was confident he could reach the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>And then... break through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He looked forward to seeing the world after breaking through the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a message notification on his phone interrupted Qi Yuan's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He opened the message and found it was a video.</p><p></p><p>In the video, a cat was using nunchucks, performing quite impressively and interestingly.</p><p></p><p>The video was sent by his old classmate Li Yan.</p><p></p><p>Below the video were a few messages.</p><p></p><p>"Is this your account?"</p><p></p><p>"I came across this video and it looked familiar."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the decor of your home?"</p><p></p><p>"You got a new cat? It's pretty funny. How did you film this video?"</p><p></p><p>"So envious, 100,000 followers. Remember to help me out if you get famous!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan seemed quite excited in her messages.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these messages and replied casually.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't take it, my robot took it."</p><p></p><p>"The cat is a silly cat I picked up on the street."</p><p></p><p>"It can't just eat and drink for free at my place, it definitely has to work to earn money."</p><p></p><p>"So, I had the robot Zero One take videos of it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sent several messages in quick succession.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan's reply came quickly.</p><p></p><p>"So it was actually taken by a robot, and the cat is real, the video isn't synthesized. Your cat is really amazing! Ah, it's a pity I'm away on a business trip, otherwise I'd definitely come over to see that cat you're raising. It's too incredible.</p><p></p><p>Damn capitalists, working us to death every day. </p><p></p><p>If only I had a cat like that, taking a few videos every day, it might become a big internet celebrity and I wouldn't have to work anymore."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of envy in Li Yan's words.</p><p></p><p>After all, she could already envision that with this cat, Qi Yuan might even achieve financial freedom.</p><p></p><p>This left her with rather complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>It felt like a poor student who had been advised to drop out suddenly getting into a top university at another school.</p><p></p><p>"You're absolutely right, working is impossible, I'll never work in this life, playing games is better."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan agreed with Li Yan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Next time Wang Xu and I will come visit you and see the cat.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, how did the blind date go last time? I heard Cui Fan was arrested, did you know? The blind date he set up might not be reliable."</p><p></p><p>Originally Li Yan didn't want to say these things.</p><p></p><p>But seeing that Qi Yuan was about to make big money, which would probably benefit that blind date match, she felt a bit unbalanced again.</p><p></p><p>"It was okay, I even borrowed quite a bit of money from her."</p><p></p><p>After replying to these messages, Qi Yuan thought of that young woman in tight clothes.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had money, he was also planning to pay her back.</p><p></p><p>But... he couldn't find her.</p><p></p><p>Given Qi Yuan's style, in this situation he would definitely try to find the person and pay them back.</p><p></p><p>But now he had a certificate of mental illness, and mentally ill people not paying back debts... seems reasonable, right? He turned off his phone and looked towards a pile of items in a box not far away.</p><p></p><p>"And this pile of leftover foundation-building spirit materials... the smell is too strong, it's polluting the air."</p><p></p><p>Using mutant sea monster meat to refine foundation-building spirit materials had also produced a pile of garbage.</p><p></p><p>The smells from this garbage were strange and varied, unpleasant to smell.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One, come here and throw this garbage in the trash can."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan called out.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the robot Zero One pushed open the door and, following Qi Yuan's instructions, carried away the box full of garbage.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu also ran in at this time, and when she saw the things in the box, her eyes went wide.</p><p></p><p>She could tell at a glance that the things in the box... were all foundation-building spirit materials.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their rank was not low.</p><p></p><p>According to the classifications in their world, many of the foundation-building spirit materials before her eyes had reached superior grade.</p><p></p><p>Several of them had even reached first grade.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that when Xie Xinsu originally built her foundation, she had only used second-grade foundation-building spirit materials.</p><p></p><p>Here there was actually a pile of first-grade materials, how could she not be envious.</p><p></p><p>If all these foundation-building spirit materials were taken to Xuantian Sect, it would significantly increase the sect's strength.</p><p></p><p>Where did this Qi Yuan get so many treasures from?</p><p></p><p>She was envious, but even more so anxious, with a feeling of exasperation.</p><p></p><p>Because what did she hear! This ignorant and cold-hearted man actually treated these foundation-building spirit materials as garbage, wanting to throw them in the trash can.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow!" Xie Xinsu anxiously rolled over, wanting to stop Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at her, seeming to see through her intention to stop him: "The smell of this garbage is too unpleasant, keeping it here pollutes the air. Zero One, quickly throw it outside."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly issued the order.</p><p></p><p>Zero One carried the box, ignoring Xie Xinsu's meowing, and left the room.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu stayed in the living room, her eyes blank and full of heartache.</p><p></p><p>This dog of an owner... doesn't know treasure!</p><p></p><p>How was the smell of these foundation-building spirit materials unpleasant? They clearly emitted the wonderful aroma of the immortal dao.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was just a cat, and a cat that was bullied mercilessly by the robot at that.</p><p></p><p>And the owner... also had a certificate of mental illness, she knew communication would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>She decided to add a few more words to the prefix for the dog owner.</p><p></p><p>Ignorant, unappreciative, cold-hearted man.</p><p></p><p>She harbored resentment, as if her own treasures had been ruined by an ignorant boor, feeling extremely distressed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the neighboring house, a group of people had arrived at Yang Shan's room.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was now full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He recognized some of the people who had come.</p><p></p><p>The one he recognized was the son of the number one figure in their military district.</p><p></p><p>That kind of second generation was not from the same world as Yang Shan at all.</p><p></p><p>But now, that second generation figure was like a mere accompaniment in front of an ordinary-looking man.</p><p></p><p>That ordinary-looking man was clearly the leader of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>This left Yang Shan quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... he was also from a great family background?</p><p></p><p>"So... he's been practicing martial arts all this time?"</p><p></p><p>The ordinary-looking man looked at Yang Shan, his gaze calm, appearing quite refined.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... he's been practicing martial arts constantly. His martial arts talent... is the strongest I've ever seen, unparalleled. He may even have the potential to break through the limits of martial artists!" When mentioning this, Yang Shan's eyes held a hint of fanatical light.</p><p></p><p>That was the limit of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Once broken through, it would be enough to go down in history.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know the intentions of this group, but having received orders from above, he could only disclose the information about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he vaguely mentioned Qi Yuan's importance to martial arts, just in case these people wanted to do something to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was also puzzled in his heart - why did this group come to ask him for information about Qi Yuan? Could it be related to Qi Yuan's parents?</p><p></p><p>"Martial artist... his choice is interesting!" At this point, the second generation man smiled, with a hint of mockery in his smile. "Brother-in-law, I don't think there's any need for cooperation. He... it's only been a year."</p><p></p><p>These cryptic words left Yang Shan quite confused.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary-looking man Luo Ping pondered for a while, and finally said: "You're right. If he were like me, he wouldn't have chosen the path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Even if spiritual energy resurges in ten years, and martial arts simply revive somewhat.</p><p></p><p>But... that's about it. Compared to the immortal dao, the gap is too great.</p><p></p><p>It seems Qi Yuan doesn't have memories of the next ten years, just one year, which doesn't count for much.</p><p></p><p>As a restarter, after returning to the present, Luo Ping had made contact and communicated with a major family of the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>He had also, as agreed in his previous life, married that family's precious daughter, the little princess of the Two Seas region.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that in his previous life, such a woman was completely out of his reach, he didn't even have a chance to meet her.</p><p></p><p>In this life, however, she could moan coquettishly beneath him.</p><p></p><p>This is opportunity, the opportunity of a restarter.</p><p></p><p>He was also using his information advantage to seek various benefits and fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the greatest fortuitous resource was... immortal destiny.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had thought about meeting Qi Yuan, to see if there was any other useful information here.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan died just a year later, knowing no useful information at all. Even ten years later, the Seven Martial Stars families hadn't been able to contact him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have foolishly taken the path of martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he's not a good choice for cooperation... but we can meet him." Luo Ping said this.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

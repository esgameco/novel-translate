        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every sword strike was perfectly executed.</p><p></p><p>When attacking, he did not use even a sliver of divine power.</p><p></p><p>The timing of his attacks was also perfectly controlled, not giving the five divine generals any opportunity to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" The Fifth Extraordinary was furious with impotence.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, his divine power far surpassed Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>Among the five divine generals surrounding him, each one's divine power individually exceeded Qi Yuan's, yet facing Qi Yuan's attacks, they felt helpless and constrained.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, they were completely unable to injure Qi Yuan, only able to passively endure the blows.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>A sword strike fell, breaking the old man's arm, his eyes bulging with rage, his entire divine power surging as he attacked frantically.</p><p></p><p>As long as a single strike landed on Qi Yuan, it would undoubtedly inflict significant injury on him.</p><p></p><p>But just short, just short, every time he traded injury for injury, it was always just short.</p><p></p><p>"His martial arts are peerless!" the old man said grudgingly.</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, our defeat is certain!" The King of Distant Peace was already considering fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Now, in less than ten breaths of time, each of them had sustained injuries.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Qi Yuan remained unharmed, his offensive growing increasingly fierce.</p><p></p><p>These divine-level imperial guards, when had they ever been bullied like this before?</p><p></p><p>Even at the celestial level, each of them was considered an outstanding expert, their skills honed to the peak, able to easily defeat their peers when challenging beyond their level.</p><p></p><p>After entering the divine realm, they rarely trained their techniques anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because divine power alone was enough to sweep away everything.</p><p></p><p>As long as their divine power was strong enough, they would be stronger.</p><p></p><p>Yet who would have thought that today there would be someone capable of outmaneuvering them in skill, not just suppressing them, but completely crushing them, on an entirely different level.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, save me, I can't hold on!" one of the old men cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attacks were too fierce, he was completely unable to resist, and in just a few breaths, he was covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>In a few more breaths, he might perish.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Liu Sheng, who had been preparing to come to their aid, stopped in his tracks, a look of horror in his eyes: "Without the Godly Presence, he is still this strong?"</p><p></p><p>After all, he had always felt that Qi Yuan's reliance was the Godly Presence.</p><p></p><p>With the Godly Presence, he could dominate the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet who knew that after the Godly Presence was corrupted and its divine power dissipated, he would become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Godly Presence... seemed to have been a constraint.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the old man let out a piercing scream.</p><p></p><p>Of the five divine-level imperial guards present, ultimately none of them dared to sacrifice themselves to stop Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was resentful.</p><p></p><p>If only someone had the courage to decisively block Qi Yuan, he might have only sustained minor injuries, instead of meeting this demise! The expressions of the other four divine-level imperial guards changed.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Zhiqi has actually died!"</p><p></p><p>"King of Distant Peace, you were closest just now, why didn't you intervene?"</p><p></p><p>"What do we do, he's not our match?"</p><p></p><p>These divine-level imperial guards were both shocked and anxious, descending into internal strife.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Fifth Extraordinary's expression was particularly grim.</p><p></p><p>The outsider had told him that in this battle, he would be victorious, and Raksha would prosper for generations, yet now he found himself in a precarious situation.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, he had no time to ponder further.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, how about we cease hostilities here? The Godly Presence has fallen, and if we continue fighting, we'll only end up benefiting Feng Guo. Why don't you accept my offer to be appointed as the National Preceptor, second only to the emperor?" the Fifth Extraordinary gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"Such a wonderful offer, who would have thought?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary was delighted, thinking Qi Yuan had agreed.</p><p></p><p>"You dream too beautifully. Even if I were your son, I would find you disgusting for not bathing and being so old." Qi Yuan's attacks did not let up.</p><p></p><p>This Fifth Extraordinary didn't even qualify to be his son.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary's face darkened, roaring in fury: "You're forcing my hand!"</p><p></p><p>In this state, he seemed to have another trump card.</p><p></p><p>The remaining few divine generals, all had hopeful expressions on their faces, hoping the Fifth Extraordinary would unleash something.</p><p></p><p>However, what they heard next was:</p><p></p><p>"Fake son, don't run!"</p><p></p><p>Only to see the Fifth Extraordinary directly fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The other divine-level imperial guards, seeing this, did not hesitate, scattering in all directions to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Fake sons, don't run!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll randomly select one lucky audience member... it's you, King of Distant Peace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's speed suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>The drones in the sky also scattered in all directions, chasing after the other divine-level imperial guards.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pursued the King of Distant Peace.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique! The King of Distant Peace's eyes bulged with terror.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>He exerted his full divine power, trying to counterattack before his death.</p><p></p><p>But against Qi Yuan, who had just slain a divine-level imperial guard and risen in level, his counterattack was utterly meaningless.</p><p></p><p>A sword strike fell, and the King of Distant Peace perished!</p><p></p><p>"This is... a hunt."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Qi Yuan was no longer the Godly Presence, he was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He followed the drones in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng was inwardly shaken: "How can a person be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing a divine-level imperial guard fleeing towards him, he quickly soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, this old man will assist you!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Slay!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The hunt continued, and death spread.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the divine-level imperial guards were slain.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, even those divine-level imperial guards who were reincarnations of celestial gods were no match, let alone these ordinary divine-level ones.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Qi Yuan slew all the divine-level imperial guards one by one.</p><p></p><p>As for the Fifth Extraordinary, he too was slain by Qi Yuan in the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial treasury, the Fifth Extraordinary even brought out an item that could activate a divine domain, originally confident in slaying Qi Yuan with this trump card.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, even with his trump card revealed, he too was just a clown, slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With the Fifth Extraordinary's fall, many celestial-level and even earth-level imperial guards drew their swords against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Any country would not lack those willing to sacrifice themselves and perish alongside him.</p><p></p><p>As a lawful and righteous person, Qi Yuan naturally indulged them.</p><p></p><p>This day would be recorded in the annals of Raksha.</p><p></p><p>The Godly Presence shattered, the seven divine generals fell, the imperial power of Raksha collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The moon was bright, the stars sparse.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the roof of the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>The imperial palace had been in turmoil earlier today.</p><p></p><p>The death of the Fifth Extraordinary had dealt a huge blow to the current system.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, Liu Sheng intervened, stabilizing the situation.</p><p></p><p>The capital city now maintained a fragile balance.</p><p></p><p>"99%."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan surveyed the capital, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>With the Fifth Extraordinary's fall, the name of the Godly Presence had also spread throughout the land.</p><p></p><p>But the performance rating was stuck at 99%.</p><p></p><p>Reaching perfection and unlocking the next task required only 1% more.</p><p></p><p>But it would not increase further.</p><p></p><p>Just then, several figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>The figures of Liu Sheng, Liu Chuwinter, and the Dowager Huan Sha emerged.</p><p></p><p>Dowager Huan Sha's eyes held a look of sorrow: "The Godly Presence... is destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>Today, seeing the Godly Presence consume all the poisonous rain for the sake of the city's people, her heart ached.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when the poisonous rain appeared, she had already had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>The Arbiter God she revered and admired would swallow the poisonous rain for the sake of the city's people.</p><p></p><p>But... at that time, she had inexplicably harbored a selfish wish, hoping the Arbiter God would be a little more selfish.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine visitation has arrived, but she has chosen to drink the poisonous rain instead of accepting it.</p><p></p><p>Now, the divine visitation has been destroyed, leaving her in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The most painful thing in this world is to ignite hope, only to watch it be extinguished before your eyes.</p><p></p><p>"He... has been destroyed," Qi Yuan said calmly, "but not quite."</p><p></p><p>These words were rather cryptic.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng eyed Qi Yuan, and a terrifying thought arose in his heart: "Brother Qi, are you the divine visitation?"</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a young divine-level armament master in this world? If Qi Yuan was indeed the divine visitation, and one with it, then it would make sense.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, due to a special opportunity, the national guardian divine visitation had taken on a human form, with its own thoughts and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Arbiter God?" Liu Chuwinter's eyes were filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The old woman Huan Sha's eyes shone with joy.</p><p></p><p>The Arbiter God has not fallen?</p><p></p><p>"Young master is a god descended to the mortal realm. Whether he is the divine visitation or not, what does it matter?" Chen Kang answered smugly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "That's not entirely wrong. I can be the divine visitation, but the divine visitation is not me."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter looked at Qi Yuan, her heart surging with turbulent waves. She had joy on her face, but also a hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>The divine visitation... has become human, with human emotions and thoughts. Is he still the impartial and selfless divine visitation?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Liu Chuwinter.</p><p></p><p>"Someone like you may sometimes be quite annoying to others, but at times, you can also be admired.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter, can you do me a favor?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had seen many people, but idealists as pure as Liu Chuwinter were rare.</p><p></p><p>Even if he saw them, such people generally didn't live well and were often called brainless.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Qi, please tell me." Liu Chuwinter was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng quickly gave his granddaughter a meaningful look, afraid that Liu Chuwinter might say the wrong thing.</p><p></p><p>However, it was like talking to a cow, as Liu Chuwinter did not understand his intention.</p><p></p><p>He could only apologize, "Chuwinter is naive, if she has offended brother Qi in her words, please do not blame her!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "I do have a certain magnanimity."</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had killed many people and often got angry because of Bai Yueguang's words, he still had a basic sense of magnanimity.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think the divine visitation's wish is?" Qi Yuan looked at Liu Chuwinter and asked.</p><p></p><p>Now, to fully play the role of the divine visitation, he was missing the last 1%. </p><p></p><p>What was missing, Qi Yuan had a vague guess, but he dared not confirm it.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter paused for a moment, her gaze becoming sharp, and she said loudly, "Wielding the light, driving away the darkness; if there is any injustice, call upon me, the divine visitation!</p><p></p><p>This is the divine utterance of the Arbiter God, and naturally, it is also His aspiration.</p><p></p><p>He hopes to eliminate all injustice in this world, so that everyone is equal, just and fair!"</p><p></p><p>This was also Liu Chuwinter's wish.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>Probably, except for some special races, what Liu Chuwinter said would be impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>"This may be difficult to realize," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He also could not stay in the Luosha Kingdom or the Qingshan Realm forever.</p><p></p><p>To realize these... unless he used the Great Oblivion Sutra to brainwash all the people in the Luosha Kingdom, and implant the concepts of kindness and equality in the minds of all living beings in the Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this way, all the people in the world would be molded into the same pattern, living according to the rules like robots.</p><p></p><p>This would indeed fulfill the divine visitation's wish and comply with the rules.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan was unwilling to do so.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has the right to exist, and although they could be casually slaughtered by Qi Yuan, their thoughts should remain free.</p><p></p><p>"If it is difficult to achieve, does that mean we should not try?" Liu Chuwinter retorted, "If we make progress a little every day, one day this world will truly become a utopia."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter's gaze was filled with expectation and hope for the future.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite in agreement with these words.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the Blue Star, he had also seen many inspirational stories.</p><p></p><p>Just like a little girl trying to throw the fish back into the sea that she had scooped up.</p><p></p><p>Passersby seeing the dense school of fish would say, "You can't save all the fish, why waste your energy? Who cares?"</p><p></p><p>The girl would say, "This fish cares, and that fish also cares."</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan could do was to improve the atmosphere of the world within his sight.</p><p></p><p>Have fewer people cursing and scolding than him. </p><p></p><p>Have more kind-hearted people than him.</p><p></p><p>In this way, his life would certainly be more comfortable, even if he was scolded, he could easily scold back and win.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter looked at Qi Yuan seriously and said, "However... the premise is that this divine visitation needs true fairness and justice. As long as there are self-aware beings..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng glared anxiously at Liu Chuwinter.</p><p></p><p>But Liu Chuwinter ignored him and continued, "Big brother Qi, are you sure you can guide this world towards the direction the divine visitation aspires to?"</p><p></p><p>Her words were a bit impolite and not very rational.</p><p></p><p>But she still said them.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, waiting for his answer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was deep: "It's painful, I have to think again."</p><p></p><p>He was a bit irritated, then looked at Liu Chuwinter: "Tell me, is there a way to solve this problem?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter looked at Qi Yuan: "Big brother Qi, if what I'm about to say offends you, please only punish me and not involve my family!"</p><p></p><p>The petite and delicate Liu Chuwinter, who looked only around twelve or thirteen years old, more fragile than a canary, but her gaze was now unusually resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Say whatever you want, I won't get angry even if you call me a dog," Qi Yuan said with a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to cursing and attacking, who could surpass the comment section on the Blue Star?</p><p></p><p>Just a glance would make people break down and their blood pressure rise.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has their own selfish desires, including me. Although my selfish desires are cloaked in the banner of fairness and justice, seemingly for the good of the world, they are still selfish desires.</p><p></p><p>So to achieve true fairness and justice, we need to eliminate human nature. The human heart is the most difficult to fathom.</p><p></p><p>The original divine visitation might have been able to bring this world a true utopia, but you, big brother Qi, have your own consciousness, your own preferences. Even if you are completely fair and just, there will still be biases."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter's cherry lips showed no mercy: "I hope that big brother Qi can... extinguish your own consciousness, and let the original divine visitation return!"</p><p></p><p>"If big brother Qi perishes, I will jump down from here as well, so that you won't be alone!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuwinter's words were earth-shattering, enough to move everyone.</p><p></p><p>It was as if in a feudal dynasty, a warlord had led his army into the capital, overthrown the old dynasty, and was about to ascend the throne, when someone told him that the emperor was the greatest disaster for the common people, and asked him to commit suicide for the sake of the people.</p><p></p><p>The old woman Huan Sha's expression suddenly changed, and she anxiously said, "How do you know the Arbiter God cannot maintain fairness and justice?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng sighed deeply, without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Now, whatever he said would be useless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Liu Chuwinter, his thoughts complex, as if he was growing a new brain.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed, and a joyful expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, since... I cannot be the divine visitation, then... I will return a divine visitation to the Luosha Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Qi Yuan's mind was enlightened.</p><p></p><p>He understood what was missing in his portrayal of the divine visitation.</p><p></p><p>This could also be linked to the blind artifact master's impersonation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

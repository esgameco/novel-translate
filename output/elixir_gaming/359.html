        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, as Qi Yuan was communicating with the Thunder Lord, a guest arrived outside the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>This guest was dressed in white robes with a jade belt at his waist. He had an upright posture, extraordinary looks, and an elegant demeanor. </p><p></p><p>In the mortal world, this man would undoubtedly be considered a rare beauty among tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Qi Yuan, he looked like a toad.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Kongming, that Qi Yuan stubbornly refuses to leave. Should we... kill him?" Madam Wang gritted her teeth, a murderous glint flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of all living beings and the world, she was willing to go against her conscience and kill some innocent people.</p><p></p><p>In her view, as long as it could save the world, sacrificing any number of people was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Tu Kongming maintained his refined expression, a look of regret flashing in his eyes: "This is not the way of a gentleman. I would be ashamed to do so!"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Kongming, for the sake of all living beings, sacrificing a bit of personal virtue is nothing!" the elderly Madam Wang urged.</p><p></p><p>Tu Kongming shook his head, his expression resolute: "If I was able to move Yuan Yu's heart in our past life, I believe I can do it again this time!"</p><p></p><p>"There's less than two months left, it's not enough time." Anxiety showed on Madam Wang's face. She thought of something and then said, "Should we... drug the young lady and force the issue?"</p><p></p><p>As long as they forced the issue, things would get back on track.</p><p></p><p>Their mission from the Mending Sky Pavilion would be considered complete.</p><p></p><p>The Mending Sky Pavilion was an organization under the Eastern Alliance, operating within all the Sea and Mountain Scrolls to complete missions.</p><p></p><p>These people had been cultivated and indoctrinated with a sense of righteousness from birth, with saving all living beings as their aspiration.</p><p></p><p>"We can't do that to Yuan Yu. We must respect Yuan Yu's inner feelings!" Tu Kongming hastily refused, his attitude firm.</p><p></p><p>"If we don't do this... the world will be destroyed!" Madam Wang's voice was low.</p><p></p><p>To her surprise, Tu Kongming showed no concern upon hearing this: "So what if the world is destroyed? In my heart, Yuan Yu is more important than the entire world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Madam Wang fell silent.</p><p></p><p>This Tu Kongming was too passionate, too much of a gentleman.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the past it was called passion, but on Blue Star, this kind of behavior was called being a simp, a love-struck fool.</p><p></p><p>Well, love-struck fool ranked below simp.</p><p></p><p>Anyone would do, except Ah Fei.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Seeing that she couldn't persuade Tu Kongming, Madam Wang slowly left without saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Tu Kongming watched Madam Wang's retreating shadow, his expression desolate: "It's not that I don't want to have Yuan Yu, to possess her, but true love isn't like that..."</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Wang Yuan Yu, who had concealed herself, heard this. Her expression remained unchanged as she frowned, lost in thought about something.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why are there so many variables in this mission? This Tu Kongming is also too pedantic and inflexible!" The man in the black robe gnashed his teeth, his expression fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Time is running out. It seems... we can't be so gentle anymore." Madam Wang gritted her teeth, her eyes fierce, clearly harboring murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. If they're unwilling to do it, they don't get a choice when compared to all living beings.</p><p></p><p>I have some aphrodisiac here. Give it separately to Tu Kongming and Wang Yuan Yu.</p><p></p><p>As for that bloodline holder, since he won't leave, I'll have to personally send him off." Murderous intent showed on the black-robed man's face, but even more so was fanaticism. "Everything for the world."</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang's eyes also became fanatical: "Everything for the world!"</p><p></p><p>Even if misunderstood by the people, even if bearing infamy, she would still forge ahead. For the sake of saving the world, Madam Wang thought to herself, her shadow under the sun seeming to grow taller.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a calm voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I forgot to tell you, my full name is Qi Yuan, and my nickname is World.</p><p></p><p>Could you... commit suicide for me?"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a figure suddenly appeared not far from the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>He wore cyan robes and had a lazy expression. Sunlight fell on him through gaps in the leaves, creating a striking contrast of light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, the black-robed man and Madam Wang were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"How are you here?"</p><p></p><p>They had been plotting in secret, and outside the cemetery. How could Qi Yuan know?</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Qi Yuan had appeared silently, something even a peak Martial King would find difficult to do.</p><p></p><p>"You were plotting against me behind my back, and I happened to overhear, so I came over."</p><p></p><p>Due to the revival of the divine infant within him, Qi Yuan's immortal cultivation had risen dramatically, reaching the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Though unable to illuminate all heavens like the Yang Spirit realm, the Yin Spirit realm allowed for divine sense to hear across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>He could sense if anyone nearby spoke ill of him.</p><p></p><p>He could also hear those who spoke ill of Xiao Jia, Jin Sique, Jin Li and the others.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man looked at Qi Yuan, his initial surprise fading to calmness: "Since you're here, I won't have to make a wasted trip.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the world, please go to your death, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's expression became solemn and sacred.</p><p></p><p>A bloodstained stone appeared.</p><p></p><p>This stone was stained with the blood of a Martial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Sovereign was incredibly powerful, able to dissolve an entire nation with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Even a dried drop of blood could easily obliterate a peak Martial King.</p><p></p><p>Martial Kings and Martial Sovereigns were simply not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the blood of a Martial Sovereign, the black-robed man was full of confidence. Even if Qi Yuan had suddenly appeared with shocking strength, so what?</p><p></p><p>Anyone below Martial Sovereign was but an ant.</p><p></p><p>"After you die, I will remember you and erect a monument for you.</p><p></p><p>Saving the world will be partly your achievement! Future generations will remember and praise your name!" The stone in the black-robed man's hand enlarged.</p><p></p><p>A powerful killing intent spread out. The black-robed man felt incredibly powerful, as if he were a deity who could control the life and death of everyone in the world at will.</p><p></p><p>"You're so kind, but unfortunately I'm very petty. After you die, I won't erect a monument for you, and no one will remember your name.</p><p></p><p>Look, I don't even know your name right now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced so many worlds,</p><p></p><p>He had seen all kinds of people.</p><p></p><p>He had also encountered people as "dedicated" as the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Mountain of Fate in the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Yuan wanted to resist the great calamity, this force feared Qi Yuan would anger the calamity and cause it to take revenge on the Azure Waves Realm, so they tried to curse and kill Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found this quite amusing.</p><p></p><p>When the butcher raises his cleaver, if one thinks not of resisting, but of fearing to anger the butcher and make him chop harder, that would be ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, this Mending Sky Pavilion was somewhat similar to the Mountain of Fate.</p><p></p><p>"I see, you must be that Lord from the Demon Suppression Court? No wonder you have such confidence.</p><p></p><p>However, this is the Sea and Mountain Scroll. The Mending Sky Pavilion reigns supreme here!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Sovereign's blood emitted light at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In all the Sea and Mountain Scrolls, there was no force that could resist the power of a Martial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"The world will remember your sacrifice!" The black-robed man shouted loudly, his expression majestic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "I'm here to play a game, not to listen to your preaching. Sigh, you game designers are really too boring."</p><p></p><p>That's right, this was exactly how Qi Yuan felt.</p><p></p><p>Each mission in this game had a little story.</p><p></p><p>The stories always carried some regret, helplessness, or pain.</p><p></p><p>These stories seemed intended to leave a deep impression on players, to influence them.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's view, the designers were just trying to be pseudo-intellectual.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, trying to be profound now.</p><p></p><p>"Who has the planner's phone number? Call and tell them I'm here to play the game, not to listen to stories. I'm here to kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a free game? Am I a freeloader? Whatever, planner can do as they please, I'll just kill, kill, kill."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he looked at the man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he unleashed the Bird-Killing Fist. Qi Yuan's powerful punch seemed capable of destroying the world.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blood-stained rock shattered instantly. </p><p></p><p>The expression on the black-robed man's face froze: "Mar...Martial Lord."</p><p></p><p>The strike Qi Yuan had unleashed had clearly reached the realm of Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>This unstoppable, unmatched power was undoubtedly that of a Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Disbelief flashed in the depths of the black-robed man's pupils. His form dispersed in that moment, shattering into countless fragments.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was a peak Martial King, even though he had the blood of a Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>But before Qi Yuan, he was still not worth mentioning, far too weak.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between gods and men.</p><p></p><p>"Shattered beyond recognition, indeed there's no grave." Qi Yuan's expression was relaxed after killing the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Madam Wang's body trembled, her expression full of incomprehension and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"How could there be a Martial Lord in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas? Impossible, impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Without ancestral blood, how could a peak Martial King break through to Martial Lord?</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords of the Origin Lands also absolutely could not leave the Origin Lands - leaving meant death.</p><p></p><p>That's why they, the Mending Sky Pavilion group of Martial Kings, wandered in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, correcting the timeline, re-enacting the world, and then saving the world before the Dawn's Call began!</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is impossible in this world." Qi Yuan looked at Madam Wang, "Are you interested in having your corpse specimen married to Han Xianyun?"</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang looked at Qi Yuan, her heart in turmoil, unable to understand.</p><p></p><p>However, she still calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, please stop.</p><p></p><p>This old woman doesn't know how you broke through to Martial Lord. Perhaps you have some great opportunity, an extraordinary destiny. A Martial Lord in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas is truly a king.</p><p></p><p>But... in the face of greater trends, even a Martial Lord is as insignificant as dust.</p><p></p><p>There are less than 4,000 years left until the Dawn's Call.</p><p></p><p>Our Mending Sky Pavilion must correct the timeline. Only in this way can the world restart without errors!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested in all that. Speak plainly." Qi Yuan's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>He had heard plenty of such talk from Old Thunder God.</p><p></p><p>But what did the game restarting have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, worldly affairs were complicated. Who knew what was true or false?</p><p></p><p>Even if Madam Wang was speaking sincerely, Qi Yuan's nose hadn't grown longer, but he only glanced at the information passed through the Book of Chronicles.</p><p></p><p>"I hope sir can consider the bigger picture, and bring together the young miss and Tu Kongming, to retrace the timeline.</p><p></p><p>This old woman... thanks Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Madam Wang stretched out her hand and resolutely struck her own head.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, her skull shattered, blood flowing, as dead as one could be.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, she intended to use her own death to move Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Qi Yuan wasn't strong, the one dying might have been him instead.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's expression didn't change at all, nor was he moved.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, Han Xianyun lost such an awesome wife."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, forcing such a great person to die, doesn't that make me the villain?"</p><p></p><p>"Should I... hehehe!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out the signature laugh of a villain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three months passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>During this time, many things happened.</p><p></p><p>Well, many people came from the Mending Sky Pavilion to try to kill Qi Yuan, all easily slain by him.</p><p></p><p>Tu Kongming ultimately failed to win the beauty, still like Fei Yangyang.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu didn't fall for Tu Kongming, and only treated Qi Yuan as a friend.</p><p></p><p>The two protagonists of the story didn't follow the script.</p><p></p><p>Ma Longhan, this "villain", was very dedicated to his career, always causing trouble, following the "original trajectory" to assassinate Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>Well... this time Tu Kongming still stepped forward, taking the blow for Wang Yuanyu, ultimately dying, as devoted as Fei Yangyang.</p><p></p><p>Unlike what Madam Wang said, Wang Yuanyu didn't die for love.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally met Ma Longhan and casually killed him.</p><p></p><p>If you ask why Qi Yuan didn't save Tu Kongming: first, they weren't close; second, he didn't want to; third, the mission didn't require protecting him.</p><p></p><p>"The mission is complete, I should leave now.</p><p></p><p>I've stayed a bit long this time, missed several martial arts tournaments, such a loss."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clapped his hands, feeling somewhat distressed.</p><p></p><p>To become a Human Dao Martial Lord required winning a hundred consecutive martial arts tournaments.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Scroll of Mountains and Seas meant being unable to participate in tournaments, risking breaking the winning streak.</p><p></p><p>So at this time, the golden canary outside would help Qi Yuan by stopping the martial arts tournaments.</p><p></p><p>Well, only tournaments Qi Yuan participated in counted as martial arts tournaments.</p><p></p><p>It was like a specially dug radish pit.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu glanced at Qi Yuan, her gaze falling on Tu Kongming, her expression somewhat dejected: "He still died to save me, just as Madam Wang said.</p><p></p><p>But I... actually don't feel sad, nor moved.</p><p></p><p>Am I... born cold-hearted?"</p><p></p><p>"I can tell. According to this narcissistic man's opinion, you've been with me so long without falling for me, so... you are indeed somewhat cold." Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Is that... not good?" Wang Yuanyu hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"What is good? What is not good?" Qi Yuan's form became ethereal, "Living in this world, sometimes it's better to be a bit selfish.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you offend me, sorry, no matter how good you are, that's not good."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Yuanyu smiled gently: "You're leaving?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, going back. Haven't seen my wife in many years, miss her dearly."</p><p></p><p>"I hope we have a chance to meet again." Wang Yuanyu said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>In this ethereal world, vast as mist, finding someone to talk to was rare and precious.</p><p></p><p>"As long as your lifespan is long enough, you'll have the chance." Qi Yuan looked at Wang Yuanyu, suddenly feeling something, and spoke mysteriously, "You can watch a lot of TV dramas, you can immerse yourself, but don't take them too seriously.</p><p></p><p>Just like when we scroll through videos and check trending topics, what we see is sometimes what others want us to see."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu tilted her head, nodding: "Sounds profound, looks like you're a cultured person."</p><p></p><p>The two began to flatter each other.</p><p></p><p>"You're not bad either, a good actress, suitable for playing a kidnapper." Qi Yuan said, looking at the black sack on Wang Yuanyu's head.</p><p></p><p>If changed to black stockings, it would be more fitting, more suitable.</p><p></p><p>"Next time we meet, I'll give you a set of stockings." Qi Yuan said, "You wear them for me to see!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu smiled: "Alright. By the way, what's a TV drama?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, when she called Qi Yuan cultured, she was just flattering him randomly.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't understood Qi Yuan's words at all.</p><p></p><p>"Well, you all are the TV drama, I'm the audience."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his form disappeared in that moment.</p><p></p><p>In the vast world, only Wang Yuanyu was left standing alone.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

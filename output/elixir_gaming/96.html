        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed across his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Where is the golden elixir? It's gone.</p><p></p><p>He glanced over and saw what seemed to be a Foundation Establishment cultivator looking at him.</p><p></p><p>When he heard the words of the Foundation Establishment cultivator, a trace of suspicion flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My final spiritual attack, yet a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator is unharmed. It seems you possess a precious spiritual treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the eyes of the old demonic chicken demon were filled with ecstatic joy.</p><p></p><p>"The heavens have been merciful, I have survived great calamity, there must be good fortune to come!"</p><p></p><p>Surrounded and attacked by nine Infant Immortals, he had feigned death and escaped, his spiritual power already greatly depleted.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected to encounter a Foundation Establishment cultivator immune to his spiritual attacks.</p><p></p><p>Before his death, his indiscriminate spiritual attacks had dealt the greatest damage to those nine Infant Immortals, and the next greatest to the cultivators near Patriarch Zu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The result was that the Mid-Nascent Soul cultivator was unconscious, while the Foundation Establishment cultivator was lively and energetic. </p><p></p><p>This clearly showed that the other party possessed a precious treasure that could defend against spiritual attacks. Judging from the level, it was of a very high grade.</p><p></p><p>If he could seize it, find a secluded place, and cultivate step-by-step, the chances of him weathering the tribulation of the Purple Palace would increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be excited? Looking at Qi Yuan, he was like looking at a delicacy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also looking at him, his eyes filled with puzzlement: "The one who was woken up by a fart really does have a problem with his head."</p><p></p><p>He held a kitchen knife, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, even in my injured state, I am not someone a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator can humiliate." The old demonic chicken demon's eyes were filled with disdain as he instantly unleashed his Dao techniques, intending to trap Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, holding the kitchen knife, directly struck forward.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife, as if able to cleave spiritual bodies, fell upon the old demonic chicken demon's spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Excruciating pain like tearing spread, the old demonic chicken demon's smugness and excitement completely vanishing.</p><p></p><p>This was no delicacy, this was a demon! Qi Yuan's kitchen knife directly shattered his remaining soul.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Zu Yuan's physical body fell to the ground again.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if someone will fart and wake him up again?" Qi Yuan looked at the scene with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his gaze fell on the area near Patriarch Zu Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>There, suspended in the air, was a blood-red drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>He immediately looked at it.</p><p></p><p>[Spiritual Blood, originating from the Great Void, accidentally fell in the Great Zhao, and was obtained by the old demonic chicken demon. </p><p></p><p>This blood, fused with the spiritual body, can cultivate a seed, which will eventually transform into a spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the seed, the more powerful the spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even after death, one can be revived on the seed.]</p><p></p><p>"So, he was the old demonic chicken demon's seed, and the Patriarch Zu Yuan I just killed was the old demonic chicken demon?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the drop of blood, his eyes filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>"This drop of blood is truly a good thing!"</p><p></p><p>"Old demon, you are truly my money-spending fairy! My pure white moon, even whiter than the broken wolf!"</p><p></p><p>"This is Spiritual Blood from the Great Void, truly a precious treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Spiritual treasures were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Great Zhao, there might not even be a single spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual treasure formed from the condensation of Spiritual Blood seemed to be a growth-type, which was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately swallowed this drop of Spiritual Blood.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he felt a drop of fresh blood appear on his spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>This drop of blood could be parasitized at any time.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to parasitize on the body of a Yang God, wouldn't that Yang God become my spiritual treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had wild thoughts, but also felt this idea was not very feasible.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find a suitable object to parasitize and cultivate my spiritual treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p></p><p>The matter was over, it was time to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the old man, who had not yet regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Since you previously let me leave first, I'll take you out of here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and the old man's entire body floated behind him, as if being controlled like a corpse.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a message came from Ku Mu Zhen Jun in Qi Yuan's jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"The old demonic chicken demon has been slain, we nine will be recuperating in the Myriad Demon Cave for four days.</p><p>How are things on your end?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly replied: "It's done, I killed an Elixir Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence from Ku Mu Zhen Jun's end, before he slowly replied: "In four days, I will come to the Seven-Colored Peak to find you."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Carrying the old man, Qi Yuan left the cave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the cave, the thirteen Elixir Nascent Soul cultivators who had entered earlier had come out.</p><p></p><p>But this time, only eleven people came out, the other two were corpses.</p><p></p><p>The leader unexpectedly glanced at Qi Yuan, seeing the unconscious old man, he was even more surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The matter here is concluded, we shall all return to our respective homes.</p><p>However, during this time, the news of the old demonic chicken demon's demise must not be leaked."</p><p></p><p>The leader spoke, then disappeared like a flowing light.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present one by one left.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the old man behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it seems I still have to send you back home, to Wuxue City... Lao Guan, right?"</p><p></p><p>He still remembered going to Wuxue City before.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he went to destroy the Black Mountain Sect, the spiritual boat he rode on had landed in Wuxue City.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there was also a beautiful and talkative young woman sitting next to him on the spiritual boat.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the courtyard, Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a trace of surprise.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to see the beautiful young woman from the spiritual boat again.</p><p></p><p>That beautiful young woman was actually the daughter of the old man Lao Guan.</p><p></p><p>"I've already returned the person, I should be going now." Qi Yuan's voice was a bit hoarse, changing his voice tone was the simplest thing for him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving my father's life." Liu Piao was deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>Her father was injured and unconscious outside. </p><p>If any malicious cultivators had found him, her father would not have survived.</p><p>She never expected someone would bring her father back.</p><p>How could she not be moved?</p><p></p><p>Just then, hurried footsteps approached: "Grandfather, Grandfather."</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou, in a white dress, her forehead beaded with fine sweat, looked very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Your grandfather has not yet regained consciousness." Liu Piao saw her daughter, her heart relieved. "It was this senior who brought your grandfather back."</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou then carefully examined Qi Yuan.</p><p>But unfortunately, Qi Yuan's face was covered by a mask, so she could not see his features clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, for saving my grandfather from danger, Qianrou has prepared a small gift, please don't disdain it." Duan Qianrou said, extending a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bag was filled to the brim with blood crystals.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not refuse, he took the blood crystals, and suddenly he felt the tattoo of Xiao Jia on his chest become slightly warm.</p><p></p><p>He pondered.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that these blood crystals are useful for Xiao Jia?</p><p></p><p>"No problem, a small favor, not worth mentioning, the person has been delivered, and I should leave now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was now eager to leave, to see what use these blood crystals could be for Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Xiao Jia tattoo on his chest become warm?</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Duan Qianrou to speak, Qi Yuan disappeared like a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before, in a place with no one around, Qi Yuan summoned Xiao Jia out.</p><p></p><p>He took out the blood crystals.</p><p></p><p>The blood crystals were not very large, crystal clear, somewhat resembling pomegranate seeds, but even more blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blood crystals, a wooden plaque fell out of Xiao Jia's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>A joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Do you like them? I'll give them to you."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia's sleeve picked up one of the blood crystals.</p><p></p><p>After some time, that blood crystal disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia looked very excited.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiao Jia happy, Qi Yuan's mood also improved greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Did you eat it?" Qi Yuan thought Xiao Jia didn't eat things.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Xiao Jia actually ate things.</p><p></p><p>"I have a lot more here, enough for you to eat." Qi Yuan took out some more of the blood crystals for Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xiao Jia slowly digest them.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blood crystals, and some information flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Blood crystals, effects comparable to low-grade spirit stones.]</p><p></p><p>The information he saw was random, and he might not be able to see the key information immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Since you like them, when I see the Sect Master, I'll find an excuse to take over the blood crystal mine in Wuxue City, these spirit stones will be enough for you to eat."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to spend money to buy blood crystals, it would be much better to directly take over the blood crystal mine in Wuxue City.</p><p></p><p>Let the people of Wuxue City work for him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current Emperor of the Great Xia is his junior brother.</p>

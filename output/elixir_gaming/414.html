        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can't be too flirtatious, need to be a bit aloof and cold, make him feel that Purple Qi is special and has some interest in him, but is too reserved to actively pursue him."</p><p></p><p>"Before meeting Purple Qi, need to add some difficulties and obstacles. Otherwise if it's too easy to obtain, he'll become suspicious and may even think the Gate of Ultimate Truth behind it is a honeytrap."</p><p></p><p>"Adding some difficulties will make him feel like this is what he deserves, the result of his hard work and efforts, and he'll be moved by his own actions."</p><p></p><p>In a desolate, uninhabited place, Qi Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Five Elements in Chaos!"</p><p></p><p>The aura on Qi Yuan's body receded, then burst forth again. </p><p></p><p>When he was in Wangyue Continent, he had used the Five Ancestors' Five Elements qi to refine his own qi, establishing the foundation of Five Elements qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>Now with just a wave of his hand, he could throw the Five Elements of this place into chaos.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, causing chaos in the Five Elements was very easy, but for other Yang Spirits, it was actually quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>Unless they specialized in the Five Elements and had comprehended the ultimate truths of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan's act of making things look old was very convincing - even if a Yang Spirit of Ultimate Truth came, they wouldn't be able to detect any issues.</p><p></p><p>"Now to set up some incomplete ancient formations..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hadn't done much research on formations.</p><p></p><p>But even so, with his eyes that could see hidden information,</p><p></p><p>Improving some formations to the point where even their creators wouldn't recognize them was also very simple for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed, and Qi Yuan looked at his handiwork with great satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe I wasted half a day setting up this trap."</p><p></p><p>"But well, I've gained experience this time, so next time I can just copy and paste when setting up traps!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I have so little Purple Qi, and only one Gate of Ultimate Truth. Otherwise... wouldn't it be great to set up more traps?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't mass produce, can't industrialize, so the efficiency is low."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the trap he had set up with a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"Need to give it a push, otherwise what if that Yang Spirit is a homebody who doesn't want to come out?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he lightly pressed down with his finger.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spiritual energy in the trap surged and overflowed, shooting up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, time to head back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan dusted off his hands and his figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Need to be careful during this time. My door is gone, so I need to keep a close eye. It would be bad if thieves got in."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Demon Luo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable sat in his cave dwelling, wearing loose robes with faint traces of blood visible.</p><p></p><p>He looked at an order in front of him, a fierce light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I was cultivating so well, and now they want me to go to that damned Demon Abyss battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Can't kill those insects, have to fight fellow cultivators instead, it's so pointless!"</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the Demon Flame Venerable had received orders from the Council of Elders to take over for the Demon Silkworm Venerable and guard the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable was very unwilling to take on this task.</p><p></p><p>After all, he would be facing Venerables from the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>In terms of battle power, he was no match for them.</p><p></p><p>So he could only endure being bullied.</p><p></p><p>What's worse, due to the war prohibition, he couldn't even attack those low-level cultivators without reason.</p><p></p><p>So this assignment was just going to be frustrating.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't beat the Yang Spirits, couldn't kill the Yin Spirits, and couldn't even vent his frustrations.</p><p></p><p>"Must go to the front lines within a month... Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable was unwilling to go to the front lines.</p><p></p><p>Once he took up this guard duty, it would likely be for ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't refuse the Council of Elders' appointment.</p><p></p><p>"Even as a Venerable, life is still so difficult, sigh."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable sighed.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, his brows raised.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>He sensed an unusual aura.</p><p></p><p>The aura was very faint, but he still detected it.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable immediately stood up, his gaze seeming to pierce through the clouds to ten thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable narrowed his eyes, the scene ten thousand miles away appearing before him.</p><p></p><p>He saw that in a distant uninhabited area, spiritual energy was in chaos, the Five Elements in disarray.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the Demon Flame Venerable's figure vanished as he headed towards the uninhabited area.</p><p></p><p>He concealed his aura, appearing just like an ordinary mythical cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements qi is in chaos. Either a great treasure has appeared, or there's some special situation."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable's eyes suddenly lit up, trying to see through the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>"An ancient formation is blocking me?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable's eyes brightened.</p><p></p><p>"If it can block even me, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>There must definitely be a great treasure here! It might even be the location of an ancient powerhouse's cave dwelling from the primordial era.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, this is too coincidental." The Demon Flame Venerable instinctively sensed a whiff of danger.</p><p></p><p>It was like an ordinary person sleeping in their house, suddenly hearing a noise, going outside to check, and finding a cave with a sign in front of it.</p><p></p><p>"Great treasure inside."</p><p></p><p>It's a bit exaggerated, but for the Demon Flame Venerable it really was like this.</p><p></p><p>Because treasures that could tempt even Yang Spirits were extremely rare, with a very low probability of encountering them.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements chaos before him must be hiding a treasure that could tempt even Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Seal!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable reached out his palm, instantly covering and concealing this entire area.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he had to cover up the aura here first.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the Five Elements chaos continued to spread, other Yang Spirit Venerables might sense it in a few years.</p><p></p><p>"This is the core area of my Demon Luo clan, there shouldn't be any danger. I can go in and explore."</p><p></p><p>As the Demon Flame Venerable said this, he headed forward.</p><p></p><p>An incomplete ancient formation appeared before him, with a faint ancient and profound aura.</p><p></p><p>"This formation method is unheard of, it must be a lost technique from ancient times."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable thought for a moment, then entered the ancient formation without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>About a few hundred breaths of time passed, and the Demon Flame Venerable went deeper in.</p><p></p><p>He let out a sigh of relief: "Fortunately this ancient formation is too old, otherwise it would take at least a hundred days to break through."</p><p></p><p>A hundred days was the blink of an eye for a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>But he had to go guard the Sixth Heaven within a month, so he couldn't delay.</p><p></p><p>"There's another ancient formation ahead, inside must be... Hmm? Purple Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Demon Flame Venerable's mind shook and his eyes lit up: "It's actually Purple Qi, the number one qi of the immortal realm! No wonder the Five Elements are in chaos!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Venerable was a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>He had caught the scent of Purple Qi.</p><p></p><p>Purple Qi was the number one qi of the immortal realm, representing chaos and the beginning.</p><p></p><p>For Yang Spirits, Purple Qi had great uses.</p><p></p><p>For example, if one's past life was at the Mythical realm, obtaining Purple Qi could elevate them to the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for ordinary Celestial realm powerhouses, increases in cultivation were generally reflected in the stars they projected across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>And the star projections across the heavens didn't appear out of thin air, they required Purple Qi.</p><p></p><p>The more Purple Qi one had, the stronger the star projections a Yang Spirit could condense, the stronger the effect of projecting across the heavens, and the faster their strength would increase.</p><p></p><p>That's why when the Ten Suns Venerable aspired to challenge for the Great Sun Venerable position, all the Yang Spirit Venerables were shocked.</p><p></p><p>First, the Ten Suns Venerable must have a lot of Purple Qi.</p><p></p><p>Second, the Ten Suns Venerable's talent must be strong to be able to have ten suns in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these Yang Spirit Venerables didn't know that their star projections were different from Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's... were projections of real fixed stars!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's mandate is with me,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I, Mochi, would see this day!"</p><p></p><p>Mochi was extremely excited and no longer hesitated, heading towards the next ancient formation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping returned from afar. He instinctively glanced at the distant tent.</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw that familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he flew over and casually asked, "I didn't see you yesterday, friend. Did you perhaps make some new discovery?"</p><p></p><p>Collecting Miluo Light depends on luck first, and skill second.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping was afraid Qi Yuan had good luck and collected some, which made him quite jealous and resentful.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Black Demon Abyss, bloodline was most important.</p><p></p><p>How could this Qi Yuan, without a bloodline, have a higher status than him? If his luck was even better and he collected Miluo Light, Ji Buping would feel even more unbalanced.</p><p></p><p>A mere country bumpkin from the Second Heaven, how could he have such good fortune!</p><p></p><p>"Discovery... indeed I did," Qi Yuan looked at Ji Buping and said softly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping's heart skipped a beat, feeling sour: "Your luck is truly enviable, friend, to have discovered Miluo Light."</p><p></p><p>"It's not Miluo Light," Qi Yuan shook his head. He looked at Ji Buping and said quietly, "Friend, since you can stoop to an old lady, you must be quite ambitious, right?"</p><p></p><p>"You... you!" Ji Buping's expression changed abruptly, his face filled with a thick bloody aura. "How dare you, you insolent brat! To insult me like this, even if some bigwig from the Black Demon Abyss has taken a liking to you, I'll still kill you today!"</p><p></p><p>He was truly angry.</p><p></p><p>Though the attack was just for show.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "Why be like this, friend? I truly admire you!"</p><p></p><p>After all, if it were Qi Yuan, he couldn't bring himself to go for an old lady.</p><p></p><p>Although his ideal women were all old men and grannies who rarely bathed.</p><p></p><p>But... those were just ideals, existing only in fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The killing intent in Ji Buping's eyes was real, but he didn't make a move.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't have a collar on his neck. If he had a rope around it, he would have really attacked.</p><p></p><p>"Precisely because I know of your ambition, I have a big money-making opportunity to share with you," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to play the role of a talent scout today.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping was stunned for a moment, then asked suspiciously, "What opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>"When I left yesterday, I actually had my eye on a fat sheep. He's very rich, with lots of money." Mentioning this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Ji Buping's expression remained unchanged, "Robbing cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>He had done it before and was very familiar with this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>"How can you call it robbing cultivators? I strongly suggest renaming it to 'wandering cultivation'."</p><p></p><p>If homeless people can be renamed, thereby reducing their numbers in cities,</p><p></p><p>Renaming robber cultivators shouldn't be a problem, right? Ji Buping narrowed his eyes: "Very rich?"</p><p></p><p>Although he disliked Qi Yuan, making money together was no problem.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, this kind of thing was very normal.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely loaded. It's just that his strength is a tiny bit high," Qi Yuan said. "That's why I called you to make big money together."</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping felt some mockery in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's cultivation level was probably just at the early Great Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>When he said "a tiny bit high", it was probably at most the fourth step of Sky Treading.</p><p></p><p>He himself was at the sixth step of Sky Treading, so he didn't take it seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>However, he still asked, "Are you sure we can handle it with just you and me?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, he's very old, already decrepit. We're young and strong, definitely no problem taking down an old man.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, he's a high-ranking member of the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>We're from the Black Demon Abyss, the daddy of the Demon Luo clan! So if we kill him cleanly, there won't be any problem.</p><p></p><p>Let's go... are you in?</p><p></p><p>We'll split it based on our contributions, okay?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he activated the Great Forgetting Scripture.</p><p></p><p>He was socially anxious, not good with words, and poor at expressing himself verbally.</p><p></p><p>So he often used the Great Forgetting Scripture.</p><p></p><p>"After this job, you might just have enough merit to reach the Sixth Heaven!" Qi Yuan persuaded.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping's face changed slightly, his expression stunned: "Sixth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sixth Heaven. Are you in?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm in!" Ji Buping nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>It's just a high-ranking member of the Demon Luo clan, right? He dared to kill Blood Robes, what was there to fear!</p><p></p><p>He had fourth-grade bloodline! And unequal distribution of loot? Schemes and tricks? He was a mighty cultivator at the fifth step of Sky Treading, why would he fear someone at the fourth step?</p><p></p><p>Who would cultivate if they were cowards?</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!" Hearing this, Qi Yuan was very happy. "Let's go set up an ambush for him. If this cooperation goes well, we can continue working together next time.</p><p></p><p>I've got my eye on quite a few high-ranking members of the Demon Luo clan, each one a first-rate fat sheep!</p><p></p><p>Much richer than your old lady."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Buping took a deep breath: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Would I lie to you? I'm the most honest and trustworthy person, never tell lies." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping glanced at Qi Yuan: "You're quite interesting. I misjudged you before."</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping looked at Qi Yuan as if looking at a fat sheep: "Where's your Dao partner?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping remembered the woman by Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>That woman looked like she hadn't been cleansed by celestial energy, probably hadn't entered the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan's strength should be quite ordinary too.</p><p></p><p>"One of my Dao partners is in the Sixth Heaven, and another is on the sun." Mentioning this, Qi Yuan's expression became somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Buping's expression froze, then he said: "Didn't you just say you never lie? How come you're making things up now?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not lying." Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to explain. He thought of something and then asked, "What about your family, friend?"</p><p></p><p>When it came to enemies, Qi Yuan always wanted to find out clearly.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was whether they had family.</p><p></p><p>"I'm all alone, no family."</p><p></p><p>"Oh! Friend, let's hurry. The fish has taken the bait, just waiting for us to pull in the net."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Ji Buping was excited, ready to pull off a big job.</p><p></p><p>What did it matter if he was a high-ranking member of the Demon Luo clan?</p><p></p><p>He was from the Black Demon Abyss, a level above the Demon Luo clan! "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan led Ji Buping, disappearing in a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>When they reappeared, they had come out of the Miluo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping's eyes held a surprised look: "How did you avoid the Demon Luo clan's cultivators to get out?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Luo clan had cultivators guarding the entrances and exits of the Miluo Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan had led him out casually, as if those cultivators couldn't see them at all.</p><p></p><p>"Because... we're from the Black Demon Abyss, they can't see us!" To avoid revealing his innate divine ability, Qi Yuan chose to tell some selective lies.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Ji Buping looked at Qi Yuan, somewhat skeptical.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, having left the Miluo Realm, he actually had some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>If the target was in the Miluo Realm, any battle wouldn't be noticed by the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>But outside the Miluo Realm, too much commotion would likely be discovered by the Demon Luo clan's experts.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that he dared to go after Blood Robes, it would be too embarrassing to back out now.</p><p></p><p>If things went south, he could just flee and leave Blood Robes behind.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was strong and didn't fear accidents.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, we're almost there. That old man is right in the trap!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>If you ask why he brought Ji Buping along, firstly, he was a talent scout, seeing Ji Buping's ambition; secondly, life was boring, he needed some entertainment; thirdly, to share some of the karmic consequences.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

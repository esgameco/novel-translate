        <h1>Chapter 330</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A mechanical prompt sounded, and the old patriarch of the Mu family was startled, a look of confusion flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Eye in the Sky was rarely activated, but simulated exercises were conducted at regular intervals. </p><p></p><p>Even the robots executing the program did not know if it was an exercise or real combat.</p><p></p><p>Each exercise had always proceeded in an orderly manner, and a situation like this had never occurred before.</p><p></p><p>Command issuance failed.</p><p></p><p>Unknown error occurred.</p><p></p><p>"What unknown error? Begin self-test!" the old Mu patriarch blurted out involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>His voice was not concealed at all, and it reached the ears of the Seventh Prince, Gongyi Cai, and the others.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince's eyes showed surprise, as if unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had also practiced the Eye in the Sky activation procedure before.</p><p></p><p>An unknown error... this was an almost impossible problem to encounter.</p><p></p><p>The Eye in the Sky was a self-contained system, not connected to other networks, and was constantly self-checking and monitoring itself.</p><p></p><p>The robots on the Eye in the Sky were the latest generation, with an error rate far lower than humans.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the Eye in the Sky was located high in the sky, like a series of high celestial barriers.</p><p></p><p>Apart from other Eyes in the Sky, there were no weapons in this world that could affect the Eye in the Sky.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Eye in the Sky was a war barrier equipped externally with almost all of the most advanced weapons in this world.</p><p></p><p>But... an unknown error occurred.</p><p></p><p>And... it seemed that it wasn't just one Eye in the Sky affected, but multiple simultaneously, which was almost unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai simply couldn't imagine what problem the Eye in the Sky could have encountered.</p><p></p><p>"Begin self-test... beep... Eye in the Sky has encountered an unknown attack, entering Level 1 alert, initiating defense..."</p><p></p><p>As the prompt sounded, the old Mu patriarch's face changed completely.</p><p></p><p>The Eye in the Sky had actually been attacked.</p><p></p><p>And Level 1 alert was the highest level of alert.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the attack on the Eye in the Sky... might be impossible to counter.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Ancient Witchcraft, Brilliant Star, or the other Seven Martial Star families!" The old Mu patriarch's eagle-like gaze fell on the Seventh Prince.</p><p></p><p>Only other Eyes in the Sky could cause such a crisis for the Eye in the Sky in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>The old Mu patriarch naturally suspected whether it was the royal family and the other Seven Martial Star families conspiring against him.</p><p></p><p>"Activate the Star Network, let me see exactly what's going on!"</p><p></p><p>The Eye in the Sky was currently under attack and in defense mode, unable to transmit real-time images back.</p><p></p><p>The old Mu patriarch had no choice but to activate the Star Network.</p><p></p><p>The Star Network, somewhat similar to satellites on Blue Star, hung high in space and could capture many images and videos.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, following the old Mu patriarch's voice, projections of some images appeared in the air of the hall, visible to everyone.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that caught their eyes was clearly the Mu No. 1 Eye in the Sky.</p><p></p><p>In the cold and desolate space, a huge war fortress hung lonely in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Within this steel behemoth, countless oddly shaped mechanical vehicles could be vaguely seen moving, along with various conveyor belts.</p><p></p><p>Dense swarms of robots patrolled, like ants.</p><p></p><p>The retracted gun barrels were cold and rigid.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge war barrier gave people a feeling of... science fiction, enormity, and heavy industry.</p><p></p><p>The steel barrier operated smoothly, like a deep space beast lying in wait, waiting for the moment to bare its fangs.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there seemed to be a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Bang! This wasn't a sound, but an action.</p><p></p><p>That massive steel beast suddenly brightened in that moment, as if illuminated by lights.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, the dense swarms of robots on the steel beast... all shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying steel barrier, as fragile as collapsing building blocks, also showed signs of fracture in its main body.</p><p></p><p>The complete steel creation split into pieces, like a scene from a science fiction movie.</p><p></p><p>But this was reality.</p><p></p><p>The Eye in the Sky, which even the strongest missiles couldn't scratch, had just... suffered over 80% damage to its main body.</p><p></p><p>That light... what exactly was it? Who exactly... had damaged the Eye in the Sky?</p><p></p><p>The Mu family members present stared at the shattered Eye in the Sky, their eyes showing bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The old Mu patriarch's face was ashen: "Who is it, who exactly, I'll make them pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>To repair this Eye in the Sky would take at least several decades.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a voice strangely transmitted into the ears of everyone present through the projection.</p><p></p><p>This was very unscientific.</p><p></p><p>"This Eye in the Sky is indeed quite formidable, unable to be blown to dust in one breath.</p><p></p><p>Husband, hold on tighter... your wife needs to free one hand."</p><p></p><p>A slightly coquettish voice entered the ears of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>The Mu family members all changed expression.</p><p></p><p>If this voice was real, in one breath... the Eye in the Sky barrier had been blown... down?</p><p></p><p>What an incredibly mighty force this was! However, before they could think further, an even more terrifying scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of space, a light flashed that was ten or a hundred times stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>This light was as vast as the sea, like divine might, beyond mortal comprehension or description.</p><p></p><p>Even... all those present who saw this godly might suddenly felt an urge to prostrate themselves in worship.</p><p></p><p>Under this divine might, the terrifying beast that was the Eye in the Sky, like a seven-spotted ladybug encountering a space-based weapon, directly shattered and turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In space, it was as if a grand fireworks display had been ignited, brilliant and boundless.</p><p></p><p>In various parts of Qinyuan, it seemed many people looking up at the starry sky saw the fireworks in the celestial vault.</p><p></p><p>The warning sounds also came at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Warning, connection lost with Mu No. 1 Eye in the Sky."</p><p></p><p>"Warning, connection lost with Mu No. 2 Eye in the Sky."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Warning, connection lost with Mu No. 13 Eye in the Sky."</p><p></p><p>These successive warning sounds transmitted into the hall.</p><p></p><p>The Mu family members in the hall were horrified, becoming dispirited one by one.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen Eyes in the Sky... all destroyed in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be a false alarm, a false alarm, yes!"</p><p></p><p>These Mu family members' eyes were bloodshot, unable to accept this reality.</p><p></p><p>The arrogance and sense of superiority that was once in their eyes had completely vanished at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of thirteen Eyes in the Sky, what did this mean? Everyone present understood very well.</p><p></p><p>It meant that the Mu family's special privileges would completely disappear.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the thirteen Eyes in the Sky that the Mu family was undoubtedly one of the top three families in Qinyuan.</p><p></p><p>But with the Eyes in the Sky destroyed, everything was... gone.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that none of the Mu family members present had ever imagined what it would be like without the Eyes in the Sky.</p><p></p><p>Because the power of the Eyes in the Sky was something that even gods would tremble at.</p><p></p><p>But now... thirteen Eyes in the Sky were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Gone... all gone..." The old Mu patriarch's voice was hoarse, his spirit completely dissipated at this moment, his body suddenly becoming hunched.</p><p></p><p>The Eyes in the Sky were everything.</p><p></p><p>The royal family without the Eyes in the Sky would become mere figureheads.</p><p></p><p>They dared not imagine what kind of storm awaited the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>"The Mu family has met its end by my hand, I am a sinner... wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>This old man, without his previous imposing manner, was like a lonely old man flickering in the wind, suddenly aging twenty years.</p><p></p><p>In his old age, he actually burst into tears.</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch who led the Mu family, one of the most powerful people in Qinyuan... in the end, wasn't he just an ordinary person?</p><p></p><p>After all, before having the talent for cultivation, in Gongxing, the difference between people was actually... not very great.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference might just be the starting line.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there wouldn't be cases where an entire town was filled with founding generals and famous ministers.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just then, a playful voice reached everyone's ears again.</p><p></p><p>The Mu family members suddenly tensed up.</p><p></p><p>Because this voice... was exactly the same as the one that had come from the Star Network earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, who should we kill?"</p><p></p><p>As this voice sounded, everyone present seemed to feel a breeze blow past.</p><p></p><p>In the hall, a young couple had appeared out of nowhere, looking like a perfect match.</p><p></p><p>"It's her... she destroyed the Sky Eye!"</p><p></p><p>"How did they get here so fast!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>The Mu family members present erupted in commotion, some with trembling legs.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, they had immense power and influence. A single word from them could determine a region's economy or the appointment of officials. But now, they felt utterly powerless and weak.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince's gaze swept over the young woman. Even though her beauty was stunning, like an immortal descending to the mortal world, he didn't dare look at her for long. His gaze landed on the young man's face. When he saw that familiar face, his eyes lit up with joy: "Mr... Mr. Qi, I'm the Seventh Prince!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>As expected... the one who destroyed the thirteen Sky Eyes was Mr. Qi's... female companion.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi had come to the capital, intending to cause trouble for the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Wang Wenmin's call, he immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>Investing in Qi Yuan meant protecting Qi Yuan, helping them remove the obstacles posed by the Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after arriving at the Mu family residence, he was humiliated.</p><p></p><p>The Mu family didn't take him, a member of the royal family, seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>He felt very frustrated, thinking his plan had fallen apart.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't expect fate to play such a huge joke on him.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi... had single-handedly destroyed all the Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? It was unimaginable, incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>Didn't this mean that if Mr. Qi wanted to... he could destroy the remaining Sky Eyes in the heavens at any time?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't this Qi Yuan be... not just Qin Yuan Kingdom's, but the entire Gongxing's true uncrowned king?</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a prince? That's rare. In all my life, I've met quite a few princesses, but not many princes," Qi Yuan casually greeted.</p><p></p><p>After the greeting, his gaze swept across the hall, his brows furrowing.</p><p></p><p>"Fear? Killing intent? Hatred?... Hmm, I think all these people should be killed. None of them are innocent," Qi Yuan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>With one sentence, he decided the fate of the three hundred Mu family members in the room.</p><p></p><p>The Mu family members' faces changed drastically, their gazes towards Qi Yuan turning fearful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, where was the high and mighty image of the Mu family members? They all looked like dead dogs.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Mr. Qi, the Mu family's actions against you have nothing to do with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, spare my life! I have money, wealth, and women - I can give them all to you!" a middle-aged man said in panic.</p><p></p><p>Without the Sky Eyes, facing a powerful cultivator like Qi Yuan, they had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, they were as powerless as ordinary people facing them.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a fierce character who could destroy even the Sky Eyes, a terrifying existence above the gods.</p><p></p><p>How could the Mu family have offended such a person?</p><p></p><p>Their pride, self-esteem, and arrogance vanished in this moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao, standing beside him, flashed a cold look in her eyes: "Trying to bribe my husband with women? He should die!"</p><p></p><p>With her words, that middle-aged man's body stiffened and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>All life signs vanished, clearly dead on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent. None of the Mu family members dared to speak, looking at Qi Yuan as if he were a demon god.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a thud was heard.</p><p></p><p>The arrogant old patriarch of the Mu family had fallen to his knees, his cloudy eyes filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>"Offending Mr. Qi is entirely my fault, Mu Wangshan's responsibility.</p><p></p><p>This sin is unforgivable, I should take my own life in apology.</p><p></p><p>I hope Mr. Qi will consider that the Mu family's lineage is not easily continued, and leave us... some descendants.</p><p></p><p>The entire Mu family is willing to become slaves to you, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The old Mu patriarch was also a tough character.</p><p></p><p>With the Sky Eyes destroyed, he knew the Mu family's decline was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Not only would Qi Yuan not let them off, but their past enemies wouldn't spare them either.</p><p></p><p>They had almost no chance of turning the tables.</p><p></p><p>The only chance was to seek Qi Yuan's forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>So he made a tough decision, directly offering the Mu family's thousand years of accumulated wealth as compensation to Qi Yuan, in exchange for a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p></p><p>After all, the vast wealth accumulated by a great family over a thousand years was enough to tempt anyone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the old Mu patriarch's words, Gongyi Cai's breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince's gaze also became complex.</p><p></p><p>The entire Mu family becoming slaves... this old Mu patriarch... was indeed cunning with age.</p><p></p><p>Such a hefty gift, probably no one in the world would refuse.</p><p></p><p>"No, Grandfather, our Mu family has a three-thousand-year heritage, with a thousand years as a noble family. How can we become slaves!" </p><p></p><p>A Mu family member stood up, tears in his eyes, clearly unable to accept this reality.</p><p></p><p>As true nobles, they had the pride of noble children.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years of heritage made it impossible for him to lower himself to be someone's slave.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, other Mu family members stood up: "We'd rather die than be slaves."</p><p></p><p>This voice received responses from many.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't imagine what kind of humiliation awaited them if they became slaves.</p><p></p><p>But most of the Mu family members present were actually tempted.</p><p></p><p>At this point, being able to stay alive was already fortunate, how could they consider so much?</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, you're really thinking too highly of yourselves," Qi Yuan's eyes showed disdain, "You bunch of... useless wastrels living in luxury, how are you worthy to be my slaves?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that make me lose face?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally looked down on the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>Their wealth, their heritage and accumulations were worthless in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their value to him wasn't even worth a joke to make him laugh.</p><p></p><p>These NPCs were really funny, thinking too highly of themselves.</p><p></p><p>"So... let's just kill them all. It'll save them from continuing to daydream, which would be too good for them," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The old Mu patriarch's eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's answer completely exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>How could there be someone who would refuse... the Mu family's thousand years of accumulated wealth?</p><p></p><p>But before he could think further, his consciousness stopped at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The over two hundred Mu family members in the hall... all became corpses in this instant.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince's heart shook, fear arising in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai also trembled, not daring to make any move.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's much quieter this way. Otherwise, with them talking in my ear every day, it would be too noisy," </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Killing over two hundred Celestial Dragons was very casual for him, just like squashing ants.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, if I remember correctly, the Mu family should have at least a few thousand people? Or tens of thousands? Should we... kill them all?" Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao, talking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"If my husband wishes to kill, this servant can use a spell right now. All those in this world with Mu family bloodline will perish instantly," Ning Tao answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>In her world, Qi Yuan was everything.</p><p></p><p>Whatever Qi Yuan said, she would do.</p><p></p><p>These words fell on the ears of the Seventh Prince and Gongyi Cai, their faces changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying spell... too horrifying!</p><p></p><p>This woman's heart... was also too frightening.</p><p></p><p>With this spell, the death toll wouldn't just be a hundred thousand, it might reach millions.</p><p></p><p>"No, that way wouldn't I become a mass murderer? I'm not someone who kills innocents indiscriminately," Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>He was a good person, never killing innocents indiscriminately, nor exterminating entire families, nor punishing by association.</p><p></p><p>"I've got it, why don't we... have a public vote!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes showed a satisfied smile, having thought of a satisfactory solution.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his large sleeve, and twenty-one people headed towards the third tall tower.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods had anxious looks on their faces, but were full of anticipation in their hearts. They wanted to see exactly how Qi Yuan had passed through the many checkpoints and entered the highest level of the tower to take away all the treasures.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they entered the third tower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said to everyone present: "Please wait a moment, let me calculate."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his eyebrows began moving rapidly. </p><p></p><p>The villagers beside him were used to this sight and thought nothing of it.</p><p></p><p>But those ancient gods were completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"He's really using his eyebrows to divine?"</p><p></p><p>"Can it be done like this?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Their worldview collapsed once again.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had thought Qi Yuan was using some profound magical technique, or had obtained some top secret information from within the tower.</p><p></p><p>But the result was truly the same eyebrow divination as at the entrance to the ancestral lands.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the legendary long-lost 'Dancing Eyebrows' celestial calculation method of the divine lord?" The ancient god Wang Song quickly got into character, directly addressing him as "divine lord" like a proper subject would.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister looked puzzled: "Is there really such a celestial calculation method? Why have I never heard of it?"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also looked at Wang Song. They hadn't heard of it either. </p><p></p><p>They wanted to find out Qi Yuan's background through Wang Song.</p><p></p><p>"It's normal that you don't know about a long-lost celestial calculation method," Wang Song replied.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient God Wang Song, since you know about this celestial calculation method, why don't you tell us about its origins and what makes it so powerful!" someone asked.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I don't know those details either. I'm completely ignorant about this celestial calculation method," Wang Song said.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Then how do you know about it? Where did you hear of it?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know about it, and I've never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"It's been lost for too long, how could I possibly know about it? I've never even heard of it before!" Wang Song said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were rendered completely speechless.</p><p></p><p>After all that, it turned out Wang Song had just made it up.</p><p></p><p>But it did sound quite reasonable when you thought about it.</p><p></p><p>If it had been lost for so long, wasn't it normal that none of them knew about it?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone follow me and copy my movements," Qi Yuan said at this point, opening his eyes and walking forward.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers hurriedly followed, walking through the spacious tower.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods saw this and quickly followed as well.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at a platform.</p><p></p><p>"It's temporarily safe here. You can move freely within a ten meter radius while I continue calculating," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods' eyes turned red at the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Dragon Silk!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Dragon Gauntlets!"</p><p></p><p>"Condensed Flame Essence!"</p><p></p><p>Many treasures were scattered around this small area.</p><p></p><p>These treasures were all quite precious.</p><p></p><p>Outside, one would have to fight to the death to obtain them, but here they were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods' eyes turned red as they frantically picked up the treasures on the ground.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't afraid of waking the puppet god, they would have even tried to take the floor tiles.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, move forward!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He led everyone towards the higher levels of the tower again.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, these ancient gods made a fortune, obtaining many rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan led everyone to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>The many ancient gods immediately started breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Aperture Essence!"</p><p></p><p>On the table were ten vials of Divine Aperture Essence.</p><p></p><p>One vial of Divine Aperture Essence could open one divine aperture! These ten vials could open a full ten apertures!</p><p></p><p>How could the ancient gods not be moved by this?</p><p></p><p>This kind of immortal liquid was a priceless treasure in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although a great venerable once declared that ten vials of Divine Aperture Essence was the limit of what a cultivator could consume.</p><p></p><p>But that was certainly an exaggeration!</p><p></p><p>[Divine Aperture Essence, a product of the Industrial Zone He Yao Factory No. 6 Office, nurturing babies' healthy growth. </p><p></p><p>He Yao Factory No. 6, born to nurture babies.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Divine Aperture Essence, Qi Yuan revealed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>In that short sentence was hidden a lot of useful information.</p><p></p><p>The three words "Industrial Zone" made Qi Yuan think of many things.</p><p></p><p>After entering the ancestral lands, Qi Yuan had discovered the abnormalities of this place.</p><p></p><p>Combined with this Industrial Zone, Qi Yuan instantly felt that these ancestral lands were like a small city.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the towers he had entered contained things like bathwater and firecrackers - items that seemed to belong in a residential area.</p><p></p><p>Having a residential area as well as an industrial zone was quite normal, right?</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan felt that in the later towers, there might well be an office for He Yao Factory No. 6.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Aperture Essence there would certainly not be as scarce as the mere ten vials here.</p><p></p><p>After all, there would definitely be more goods there.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, the advertising slogan "He Yao Factory No. 6, born to nurture babies" also made Qi Yuan unable to keep a straight face.</p><p></p><p>Do babies need to drink Divine Aperture Essence? Wouldn't that mean the babies are all Yin Gods? The background of these ancestral lands was frighteningly significant.</p><p></p><p>"You are all of the ancient race. Do you know when the ancestral lands fell into the Mortal Heart Realm?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Wang Song quickly replied: "Divine Lord, legend has it that when the heavens and earth of the Mortal Heart Realm first opened, the ancestral lands fell into it."</p><p></p><p>"That long ago?" Qi Yuan was surprised. "Hasn't this Divine Aperture Essence expired then?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's train of thought moved very quickly, just now he was thinking about the origins of the ancient race, and now he had switched to whether the essence had expired.</p><p></p><p>This left those present confused.</p><p></p><p>"Are the newborn babies of your ancient race very strong then?" </p><p></p><p>This Divine Aperture Essence looked just like nutritional liquid for infants.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary members of our race are about Foundation Establishment level when born, which is considered mid-level in the Mortal Heart Realm," Wang Song continued to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment at birth, it seems this baby oral liquid isn't meant for you to drink," Qi Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>According to what these ancient race members had said before, the ancient race came from outside the realm and were not natives of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>But combined with the information obtained so far, it was obvious that the ancient race were in fact natives.</p><p></p><p>Their babies were only at Foundation Establishment and couldn't drink Divine Aperture Essence.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the ancient race had some connection to the ancestral lands, and claimed to be from outside the realm in order to associate themselves with it.</p><p></p><p>"So the starting point is different for each race?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, everyone started as an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, the starting point was a Foundation Establishment great cultivator!</p><p></p><p>And in these so-called ancestral lands, the starting point was very likely to be Yin God.</p><p></p><p>This was especially terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, our sword points to He Yao Factory No. 6, our sword points to the path of true divinity!" Qi Yuan pocketed the Divine Aperture Essence and led everyone out the window to continue forward.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to speed up his progress.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were too few good things in the residential area.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to head to the industrial zone.</p><p></p><p>There would be mass-produced products there.</p><p></p><p>If they happened upon a warehouse, they would strike it rich.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, within the ancestral lands.</p><p></p><p>The muscular black man was covered in wounds, but his eyes were filled with excited laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Destiny is with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>He had found two broken vials of Divine Aperture Essence in a metal box.</p><p></p><p>Now, he poured the Divine Aperture Essence into his mouth, and divine apertures continuously condensed within his body.</p><p></p><p>In just a hundred breaths of time, he had condensed two divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>"The gains this time are far better than before!"</p><p></p><p>The muscular black man was elated.</p><p></p><p>This time he had followed Old Snake, giving Old Snake a fright.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Old Snake ignite his divine apertures to flee, he was dumbfounded and in the end didn't have the heart to ignite his own divine apertures to chase after him.</p><p></p><p>At the Yin God realm, whether one step to heaven or seven steps to heaven.</p><p></p><p>The difference in speed and strength was not actually that great, or one could say it was almost the same.</p><p></p><p>The difference between one step to heaven and three steps to heaven lay in the divine apertures, and in the utilization and quantity of divine power.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerables had divine domains, which were a powerful trump card that could easily slaughter one step to heaven Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>The muscular black man charged into the ancestral lands, somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>This also woke the puppet god, and after a great battle, he fled in a miserable state.</p><p></p><p>But then he found two vials of Divine Aperture Essence here, how could he not be excited?</p><p></p><p>"That kid's divination ability is indeed somewhat real," he said.</p><p></p><p>He lay down in a more comfortable position, completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>At his level, it would take nearly a thousand years of tempering to open one divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>Opening two in succession naturally made him pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"When I run into Yan Xi, Wang Song, Hu Ha and the others, this venerable can show off a bit this time."</p><p></p><p>"Right now, they're probably still fleeing for their lives somewhere!"</p><p></p><p>The muscular black man was very excited.</p><p></p><p>He was now thinking about running into those acquaintances and then showing off vigorously.</p><p></p><p>For ancient gods, over their long lifespans, showing off to their peers was something worth being happy about.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, two hours passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered a tower.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the ancient gods all had gleaming eyes, one after another.</p><p></p><p>They had struck it rich! They had made a fortune! Now they were like wealthy landowners.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had reaped a full harvest.</p><p></p><p>Although the lion's share went to Qi Yuan, their gains were ten times, even a hundred times what they had ever gained before combined! Most importantly, there had been no danger at all.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the tower, Qi Yuan revealed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"The air quality here is not good. Everyone put on a mask, otherwise you'll get sick," Qi Yuan warned.</p><p></p><p>His eyes saw that there were many small particles in the air here. If these particles were breathed in, even True Gods would fall ill.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the subjects immediately used magical techniques to seal their mouths, noses and ears.</p><p></p><p>They were already able to understand Qi Yuan's strange words.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan looked at Venerable Yan Xi with a puzzled expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yan Xi was confused: "Divine Lord, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Your fetish is a bit strange," Qi Yuan said, looking at Venerable Yan Xi who had golden gauze covering his head.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yan Xi became even more confused.</p><p></p><p>The others were also curious, not knowing what Qi Yuan meant.</p><p></p><p>"Wearing underwear on your head, are you some kind of perverted superhero? </p><p></p><p>No, you're even more perverted than a perverted superhero, you're wearing... the erotic version," Qi Yuan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Yan Xi's outfit, if seen on Earth, would definitely be considered perverted.</p><p></p><p>"Underwear? Erotic?" Yan Xi touched the fine golden gauze, confusion flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>This... is actually underwear?</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods hadn't thought of it that way before.</p><p></p><p>But hearing Qi Yuan say this, they looked at the golden veil on Venerable Yanxi's head, and the more they looked, the more it seemed like underwear.</p><p></p><p>"Pfft..." The twin sister was the first to burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods also laughed hysterically.</p><p></p><p>"This is actually underwear!"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Yanxi... too funny!"</p><p></p><p>"If the divine lord says it's underwear, then it must definitely be underwear!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods and villagers on the scene all burst into laughter, holding their stomachs.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Yanxi looked extremely embarrassed as he took off the golden veil.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to throw it away, but then couldn't bear to, so he put it back in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>His lifelong reputation!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, this is Heyao Factory No. 6. Hopefully the harvest will be decent," Qi Yuan waved his hand and led everyone inside.</p><p></p><p>He had finally arrived at the office of Heyao Factory No. 6.</p><p></p><p>"Heyao Factory No. 6?" The other ancient gods found it a bit strange, but weren't too surprised.</p><p></p><p>This tower of Heyao Factory No. 6 was indeed somewhat different from the other towers.</p><p></p><p>The other towers went upwards.</p><p></p><p>This tower went downwards.</p><p></p><p>Walking inside the tower, Qi Yuan showed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a place that sells medicine, even the puppet gods here are at the six steps of heaven-treading level."</p><p></p><p>Here, Qi Yuan had already discovered at least seven great venerable-level puppet gods in hiding.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the further down they went, the more puppet gods there were.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the ancestral land has been able to exist for so long," Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>This place was truly dangerous everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Qi Yuan had encountered a metal box-shaped trash can, and inside were three great venerables at the seven steps of heaven-treading level.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't dare provoke these puppet gods either.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even felt that all the forces of the mortal realm at their peak combined would not be able to breach the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>No wonder so many towers still stood tall here, with treasures still inside.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the ancestral land this time was the right choice.</p><p></p><p>With so many treasures, to what level could his people grow if they all used them?</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine!</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter where they went along the way, Qi Yuan had seemed very calm and indifferent, as if he didn't care about those treasures.</p><p></p><p>But here, Qi Yuan's reaction was different from other places.</p><p></p><p>He was also looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"This door is a bit heavy, I can't open it. A few of you ancient gods come and open it," Qi Yuan stopped in front of a large door at this time.</p><p></p><p>That door was made entirely of special alloy.</p><p></p><p>It was very heavy.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do it!" The man with a mole between his eyebrows stepped forward and gave the door a tug.</p><p></p><p>However, that force that could topple a mountain didn't budge the door at all.</p><p></p><p>"Get four people," Qi Yuan couldn't help but say when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>He also lamented that he was really too weak, unable to even open a door as a thief.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, three more ancient gods came forward to help, and four people exerted force together.</p><p></p><p>"Heh!"</p><p></p><p>"Ha!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Only then was this alloy door finally pulled open.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the ancient gods on the scene started breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the scene before them with incredulous expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Divine aperture essence!"</p><p></p><p>"Pain-relieving pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Spirit-cleansing powder!"</p><p></p><p>The spacious room was filled with all kinds of treasures.</p><p></p><p>These treasures were all stored in transparent glass boxes.</p><p></p><p>Endless, with no way to know how many there were.</p><p></p><p>These people's hearts trembled.</p><p></p><p>If ten doses of the divine aperture essence here were given to each ancient god in the mortal realm, there would still be a lot left over.</p><p></p><p>In addition, all kinds of other precious treasures could be seen here.</p><p></p><p>Things to increase cultivation, heal injuries, cure illnesses - everything one could want.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan now also revealed a smile: "This kind of loot barely befits my status."</p><p></p><p>He took quite a few divine aperture essences, as well as various other treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Each person take ten doses of divine aperture essence to use, and two of the other treasures," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present all had red eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Wang Song looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes full of emotion: "Divine Lord, I've decided to follow you from now on!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Wang Song's meaning was to completely become Qi Yuan's subject, not with a time limit.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, alright," Qi Yuan's heart had no fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were grateful and excited in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, since they didn't have osteoporosis after all, while they were grateful now, they couldn't bring themselves to completely lose their freedom for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all the ancient gods present took divine aperture essence and other treasures according to Qi Yuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare take more.</p><p></p><p>After taking the divine aperture essence, these ancient gods couldn't wait to pour it into their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the ancient gods on the scene broke through one after another, the scene extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Happy Arhat also broke through to the second step of heaven-treading in one go.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally reached the second step of heaven-treading!" An ancient god said with joy.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I'd reach the late stage of the second step of heaven-treading, with the prospect of entering the third step!" The twin sister sighed.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the scene was full of joy and excitement, their minds filled with immense happiness.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like an ordinary Blue Star worker with a monthly salary of 5000 suddenly receiving 100 years' worth of salary.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhao Zun and other villagers who had not entered the realm of true gods hugged the divine aperture essence, also very envious.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he still could not enter the realm of true gods, so these treasures were useless to him even if he had them.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely jealous, and also felt a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know when he would be able to break through to true god.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since everyone has broken through, let's continue to look at the other warehouses," Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>He had put all the densely packed boxes in the room into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Next, five more warehouses were opened.</p><p></p><p>Two of them appeared to have been destroyed, with nothing good left inside.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three warehouses also had densely packed treasures no less valuable than divine aperture essence.</p><p></p><p>Having been shocked by the divine aperture essence earlier, these ancient gods were better able to accept this sight.</p><p></p><p>The shock in their hearts lingered for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Heyao Factory No. 6 isn't very good, it's all for babies, don't they have anything for adults?" Qi Yuan was unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>He had already led everyone to the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>They had entered over 70 towers.</p><p></p><p>There were still three levels of the ancestral land he had not yet explored.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the seventh level of the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>A burly man wore a streamlined liquid battle armor, with flowing light moving on the armor, colorful and brilliant.</p><p></p><p>This battle armor was excavated from the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>The burly man was named Arrogant Great Venerable, and this was only his second time entering the seventh level of the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>The first time, he entered when he was at the Purple Palace realm, and by chance stepped into true god.</p><p></p><p>Later, he became a great venerable, but didn't dare enter again.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had been researching the ancestral land, and finally made some discoveries.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these research results came more from the ancient gods' research on the ancestral land before the Great Flood War.</p><p></p><p>Now, the streamlined battle armor on his body could greatly increase his survival rate when entering the seventh level of the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he looked at the Snake Elder before him with a cold expression, his gaze deep.</p><p></p><p>"Your undercover identities were discovered by them?"</p><p></p><p>Snake Elder and the other ancient gods looked terrified. They were also wearing this type of streamlined battle armor, but it was clearly far inferior to Arrogant Great Venerable's.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that newcomer pointed us out immediately. I suspect a great venerable discovered our plot!"</p><p></p><p>Snake Elder reported what had happened to Arrogant Great Venerable truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Arrogant Great Venerable narrowed his eyes: "They didn't kill you, so it's not your fault."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Snake Elder breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Arrogant Great Venerable was temperamental, and they were afraid of being blamed by him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid of me, we are all ancient gods and should look out for each other. I am alone on the new gods' side, and it's hard to accomplish things single-handedly. I need some people to help. You are ancient gods like me, so I can use you with peace of mind," Arrogant Great Venerable's voice softened.</p><p></p><p>The worry in Snake Elder's heart completely dissipated, and he even felt a sense of being valued: "We are willing to serve Arrogant Great Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods felt the same.</p><p></p><p>"As it happens, I have another matter that I need to trouble you all with," Arrogant Great Venerable spoke, his voice earnest.</p><p></p><p>"Please tell us, Great Venerable!" Snake Elder quickly said.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to make up for not handling things well earlier.</p><p></p><p>"To open the side door of this tower, we need to burn some true gods. We're just short a few, so I'll have to trouble you... to enter the tower," Arrogant Great Venerable said gently.</p><p></p><p>Snake Elder's expression suddenly changed drastically, and a strong sense of threat came over him.</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>He started cursing loudly, wanting to flee.</p><p></p><p>But a divine realm opened, and he was immediately pressed down unable to move.</p><p></p><p>At this time, several new gods wearing streamlined battle armor came forward, with mocking smiles in their eyes as they pressed them down and threw them into the terrifying furnace in front of the tower.</p><p></p><p>That furnace could burn even true gods to ashes!</p><p></p><p>Arrogant Great Venerable didn't give Snake Elder and the other ancient gods any chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these ancient gods didn't know, but which new god didn't know that the cruelest to ancient gods was this ancient god Arrogant Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps to show his loyalty, to prove his devotion, he was truly ruthless towards ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Kui, Tan Zui, you two take action and bring that group of ancient gods who entered the ancestral land here. To open this door, we still need some true god corpses," Arrogant Great Venerable spoke.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, two terrifying new gods wearing streamlined battle armor appeared.</p><p></p><p>These two new gods were both powerful experts at the third step of heaven-treading!</p><p></p><p>With experts at the third step of heaven-treading taking action, how could that group of ancient gods at the first and second steps resist?</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!"</p><p></p><p>The male and female new gods lowered their heads, their forms disappearing.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

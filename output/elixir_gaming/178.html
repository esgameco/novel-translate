        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you really not going to help Liu Yan?" asked the tall man in iron armor.</p><p></p><p>"That Liu Yan has an overbearing personality and has been disrespectful to the divine lords many times. He should have died long ago to make room!" said the short man in iron armor.</p><p></p><p>The tall man nodded, "This ancient god of Qingshui Village has some ability, having already killed two new gods."</p><p></p><p>The short man said, "That's good. The new gods under Kuangfeng Town are not directly under our lord. We can wipe them out clean, then our lord can take action to slaughter the ancient god of Qingshui Village, and bring in his direct subordinates here!"</p><p></p><p>The evil god Civet Wolf of Kuangfeng Town had naturally learned of Qi Yuan's arrival several days ago. </p><p></p><p>However, Civet Wolf didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that the new gods that had descended in the villages under Kuangfeng Town were not his direct subordinates, and some were even hostile to his faction.</p><p></p><p>So he directly used the ancient god Qi Yuan's hand to slaughter the villages under Kuangfeng Town clean.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he would kill Qi Yuan and could openly insert his own people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Civet Wolf wasn't a fool. He also understood the principle of raising a tiger to invite trouble.</p><p></p><p>So he sent two temple guards to scout out the enemy situation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sound of suona horns blew, and the two temple guards perked up and looked over.</p><p></p><p>They saw a long procession advancing quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, this procession didn't look like it was going to battle, but rather like a funeral procession.</p><p></p><p>The tall iron-armored guard couldn't help but smile: "This ancient god of Qingshui Village is truly a clever god."</p><p></p><p>"The divine dog leading the way is quite extraordinary!" said the short one.</p><p></p><p>"But it's only early Purple Palace stage, nothing to fear!" said the tall one.</p><p></p><p>As temple guards, they were the elite warriors of Kuangfeng Town, also at the early Purple Palace stage.</p><p></p><p>There were over thirty guards of their level in Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>Naturally they looked down on a mere early Purple Palace stage black dog.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that ancient god of Qingshui Village's strength hasn't even reached Purple Palace, but he has a powerful sacrificial tool. It was by relying on that sacrificial tool that he killed two new gods!" said the short one. "This sacrificial tool should be Lord Civet Wolf's for the taking!"</p><p></p><p>Among the seven towns, Lord Civet Wolf's reputation wasn't prominent.</p><p></p><p>But these assimilated temple guards knew best that the Civet Wolf they believed in wasn't simply at the peak of Purple Palace in strength.</p><p></p><p>He had even opened half a divine aperture! This could be called a demigod!</p><p></p><p>That's why South Palace Wuji at the peak of Purple Palace was injured by Civet Wolf.</p><p></p><p>The two hid to the side as the suona sounds grew louder.</p><p></p><p>The tall one smiled, "The show is about to begin!"</p><p></p><p>The two watched the village battle with the superior attitude of those in high positions.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Yan of Xiaoshi Village soared into the air, emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"Sending a mere dog to provoke me, Qingshui Village has insulted me so, they must face retribution!"</p><p></p><p>The suona procession hadn't arrived yet, but the sound came first.</p><p></p><p>The evil god Liu Yan took to the air, the villagers' faith condensing into a sacrificial tool, emanating the aura of an innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he attacked directly, venting the anger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This strike of innate divine ability, accumulated over decades, was incredibly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even a cultivator at mid Purple Palace stage would find it difficult to easily block this power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was only one strike.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked worried: "Can the big black dog handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Although the big black dog was at Purple Palace stage, and would definitely be stronger than Liu Yan in a prolonged battle.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it had just broken through to Purple Palace using the visualization method.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't skilled in mastering innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Unless the level of its innate divine ability was too high, it wouldn't be able to withstand this attack! Village Chief Yu Lu and Divine Official Shen Tu both had this thought.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't expected the enemy to be so troublesome.</p><p></p><p>At the front of the villagers, a mocking look flashed in the big black dog's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly flew towards the sky, letting out a lion-like roar that shook the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Its bloody maw sucked at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then... a terrifying thing happened.</p><p></p><p>The clouds in the sky at this moment were like river water with a huge hole, all pouring into the big black dog's mouth.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability of Howling Celestial Dog was to swallow clouds and spit mist.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog had also visualized and obtained it!</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the clouds in the sky like a whale.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog spat towards Liu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, multicolored mist gushed out.</p><p></p><p>Sky-scorching flames, earth fire, fierce winds and more were mixed within.</p><p></p><p>This mist was not ordinary mist at all.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yan's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Your innate divine ability... how is it not of this world's origin!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand, then let out a scream of agony.</p><p></p><p>His sacrificial tool had long since burned up in this innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>His body was also being cut to pieces.</p><p></p><p>That wasn't mist at all!</p><p></p><p>It was fire! At this time, the tall man and short man hiding in the distance widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not an innate divine ability of this world, an evil god?"</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had long since learned to conceal the origins of his innate divine abilities, and even influenced those who saw his innate divine abilities through the Golden Elixir of Fixed Stars.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog didn't know how.</p><p></p><p>It had just comprehended this innate divine ability, and hadn't had time to adapt and transform it into an innate divine ability of this world.</p><p></p><p>So as soon as it made a move, all the strong people present could judge that this was an innate divine ability that didn't belong to this world! The tall man and short man's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of an evil god, this kind of thing had to be reported to Lord Civet Wolf immediately.</p><p></p><p>The two were just about to quietly retreat.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vertical pupil appeared beside the big black dog.</p><p></p><p>A voice that seemed to contain the rules of heaven and earth rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What petty thieves are lurking here!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze was involuntarily drawn to the afterimage of that vertical pupil.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The short iron-armored man trembled all over.</p><p></p><p>Just from the afterimage of the vertical pupil, he was terrified, his whole body shaking, as if facing an invincible, majestic heavenly god.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of... true god is this?" The tall man couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>He had once seen a believer of an ancient god observe a great lord level innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>But compared to this vertical pupil afterimage, it wasn't even one hundredth, or even one ten thousandth as powerful!</p><p></p><p>This was an existence he couldn't comprehend!</p><p></p><p>Following that majestic, cold and emotionless voice.</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared out of thin air, and the bodies of the short and tall iron-armored men instantly turned to ash at this moment! They completely disappeared from this world.</p><p></p><p>In Kuangfeng Town, Civet Wolf suddenly opened his eyes, a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, he suddenly had a sense of great disaster approaching, as if some great terror had descended.</p><p></p><p>And his body was also inexplicably injured, for no reason.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... a god is targeting me?" Civet Wolf's expression flickered between light and dark.</p><p></p><p>"I need to... keep a low profile for a while."</p><p></p><p>Civet Wolf decided that before figuring out what was going on, he needed to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu looked at the vanished vertical pupil, his heart unable to calm for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan was the same. In all his years, this was the first time he had seen such a powerful and majestic, even indescribable phantom.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog knelt on its front legs, its tail wagging frantically.</p><p></p><p>The crowd on the scene had serious expressions, all knowing that this matter was absolutely terrifying and could not be leaked.</p><p></p><p>"What happened today, anyone who leaks it will have their body destroyed and corpse obliterated!" Village Chief Yu Lu spoke.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi also realized the importance of the matter.</p><p></p><p>Those wailing aunties and uncles, as well as the fat-headed cooks, all nodded.</p><p></p><p>The lowest cultivation among them was Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Most were at the Core Formation stage.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Qi Yuan in the temple opened his eyes, a look of surprise in them: "Buy one get one free?"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that just by visualizing the Howling Celestial Dog, he would be gifted... the big gift package of Erlang Displaying Holiness True Lord!</p><p></p><p>Erlang God has extremely legendary mythological colors in Blue Star's mythological history.</p><p></p><p>Like Yang Jian in "Investiture of the Gods", or the Erlang God who split the mountain to save his mother, or the Guankou God who fought evenly with the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No matter which mythology or legend, this was top-tier combat power.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that Qi Yuan had a feeling that even the spiritual power of a hundred previous-level evil gods couldn't summon this great deity.</p><p></p><p>As a result, visualizing Howling Celestial Dog unexpectedly came with a buy-one-get-one-free deal.</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't the true form of Erlang Shen, or even a projection, but merely a residual image formed from Howling Celestial Dog's memories, it was still terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"So, should I try visualizing more buy-one-get-one-free deals later?" Qi Yuan thought, but ultimately dismissed the idea.</p><p></p><p>Let things happen naturally.</p><p></p><p>However, this feeling of leveling up while sitting down was truly amazing.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had reached level 30 as a divine being. According to this world's calculations, he was already at the early stage of divine infant.</p><p></p><p>This was much faster than leveling up in Wangyue Continent or Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, time to feast!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand grandly.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Qi, let's go feast."</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village, Qi Qi and her maid Xiao Xue, who had been frowning while looking at the crops, heard the voice and their furrowed brows relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not worry about these troublesome matters for now, let's go feast with godfather!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, maid Xiao Xue's eyes lit up, as if fatty pork was already laid out before her, and she couldn't help but drool.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, turn your grief into appetite, let's eat!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan's opening remarks for the feast were very simple, without saying too much.</p><p></p><p>But the aunts and uncles of Shi Family Village were crying their hearts out.</p><p></p><p>Even as he ate, Qi Yuan felt sorrow welling up from within.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather... you actually visualized such a powerful divine visualization method!" Qi Qi, sitting to the side, had a look of surprise in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't seen the vertical pupils in action, only realizing after the feast when she saw the big black dog that Qi Yuan had given a divine visualization method to the dog.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog sat next to Qi Yuan, wagging its tail frantically, clutching a pork trotter in its paw, with a smug look in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi, sitting nearby, looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>Village chief Yu Lu also seemed to want to say something but held back.</p><p></p><p>Because such a precious divine visualization method was actually given to a dog.</p><p></p><p>What a waste!</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, such a powerful divine visualization method, capable of creating a true god... using it so casually is a bit of a shame," Qi Qi couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi, who had been silent until now, chimed in pitifully, "Divine One, how am I inferior to Big Black?"</p><p></p><p>The big black dog immediately glared at Zhu Zhuangshi.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan hadn't been nearby, it probably would have attacked its former master directly.</p><p></p><p>"Because you're not a dog," Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"I... I can be a dog too," Zhu Zhuangshi said, sneaking a glance at the big black dog.</p><p></p><p>Compared to such a powerful divine visualization method, what did it matter to be a dog? This was a chance to become a true god.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled and said, "There will be plenty of opportunities in the future."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's eyes lit up with joy when she heard this: "Has godfather met other true gods?"</p><p></p><p>"Quite a few," Qi Yuan answered honestly, adding in his heart, on TV, in movies, in miscellaneous books.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi was also somewhat delighted.</p><p></p><p>The godfather she had invested in was indeed no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Her judgment was quite good.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, powerful divine visualization methods like this are not easy to visualize, and shouldn't be casually given to... dogs," Qi Qi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>In her view, divine visualization methods of this level were probably difficult for even her godfather to visualize many of.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were only so many true gods, and only so many that had received worship in the past.</p><p></p><p>If godfather had seen them, other ancient gods had seen them too.</p><p></p><p>So divine visualization methods that weren't unique might not be as powerful.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, there are plenty more. As long as there's enough evil god spiritual power, we can have whatever we want."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was looking forward to it - what would it be like if he could visualize all the gods and immortals in the heavens?</p><p></p><p>It must be very interesting, right?</p><p></p><p>Looking at her godfather, Qi Qi didn't try to persuade him further, but said, "Godfather, we now have the territory of four villages. It's not sustainable to hold a feast every time we conquer a village."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was speaking the truth.</p><p></p><p>Right now everyone was eating and drinking well, but with more people, this couldn't go on. After all, holding feasts every day would quickly deplete a village's resources.</p><p></p><p>Even if they conquered new villages, what if the new villages didn't have enough grain and meat?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "We need to conquer more villages, as long as we keep passing it on, there will always be feasts to eat."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi couldn't help but smile bitterly: "Godfather, this won't work. We need to establish our own base."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also understood the meaning behind Qi Qi's words.</p><p></p><p>"It's all the enemy's fault for being too poor, otherwise we could hold feasts for them every day!" Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>These new gods were too useless, after so many years of management, they couldn't even become filthy rich.</p><p></p><p>Yu Cai was even hesitant about holding a grand feast.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present felt a hint of pity for those dead evil gods when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Kill them, take their things, use their things, and then feast.</p><p></p><p>How miserable.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, one shouldn't oppose the Origin Venerable, or it would be too tragic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was also quite speechless, and said, "We need to plant more crops, and ensure good harvests."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded: "Should we also raise some pigs?"</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue, who was eating pork, nodded frantically when she heard this: "Yes, I support raising pigs."</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave these matters to you then," Qi Yuan looked at maid Xiao Xue.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well leave pig-raising to his goddaughter, could he?</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue was stunned for a moment, then her eyes lit up: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan asked again: "How many new gods are left to kill in Kuangfeng Town?"</p><p></p><p>"Including the one in Kuangfeng Town, there are nine left."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, in the coming days, we'll kill one each day!" Qi Yuan commanded.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't kill too many in one day, or the feasts would conflict.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple.</p><p></p><p>The Civet Wolf Evil God appeared, his expression not very good.</p><p></p><p>"What business do you have with me?" Ever since being mysteriously injured last time, he had been lying low to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Divine One, our five great families are preparing to summon that great personage!" The plump man's eyes revealed excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Civet Wolf Evil God was surprised to hear this: "Wasn't it supposed to be in a few years?"</p><p></p><p>"We have confirmed that the Ancient God Yuan Shen is severely injured and unable to awaken. This is the best opportunity for us to summon a new god!"</p><p></p><p>"This is good news." The Civet Wolf hesitated before slowly speaking.</p><p></p><p>If a true god descended, Fehuang City would fall completely under his control.</p><p></p><p>"However, to summon the new god, we still need Civet Wolf's assistance!" The plump man's eyes held a pleading look.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"To summon this true god, we need to create an environment of plague, which still requires Civet Wolf's efforts."</p><p></p><p>"Spread a plague in Fehuang City? Very well, but I'll need a few days."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the plump man's eyes lit up with joy: "We are grateful for the Divine One's help!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village, Qi Yuan walked with Qi Qi along the ridges between fields, looking at the thin crops with a complex expression: "You're right, these crops all look a bit..."</p><p></p><p>In the past two days, Qi Yuan had eliminated two more new gods.</p><p></p><p>He now had two more evil god spiritual powers in hand.</p><p></p><p>One of them was at the Purple Palace level, surpassing many others.</p><p></p><p>Now, as their territory expanded, he also felt the shortage of food.</p><p></p><p>This made him sigh that the Canglang Realm where one could practice abstinence from food was better.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators here ate too much.</p><p></p><p>"Does godfather have any solutions?" Qi Qi had been managing the logistics of Qi Yuan's territory, "Right now, if we pile up all our grain, it's only enough for three months."</p><p></p><p>"If only I had Golden Arowana," Qi Yuan couldn't help but lament.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

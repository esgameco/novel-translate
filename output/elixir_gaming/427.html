        <h1>Chapter 427</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord Heng concealed his form and secretly headed towards the Broken Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Since there might be some issues with Demon Lord Eye, he would let Demon Lord Flame keep watch.</p><p></p><p>He hid his form as he passed by many yin spirits. </p><p></p><p>Even though he was within a few miles of many yin spirits, none of the yin spirits in the Broken Moon Abyss detected Demon Lord Heng's presence.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Demon Lord Heng's figure stopped, and he gazed into the depths of the Broken Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The formation blocked his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Although his power far exceeded that of Demon Lord Flame, he did not possess Demon Lord Eye's ability to observe minute details.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he could not discern much at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord Flame, please come out to meet me quickly," Demon Lord Heng transmitted.</p><p></p><p>As a yang spirit of the Ultimate Principle realm, his status and position were higher than Flame's, so naturally he was not going to pay a visit.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the voice fell, the formation in the depths of the Broken Moon Abyss rippled, and a man in gray robes hurriedly came out, seeming somewhat flustered.</p><p></p><p>This naturally revealed fluster could deceive cultivators of the same level, but for those of a higher Ultimate Principle realm, it was easily detected.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Demon Lord Heng!" Qi Yuan bowed his head respectfully, with a hint of surprise on his face. "May I ask what brings Your Excellency to my Broken Moon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was trying his best to act, without even any mental activity.</p><p></p><p>"Flame, have you seen Demon Lord Eye recently?" Demon Lord Heng glanced at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I visited Demon Lord Eye as usual a few days ago. </p><p></p><p>At that time, Demon Lord Eye invited me to... ambush the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>However, I was at a critical point in refining a pill, so I declined Demon Lord Eye's invitation.</p><p></p><p>Now... could it be..." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to act, with a shocked expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord Eye has suffered some injuries," Demon Lord Heng said with a profound expression. "I suspect the Moon Palace has inflicted serious injuries on him, which have already affected him. As I am too far from the Absolute Moon Abyss to keep an eye on things here at all times, I need you to watch him for me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became solemn: "Demon Lord Heng, you suspect Demon Lord Eye..."</p><p></p><p>He swallowed, not finishing the rest of his sentence.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to keep watch and report to me at any time," Demon Lord Heng did not say more.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" Qi Yuan bowed his head, not daring to look directly at Demon Lord Heng.</p><p></p><p>"You may go back now," Demon Lord Heng said flatly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan hurriedly returned with a flustered expression.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed, and Demon Lord Heng narrowed his eyes, his gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>"This Flame is also a bit strange, there's no scent of newly refined treasure pills on him."</p><p></p><p>Flame had just said he refused Demon Lord Eye's request because he was refining pills.</p><p></p><p>So Flame should have been continuously refining pills.</p><p></p><p>He could smell the scent of treasure pills on Flame, but upon careful discernment, it was the kind of pill aroma that had been completed long ago, not the kind that was still being refined or just finished.</p><p></p><p>So, Demon Lord Flame was lying about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"He probably has some small secrets," Demon Lord Heng's gaze was profound. "It's a pity my true body is too far from this place, otherwise I would like to see what exactly Flame's little secret is."</p><p></p><p>His gaze was deep as an inspiration struck him.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord Abandon is next to the Broken Moon Abyss, I'll have him watch Flame," Demon Lord Heng thought for a moment, then headed towards the area guarded by Demon Lord Abandon.</p><p></p><p>That's right, Demon Lord Heng was very skilled at nesting dolls.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, at the Cloud-Following Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The armored woman had changed into a plain green robe, the killing aura around her somewhat dissipated.</p><p></p><p>She walked out of the Cloud-Following Pavilion, her expression carrying a hint of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt, aren't we enemies with the Demon Luo clan and still at war? Why are we borrowing from them?" Young lady Mu Bihua wore a puzzled expression, very confused.</p><p></p><p>Today, she had accompanied her aunt to the area operated by the Demon Luo clan to borrow money.</p><p></p><p>The amount of celestial jade borrowed was an astronomical figure.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Luo clan would gradually transport this celestial jade to their clan.</p><p></p><p>"War is war, business is business," said the tall man. "It may seem that in the Demon Abyss, the Demon Luo clan and the Moon Palace have been at war for nearly hundreds of thousands of years, but until now... only some yin spirits have died, not a single yang spirit or Celestial Lord has fallen."</p><p></p><p>The tall man spoke with some感慨.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the grudges between these great powers seemed particularly ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Only the lower levels suffered casualties.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons sat high in the heavens, untouched by enmity.</p><p></p><p>At any time, a single order could turn enemies into allies.</p><p></p><p>"So naturally, this business can be done," the tall man said, his face showing a suspicious expression. "I just don't understand why the Moon Lady ordered us to borrow from the Demon Luo clan. The interest is quite high."</p><p></p><p>Because of their enmity, the interest rate the Demon Luo clan charged them was higher than usual.</p><p></p><p>The interest they had to repay to the Demon Luo clan every ten years was an astronomical figure.</p><p></p><p>In fact, just the interest alone every ten years amounted to several celestial jade mines given to the Demon Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>A single celestial jade mine was enough to support a yin spirit venerable to step into the great venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, with so much celestial jade, most of our family assets will be used to pay interest to the Demon Luo clan!" Thinking about having to repay the loan, the young lady made a bitter face, very unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a slightly mocking voice came, and a fat-headed man walked over: "Could it be that you don't know? Your Moon Lady has fallen for a little spirit and willingly gave up her position as the Moon Lady of the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now... I guess she lacks resources for cultivation, so she's borrowing celestial jade from the Demon Luo clan."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fat-headed man, Mu Tianshui coldly snorted: "Even if the young miss loses her Moon Lady status, it's not something your little Zhao family can afford to offend!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the fat-headed man's face stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, because of the Moon Lady's existence, their Zhao family was far inferior to the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>But even if Jin Li lost her Moon Lady status, the current Mu family was still not something they could compare to.</p><p></p><p>However, the fat-headed man still couldn't help saying: "Our Zhao family can still send daughters to the Moon Palace, with a chance to gain the Moon Lady status.</p><p></p><p>Your Mu family voluntarily gave up the Moon Lady status, cutting off the qualification to send female clan members into the Moon Palace!</p><p></p><p>This loan from the Demon Luo clan is enough to give you a hard time.</p><p></p><p>In a thousand or ten thousand years, when your breakthrough to yang spirit fails, your Mu family... will be completely finished!"</p><p></p><p>This fat-headed man naturally believed that Jin Li, having lost her Moon Lady status, would not receive resource support.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to break through and enter the legendary yang spirit Celestial Lord realm, changing her fate against the odds, she recklessly borrowed celestial jade from the Demon Luo clan in a desperate gamble.</p><p></p><p>Such myths were not uncommon, but the results were always tragic.</p><p></p><p>How could becoming a yang spirit be so easy?</p><p></p><p>In the five realms around them, even in the Sixth Heaven territory, not a single yang spirit Celestial Lord had ever emerged since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Having said this, he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, those misfits of the Zhao family are really dreaming!" Young lady Mu Bihua said angrily. "The Moon Lady will definitely break through to yang spirit and slap this guy's face hard!"</p><p></p><p>The tall man then looked at Mu Tianshui: "The Moon Lady's dao companion... what kind of person is he?"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>Mu Bihua also looked over, her eyes expectant.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Lady giving up her status for a man had caused an uproar in the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>One clan elder even</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He immediately took out his own divine infant, wanting to present it to Jinli, to make her give up her decision.</p><p></p><p>Some were weeping bitterly. </p><p></p><p>Few actually recognized their true status. After all, they were used to relying on their seniority, and some were extremely stubborn.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no need for Jinli to take action, as Mu Tianshui had already dealt with these elders.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's decision was the will of the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Tianshui thought of the man beside the young lady, her gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, it was the first time she had seen the young lady act like such a young girl.</p><p></p><p>"He... has outstanding looks," Mu Tianshui finally thought of this one merit of Qi Yuan after pondering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't think of any other merits.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Mu Bihua blinked. </p><p></p><p>Was the Moon Lady so shallow as to only look at appearances? "Anything else?" Mu Bihua asked again.</p><p></p><p>"His way of speaking... is witty, humorous, and imaginative," Mu Tianshui finally chose a diplomatically intelligent answer.</p><p></p><p>Actually, hearing Qi Yuan's words, she found them ridiculous, absurd, and bewildering.</p><p></p><p>What was all that about adding an egg to noodles, eating beef?</p><p></p><p>And the Moluo clan's downfall, borrowing high-interest loans?</p><p></p><p>What did any of that have to do with anything? If Qi Yuan wasn't the young lady's beloved, she would have even suspected he was a crazed cultivator who had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>"Good looks, plus a mouth that can please girls, no wonder the Moon Lady is fond of him," the tall man sighed.</p><p></p><p>Mu Bihua didn't want to speak.</p><p></p><p>She felt it would be better if Qi Yuan didn't talk at all, as talking only lost him points.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Moon Lady's actions... will bring fortune or disaster," the tall man said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing so many celestial jades from the Moluo clan had placed an extremely heavy debt on the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>The only way out was for the Moon Lady to break through to the Yang Spirit realm, there was no other option.</p><p></p><p>Could they really count on the Moluo clan disappearing?...</p><p></p><p>In Duan Yue Abyss, Qi Yuan lounged lazily with his legs crossed, dressed in a blood-red robe and holding the Linglong Yuxi in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Being an actor is so boring, sigh, having to pretend to be someone else every day, I wonder if I'll get depression?"</p><p></p><p>"The worst part is, no one pays me a salary."</p><p></p><p>"I've thought about it for a long time and still don't understand, who exactly owes me a salary!"</p><p></p><p>"I can't think about it anymore, it'll make my brain swell."</p><p></p><p>"But hehe, it's not bad, I've gained quite a lot these days, I've already caught two little fools, unfortunately they're only Yang Spirit realm cultivators at the Heavenly level."</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing, come start a video call, let me see!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to return to Wangyue Continent, chatting with Jinli.</p><p></p><p>The new Linglong Yuxi had added video call functionality.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't very difficult.</p><p></p><p>But due to the existence of miraculous treasures, such communications were blocked.</p><p></p><p>So when leaving Jue Yue Abyss, Qi Yuan had found Long Yue Tianzun and asked him to give him and Jinli permissions, not to block their communications.</p><p></p><p>On the Duan Yue Abyss side, Qi Yuan also had partial control of permissions, so he could give himself permission.</p><p></p><p>"Is there no one beside you?" Jinli's voice came from the Linglong Yuxi.</p><p></p><p>"No one, what's the matter?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a white light flashed on the Linglong Yuxi, and a hazy mist appeared in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's lotus-white arm held up the Linglong Yuxi, she was naked, sitting in a bathtub.</p><p></p><p>The hazy mist concealed her figure, with her exquisite shoulders and below hidden underwater. The milky white water could not block Qi Yuan's gaze, her white and delicate soft flesh faintly visible, with faint kiss marks still remaining.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's memory was instantly pulled back to that day of intimacy with Jinli.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed.</p><p></p><p>This water was so big and white.</p><p></p><p>If Ning Tao and Jinsi's were a handful,</p><p></p><p>Jinli's, though not as small as little junior sister's "no need for a bra", could still suffocate him.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't appropriate, is it?" Qi Yuan blinked.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately this was the cultivation world, and the Linglong Yuxi was made by him, operating on different principles than his previous life on Blue Star, so there was no need to worry about privacy leaks.</p><p></p><p>A reminiscent look appeared in Jinli's eyes: "Back when you killed Xuanyuan Jinshakong and chatted with me, I was also bathing.</p><p></p><p>At that time, hearing you say you killed Xuanyuan Jinshakong, I was hesitant in my heart.</p><p></p><p>It's similar to how I feel now, hearing you just say you captured two Yang Spirit cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Jinli said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she hadn't taken Qi Yuan's words seriously, even treating them as a joke.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan's claim of capturing two Yang Spirit cultivators was even more exaggerated than killing Xuanyuan Jinshakong.</p><p></p><p>Even if spread, no one would believe it, but this time she believed.</p><p></p><p>"People should be sincere with each other, I rarely lie!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Jinli covered her chest with one hand, making it appear even more trembling, a "great upheaval".</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do to me now?" Jinli asked with bright smiles in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>At that time, separated by the Linglong Yuxi, they couldn't even see each other.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was different.</p><p></p><p>"Kiss you?" Qi Yuan's gaze moved from top to bottom, lingering slightly on her lips, snow-white neck, fragrant shoulders, plump breasts and other areas, saying sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?" Jinli continued to ask expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze continued downward, pausing on her slender waist, with beautiful contours and distinct waistline.</p><p></p><p>He continued downward, a look of disappointment appearing in his eyes: "You're wearing underwear while bathing?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli's face reddened, she covered her mouth and laughed, but the scenery on her chest was also revealed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath, the smile on her face froze, because Qi Yuan's voice was somewhat... jarring?</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't your underwear have an elastic band? Otherwise, I could take it off, pull out the elastic, and tie up your hair.</p><p></p><p>You'll easily get your hair wet if you don't tie it up while bathing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to give himself ten thumbs up for his high emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>People with low EQ would only think about their own desires at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But he was different, he was a caring man, he could notice details others hadn't discovered.</p><p></p><p>Now Jinli, because she had no elastic to tie her hair, already had quite a bit wet and soaked in the bathtub.</p><p></p><p>"...Should we end the video call?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? You're right, you're bathing, this really isn't appropriate, let's end it." Qi Yuan was very considerate. As the saying goes, food and sex are human nature. He not only wanted to look, but also... But they had to respect each other, right?</p><p></p><p>"No." On the other side, Jinli shook her head. She gathered up her black hair, her expression gentle, gaze focused, eyes brimming: "I want to look at you a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... Jinli, do you want me to teach you a technique?" At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Jinli and pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan's improved version of the Glorious Sword!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Jinli nodded gently. Whatever Qi Yuan said, she would agree without question.</p><p></p><p>"This sword technique is extremely powerful, able to disguise one's own intense killing intent, transforming it into a sword of righteousness and light! Once this sword appears, one immediately looks like a righteous sect leader!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli blinked her watery eyes, water droplets splashing onto her snow-white face. She lowered her delicate head, a blush rising on her milk-white jade-like skin, adding a touch of charm.</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked a bit aggrieved: "I'm... very gentle."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 314</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha's eyes held a bright smile, her beauty living up to her title as princess. </p><p></p><p>Compared to those gorgeous celebrities online, her looks were no less stunning. More importantly, she had a certain aura about her.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll trouble you two to show me around Wuyun Pavilion," Princess Huansha said with a radiant smile.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang reminded them once again: "The Wu Sect is hiding in Longtai City, intending to harm Princess Huansha. You two must ensure the princess's safety even at the cost of your own lives."</p><p></p><p>Han Kang's words sounded scary, but in reality there was nothing to worry about. </p><p></p><p>The current Wuyun Pavilion had already been filled with his own people.</p><p></p><p>If the Wu Sect tried to harm Princess Huansha in Longtai City, that would be truly absurd.</p><p></p><p>However, the main purpose of his words was to remind the two to guarantee the princess's safety.</p><p></p><p>"You all don't need to follow, it's no fun with a big group," Princess Huansha said cheerfully as she walked towards Qi Yuan and Han Xian Yun.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Han Kang had a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>His brother's attitude towards him today was very different.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... he had heard something? Han Kang gave a few more instructions, and the minister from Liulisi also said a few words, before letting the three enter Wuyun Pavilion with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>The princess had an alarm device on her. If she encountered danger, an alarm would sound.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, if attacked, the princess's light energy shield would activate, able to withstand a sniper shot.</p><p></p><p>This time, the three entered Wuyun Pavilion smoothly without obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha seemed very talkative. Looking at Qi Yuan, she said slowly: "This gentleman seems to be in low spirits, did something unpleasant happen?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded vigorously: "I'm too poor."</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha was slightly stunned, not expecting Qi Yuan to be so direct.</p><p></p><p>Her impression of Qi Yuan worsened slightly.</p><p></p><p>She felt Qi Yuan was trying to use her connections.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to climb the social ladder was normal, but trying to do so without offering anything in return... was rather pathetic.</p><p></p><p>"I only have 100 million Qin yuan on me," Qi Yuan said, looking even more worried.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Princess Huansha was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>The thoughts she had just now also felt absurd and unfounded.</p><p></p><p>"100 million Qin yuan is already a lot," Huansha knew the exchange rate between the two countries. 100 million Qin yuan was a lot, an unattainable number for ordinary people in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"It's not much at all, I can't afford to buy what I want," Qi Yuan said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, what do you want to buy that costs 100 million? Are you planning to buy a fighter jet?" Han Xian Yun asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I want to buy... Gongxing," Qi Yuan said seriously. "Just now, I was humiliated and almost couldn't even enter Wuyun Pavilion. I need to buy Gongxing to get back at them, otherwise... it's too embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>"..." Han Xian Yun was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha: "...Sir, you must be joking, right?"</p><p></p><p>Buying Gongxing, he really dared to imagine.</p><p></p><p>Now she completely understood that she had misunderstood Qi Yuan. He wasn't trying to borrow money or ask for her help, he was just being too humorous.</p><p></p><p>"I have too little money. Recently I was scrolling through videos and saw several 20-year-old girls, like An Chuan and Jing Can, newly minted richest people with 800 trillion in assets. </p><p></p><p>Compared to them, I'm really too poor, too poor.</p><p></p><p>How much beef do I need to cut back on eating to save up that much money?" Qi Yuan truly felt the gap between people.</p><p></p><p>He was contemplating whether he should follow those accounts sometime and try to scam them into marriage?</p><p></p><p>One person has 800 trillion, scam half of it, scam a few of them, wouldn't that be enough to buy Gongxing? However, there was still one problem.</p><p></p><p>"You're a princess? You should have good connections. Can you help me find out something?" Qi Yuan looked at Princess Huansha expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha felt like she was on a roller coaster, her judgement constantly changing. She said very gently: "Please go ahead, sir."</p><p></p><p>"I want to know where I can buy Gongxing, and roughly how much it would cost," Qi Yuan asked his question.</p><p></p><p>He felt he needed to start saving money.</p><p></p><p>When eating beef noodles, he couldn't add an extra portion of beef anymore.</p><p></p><p>He had to economize to buy Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>"This... I don't know either," Princess Huansha smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>If it was just once or twice before, it could be called humor.</p><p></p><p>But now like this... it was just sick.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Qi Yuan looked quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun was sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>He had interacted with Qi Yuan before and knew his abilities, as well as understood his personality.</p><p></p><p>Was Qi Yuan being serious? He didn't dare continue this topic, so he changed the subject: "Princess Huansha, Wugui Country and Liulisi don't seem to have hostile relations, so why would the Wu Sect want to harm you?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun loved gossip, especially this kind involving noble royalty.</p><p></p><p>It seemed very dramatic, full of juicy details.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a flash of anger appeared in Princess Huansha's eyes: "These Wu Sect people say that I am the reincarnation of Wu God's daughter, and need to return to the heavenly realm to take care of Wu God day and night!"</p><p></p><p>When the princess of Liulisi was born, the king had even invited priests from Wugui to give blessings.</p><p></p><p>This was very common among royalty.</p><p></p><p>But this blessing turned out to be problematic.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sect priest said Princess Huansha was the reincarnation of Wu God's most beloved youngest daughter.</p><p></p><p>This youngest daughter was mischievous by nature and had secretly run away from the heavenly realm to the mortal world. She needed to return to the heavenly realm to accompany Wu God.</p><p></p><p>As for how to return to the heavenly realm, that was simple - through death.</p><p></p><p>So the Wu Sect had been plotting to kill Princess Huansha.</p><p></p><p>The king of Liulisi was of course furious about this.</p><p></p><p>Telling a noble princess to die was unacceptable in terms of family affection, and moreover, where would the royal family's face be?</p><p></p><p>However, Wugui and Liulisi had many trade deals, so this matter was never brought out into the open.</p><p></p><p>"These Wu Sect people are so shameless. I could say their Wu God is my wife too, does that mean they'll deliver Wu God to my bed?" Han Xian Yun said.</p><p></p><p>"You have a point," Princess Huansha covered her mouth and giggled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan beside them looked at Han Xian Yun coldly and said: "You scumbag, your wife's blood isn't even cold yet and you're already thinking about a new wife!"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was also quite a scumbag, he couldn't be like Han Xian Yun, calling someone his wife without even knowing if they were male or female.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, don't let down a good girl, don't waste a bad girl. Qi Yuan could only manage the first half.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Han Xian Yun thought of that terrifying wife and his legs went weak.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha beside them widened her eyes, as if discovering something incredible. However, being clever, she didn't pursue it further and continued changing the subject: "The Wu Sect is all talk. In fact, I've been living well all these years with my father's guards protecting me. The Wu Sect can't do anything to me at all."</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha's country Liulisi was a small country, but rich in energy resources. By selling resources, it had become extremely wealthy.</p><p></p><p>The guards around Princess Huansha were also numerous.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of genetically modified soldiers willing to die for her.</p><p></p><p>Now outside Wuyun Pavilion, there was such a team of warriors.</p><p></p><p>"The Wu Sect is indeed just big talk, blowing their own horn. Some time ago, a martial artist from our Qin Yuan country directly captured one of their priests!" Mentioning this, Han Xian Yun looked proud.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the few notable achievements of martial artists in today's society.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha smiled happily: "Actually, I've admired Qin Yuan's martial arts since I was young. Unfortunately, my father wouldn't let me practice, saying he was afraid I'd become a muscle woman."</p><p></p><p>She spoke casually, with a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>Han Xian Yun looked at Princess Huansha and said approvingly: "I think your father is right. If you practiced martial arts, the world might lose another peerless beauty. </p><p></p><p>Moreover... you must have taken genetic enhancement drugs, right? Your combat power is probably stronger than mine, there's no need to forcibly pursue the path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Genetic drugs are very effective, but I don't have any combat power at all. Otherwise, they wouldn't keep asking you to protect me when we came in," Princess Huansha smiled brightly, like warm sunshine on a winter day.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with us here, even if the Wu Sect's entire Shadow Team came, they couldn't do anything to you!" Han Xian Yun said, glancing at Qi Yuan beside him.</p><p></p><p>He had personally witnessed Qi Yuan's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Someone who could destroy an entire military camp could be called a terrestrial immortal!</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sect's strongest was the Shadow Team, all fanatics who often carried out suicide attacks.</p><p></p><p>But they were still mortals after all. Even with genetic enhancement drugs, how could they compare to an immortal like Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>One comes, one dies. Two come, a pair dies.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha noticed this detail and was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Although she admired martial artists, she also knew their abilities were limited.</p><p></p><p>This Han Xian Yun, why did he look at Qi Yuan with such confidence?</p><p></p><p>"How would you two protect me?" Princess Huansha then asked with a smile, her eyes fixed on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't dramatic gossip, she was still willing to explore and see people's little secrets.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Princess Huansha, seeming to seriously ponder her question: "That depends on what methods the Wu Sect uses."</p><p></p><p>"The Wu Sect's Shadow Team has thousands of members skilled in various guns and bladed weapons, specializing in assassination and hacking techniques. </p><p></p><p>When necessary, they can even provide air support. If ordinary martial artists encountered them... they wouldn't</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's a chance of winning," Princess Huansha answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun nodded: "To be honest, if I really encountered people from the Shadow Group here, I would have no chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>The combat teams of the Shadow Group had all taken gene-enhancing drugs, and specially made ones at that.</p><p></p><p>These special gene drugs could greatly enhance the user's abilities, but they would actually disrupt the body's balance. </p><p></p><p>The people in these combat teams wouldn't live past ten years.</p><p></p><p>This type of gene drug was officially banned in various countries.</p><p></p><p>But Wugui Country didn't bother to hide it.</p><p></p><p>And there were so many fanatics who worshipped the Crow God.</p><p></p><p>So the Shadow Group's combat teams never lacked for recruits.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed troublesome. Even on Blue Star, they could be opponents for the Dragon Team. </p><p></p><p>Except for the Crooked-Mouth Dragon King or the War God of Soldiers, almost no one could match them. It seems Princess Huansha, you are in great danger," Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun looked puzzled: "What Blue Star? What Dragon Team?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you a secret, I'm actually an alien, you bunch of... foreigners!"</p><p></p><p>"You're the foreigner!" Princess Huansha naturally didn't believe Qi Yuan's words and took it as a joke. "I'm in great danger, how will you protect me?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, just don't let them find you and everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Princess Huansha was confused, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"If the Shadow Group can't find you, they can't kill you. </p><p></p><p>So, the best way to protect Princess Huansha is to turn you into... a paramecium!" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>They didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>"Transform!" Qi Yuan pointed his hand, and the original Princess Huansha instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun's eyes widened: "Where's Princess Huansha?"</p><p></p><p>"She's right in front of you. I turned her into a paramecium. From now on, you should call her Princess Paramecium."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand near Han Xianyun: "See, Princess Huansha is right here."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun blinked his eyes but saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Come on brother, are you nearsighted? Such a big paramecium and you can't see it?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite exasperated. </p><p></p><p>To protect this paramecium from dying, Qi Yuan had even specially put a protective shield around it.</p><p></p><p>"I can't see it," Han Xianyun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you need to wear microscope glasses." Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The paramecium fell into a crack between bricks.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've put Princess Huansha in a safe place. We'll bring her back after we finish our tour.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Shadow Group can't see her, so she's very safe." Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun beside him still felt dazed.</p><p></p><p>Protecting the princess... is this how you protect her?</p><p></p><p>Turning the princess into a paramecium?</p><p></p><p>What kind of good person protects a princess like this? He found that after spending time with Qi Yuan, his head always felt dizzy and couldn't keep up.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he thought of something and blurted out: "Mr. Qi, now that the princess has turned into a paramecium, what if... we can't find her when we come back later?"</p><p></p><p>"That's simple, just borrow a microscope to look for her," Qi Yuan answered without thinking.</p><p></p><p>"But... what if I accidentally step on her while searching?" Han Xianyun was very worried.</p><p></p><p>Now that the princess had become a paramecium, such a tiny creature would probably drown if someone just spit on her.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, I'm sorry my friend, you're a murderer who assassinated the princess."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged and walked straight into the depths of Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun hesitated, but eventually followed.</p><p></p><p>Now his heart was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He could only pray to the gods that the princess would have good luck.</p><p></p><p>The two of them didn't bother with Princess Huansha anymore.</p><p></p><p>After all, wasn't the point to protect the princess? Wasn't turning her into a paramecium protection?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the two arrived at Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a thirteen-story wooden building.</p><p></p><p>By now, Han Xianyun had somewhat recovered, and his head wasn't so muddled.</p><p></p><p>"Wuyun Pavilion was built 1,300 years ago. What we see before us now is a reconstruction.</p><p></p><p>In this entire building, only one place has been preserved from 1,300 years ago, and it's the most precious part of Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>That is the Wuyun Carving.</p><p></p><p>The Wuyun Carving is made of specially crafted thunder-yin wood, buried at the bottom of mountains and rivers for a hundred years, and will not decay for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>On the Wuyun Carving are traces left by over a thousand martial artists over the past thousand years, for later generations to admire and learn from."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Wuyun Carving, Han Xianyun's eyes were full of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it called Wuyun Pavilion and not Wuyun Tower?" Qi Yuan's focus once again surprised Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe... the builder liked pavilions," Han Xianyun casually made up an answer.</p><p></p><p>The two took the elevator and quickly reached the top floor of Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor was a Wuyun Carving.</p><p></p><p>The Wuyun Carving was about ten square meters in size.</p><p></p><p>The entire Wuyun Carving was a wooden yellow color, with purple showing through the wood, vaguely giving off an air of nobility.</p><p></p><p>This kind of wood looked very suitable for making coffins at first glance.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of traces remained on the Wuyun Carving.</p><p></p><p>There were finger impressions, sword and knife marks, and even large footprints.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts abilities of these predecessors were truly terrifying, even able to leave marks on the Wuyun Carving with just their fingers.</p><p></p><p>Although I've reached the limit of martial arts, I absolutely cannot leave such marks with just my fingers.</p><p></p><p>These ancestors, in terms of personal strength, were probably on par with warriors who have taken high-level gene drugs.</p><p></p><p>To have such power without breaking through the martial arts limit, if they had broken through... what kind of sight would that be?" Han Xianyun sighed.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts lineage has been getting weaker from ancient times to the present.</p><p></p><p>According to historical records, two thousand years ago, Gongxing was full of martial artists, and even those who broke through the martial arts limit were as common as carps crossing a river.</p><p></p><p>But now, after a thousand years, except for one Luo Bufan, there hasn't been a single person who broke through the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>"You foreigners have quite a mixed bloodline, hmm chicken, duck, gecko, bird, dung beetle..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually commented while looking at the marks left on it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems your foreign ancestors were all like Xu Xian."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, looking seriously at Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>"It seems your liking for very wow wives isn't your own fault, it's an inherited blood problem from your ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>Through the Wuyun Carving, he could see the bloodlines contained in the bodies of those who had left marks on this wood carving in the past.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of small animals were present.</p><p></p><p>But speaking of this, Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because the boomerang had hit him.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's previous life was as a golden canary on Jiupan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>If he married and had children with a golden canary, wouldn't that mean... the children born would be somewhat similar to these foreigners?</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun continued to look confused, maintaining his state of mental chaos.</p><p></p><p>Because once again, he couldn't understand what Qi Yuan was saying.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, is what you said about bloodlines... true?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you're a descendant of rodents, absolutely true," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Evolution theory is false, Darwin's coffin lid can't stay down!" At this moment, Han Xianyun still chose to believe Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Mr. Qi was an immortal.</p><p></p><p>It was natural for an immortal to be knowledgeable and experienced.</p><p></p><p>"The history books didn't record how you came to be, so... it's possible you're really descended from rodents."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could make up rumors at will.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's unofficial history, you can say whatever you want.</p><p></p><p>Someone once asked, after Sima Zhao killed the emperor, why didn't he kill the court historians too? That way the historians wouldn't record this event, and he wouldn't have to bear the infamy of regicide.</p><p></p><p>Immediately someone said, in the unofficial history he read, Sima Zhao originally had homosexual tendencies, saw the emperor on the street and took a liking to him, but the emperor refused, so Zhao killed him in anger.</p><p></p><p>"Am I really descended from rats?" Han Xianyun pondered for a moment, then decided to stop thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Even if it were true, did that mean he should stop sleeping in mansions and switch to sleeping in burrows instead?</p><p></p><p>Did it mean that when he got sick, he should eat rat poison instead of medicine?</p><p></p><p>"Which one of these was left by Luo Bufan?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, among the marks on this, Qi Yuan had already seen no less than ten that surpassed the power of the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that there were still people in ancient times who broke through the martial arts limit, they just hid their identities and didn't show off.</p><p></p><p>"This one," Han Xianyun pointed to a slender fingerprint.</p><p></p><p>"This guy... has six fingers?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun was even more confused.</p><p></p><p>There's only one fingerprint here, how did you see six fingers?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked carefully at this fingerprint, his expression quite calm.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that to break through the martial arts limit, the key is still in the bloodline."</p><p></p><p>This single fingerprint gave Qi Yuan a lot of useful information.</p><p></p><p>This Luo Bufan was a ruthless person.</p><p></p><p>In order to break through the martial arts limit... he even...</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's identity in this game was an orphan, and he also couldn't do what Luo Bufan did, eating anything.</p><p></p><p>So, his breakthrough opportunity lay in the sea, with mutant sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

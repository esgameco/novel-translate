        <h1>Chapter 279</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The siblings Shi Rushan and Shi Rulan died tragically.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the miserable scene in the residence, Grand Master Dazhi couldn't help saying: "You were a bit impulsive, killing them too quickly."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's actions were too swift and fierce, directly uprooting the Mountain of Fate and easily slaying Shi Rushan and Shi Rulan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"We should have asked if there were any more birds, I didn't even get to taste them." Grand Master Dazhi looked at Qi Yuan, pondering seriously.</p><p></p><p>"There will be plenty of opportunities in the future," Qi Yuan replied softly.</p><p></p><p>In his hand appeared a strange small wooden door.</p><p></p><p>This door was the Mountain of Fate's reliance - the Door of Fate.</p><p></p><p>Shi Rulan was able to summon projections of the Chaos Birds thanks to the Door of Fate.</p><p></p><p>However, in Qi Yuan's eyes, this Door of Fate was actually the Door of Myriad Distinctions from the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this small wooden door was not the true Door of Myriad Distinctions, but merely a token that could summon a trace of its illusory form.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there's a Game Door inside the Door of Myriad Distinctions?</p><p></p><p>If so, wouldn't that mean you could play games in there every day?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He and Grand Master Dazhi returned once again to the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>In Qinghong City, there had been a commotion due to Qi Yuan's earlier shout.</p><p></p><p>However, the other Yin Gods and cultivators didn't know what had happened, and were just left with some questions.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Qinghong City returned to peace once again.</p><p></p><p>The Original God Sharing Association also continued to develop steadily.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Association's affairs were progressing vigorously.</p><p></p><p>About one-third of the entire Azure Waves Realm was caught up in the craze of uploading cultivation methods and providing assistance.</p><p></p><p>Some old-timers who had been in seclusion now emerged, either to provide assistance or upload cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>More and more powerful Yin Gods were heading towards the Phoenix Sky Domain, seemingly wanting to meet the legendary Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Qi Yuan dispatched three Great Venerable Ones to assist the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman in breaking through to the Yin God realm.</p><p></p><p>When the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman's grandfather saw the three Great Venerable Ones, his expression was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he heard that the Blood-Robed Sword God was the Heavenly Dao Foundation Building cultivator his granddaughter had once called her sworn brother, he was even more amazed.</p><p></p><p>When the three Great Venerable Ones saw the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman's grandfather, they immediately noticed the injuries on the body of Ice Soul Venerable One, as he was known.</p><p></p><p>His injuries were extremely severe, with only a hundred years of lifespan remaining.</p><p></p><p>The three Great Venerable Ones had come from afar, knowing the close relationship between the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman and the Blood-Robed Sword God. So they reciprocated the kindness, with the three Great Venerable Ones working together to treat Ice Soul Venerable One's injuries.</p><p></p><p>With the three Great Venerable Ones joining forces and using precious treasures, Ice Soul Venerable One's injuries were naturally not a big deal, and were easily healed almost completely.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods in the Original God Sharing Association were increasing.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods collected in the Divine Flower Association had also reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of posts appeared on the forum.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this old Daoist has obtained a mid-grade Heaven-level cultivation method!"</p><p></p><p>"Can someone help me? The Heaven-level method I exchanged for was stolen!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go find the Blood-Robed Sword God to uphold justice."</p><p></p><p>"100 is actually not perfect!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, let's work harder together to obtain divine methods!"</p><p></p><p>"This poor Daoist never imagined he would have hope for divine methods in this life. Thanks to the Divine Flower Association and the Blood-Robed Sword God."</p><p></p><p>"I've decided, I want both my senior sister and junior sister."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the number of cultivation methods accumulated in the Divine Flower Association was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The total progress bar had been stuck at 99% for two days.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the cultivators on the Divine Flower Association forum had no complaints, but were instead encouraging each other.</p><p></p><p>With divine methods just one step away, those cultivators were uploading methods even faster.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on a spirit ship heading to the Great Shang Kingdom, Jiang Ruhua wore a dark blue robe with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood-Robed Sword God of the Divine Flower Association has some skills. This 99% has already been stuck for two days."</p><p></p><p>On the journey to Great Shang, he had inevitably come into contact with the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>His personal progress bar had already reached 51% and was difficult to increase further.</p><p></p><p>So his gaze fell on the Divine Flower Association's total progress bar.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Jiang Ruhua looked at the young man beside him. He saw that the excessively handsome young man was lowering his head, also fiddling with the Divine Flower Association's jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua spoke to the young man beside him with the air of someone experienced:</p><p></p><p>"I guess this 99% will probably be stuck for at least a year or half. That's a divine method we're talking about. Whether the Blood-Robed Sword God is willing to give it is one thing, whether he even has it is another question."</p><p></p><p>This handsome young man was someone Jiang Ruhua had met on the spirit ship.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the spirit ship heading to the Great Shang Kingdom, cultivators with Divine Flower Association jade slips were few and far between. That handsome young man's aura was also quite mysterious - he couldn't discern his cultivation level, so he had become somewhat familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man raised his head, his eyes filled with a smile: "Fellow Daoist, a figure like the Blood-Robed Sword God keeps his word. How could he deceive people?</p><p></p><p>I dare to bet that within three days, this progress bar will reach 100%, and everyone will be able to obtain divine methods!"</p><p></p><p>"The words of those high-level cultivators should be treated like farts and ignored.</p><p></p><p>That's a divine method we're talking about, probably something even the Azure Waves Realm doesn't have. Who would be willing to make it public? Even if they did publish it, I guess it would be an incomplete version!" Jiang Ruhua said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you think too poorly of people's hearts." The handsome young man smiled, "I'm 90% certain that we'll see divine methods within three days."</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man said confidently.</p><p></p><p>He was so confident because he was Qi Yuan, and regarding the progress bar, it would likely truly be full in about three days.</p><p></p><p>There was another reason - in three days, the game icon loading would also be complete. He was eager to enter the game, so naturally wouldn't keep holding onto the divine methods.</p><p></p><p>It was just one divine method after all.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't that stingy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Ruhua smiled without speaking.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something, and then changed the subject: "Fellow Daoist, since you're from Great Shang, do you know of Qi Yuan from the Divine Light Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Of course I know of him. He's Great Shang's number one Divine Infant, and also Great Shang's number one handsome man. He's incredibly powerful, hates evil, is as handsome as a jade tree in the wind... He rules Great Shang alone!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used all the phrases he knew in one go.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ruhua was a bit dazed, then narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Fellow Daoist greatly admires this person." Jiang Ruhua thought it made sense.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Light Sect could be considered the number one power in the Great Shang Kingdom. A Divine Infant True Lord was enough to act tyrannically in Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for cultivators from Great Shang to admire him.</p><p></p><p>"I admire him as I do myself!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Grand Master Dazhi beside them spoke up: "That person is not only Great Shang's number one Divine Infant, but even the Eastern Lands' number one Divine Infant, and perhaps even the Azure Waves Realm's number one Divine Infant!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua glanced at Grand Master Dazhi, not continuing further.</p><p></p><p>He understood now - he had encountered a fanboy of his daughter's senior apprentice brother.</p><p></p><p>Great Shang's number one Divine Infant was one thing, but to claim he was the Eastern Lands' number one Divine Infant, or even the Azure Waves Realm's number one Divine Infant, was too much.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, among the Hundred Kingdoms region, only Kang Fulu from the Divine Light Sect entered the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>It seems this Qi Yuan is not as good as Kang Fulu by quite a bit." Jiang Ruhua said.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen Kang Fulu, he's not as good as Qi Yuan," Grand Master Dazhi glanced at Qi Yuan, "If they fought, Kang Fulu wouldn't be able to withstand even one move from Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that's just bullying the young with age!" Jiang Ruhua thought of Qi Yuan and felt annoyed.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Infant True Lord, an old fellow of about a thousand years, actually went to seduce his daughter who wasn't even twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was at a loss: "How can you baselessly smear someone's reputation! Qi Yuan should be quite young."</p><p></p><p>Saying Elder Kang Fulu was weak was one thing, but calling him old was unbearable. He was very young and in his prime.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how young he is, is he as young as you?" Jiang Ruhua couldn't help saying. The man before her was full of vitality, clearly very young and in the prime of life. </p><p></p><p>While that Qi Yuan had become a Divine Infant in the Great Shang Kingdom, he was probably close to a hundred years old, practically an old fogey.</p><p></p><p>"About the same as me," Qi Yuan muttered, then asked, "Fellow Daoist, do you know Qi Yuan? Why do you have such animosity towards him?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua didn't answer. </p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't very well say he had traveled thousands of miles to the Great Shang Kingdom just because of his daughter's affair with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Jiang Ruhua changed the subject: "Fellow Daoist, didn't you say the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal would announce the divine law in three days? Here, add my jade slip, and we'll see who's right in three days."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "If you lose the bet, you'll have to apologize to me on the Divine Flower Society forum, and use your real name!"</p><p></p><p>It's a pity the Divine Flower Society couldn't post videos, otherwise it would be more interesting to have this fellow Daoist post a video apology.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist seems very confident... Oh? Fellow Daoist is actually Origin Venerable?" Jiang Ruhua was surprised. </p><p></p><p>He had been following the Divine Flower Society forum and knew Origin Venerable was one of the more popular figures there recently.</p><p></p><p>This person often shared updates on his cultivation progress, especially interesting events in his sect.</p><p></p><p>Things about busty junior sisters and cold senior sisters.</p><p></p><p>Based on the shared content, Origin Venerable should undoubtedly be at the Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, has Fellow Daoist chosen the junior sister or the senior sister?" Jiang Ruhua revealed a slightly lecherous smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's fake, I made it all up," Qi Yuan hurriedly denied.</p><p></p><p>The junior sister and senior sister were of course all fake.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why be shy Fellow Daoist? We're all male cultivators, I understand you. Back then, I also encountered such a situation, with a junior sister on one side and a senior sister on the other," Jiang Ruhua revealed a nostalgic expression, as if recalling the past. "Later, I successfully became Dao companions with the junior sister!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Jiang Ruhua looked proud: "From your description, that senior sister of yours seems a bit arrogant, and of rather noble birth. In my opinion, you'd better choose the junior sister. Otherwise, your future life... sigh."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua couldn't help but sigh, seeming to have experienced a lot.</p><p></p><p>"From your description, that junior sister of yours seems to have deep feelings for you. As for the senior sister, she's more elusive, neither cold nor warm," Jiang Ruhua continued.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan agreed with Jiang Ruhua's words.</p><p></p><p>When making things up, he had used Jiang Lingsu as a reference for the junior sister character, so it was written more realistically. </p><p></p><p>The senior sister was indeed a bit hollow.</p><p></p><p>"From what you say, your junior sister's father seems difficult to deal with, has a mysterious relationship with the sect leader, looks down on you, and favors the sect leader's daughter. This matter is easy to handle, hehe. Since the junior sister already has deep feelings for you, find a beautiful moonlit night, and in the heat of mutual affection, let the rice be cooked. Then take your junior sister to meet your father-in-law. He can't beat you then!" Jiang Ruhua shared his successful experience, even stroking his beard, looking quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was all made up.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, follow what I say and you'll definitely be able to marry your junior sister. As the saying goes, a married daughter is like spilled water. After you're married, your junior sister will surely side with you. Your junior sister's family is also quite well-off. She can casually give you some techniques, let you obtain some celestial methods on the Divine Flower Society, give you some resources, and maybe after a while you'll become a Divine Infant True Lord. By then, that dog-eyed father-in-law of yours who looks down on people will be obedient when he sees you. If you one day advance to the Purple Palace realm, you could shit on his head directly and he wouldn't dare to breathe!" The latter part was naturally Jiang Ruhua's fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his fantasy had never been realized.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was only at the late stage of Divine Infant, still far from the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>His father-in-law's strength was at the peak of Divine Infant, a big step ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist has much experience," Qi Yuan spoke appropriately to the situation.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he could only flatter Jiang Ruhua.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, follow my advice and within half a month, you'll be able to win the beauty. When you and your junior sister get married, if this old man is still in Great Shang, you must invite me as the matchmaker and toast me a cup of wedding wine!" Jiang Ruhua said proudly.</p><p></p><p>After all, seeing Qi Yuan made him feel as if he had returned to the past, to his days in the sect.</p><p></p><p>It's just that later, after returning to his family, the past could only become a memory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged and casually agreed: "Certainly!"</p><p></p><p>But he wouldn't actually invite him.</p><p></p><p>He and his junior sister were purely platonic.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua squinted: "Meeting is fate. If you encounter difficulties with your good match with your junior sister, contact this old man. In my spare time, I most enjoy facilitating good matches."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded, glanced at the spirit ship, and said softly, "Fellow Daoist, the spirit ship will stop in a moment. My junior sister is coming to pick me up."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ruhua smiled even more: "Indeed, your junior sister has you in her heart."</p><p></p><p>He thought of his daughter, and a trace of worry appeared in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His daughter didn't come to pick him up!</p><p></p><p>But the worry quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>If this Origin Venerable had a daughter, she definitely wouldn't come to pick him up either.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he felt much more balanced.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, a clear voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun directly threw herself into Qi Yuan's arms, her face bearing a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan looked helpless: "Jianjun, propriety between men and women!"</p><p></p><p>A grown daughter should avoid her father. Qi Yuan needed to hang himself.</p><p></p><p>If this scene just now was captured and uploaded to the internet, wouldn't he be cyberbullied to death?</p><p></p><p>"Jianjun is Father's daughter, what's wrong with a hug?" Qi Jianjun said this, also jumping out of Qi Yuan's arms.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Ruhua was stunned. He looked at Qi Yuan: "You have a daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded forcefully, "The content posted on the Divine Flower Society forum is mostly fictional. I don't have any senior sister, nor do I have..."</p><p></p><p>"Father, you clearly have a busty junior sister, hehe... When will you win her over? Won't I then have a... third mother?" Qi Jianjun pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Her birth mother was naturally Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Her second mother was Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Jianjun's view, the third mother would be Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... don't talk nonsense." Qi Yuan was very embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>It seems he can't make things up in the future, seeing how others have misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Ruhua, hearing Qi Jianjun's words, widened his eyes: "Fellow Daoist's cultivation is so profound?"</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Because, according to this little girl's words, the Fellow Daoist before him already had two Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>From the looks of it, the relationship between the Dao companions was very harmonious.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was considering a third Dao companion.</p><p></p><p>This made him both envious and jealous, and also guilty about his earlier guidance.</p><p></p><p>He secretly transmitted to Qi Yuan: "How is Fellow Daoist able to hook up with another while already having two Dao companions? </p><p></p><p>Teach this old man!</p><p></p><p>This old man will surely reward you handsomely!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua looked quite curious.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 400</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No self-image, no image of others.</p><p>No image of sentient beings, no image of life-spans.</p><p>Buddhas of past, present and future gather together. </p><p>Majestic in appearance, with boundless wisdom.</p><p>The pure Buddha land falls into Qi Yuan's hands, like a mere plaything. Where is the sense of celestial treasure suppressing the heavens?</p><p></p><p>"I see the Tathagata, the Tathagata sees me, it should be thus. </p><p>This poor monk Tai Xing pays respects to the Buddha patriarchs!"</p><p></p><p>Tai Xing True Buddha, this True Buddha of the Ultimate Principle realm, put his palms together and bowed to the six Buddha patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other True Buddhas were moved in their Buddha hearts: "We pay respects to the Buddha patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>Ninety-seven True Buddhas bowed together, their voices as solemn as the thunder of the great sun.</p><p></p><p>All the half-Buddhas also bowed: "We pay respects to the Buddha patriarchs!"</p><p></p><p>Their voices echoed through the clouds, spreading throughout the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators and novices understood in this moment that Buddha patriarchs had emerged in the Buddha land.</p><p></p><p>Countless monks put their palms together and bowed towards the direction of Gui Qi City.</p><p></p><p>"We pay respects to the Buddha patriarchs!"</p><p></p><p>Ninety-seven True Buddhas seeing the Tathagata meant... the Buddha land now had Buddha patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan smiled broadly: "I'm quite generous, aren't I? You lend me the Great Sun Golden Lotus, I give you Buddha patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>Not far away, hearing this, sweat poured down the forehead of the half-Buddha Can Tuo.</p><p></p><p>This guy was for real! </p><p></p><p>And he really did give them Buddha patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>"But you're quite generous too, directly handing over the Buddha land to me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Buddha land, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha land was like a sarira, countless Buddhist sayings scattered like stars, dense and endless. Just gazing at it for an instant one could feel the profound and vast Buddhist dharma.</p><p></p><p>Within the Buddha land, several boundless true words were particularly dazzling, constantly flashing due to the appearance of the Buddhas of three ages, Buddhist sounds burning the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Tai Xing True Buddha's gaze changed.</p><p></p><p>The other True Buddhas felt bitter, with bitterness they could not express.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha land was precious, the foundation of the Buddha land's holy site.</p><p></p><p>These True Buddhas could not control this celestial treasure, otherwise wouldn't they have already unified this Buddha land? How did it end up in this person's hands?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm just joking, this Buddha land is useless to me." Qi Yuan held the Buddha land casually.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the precious treasure of the Buddha land's holy site. If it were lost, the Buddha land's holy site would likely fall from the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he was a good person, only borrowing money without returning it.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, having some wealthy platonic loves was better than poor platonic loves.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other True Buddhas breathed sighs of relief, their gazes fixed on the Buddha land.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw Qi Yuan wave his hand: "Wu Tian, I'll entrust this Buddha land to you."</p><p></p><p>The Buddha land fell into Wu Tian's hands. The disheveled Wu Tian Buddha Patriarch's lips curled into a gloomy smile.</p><p></p><p>They saw the Buddha land constantly trembling, as if struggling to break free.</p><p></p><p>But in Wu Tian Buddha Patriarch's hands, the Buddha land could not move at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the other True Buddhas were shaken.</p><p></p><p>They feared this disheveled Buddha would crush the Buddha land with one palm.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this Wu Tian Buddha Patriarch is my... good friend, very reliable. He's just joking around with the little Buddha land." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Since he said he was recommending a good friend, these few Buddhas must be good friends.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tai Xing True Buddha stepped forward and looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with awe: "May I ask how the Heavenly Lord is addressed?"</p><p></p><p>All the True Buddhas were very curious about Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he were merely a Blood Lord from the lower realm, he certainly couldn't be this powerful.</p><p></p><p>"In this realm, I am called Blood Lord. In the Cang Lan Realm, I am the Blood Robed Sword God, my full name... Qi Yuan." Qi Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>The True Buddhas' gazes all changed slightly, countless pieces of information flowing through their minds.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Kun Xia Daoist next to Chen Huan felt as if his spirit had been struck by a heavy stone.</p><p></p><p>"Cang... Lan Realm... Blood Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes bulged, his spirit shaken.</p><p></p><p>This... damn... He couldn't help but look up at the ten suns, wanting to cry but having no tears.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Huan, he didn't notice Kun Xia Daoist's unusual state. He was also extremely shaken.</p><p></p><p>As expected of his big brother, simply too amazing!</p><p></p><p>Creating miracles everywhere.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tai Xing True Buddha's gaze remained unchanged. He looked at the sky and suddenly spoke a single true word.</p><p></p><p>"Seal!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the connection between the Flowing Wind Realm and the upper realm was completely cut off.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the lower realm, he had already acted to cut it off. Now he added a double insurance.</p><p></p><p>After all, the matter of Buddha patriarchs was of great importance, especially... the Future Buddha.</p><p></p><p>How could there be a Future Buddha in a world without a future? If there was a Future Buddha, didn't that mean that one day, the Buddha land's holy site could step onto the highest Three Heavens?</p><p></p><p>Among the Six Heavens, those of the Great Ultimate Principle realm could be overlords.</p><p></p><p>The highest Three Heavens were mysterious and unspeakable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, compassion flashed in Tai Xing True Buddha's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Enter my Assembly of Ten Thousand Buddhas, and enjoy ultimate bliss early!"</p><p></p><p>Vast Buddhist sounds spread out.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many cultivators hiding in the shadows cried out in misery.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Even Kun Xia Daoist was locked in place by these Buddhist sounds, his whole body restrained.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Tai Xing True Buddha was cleaning up some of the upper realm's hidden agents.</p><p></p><p>Enemies were sent to ultimate bliss.</p><p></p><p>Allies were restrained, their memories erased.</p><p></p><p>As for Kun Xia Daoist, he did not kill him.</p><p></p><p>But regarding information about the Future Buddha, he instantly extracted and erased that segment from everyone's memories, replacing it.</p><p></p><p>"This person must be a legend of the Tai Huang Palace, possibly related to the Cang Lan Realm." Tai Xing True Buddha captured Kun Xia Daoist and sent him to Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm, showing no surprise. He reached out his hand, and several jade slips fell into it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kun Xia Daoist's soul was extinguished, and his lifetime of memories was absorbed and digested by Qi Yuan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Lord, do you know how this Future Buddha... attained Buddhahood?" </p><p></p><p>Tai Xing True Buddha spoke.</p><p></p><p>Among the ninety-seven True Buddhas, six stepped forward, all looking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Including Tai Xing True Buddha, these seven True Buddhas were all True Buddhas of the Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining True Buddhas, they narrowed their eyes, cutting off their five senses and also sealing this area of space, not letting any information particles escape or leak out.</p><p></p><p>The matters discussed between Tai Xing True Buddha and that Heavenly Lord were clearly things they were not allowed to hear.</p><p></p><p>The memories of today were of great importance, and they would also extract and erase them.</p><p></p><p>"It's just... cultivate and succeed." Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>"...Could you elaborate further?" Tai Xing True Buddha asked, his voice heavy, "The immortal realm has a past and a present, but no future."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had heard words like Tai Xing True Buddha's before.</p><p></p><p>When he was in Wangyue Continent, his daughter Qi Jianjun had said that Yang spirits had past bodies and present bodies, but no future bodies.</p><p></p><p>The immortal realm also had no future.</p><p></p><p>This was the consensus of all upper realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the sudden appearance of a Future Buddha, the True Buddhas of the Buddha land were naturally shaken.</p><p></p><p>The future was related to the unspeakable highest Three Heavens.</p><p></p><p>If every True Buddha of the Buddha land could cultivate the future, it was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing detailed about it. I gave him the visualization method for the Future Buddha, he visualized it and attained Future Buddhahood, simple as that." Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tai Xing True Buddha's expression changed slightly, and he finally sighed: "The workings of heaven cannot be leaked. This poor monk has no fate to see it."</p><p></p><p>The other Ultimate Principle True Buddhas all put their palms together and chanted sutras.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they felt that due to their low level, they could not touch the future.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Great Ultimate Principle realm, rashly touching the future may not be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, now that my friends have become your Buddha patriarchs, can I ask my friends to beg for some divine methods?" Qi Yuan looked at Tai Xing True Buddha with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>These single dogs were quite old. According to the "Qi Yuan Platonic Love Standard Manual", these monks were the true candidates for platonic love.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Lord needs divine methods? We will exhaust the power of the Buddha land's holy site to collect divine methods for the Heavenly Lord!" Tai Xing True Buddha spoke, and a jade slip fell into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>The other True Buddhas seemed to have also received Tai Xing True Buddha's message...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They each imprinted their divine methods onto jade slips and presented them to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan smiled with joy: "I've hit the jackpot!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at these monks, also handsome and charming! After all, these divine methods were far more numerous than what Shen Wushen or Jade Maiden had given him.</p><p></p><p>It was the profound heritage of a Buddhist holy land.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, how many Stellar Golden Pills will this get me?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fantasized, feeling somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He thought about naming some of the Stellar Golden Pills after these monks once he condensed them. This time, he had obtained nearly ten thousand divine methods.</p><p></p><p>Although many methods had high duplication rates, it was still quite good.</p><p></p><p>Just by deducing the Golden Pill chapter of the "Qi Yuan Scripture", he could condense several thousand more Stellar Golden Pills.</p><p></p><p>This time, it could be said he made a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could be considered the emperor emeritus of the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>He also had some influence in the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Tai Huang Palace very powerful?" Qi Yuan asked at this time.</p><p></p><p>The Kunxia Daoist was merely a mythical figure. Although he was from the Tai Huang Palace, he did not know much about it, and there was a lot of information he was not qualified to access.</p><p></p><p>Tai Hang True Buddha gave Qi Yuan a meaningful look, as if guessing his identity.</p><p></p><p>"The Tai Huang Palace sits in the Sixth Heaven, almost at the peak of the immortal realm. </p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, the Great Sun Heavenly Lord is a hegemon. He alone can suppress our Buddhist realm and keep us from raising our heads." Tai Hang True Buddha said.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the upper realm divided into Nine Heavens? If the Great Sun Heavenly Lord is so arrogant, why don't people from the top three heavens come down to beat him up?" In Kunxia Daoist's memories, there were not many records about the top three heavens.</p><p></p><p>But in the Nine Heavens, the higher one went, the more abundant the immortal energy, and the stronger the presiding power.</p><p></p><p>"The top three heavens are places that cannot be spoken of, cannot be described, cannot be transmitted, only personally experienced."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the top three heavens, these Ultimate Truth True Buddhas all had a sense of taboo.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan said at this time, "If I brought you and many Buddha-level powerhouses with me, could we flatten the Great Sun Heavenly Lord's Tai Huang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Truth realm was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>The seven Ultimate Truth True Buddhas before him gave Qi Yuan a sense of being difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Great Sun Heavenly Lord who possessed a Primordial Treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult." Tai Hang True Buddha shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it seems I'm still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, this Great Sun Heavenly Lord has no martial virtue, clearly a big shot from the Sixth Heaven, yet he insists on bullying me, a small newbie at the half-step Purple Palace realm!</p><p></p><p>This is not giving the common people a way to live!</p><p></p><p>If you don't give the people a way to live, the people will overthrow you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>This Great Sun Heavenly Lord was too inhumane.</p><p></p><p>If Ten Suns in the Sky wasn't enough, then... what about a hundred suns, a thousand suns, ten thousand suns?</p><p></p><p>Quantitative changes can also lead to qualitative changes!</p><p></p><p>Tai Hang True Buddha looked at Qi Yuan, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>If it was before, when the Ten Suns Heavenly Lord challenged the Great Sun Heavenly Lord, he would have thought it was indeed a bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Future Buddha had been brought out, things were completely different.</p><p></p><p>His confrontation with the Great Sun Heavenly Lord was probably 30-70.</p><p></p><p>If he won, the Buddhist realm might even... step into the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The wish that the Great Sun Light Buddha had not realized might finally be in sight for their generation.</p><p></p><p>What a great achievement this would be!</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what's the current date in the upper realm?" Qi Yuan suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>"February 27th." Tai Hang True Buddha answered.</p><p></p><p>"July 17th... it's coming soon." Qi Yuan's gaze grew deep.</p><p></p><p>July 17th was Jin Li's birthday.</p><p></p><p>The letter he had sent to Jin Li, if nothing went wrong, would reach Jin Li's hands on July 17th this year.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if by then he would be able to overcome the great calamity and ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>But... it was coming soon.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Hang True Buddha, can you do me a favor?" Qi Yuan said at this time, "Don't worry, I won't let you work for nothing, there will definitely be benefits for you."</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Heavenly Lord." Tai Hang True Buddha's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's a small matter, not difficult..." Qi Yuan told him what he wanted done.</p><p></p><p>But Tai Hang True Buddha looked troubled: "Heavenly Lord, this poor monk cannot go."</p><p></p><p>"??" Qi Yuan blinked, "They're both in the upper realm, just separated by one heaven, is the gap that big?"</p><p></p><p>"Under the illumination of the Primordial Treasure, even those at the Great Ultimate Truth realm cannot hide, let alone this poor monk." Tai Hang True Buddha shook his head.</p><p></p><p>What the Heavenly Lord had asked him to do was to infiltrate the Moon God Palace...</p><p></p><p>That was the Moon God Palace, a force not inferior to the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>In its core area, illuminated by the Primordial Treasure, other Heavenly Lords simply could not infiltrate.</p><p></p><p>Infiltration also meant becoming an enemy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Buddhist pagoda.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist debate was still continuing.</p><p></p><p>The position of Holy Buddhist Child had caused many Buddhist children and maidens, as well as the Northern Demon Thirteen Monsters, to argue heatedly.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, with the help of Bai Ze and the assistance of Ling Yayi, Yu Daoren won the position of Holy Buddhist Child.</p><p></p><p>Purple Lotus Buddhist Maiden grinned, patting her chest: "Hehe, looks like the Holy Buddhist Child position belongs to my Purple Zen Holy Land this time."</p><p></p><p>The other Buddhist children and maidens all showed envy in their eyes, then their desires dissipated, turning to calmness again.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi excitedly said: "Yu Daoren, remember to plead for Master when they strip away the Great Sun Golden Lotus. You must ask them to spare Master's life, and his cultivation. Also ask for some spiritual medicines for Master. This old man doesn't want to take care of a master who drools all day!"</p><p></p><p>Master, from now on I'll be the one protecting you! Ling Yayi felt somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>He thought, if Master became a cripple, facing his tall and mighty self, he probably wouldn't dare call him Nangong Big Dog anymore in the future.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he found some joy in his sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Yu Daoren gave Ling Yayi a white-eyed look: "I understand."</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Buddhist Child's gaze was calm: "This poor monk is also quite curious about this Blood Lord. Obtaining the creation of a realm, and possessing the power of reincarnation, if not for the Great Sun Golden Lotus, he might become a True Buddha."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he seemed quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, having a deeper connection isn't a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, with excited expressions, Ling Yayi and the others left the Buddhist pagoda.</p><p></p><p>When they came out of the pagoda, they saw that the sky outside had already darkened.</p><p></p><p>The ninety-seven quasi-Buddhas who had been sitting in the sky had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The originally lively Great Buddhist Assembly was now desolate and cold.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Ling Yayi became anxious: "Where is everyone? They didn't kill my master, did they?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Daoren's eyes also showed worry.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the figure of a quasi-Buddha appeared. His gaze was deep, with lingering shock in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Something big happened at the Great Buddhist Assembly. All quasi-Buddhas have returned, leaving only this old monk to handle the matter of the Holy Buddhist Child." This quasi-Buddha looked at Yu Daoren with kind eyes, "Are you the Holy Buddhist Child this time?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Yayi blinked and secretly transmitted to Wuguang Buddhist Child: "This Holy Buddhist Child seems so low-class, no one even came to congratulate?"</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Buddhist Child was also confused, unable to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>"Could it just be an empty title? Will pleading still work?" Ling Yayi was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yu Daoren spoke: "Senior, I was fortunate to obtain the position of Holy Buddhist Child. I have an unreasonable request, please grant it."</p><p></p><p>This quasi-Buddha nodded, his gaze very gentle: "Please speak freely."</p><p></p><p>"My master Blood Lord did not intentionally keep the Great Sun Golden Lotus for himself.</p><p></p><p>If the Buddhist realm must remove the Great Sun Golden Lotus, could you be gentler and more careful? Please spare my master Blood Lord's life!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the quasi-Buddha's eyebrows twitched, and his expression became flustered, losing the demeanor of a high monk.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't make things up, don't falsely accuse people. When did our Buddhist realm ever think about digging out Blood Lord's Great Sun Golden Lotus? This is a fabricated story."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Ling Yayi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Yu Daoren and Wuguang Buddhist Child and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard this quasi-Buddha say: "The Wutian Buddha once said that Blood Lord should be... the Supreme Buddha. Now, Blood Lord is the Supreme Buddha of our Buddhist realm!"</p><p></p><p>"...Supreme Buddha?" Ling Yayi was confused.</p><p></p><p>This term... how strange? Also, I just attended a Great Buddhist Assembly, and Master became the Supreme Buddha? (End of chapter)</p>

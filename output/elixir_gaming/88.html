        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, hmph, Ruan Yixi, you really let go, actually giving your disciple the divine infant treasure.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the rumors are true, that Qi Yuan is either your lover or your son?"</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual power is exhausted, unable to activate the treasure..."</p><p></p><p>"Liang Ye, this time you died, I will definitely avenge you, I won't let you die in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Ye was his most valued elite warrior.</p><p></p><p>With the help of a powerful figure, he had cultivated three hundred elite warriors.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred elite warriors, the weakest of them were in the late Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>Through demonic cultivation techniques, these cultivators rapidly increased in strength, but their lifespan was extremely short.</p><p></p><p>Most of them only lived for less than ten days.</p><p></p><p>This was the method of that senior expert.</p><p></p><p>Liang Ye was different, he cultivated the orthodox royal cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Chong!" The purple-robed elder called out again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, another man in light armor appeared.</p><p></p><p>His aura was even stronger than Liang Ye's.</p><p></p><p>"I am now at a critical moment in my refinement, so I entrust the control of the soul lotus flower to you.</p><p></p><p>In the Sunken Coffin Realm, a person named Qi Yuan has arrived, and he possesses a treasure..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder told Liang Chong all the information, then said,</p><p></p><p>"Kill Qi Yuan and retrieve the treasure for me!" The purple-robed elder's voice was stern, "The three hundred elite warriors are temporarily under your command!</p><p></p><p>During this period, you must not let anyone else enter the Sunken Coffin Realm, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"As you command, with Liang Chong here, no one can disrupt your plan!" Liang Chong's face was resolute.</p><p></p><p>He was an elite warrior, willing to die for his master.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"How many people are behind the scenes, it can't be just a few, right?" Qi Yuan sat and waited for a long time, but no one showed up.</p><p></p><p>If the mastermind was just a few people, that would be a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>The few soul lotus flowers were not enough to fill a tooth gap.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a feathered arrow shot over from the distance.</p><p></p><p>The arrow emanated a powerful aura, like an immortal elixir shot.</p><p></p><p>"How dangerous!" Qi Yuan did a somersault and quickly dodged the arrow.</p><p></p><p>He took the jade slip playing a small tune and opened it.</p><p></p><p>Then he stood up, looking pale as he scanned the surroundings: "What scoundrel dares to ambush me?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the two lightly armored elite warriors had a puzzled expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"He opened the jade slip to play a small tune, what is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he's trying to scare us away?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, he has consumed a lot of spiritual power and hasn't fully recovered, unable to activate the treasure. Let's go kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The two medium-built Qi Condensation elite warriors charged towards Qi Yuan, showing no mercy.</p><p></p><p>Powerful spiritual energy permeated the entire meadow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell to the ground like a kite with its string cut.</p><p></p><p>"So... so strong!"</p><p></p><p>He struggled to get up, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"But no matter how strong you are, I, the young master, will never submit!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, emanating an indomitable spirit.</p><p></p><p>The two elite warriors were also moved, but only momentarily.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The two attacked forcefully, trying to eliminate Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You two shameless old fellows, bullying this young man together!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded a kitchen knife, desperately holding on.</p><p></p><p>Under the double assault, he soon coughed up blood.</p><p></p><p>Knocked down repeatedly, he still stood up resolutely, using the frightening kitchen knife, persisting like an unyielding swordsman.</p><p></p><p>This made the two elite warriors even more moved.</p><p></p><p>"After you die, we will give you a grand burial!"</p><p></p><p>They began to respect Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"After you two die, I'll bury you properly and even erect a monument!" Qi Yuan was always "giving them a peach, and receiving a jade in return".</p><p></p><p>He was like a competitive child, freely offering them a monument.</p><p></p><p>The two Qi Condensation elite warriors, if they hadn't heard it, would have been fine, but upon hearing Qi Yuan's words, their expressions turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and deal with this person, we still need to guard the stronghold." One of the Qi Condensation elite warriors said.</p><p></p><p>The two completely changed their fighting style, no longer hesitant or afraid of Qi Yuan's kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan also smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You want to kill me, no way!"</p><p></p><p>"I have the treasure bestowed by my master!"</p><p></p><p>He said, suddenly coughing up fresh blood again.</p><p></p><p>A heroic expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Using a secret technique, I have lost twenty years of my lifespan.</p><p></p><p>But it is enough to activate the secret treasure! To kill you, I have lost so much!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's intentional shout, he instantly slew the two Qi Condensation elite warriors with his knife.</p><p></p><p>His face was as pale as snow, but the corners of his mouth were curled in a smile: "Cough, cough... I won!"</p><p></p><p>Blood continuously dripped from the corners of his mouth, and there was even a strand of white hair on his head.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Rong City, in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Gone?" </p><p></p><p>The Withered Wood True Monarch looked at the empty bed, his expression unchanging.</p><p></p><p>The Empress's face was also extremely gloomy: "I... underestimated this old man."</p><p></p><p>The Luminous True Monarch narrowed his eyes: "The old Emperor's move is likely to truly control the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The old master is curious, what gives him the ability to control the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Red Sword Gate." Suddenly, a sharp voice like a precious sword sounded.</p><p></p><p>An old man in a cyan robe appeared in the hall, on his back was a sword case containing seventeen flying swords.</p><p></p><p>This old man was the Sect Master of the Floating Mountain, the Raging Sword True Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Sword Gate?" Hearing this name, the expressions of the people present all changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the people present were the most familiar with the Red Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, when the Demonic Desire Gate tried to unify the Great Merchant, the Red Sword Gate was behind it.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the Seven-Color Peak's Sect Master, that attempt by the Red Sword Gate failed.</p><p></p><p>"The old Emperor actually has connections with the Red Sword Gate?" The Withered Wood True Monarch had a tinge of regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If he had known earlier, he should have killed the old Emperor without mercy.</p><p></p><p>The Empress had a guilty expression on her face: "It was my mistake, I didn't keep a close eye on the old Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The Raging Sword True Monarch said, "Now is not the time to discuss this. What should we do about our disciples who have entered the secret realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Red Sword Gate has the Red Demon Seed, which can be used to mass-produce powerful cultivators. This time, the old Emperor is plotting to control the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, and there must be many Red Demon elite warriors there." The Withered Wood True Monarch's eyes were filled with worry, "Qi Yuan is also in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>He glanced towards the direction of the Seven-Color Peak, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>The old Emperor hated their major sects to the core, wishing to kill them all.</p><p></p><p>Bringing powerful experts in, he would certainly show no mercy.</p><p></p><p>"The old Emperor should have entered the first Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm and then reached this secret realm." The Raging Sword True Monarch said, "Withered Wood, quickly dispatch cultivators below the Hundred-Year stage to enter the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>Three days have passed, and we don't know how many of our disciples are still alive inside. We cannot delay any further.</p><p></p><p>Now, the most important thing is to disrupt the old Emperor's plan.</p><p>Once he truly controls the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, we will all face great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"...Okay!" The Withered Wood True Monarch gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Light Sect does not have many Qi Condensation cultivators below the Hundred-Year stage.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, there is no room for hesitation.</p><p>Whatever can be salvaged, must be salvaged.</p><p></p><p>He had already resigned himself to the idea that his son-in-law Kang Ful√º and Qi Yuan from the Seven-Color Peak had already perished.</p><p></p><p>Dozens or hundreds of Red Demon Seed Qi Condensation cultivators, how could that group of Foundation Establishment disciples possibly deal with them?...</p><p></p><p>"Boring, acting as an actor is boring."</p><p></p><p>In the Sunken Coffin Realm, Qi Yuan slew another late Foundation Establishment cultivator and took his soul lotus flower.</p><p>Now he had forty soul lotus flowers on him.</p><p></p><p>At first, he had been acting here, luring many cultivators to come. </p><p></p><p>But later, those cultivators stopped coming.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that his plan had failed.</p><p></p><p>But he was not discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Many people had come, and he had also seen a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>He knew that these elite warriors seemed to be guarding certain strongholds, helping their boss plot to control the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since they were guarding strongholds, they could not leave.</p><p></p><p>So, after getting the address of a stronghold, he began to unleash his fangs, constantly slaughtering.</p><p></p><p>"Taking the initiative to attack is better, fishing is too boring."</p><p>"These Qi Condensation cultivators are too useless."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It feels like a semi-finished product. I estimate it would take four or five of these Elixir Cores to defeat a normal Elixir Core."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan easily slaughtered these Elixir Cores, as their displayed power and even their experience in Tao Techniques were quite weak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even felt that the Yuli Longlong who had previously used schemes and tricks to harm him could single-handedly kill six or seven of the Elixir Cores here.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Cores here were like hastily produced goods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan completely wiped out this stronghold and proceeded to the next one.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the nearest stronghold to Qi Yuan had the dozen or so cultivators shivering in fear.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, that man is coming towards us!" one of the elite soldiers reported through a Soul Flower.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong's expression was extremely unsightly as he commanded the first stronghold.</p><p></p><p>He had already learned that the one called Qi Yuan was sweeping away the strongholds one by one. </p><p></p><p>One of the strongholds had seven Elixir Cores, almost comparable to a small sect, yet they were all flattened by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, wielding a kitchen knife, slew the Elixir Cores as easily as slaughtering dogs.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong knew that even he would not be a match for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster is he!" Liang Chong was gripped by fear.</p><p></p><p>Such a prodigy was unimaginable. The senior disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak had just reached the Foundation Establishment realm, yet the pressure he exerted was even stronger than late-stage Elixir Cores.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong even suspected that Qi Yuan might be a late-stage Elixir Core cultivator in disguise.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong coldly commanded, "All of you, listen up. Gather at the first stronghold!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong felt that they could not let Qi Yuan continue his rampage. </p><p></p><p>With everyone defending the first stronghold, the effect might not be as good as being scattered, but their combined strength would be the greatest, and Qi Yuan would not be able to break through them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>In the Sunken Coffin Land, all the elite soldiers from the various strongholds quickly rushed towards the first stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong stood in the first stronghold, seeing more and more elite soldiers arrive, and his sense of security grew.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly three hundred elite soldiers. Let's see how he breaks through!</p><p></p><p>As long as we defend the stronghold and wait for His Majesty's mission to be accomplished, Qi Yuan will surely die!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong did not consider taking the initiative to surround and kill Qi Yuan, as that might lead to unexpected incidents.</p><p></p><p>Guarding the first stronghold was the most important task, and there could be no mistakes.</p><p></p><p>After all, with so many cultivators defending the first stronghold, Qi Yuan would have to avoid it and not attack them.</p><p></p><p>To attack them would be courting death, right?</p><p></p><p>However, Liang Chong underestimated Qi Yuan's strength and courage.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed, and he saw a lazy figure appear outside the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held a kitchen knife in his hand, raised it, and shouted towards the many cultivators in the stronghold, "I, the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, you should all surrender and accept your deaths!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Was there really someone this bold?</p><p></p><p>Facing nearly three hundred powerful cultivators, he did not retreat far away, but instead directly issued a challenge.</p><p></p><p>Now, with three hundred elite soldiers by his side, Liang Chong's courage also grew. He flew up into the sky, looking at Qi Yuan with a fierce expression, "I originally thought you were not the Qi Yuan from the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, you are so crazy and reckless. Seeing us, you still don't leave, but dare to issue a challenge. You are truly a madman!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the crazy one, your whole family is crazy! My moral character is perfect, and my mental health is S+. How dare you call me a madman!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grew angrier as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Facing the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, you still refuse to surrender, and even dare to verbally attack me. You are courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, holding the kitchen knife and without further ado, charged into the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong saw Qi Yuan's recklessness and coldly commanded, "Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>But his smile soon froze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan charged into the stronghold like a wolf among sheep.</p><p></p><p>Although the Red Demon Elixir Cores were far weaker than true Elixir Cores, they were still Elixir Cores.</p><p></p><p>How could they be slain with a single knife strike?</p><p></p><p>Yet Qi Yuan's kitchen knife strike cut down five of the nearest Elixir Cores. Their defensive spiritual power was shattered as if they were made of paper, and they were killed without even having a chance to unleash their Gold Cores.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a powerful Foundation Establishment cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Was he a disguised Nascent Soul old monster? Could it be that he truly was the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment? But even the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment shouldn't be this strong, right? Liang Chong's mind was filled with various thoughts.</p><p></p><p>His previous confidence had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>The sense of security brought by the three hundred soldiers was now gone.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Quick! He's out of spiritual power, exhaust him to death!" At this moment, Liang Chong was gripped by fear, but he did not retreat.</p><p></p><p>The imperial court had given him everything. </p><p></p><p>He treated the Emperor as his own father! He was willing to die for the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Even if he died, he had to defend the first stronghold here.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, killing enemies with background music has a certain style, it's just like playing a game, the bloodshed doesn't seem so unpleasant anymore," Qi Yuan's jade slip played a small tune as his kitchen knife continued the slaughter.</p><p></p><p>He was covered in blood, but it was all the blood of his enemies.</p><p></p><p>These Elixir Cores were all junk to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He slaughtered them without any pressure at all.</p><p></p><p>In less than the time it takes to burn an incense stick, one-fifth of this stronghold's forces had been killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, drenched in blood, looked like a carefree killing god wielding a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>"Keep the music playing, keep killing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan charged into the crowd again, once more entering his hunting mode.</p><p></p><p>Although these people could not provide any experience points,</p><p></p><p>each of them had a Soul Flower.</p><p></p><p>How fragrant.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with enemies, he had never been merciful.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Liang Chong let out a loud roar, commanding the elite soldiers again.</p><p></p><p>The faces of those elite soldiers were filled with heroic and unyielding expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I will die for His Majesty!"</p><p>"I fight for the Great Merchant!"</p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were doing the most righteous thing in their lives.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, holding the kitchen knife, was unmoved. The brainwashed elite soldiers were no different from NPCs. If their master ordered them to kill their own parents and families, they would unhesitatingly carry it out.</p><p></p><p>After all, the brainwashing in the cultivation world was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, and night gradually fell.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of elite soldiers died at Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only about ten cultivators remained, glaring at Qi Yuan with fury in their eyes, but no fear, only anger.</p><p></p><p>"I will die for His Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The ten-odd cultivators charged towards Qi Yuan with ferocious expressions, and their Gold Cores exploded as they chose to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Red Demon Elixir Cores were just for show, and even their self-destruction could not stir up much of a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan patted the flesh fragments off his body and looked at the remaining one.</p><p></p><p>He held the kitchen knife, like an evil villain, and gave a sinister smile: "You're the last one left."</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong's gaze was resolute, and he held a long spear, like the most loyal warrior of the empire.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The spear moved like a dragon, breaking through in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, this powerful strike that could rival the sect master of the Black Mountain Sect was easily evaded by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He brought his knife down on Liang Chong's chest and abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Liang Chong's life force was rapidly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>He had a look of bewilderment in his eyes: "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Why was he so strong?</p><p></p><p>"Because I... am the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>There was one more thing Qi Yuan didn't say.</p><p></p><p>Even when he was just cultivating, he could kill Elixir Cores.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if this person heard it, he would be envious and come crawling out of his grave at night to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Is it all over?" Qi Yuan, covered in blood, looked at the pile of corpses.</p><p></p><p>He slowly squatted down and collected all the Soul Flowers.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the bodies on the ground, feeling that they didn't fit the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>He stepped on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the ground caved in, and all the bodies were buried in a deep pit.</p><p></p><p>He stepped again, and the ground became flat once more.</p><p></p><p>If someone came here, they would never discover that nearly three hundred powerful cultivators were buried beneath.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, holding the kitchen knife, let out a loud roar in this place: "I've wiped out all your strongholds, yet you still won't come out?"</p><p></p><p>He had vaguely sensed a powerful presence nearby, as if they were plotting something.</p><p></p><p>Since they were enemies, he couldn't let them succeed.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the authors "Wrote Well" and "xl575859" for their generous support.

        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao, their breath was like a thread, but their eyes were full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>"The one I have always admired the most is our tribal leader, the White Emperor, and now I must add another person... that is the young hero!" Zhang Sheng looked at Qi Yuan with great admiration.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiao was also extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the powerful demonic army, which could have wiped out the Song Camp, would be killed by Qi Yuan alone.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough... this feat deserves a toast!" Chen Jiao imitated the heroic style of the knight, raising the wine bowl with one arm and pouring it into his mouth, but the fresh blood coming out of the corners of his mouth dyed the wine red.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already returned to the city wall.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two men who were about to die and said, "You are about to die, is there any task that can be triggered?"</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to ask was, what regrets do they have?</p><p></p><p>If he was free or convenient, he might not refuse this task.</p><p></p><p>"Before I die, being able to see the young hero slaughter the demonic army, I have no regrets in this life." Zhang Sheng said, the color in his pupils was quickly fading, "The young hero should be a regional overlord, no need to be trapped in... the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>The City of No Return is only the hope of the Great Xia people, not the hope of all under heaven.</p><p></p><p>Young hero, you can go to other cities, there are also our tribal comrades there."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"My family's pigs are still..." Chen Jiao said halfway, without the strength to continue, leaning against the wall, unable to move. He raised the wine bowl stained with blood, as if to toast Qi Yuan, but unfortunately he could not lift it in the end.</p><p></p><p>The wind blew the military flags fluttering, the half-open wine jar emitted the fragrance of wine, the two men seemed to be drunk, and there was no more movement.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two men, the masses of people, like him, their lives fading away.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, there are three levels of death."</p><p></p><p>"The first level is brain death, when the body's functions stop working."</p><p></p><p>"The second level is social death, when a funeral is held, the identity card is cancelled, and the world is announced that he has died."</p><p></p><p>"The third level is dust returns to dust, earth returns to earth, and he is forgotten by all."</p><p></p><p>"You two are very lucky, I am destined to become a great immortal like the Dao Immortal, living as long as the heavens, and I remember you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, picking up the wine bowl in Chen Jiao's hand, which still had a trace of blood.</p><p></p><p>He took a sip, sour, with a trace of bloody taste.</p><p></p><p>"It's really hard to drink!"</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the two of them again and sat back on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia."</p><p></p><p>He called out.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia appeared, obediently clutching his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He hugged the sleeve, and the two of them sat on the city wall, looking at the yellow sand blowing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slowly recovering his energy.</p><p></p><p>He is very strong.</p><p></p><p>But slaying the demonic army also consumed a lot of him.</p><p></p><p>Now, his level is still very low, and slaying the demonic army is a bit difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention going out.</p><p></p><p>If he encounters a powerful one, it would be a case of "setting out before the victory is achieved".</p><p></p><p>Of course, guarding the City of No Return may also encounter danger.</p><p></p><p>Five days later, another demonic army appeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan once again wielded the broken sword, merged with Xiao Jia, and charged into the demonic army.</p><p></p><p>Alcohol cannot solve worries, what can solve worries? Of course, it's... killing, killing, killing, killing, killing!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, the night was pitch black, and the flags of the Great Xia fluttered on the walls of the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>"It's been half a year, and I haven't seen any intelligent life."</p><p></p><p>Since Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao died, no new intelligent beings have come to the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>However, the demonic armies continue to attack the city at intervals.</p><p></p><p>And the demonic armies that come are stronger and stronger each time, of course, with a limit.</p><p></p><p>"I'm level 59 now, when the monsters come next time, I'll be level 60."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hugged Xiao Jia and pondered.</p><p></p><p>At level 50, he did not awaken any new small skills.</p><p></p><p>Then, at level 60, will he not be able to awaken any major skills either?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the pitch-black night, a slightly helpless voice reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Am I very ugly, why haven't you come to see me for so many years?"</p><p></p><p>This voice was very familiar, Qi Yuan had also heard it in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was Ning Lao's.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he did not respond.</p><p></p><p>This time, his consciousness returned, entering the flesh and blood bound by eighteen chains.</p><p></p><p>He looked over and saw that Ning Lao seemed to be sleeping not far away, her small body curled up, looking very insecure, with an undried tear trace on the corner of her eye.</p><p></p><p>"Even an Exalted One is still sleeping." Qi Yuan inwardly mocked, "Not only sleeping, but also talking in her sleep."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sleeping Ning Lao suddenly opened her eyes, and a trace of apprehension appeared on her cold face: "Husband, you've come."</p><p></p><p>"I've told you many times, I'm not your husband, and you're not my wife."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you recognize your little wife? Or do you want to recognize me as your mother?" Ning Lao's mouth curved into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"There's no point in talking about this today." Qi Yuan sighed, then asked, "Why is there no star in the sky of the Liuwind Realm?"</p><p></p><p>He was very curious.</p><p></p><p>He had asked Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao, but did not get an answer.</p><p></p><p>So he wanted to ask Ning Lao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao heard this and a look of surprise appeared on her face: "Aren't you an Exalted One?"</p><p></p><p>If he was an Exalted One, he would naturally know why.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ning Lao: "Have I ever said I'm an Exalted One? I'm just a small Dao Cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"No, you are the Exalted One!" Ning Lao remembered that when she was besieged before, it was Qi Yuan who used his primordial divine ability to kill several powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Since he is the Exalted One, why doesn't he know that there are no stars in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>A look of terror flashed in her eyes: "You are not a cultivator of this realm!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and wanted to shrug his shoulders but found he had no shoulders: "You're a pretty smart NPC, you've actually discovered that I'm a player."</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao looked at Qi Yuan, her thoughts unclear, but also calmed down: "So you didn't come to see me because you couldn't come to this world?"</p><p></p><p>"It's because I didn't want to see you." Qi Yuan said bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"My husband is really saying one thing and thinking another." Ning Lao, dressed in a black dress, walked up to Qi Yuan, with a charming smile on her face, as if she knew Qi Yuan's identity, which made her very happy.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't told me why there are no stars in the night sky of this realm." Qi Yuan pulled the topic back on track.</p><p></p><p>"Because the Liuwind Realm... is a place forsaken by the gods."</p><p></p><p>"A place forsaken by the gods?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao looked at Qi Yuan and murmured, "Without the light of sun and moon, it is a place forsaken by the gods.</p><p></p><p>A place forsaken by the gods, where demonic thoughts abound, is called the Demonic Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Is this how the Demonic Realm is formed?" Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, you really don't know? It seems that you are not from the Liuwind Realm after all?</p><p></p><p>Does that mean I misunderstood and wrongly summoned you to our Liuwind Realm, imprisoned you here, and everything was my servant's mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you know you're wrong, why don't you release me? Then kneel down and apologize?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>If Ning Lao releases him.</p><p></p><p>This lump of flesh and blood will roll and crawl back to the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>This flesh and blood looks like a good thing.</p><p></p><p>It's better to keep it and study it carefully, to see what it is.</p><p></p><p>"Release you?" Ning Lao narrowed her eyes, as if pondering something, then a golden light flashed in her pupils, "I can't let you go!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and felt quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Ning Lao continue to say, "Husband, do you know that the Exalted One in the North Land is looking for a demon, called the Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Exalted One once said that this demon will harm the world, bring disaster to all living beings, and is the great enemy of the Liuwind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Exalted One has issued an edict, that whoever sees the Blood Demon, shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>"And then?" Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao looked at the flesh and blood bound by the eighteen chains, and the apprehension in her eyes grew stronger: "Husband, don't you feel that you are the legendary Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Exalted One bullshitting?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon, what is that?" After leaving the underground palace of the Heavenly Heart Palace, Qi Yuan returned to the City of No Return again.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the big boss of this world is the lump of flesh and blood that I'm inhabiting."</p><p></p><p>"The final battle, will I be fighting myself?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the game setting was a bit confusing.</p><p></p><p>He hugged Xiao Jia and jumped down from the city wall, digging a big pit and burying himself and Xiao Jia underground.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Great Xia Imperial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The young emperor's face already had a trace of...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With great solemnity, he sat on the dragon chair, his expression constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said in a deep voice, "Yuan Qi, Great Xia is unable to muster up a large army to support Wuguicheng."</p><p></p><p>The emperor had never imagined that the Songzi Battalion he had originally dispatched would end up defending Wuguicheng until now.</p><p></p><p>The flag of the Great Xia army had been planted on Wuguicheng for half a year already.</p><p></p><p>This was something that had never happened to Great Xia since the start of the South-North Divide.</p><p></p><p>The emperor even suspected that something had happened in Wuguicheng. He knew that if Yuan Qiong's Songzi Battalion could reach Wuguicheng, it would be considered a victory. </p><p></p><p>To have held the city for half a year was impossible. After all, the neighboring Great Sui had the Hegemon stationed at Jialancheng, who would regularly send reinforcements there.</p><p></p><p>But the Songzi Battalion led by Yuan Qiong did not even have a hegemon. How could they have held Wuguicheng for half a year?</p><p></p><p>Something must have happened in Wuguicheng. Unfortunately, Great Xia was too far from Wuguicheng to reach it.</p><p></p><p>Great Xia also could not organize another army to go to Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>The Great Xia emperor was very curious, but he understood that as an emperor, he had to suppress his curiosity. Otherwise, his curiosity might end up costing hundreds or thousands of lives.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi gritted his teeth, "Your Majesty, I wish to resign from my position as the Palace Commander and go to Wuguicheng!"</p><p></p><p>The emperor looked at Yuan Qi, his gaze filled with sorrow, "The Yuan family now only has you left as a man."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Gong had also died in battle at Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Qi defiantly raised his head, "The soldiers guarding Wuguicheng have also not returned home for half a year, and have not tasted the fragrance of their hometown's daughters for half a year. I wish to go and send them wine! I wish to fight and defend Wuguicheng together with my comrades-in-arms!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qi knelt down and kowtowed forcefully.</p><p></p><p>The young emperor was deeply moved by this sight.</p><p></p><p>A wave of sadness spread from his heart, "Alas, I will not live to see the day the South-North Divide is resolved."</p><p></p><p>The South-North Divide could last for hundreds or even thousands of years. </p><p></p><p>The soldiers who had died could be said that even if they did not go to reinforce Wuguicheng, the South-North Divide would not have been resolved so quickly.</p><p></p><p>But they still went.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Wuguicheng, there were countless graves.</p><p></p><p>Some of them belonged to Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the city wall as he had always done.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a smile appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Have more monsters come to die?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity these monsters are really too stupid, unable to communicate!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, since they're going to die anyway, I could communicate with them in advance, have them stick their heads out, and line them up for me to chop one by one. </p><p></p><p>The process may be different, but the end result is the same."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thin figure leaped down from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>As he landed on the ground, he kicked up a cloud of yellow sand.</p><p></p><p>When he stood up, his height had increased to ten meters, his body covered in a blood-red armor, holding a huge blood-colored broken sword.</p><p></p><p>He was like a giant blood-armored warrior, wielding a giant sword, charging into the demonic horde.</p><p></p><p>"Just a thousand demons, the strongest only at level 50? Is that all?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was like a fierce tiger among a flock of chickens, his long sword swinging constantly.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, all the demons were slaughtered by him.</p><p></p><p>The experience bar was also constantly and crazily rising.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a prompt entered Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>[You have reached level 60 and gained an opportunity to comprehend the origin. Do you wish to use it?]</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that every 30 levels, he would no longer awaken a great skill, but instead gain an opportunity to comprehend the origin.</p><p></p><p>He already had some understanding of the concept of origin.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, he could not afford to think too much.</p><p></p><p>The demonic horde was still in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded his sword and fought even more fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Because he wanted to quickly kill all the demons here and see what this so-called comprehension of the origin was all about.</p><p></p><p>He charged into the demonic horde, his movements godlike.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a distant place.</p><p></p><p>The face of the Demon Controller, Mi Sang, had a puzzled expression. "Cai Xia, has Wuguicheng failed again?"</p><p></p><p>The woman named Cai Xia also had an expression of surprise. "Behind Wuguicheng is the Great Xia nation, which is just a small country without even a hegemon.</p><p></p><p>The demonic horde we previously sent to attack should have been able to easily destroy Wuguicheng."</p><p></p><p>Currently, their biggest enemy was Jialancheng.</p><p></p><p>As for the conquest of Wuguicheng, it was not controlled by the Demon Controllers, but completely led by the demons themselves.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it should have been easily captured.</p><p></p><p>But this time, even after half a year, it had not yet been taken.</p><p></p><p>Mi Sang accidentally discovered this.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that other cities have supported Wuguicheng? Could it be Jialancheng?" Mi Sang was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Jialancheng can barely defend itself, yet dare to send reinforcements to Wuguicheng? That's just courting death!" Cai Xia said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"In a while, you will lead a small team of hegemon-level demons to Wuguicheng and capture it. No matter who is defending Wuguicheng, they must die," Mi Sang ordered.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that we didn't notice this small city, and it managed to secretly snatch it for half a year. </p><p></p><p>Now that we've noticed it, if it still wants to occupy it, it's seeking death!" Cai Xia was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After slaughtering all the demons, Qi Yuan's body was somewhat fatigued. He blew off the remaining blood drops on his broken sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan returned to Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>"There should be no demonic horde coming for five days."</p><p></p><p>"I should go see what this so-called comprehension of the origin is all about."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan returned to Wuguicheng and found a secluded and safe place.</p><p></p><p>He softly said, "Use."</p><p></p><p>[The longer the time spent in comprehending the origin, the better the effect.</p><p></p><p>Note that regardless of the length of the comprehension time, it will be just a moment in the present world.]</p><p></p><p>Hearing this prompt, Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>He also let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>If he spent too long in comprehension, and some small demons sneaked into Wuguicheng, he would have suffered a big loss.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems this worry was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>[Comprehension begins.]</p><p></p><p>With a prompt sound, Qi Yuan's consciousness immediately became blurred.</p><p></p><p>When his consciousness became clear again, he felt that his state was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>It was as if when he faced the great sun, he was like the Heavenly Dao, suspended in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was not suspended in the sky, he was on a mountain top.</p><p></p><p>He had become a drop of blood, or rather a ball of blood, about the size of a marble.</p><p></p><p>This drop of blood stood in the middle of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan looked up at the sky, he saw a door suddenly appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>What kind of door was that?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could not describe it, nor could he find the words to describe it.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that it was a door.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the door, Qi Yuan also felt that there were several powerful auras surging towards the sky, as if wanting to enter the door.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, before those powerful auras could even touch the door, they were instantly shattered into fragments.</p><p></p><p>That door seemed to be the most terrifying thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>Whatever touched it would die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the origin?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at that door and observed it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The door had no fixed shape, as if it was always in a state of change.</p><p></p><p>[The Door of Myriad Differences, the Unknown Door.]</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan looked at it, he could only know the name of that door, and could not obtain any other information.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was because his knowledge was too limited.</p><p></p><p>He kept staring at that door.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, a voice like a nightingale sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, there's a little neighbor next to me.</p><p></p><p>Wow, it looks so ugly, all round and red.</p><p> </p><p>Living here will lower the average looks of our Nine Pang Peak."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately looked over, and saw a small, delicate-looking bird next to him, dressed in a very flamboyant manner.</p><p></p><p>"You're the ugly one!" Qi Yuan, who was proud of his looks, could not accept this attack.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to my TM eater eater eater for the 1000 reward and to Zao Zao Hei Fen for the reward!

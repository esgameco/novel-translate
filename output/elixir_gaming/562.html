        <h1>Chapter 562</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The majestic palace had been cleaned up thoroughly, and the three of them left, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, the three of them kept their heads down, daring not to speak a word or look around carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main hall, ancestral gods passed by from time to time, and each time they saw them, the three would stop to the side and make way for the ancestral gods.</p><p></p><p>It was about half an hour before the three of them returned to their humble abode.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Star had gathered too many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The housing prices in the Imperial Star capital were extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Although the old man was a Heaven-level Armament Cultivator, the house he lived in was only less than 100 square meters.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the chaotic Star Realm's Qingshan Domain, he could have been a king or an ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The old man picked up his treasured wine and carefully poured a full cup for the three of them, his face showing an expression of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>"A jar of lunar-brewed wine is worth a mountain, and in other realms, this jar of lunar-brewed wine could exchange for a large village, no problem."</p><p></p><p>"Not as good as the immortal wine the ancestral gods drink, I heard that just a single drop can make a Saint-level expert drunk for a hundred days," Longqi said.</p><p></p><p>He and Xiao Qi were both war orphans, picked up by the old man.</p><p></p><p>The old man glared at Longqi impatiently, "Look who's talking?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Qi looked at the lunar-brewed wine, his gaze hazy, "What is wine?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, here we go again," the old man sighed, looking at Xiao Qi with resignation.</p><p></p><p>But he and Longqi were already used to Xiao Qi's condition.</p><p></p><p>Longqi continued, "I heard that in the next few days, they will select the one who will wield the Enlightening Beacon. I wonder who will be chosen."</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightening Beacon..." Hearing this, the old man's gaze became complicated.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Enlightening Beacon was truly built with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the light, there was only crimson blood.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Enlightening Beacon?" Xiao Qi asked, his face full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>The old man spoke to himself, "When the Dark Heavens descend and the world is plunged into darkness, only the Enlightening Beacon can ignite the darkness and illuminate the path forward."</p><p></p><p>This was the consensus of all the cultivators in the Imperial Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as long as they could forge the Enlightening Beacon, they could drive away the Dark Heavens and welcome the light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what they didn't know was that even with the Enlightening Beacon, the Dark Heavens would still be difficult to dispel.</p><p></p><p>But for the living... one must always have hope, a goal, right? "I want to wield the Enlightening Beacon," Xiao Qi murmured.</p><p></p><p>The old man laughed, "You really dare to dream big."</p><p></p><p>Longqi also smiled and said, "If you really wield the Enlightening Beacon, maybe you can get the old man to drink the immortal wine."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qi nodded seriously, "Drink the immortal wine."</p><p></p><p>The old man, with his head full of white hair, looked worried, "Drink the immortal wine? I just hope you two can live peacefully. Even if one of you has the chance to wield the Enlightening Beacon, I hope you won't, the frontlines... are no place for people."</p><p></p><p>Longqi and Xiao Qi's parents had both died on the frontlines, and the old man only wished for these two to live safely and peacefully in the cracks of life.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Star Capital.</p><p></p><p>Four dazzling beams of light hung high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The light was so brilliant and scorching that it was impossible to look at directly, and one couldn't even see its true form.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the majestic voice of Yuan Piaomiao resounded, "Within half a day, whoever is closest to the Enlightening Beacon will be the one to wield it in this expedition!"</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial City, countless great and small figures all looked up, either straining their eyes or squinting, gazing at the towering and dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Enlightening Beacon... it's so beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>"With the Enlightening Beacon, the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth may not necessarily be our opponents!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth are stronger than us, but if they dare to invade us, we'll bite off a piece of them!"</p><p></p><p>The people were filled with passionate emotions.</p><p></p><p>The past days had been too dark and oppressive, and now they could finally hold their heads high.</p><p></p><p>The old man squinted his eyes, trying his best to see the Enlightening Beacon clearly, murmuring, "There's a drop of my mother's blood in there."</p><p></p><p>His mother was also an Armament Forger, and she had left him when he was very young to go forge the Enlightening Beacon.</p><p></p><p>Armament Forgers who succeeded in forging the Enlightening Beacon had a one-in-ten-thousand chance of surviving, and those who failed might have a one-in-ten-thousand chance of living.</p><p></p><p>Longqi also strained his eyes to look at the Enlightening Beacon, and even though tears couldn't help but flow out, he still tried his best to look.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qi was the same, but his eyes didn't shed any tears.</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightening Beacon... what kind of rules govern it?"</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were endless.</p><p></p><p>He dreamed every night.</p><p></p><p>In his dreams, he was sometimes a grain of sand, a drop of water, or a mighty general.</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult, too difficult," Xiao Qi had a million questions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, over a hundred ancestral gods soared into the sky, rushing towards the Enlightening Beacon.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to participate in this competition were all at the peak of the Ancestral God Realm, and they might even be on the verge of breaking through at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred figures rushed towards the Enlightening Beacon.</p><p></p><p>The scorching light resisted all existence.</p><p></p><p>"My life is in my own hands, let me break through!" a woman with phoenix eyes roared, her clothes stained with blood, but she still pressed forward.</p><p></p><p>Many ancestral gods used various ingenious techniques to approach the Enlightening Beacon.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how hard they tried, they were still very far from the core.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, every so often, someone would fail to withstand the pressure and fall from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even the closest one, Fengliuwei, was still a hundred meters away from the core.</p><p></p><p>After coming to the Divine Wood Universe, he had taken the surname of the Sky Clan to commemorate the destroyed Sky Clan.</p><p></p><p>To wield the Enlightening Beacon, one needed to enter the core area.</p><p></p><p>But now, even the closest ones were still a hundred meters away from the core.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could wield it, it would be very difficult, and they wouldn't be able to unleash the true power of the Enlightening Beacon.</p><p></p><p>Sheng NÃ¼'s eyes also showed a hint of worry, "They were given too little time to grow."</p><p></p><p>If they had a few more tens of thousands of years, it might not have been like this.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's gaze was calm as he observed the ancestral gods who were still struggling to approach the Enlightening Beacon, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"This battle may not be a major one, a little tempering wouldn't hurt."</p><p></p><p>Yuan was comforting the morale of the troops.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the clues left behind by the Enlightening Dao Master have not yet disappeared, we still have a lot of time to prepare," the burly bearded man said.</p><p></p><p>This battle might not even involve any actual fighting, or it might just be a small-scale clash.</p><p></p><p>It was unlikely to affect the entire Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, in the crowd of the Imperial City, the young man named Xiao Qi suddenly had the haze in his eyes dissipate, revealing a glimmer of clarity.</p><p></p><p>"I also want to wield the Enlightening Beacon."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Xiao Qi, what are you doing?" Longqi was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even the old man was taken aback, as he saw Xiao Qi suddenly soar into the sky, heading towards the location of the Enlightening Beacon.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he know that the Imperial Star had a forbidden airspace, and one couldn't fly without permission?</p><p></p><p>And the restrictive formation in front could easily stop an Ancestral God.</p><p></p><p>But to their surprise, Xiao Qi's figure seemed to enter a realm without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>The formation that could restrain Ancestral Gods did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless gazes fell upon Xiao Qi, filled with astonishment, surprise, and confusion, all kinds of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Even Fengliuwei noticed him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang's figure was somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Because she had never seen Qi before.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, she had seen all the powerful figures with names and titles on the Imperial Star.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a shocking scene unfolded before her eyes. The unknown man actually surpassed the other ancestral gods.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, his position had already exceeded hers.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Huang Limi was shocked beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>As a peak expert at the Ancestral God realm, she naturally understood how much effort it took to barely maintain her position here.</p><p></p><p>Yet, that person had actually surpassed her? Who was he?</p><p></p><p>"He surpassed Huang Limi?"</p><p></p><p>"There is still a powerful expert in the Imperial Star?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Can he reach the core area?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, or watched the man with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes widened, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Long Qi clenched his fists, his face filled with uncontrollable excitement and joy.</p><p></p><p>Qi? In the heavens above, the irritable old man with a big beard widened his eyes: "He..."</p><p></p><p>He had some doubts about the man's identity.</p><p></p><p>Yuan shook his head, preventing him from making a move: "Just wait calmly."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao stood in the crowd, gazing at that figure, their thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"Why... does he look familiar?"</p><p>"Is it him?"</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, the core area a hundred zhang away was instantly approached.</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods were truly shaken this time.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the man had already qualified to initially grasp the Enlightenment of the Human Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a scene that shocked everyone occurred.</p><p></p><p>The young man raised his hand towards the four dazzling Enlightenment of the Human Dao in the heavens above.</p><p></p><p>Those four Enlightenment of the Human Dao flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightenment of the Human Dao... how did they fall into his hands?"</p><p></p><p>"How did he do this?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath, finding it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Those were the Enlightenment of the Human Dao, not just any ordinary objects. He could just wave his hand and have them in his possession.</p><p></p><p>This represented something.</p><p></p><p>With the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao in his hands, the confusion in Qi's eyes disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand something, recalling something.</p><p></p><p>He held the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao, his figure upright and majestic, with a hint of lazy nonchalance.</p><p></p><p>"I, Qi Yuan... holding several Enlightenment of the Human Dao... any objections?"</p><p></p><p>His voice spread in all directions at this moment, and the people of the Imperial Star were first confused, then quickly turned to joy.</p><p></p><p>"He is... the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, the Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"The Realm Lord... the Realm Lord of our Shenmu Universe!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many people's eyes were moist.</p><p></p><p>Centuries ago, news of Qi Yuan, the Realm Lord, had spread. At first, many people did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>But as the chaotic star domain was reclaimed, the Radiant Assembly retreated from Shenmu, and Yuan cleared Qi Yuan's name.</p><p></p><p>Everyone then realized that the Shenmu Universe also had a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Their Realm Lord! But for these hundreds of years, the Realm Lord had been in hiding, and many had gone searching but never found him.</p><p></p><p>From hope to despair.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Realm Lord reappeared, holding the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao, how could they not be overjoyed and excited.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... pay respects to the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>This former number one figure of the Shenmu Universe lowered his noble head at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Sheng NÃ¼... pay respects to the Realm Lord!" Sheng NÃ¼ lowered her head, her attitude reverential.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods bowed their heads, their eyes filled with awe and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The entire Imperial Star, all the people seemed to be shouting.</p><p></p><p>The sound rolled like the tide, like waves, echoing for miles.</p><p></p><p>The old man's gaze was complex, with a hint of wistfulness: "Little Qi... is actually the Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>Long Qi's face was filled with joyous excitement.</p><p></p><p>If Little Qi was just some divine-level expert, he might have felt a little jealous.</p><p></p><p>But now... the Realm Lord, it was not jealousy, but sheer joy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the heavens above, Qi Yuan held the four Enlightenment of the Human Dao, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"This time... the invasion of the Black Heavens and Black Earth?" he asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Realm Lord, yes!" Yuan stepped forward, without the arrogance of the former number one expert of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>As an existence at the second layer of the Ancestral God realm, he naturally knew how great the gap was between him and the Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze flickered slightly: "These years, I've been cultivating and refining, but I've neglected to slay the Devilish Spirits. In that case, give me the remaining three Enlightenment of the Human Dao as well. This time, I'll go to the Void Sea to meet them."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the expressions of the ancestral gods on the scene changed, and many thoughts surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Qi Yuan was the Realm Lord, he was also a being of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the will of the Shenmu Universe would have long since begun to reject him, and he would not have been able to stand here quietly.</p><p></p><p>But they had almost no contact with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's conduct, character, and the like were only known to them through written records.</p><p></p><p>This first encounter, to hand over the seven precious Enlightenment of the Human Dao forged with the blood and flesh of countless beings, they... had some distrust.</p><p></p><p>What if... what if...</p><p></p><p>All the ancestral gods had different expressions, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, such doubts were quite normal.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightenment of the Human Dao were not ordinary objects, they were related to the survival of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's gaze flickered, and he scrutinized Qi Yuan, finally speaking: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Yuan!" The irritable old man with the big beard shouted, wanting to stop him.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people did not say anything either.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's prestige was as brilliant as the sun.</p><p></p><p>Since Yuan had agreed, they had no need to veto it.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, if... Qi Yuan made a move, could they really guard the seven Enlightenment of the Human Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Here are the remaining three precious Enlightenment." The one in the worn armor, Yuan, handed the three precious Enlightenment to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The three dazzling precious Enlightenment fell into Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan examined these seven precious Enlightenment, his eyes filled with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"Gold, wood, fire, earth, thunder, cloud, rain..."</p><p></p><p>Among these seven precious Enlightenment, he saw these seven attributes.</p><p></p><p>And these seven attributes exactly matched the eight wooden tablets given to him by the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>"But... where is the water?"</p><p></p><p>If it was not a coincidence, were the precious Enlightenment also missing one, the rain?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it this way.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Sheng NÃ¼, his gaze calm: "Sister Sheng NÃ¼, have you ever been to the Shenmu Abyss in the Qingshan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Since Sheng NÃ¼ had created the Divine Descent, he addressed her as "sister" with high emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to be even more emotionally intelligent, he should call her "aunt" or "mother".</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Sheng NÃ¼ nodded, as she had learned from the two Shangguan siblings that Qi Yuan was very interested in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, "I once encountered a blind woman in the Shenmu Abyss, and she said she had seen you and even gave you a forging technique?"</p><p></p><p>"A blind woman?" Sheng NÃ¼ was perplexed. "No, but... I did gain some insights into the Void while in the Shenmu Abyss, and learned a forging technique."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan's gaze was complex.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 338</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the end, Canary still put on the school uniform.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qi Yuan sent her to school, she glared at him angrily: "No one else is wearing it, right? It's completely unnecessary!"</p><p></p><p>This expression looked quite adorable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stroked Canary's hair and said indulgently: "It's still useful occasionally."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, when someone is petite, even their anger looks cute in others' eyes.</p><p></p><p>Canary's face suddenly turned red: "This young lady is going to school now!"</p><p></p><p>She ran away quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched her retreating figure, the doting look in his eyes not dissipating at all.</p><p></p><p>Until her figure completely disappeared from view, Qi Yuan prepared to go home to practice martial arts.</p><p></p><p>His phone screen lit up with a message from Canary: "This young lady will not wear the school uniform at night!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the message on the phone screen and grinned foolishly: "Study hard and try to get into a doctoral program."</p><p></p><p>After sending the message, Qi Yuan turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly a hand tightly grabbed his arm. Canary, who was supposed to be going to school, had somehow suddenly appeared here. She looked up at Qi Yuan pitifully: "Blood Pearl, this young lady... doesn't want to go to school."</p><p></p><p>She clung to Qi Yuan's arm very tightly, as if afraid he would disappear if she let go.</p><p></p><p>The current Canary was like a little cat without a sense of security, exceptionally clingy.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, no one likes going to school. Only after graduating and starting work do people possibly miss school days," Qi Yuan sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, more often it's missing certain people from student days.</p><p></p><p>However, for Qi Yuan, those people were no different from NPCs in this world.</p><p></p><p>Canary looked at Qi Yuan pitifully: "Can this young lady make a puppet to go to school instead? What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure," Qi Yuan reached out and tightly held Canary's cold little hand in his palm.</p><p></p><p>When he played games and went to unfamiliar maps, he still had Little Wife accompanying him.</p><p></p><p>Canary had left Jiupan Mountain and left Liufeng Realm, with only him as a close person.</p><p></p><p>"Great!" Canary rejoiced happily, her face beaming with a smile. "Quick, lower your head. This young lady will reward you with a kiss!"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you stand on tiptoe?" Qi Yuan said indulgently, but still lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>Tenderness descended, like a cool night breeze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up Canary, and the two of them vanished into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>At the school gate, some voices could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Did I just imagine it? There was clearly a very good-looking couple there just now, one wearing a school uniform."</p><p></p><p>"I saw them too, I was about to secretly take a photo. How did they disappear?"</p><p></p><p>"You two must be seeing things from too much masturbation."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Underworld, at the base.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan surveyed the stone room, curiosity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been diligently practicing, whether martial arts or immortal techniques.</p><p></p><p>For him, the progress was quite average in both.</p><p></p><p>Besides cultivating, he also accompanied Canary and Little Wife, using the earth as their bed and the sky as their blanket, traveling across mountains and rivers to the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he also pretended to be a college student, going with Canary to attend university lectures.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't always let the puppet go to class and earn credits.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after several months passed.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld mission finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Staying in the stone room, Qi Yuan suddenly made a move. A flash of red and yellow light appeared, landing on the stone table.</p><p></p><p>With this strike, Qi Yuan exerted the combat power of an ordinary Yuandan level.</p><p></p><p>However, after one strike, the stone table remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, I'm still too weak now and unable to damage this stone table."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan didn't try again, but walked out of his own room.</p><p></p><p>The base was still the same as before, with occasional humans floating around.</p><p></p><p>On the bamboo buildings, men and women in various sexy outfits swayed their bodies, teasing passersby.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at them, his expression calm and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, An Qiao approached, holding a tracking dog on a leash, with a joyful expression: "I didn't expect we'd be on a mission together this time."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was naturally delighted, as the mortality rate for missions was quite high.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was able to kill a great demon of the Jade Blood realm, making him considered a strong person in this base.</p><p></p><p>"Are there others on this mission? Where are they?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The hint he received was that this was a group mission, with over twenty participants.</p><p></p><p>"They should be from other bases. We'll be able to meet them when we reach the mission location," An Qiao answered truthfully, then continued, "Mr. Qi, we need to remain vigilant about people from other bases!"</p><p></p><p>They carry out missions, cooperate to complete them, and receive rewards.</p><p></p><p>But human hearts are unpredictable. Besides the mission rewards, for those participating in the mission, the other participants are also tempting targets.</p><p></p><p>"When we enter the game, will we replace other NPCs?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he had replaced a gambling butcher.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he encountered a child bride with an innate marriage-changing sacred physique.</p><p></p><p>"The first time you enter, you replace someone else, but later... we all enter as members of the Demon Suppression Department!" </p><p></p><p>An Qiao explained carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, doesn't that mean this Demon Suppression Department... is an official organization that spans across various worlds." Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, if you're ready, shall we start the mission?" An Qiao asked.</p><p></p><p>She also wanted to complete the mission quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, I'll pick up some things," Qi Yuan said as he crouched down and picked up soil, grass, and pebbles from the ground, placing them into his blood qi space.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, An Qiao's eyes showed a puzzled expression: "What are you picking those up for?"</p><p></p><p>"For my wife to research. She's about to become a doctor, maybe she can research a way to enter this place.</p><p></p><p>That way, she could accompany me on mission worlds." Qi Yuan didn't hide anything.</p><p></p><p>He would give these pebbles and soil to Canary for research.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, An Qiao couldn't help but want to laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone in the world fears the Underworld like a demon, yet you're willing to let your wife come down to accompany you."</p><p></p><p>"Being separated from her for too long, I always want to be together," Qi Yuan said casually as he picked up sticks from the ground.</p><p></p><p>A flash of envy passed through An Qiao's eyes: "I hope your wife quickly researches how to enter and leave the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Of course, An Qiao didn't believe Qi Yuan's wife could research these things.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld was incredibly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Over so many years, talented people had emerged in the Underworld, encompassing almost all the elites from the past ten thousand years of the Arch Star.</p><p></p><p>However, no one had been able to research a method of entry and exit.</p><p></p><p>Their coming and going was completely dictated by the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With Canary's abilities, plus his eyes that could see hidden information, he was somewhat confident about researching the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>After about a few dozen breaths, Qi Yuan had picked up quite a few samples, all stuffed into his blood qi space.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we can go complete the mission now."</p><p></p><p>"Okay," An Qiao said.</p><p></p><p>The two came to the very center of the base, where there was a circular stone platform, about a hundred square meters in size.</p><p></p><p>As long as one stood on it, they could receive mission prompts and enter the mission.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan stepped onto the circular stone platform.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, space began to rotate at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This rotation seemed to have no duration, completed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly listened carefully, wanting to hear something.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the time was too short, he didn't hear anything.</p><p></p><p>When he came to his senses, he suddenly appeared in a space emitting a faint light.</p><p></p><p>This space seemed to be in the air.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he and An Qiao seemed to be stepping on clouds.</p><p></p><p>The game's prompt also entered Qi Yuan's ears at this moment.</p><p></p><p>[Feng Yuan ruled the world with filial piety, establishing the country for thirty years. The north fell into chaos, with demon tribes rampaging and feeding on humans.</p><p></p><p>The northern aristocratic families suffered greatly, fleeing south one after another.</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang City is located in the north, besieged by demon tribes.</p><p></p><p>The Tong clan, a gentry family of seven generations of single heirs, suffered greatly. Three months ago, demon tribes launched a major attack on the city, causing countless deaths and injuries. Tong Tianyou, the direct grandson of the Tong clan, was captured by the demon tribes.</p><p></p><p>Mission: Please find Tong Tianyou and investigate the cause of death of his father, Tong Youwei.</p><p></p><p>Reward: Ancestral Reversion Pill.]</p><p></p><p>"It's actually an Ancestral Reversion Pill!" An Qiao couldn't help but exclaim, clearly knowing the mission reward.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is this pill very powerful?" Qi Yuan asked, while also scanning this space with a glance.</p><p></p><p>He saw more than ten people nearby, all blood warriors, emanating not weak auras.</p><p></p><p>However, most were at the Blood Qi realm, with only a few at the Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>These people were all executing the mission together with them.</p><p></p><p>Before An Qiao could answer, a bald man spoke up: "The strength of us blood warriors depends on the concentration of our bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The stronger our ancestors' bloodline, the higher our bloodline concentration, the stronger our talent, and the greater our potential.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Reversion Pill allows us to glimpse a trace of our ancestors' true intent in the void, thereby enhancing our bloodline concentration."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the bald man, An Qiao's eyes showed wariness.</p><p></p><p>She continued: "The higher one's bloodline talent, the greater the effect of the Ancestral Reversion Pill.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, if one's bloodline talent is very low, the Ancestral Reversion Pill might not even be as good as a Body Tempering Blood Pill."</p><p></p><p>The bald man looked at the two of them and continued: "If you survive and complete the mission, I'm willing to buy your Ancestral Reversion Pills at a high price."</p><p></p><p>"That won't be necessary. The Ancestral Reversion Pills are of great use to us as well," An Qiao quickly refused.</p><p></p><p>The bald man smiled, then looked at Qi Yuan with interest: "I heard that Brother Chen Fan died in the last mission, and his belongings... were obtained by a newcomer named Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>I wonder, are you that person?"</p><p></p><p>There were also special ways of communication within the base.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with strong enough abilities, one could even cross the sea of mist to reach other bases.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what about it?" Qi Yuan looked at the bald man, feeling he looked like a boiled egg.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if you would be willing to transfer the entry token for the Genius Alliance to me? If you give it to me, I will protect your life during this mission!" the bald man said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He had always wanted to join the Genius Alliance, but unfortunately, his talent hadn't caught their attention.</p><p></p><p>If he could get the Genius Alliance token, he could join this powerful organization.</p><p></p><p>He could leave this backwater and go to a major base, without worrying about when the base might be swallowed by sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Protect me? Your strength... doesn't seem up to it," Qi Yuan said with a look of disdain.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about the Genius Alliance entry token, but he wouldn't easily give it to someone else.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe this person could protect him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm at least at the middle stage of the Jade Blood realm, just one step away from the late stage. Protecting you completely won't be any problem," the bald man said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a fierce voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Guang, I want that Genius Alliance entry token!" A bearded man walked over, his body full of a bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the bearded man, the expressions of the men and women present all changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon Hand Zhou Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually him, this guy is on our team."</p><p></p><p>"We're done for, they say this guy often targets his teammates!"</p><p></p><p>These people participating in the mission all looked extremely wary when they saw Zhou Yuan, unconsciously taking a step back to distance themselves from him.</p><p></p><p>The bald Yang Guang's eyes showed wariness</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Yuan, in business we follow the principle of first come, first served. Besides, this young man hasn't yet decided to trade with me. If you want to trade, you can offer a higher price, and we can compete for it," said Zhou Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A trace of disdain flashed in Zhou Yuan's eyes: "He's not worthy of trading with me. If it weren't for you... I would have already taken it by force."</p><p></p><p>With these words, everyone present witnessed Zhou Yuan's domineering attitude. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Yuan did have the qualifications to be domineering.</p><p></p><p>His strength was the highest among those present, at the late stage of the Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan, who was standing to the side, revealed a smile in his eyes: "Yang Guang, didn't you want to be my bodyguard? First drive Zhou Yuan away, and I'll see if you have the ability to protect me fully."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan needed to complete tasks in the game world and also meet his substitute for his lost love.</p><p></p><p>Having an extra helper was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>As for the Genius Alliance credentials, they could be exchanged.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that he couldn't give Luo Bufan any benefits.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, Luo Bufan's family hadn't passed down any legacy.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Yang Guang's face lit up with joy. At this moment, a powerful aura emanated from him, overwhelmingly strong: "Zhou Yuan, I'm now protecting this young man. Please leave, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan grinned and licked his lips: "Hehe, I'll leave right now."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhou Yuan left directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, An Qiao was dumbfounded: "Is this guy sick?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang hurriedly explained, spreading his hands: "He's not my stooge. Zhou Yuan has always been like this, seemingly mentally ill!"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid Qi Yuan would misunderstand that he and Zhou Yuan were in cahoots.</p><p></p><p>"He is indeed seriously ill, mentally unstable," Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a strange light.</p><p></p><p>[Zhou Yuan, late-stage Jade Blood realm warrior, consumed too many Atavistic Pills, his bloodline deeply influenced by his ancestors, resulting in drastic personality changes and erratic behavior.]</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity Zhong Niao isn't here, otherwise we could issue him a mental illness certificate," Qi Yuan muttered, then asked Yang Guang, "Does consuming too many Atavistic Pills cause one to be influenced by their ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>"Generally not," Yang Guang replied, but then thought of something and said seriously, "It happens in a small number of cases. After all, some bloodline sources only treat their descendants as nourishment. If this happens, blood transfusion is necessary to change one's fate."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he now wanted to see who the bloodline ancestor of this body was.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Yang Guang and continued: "This time when we enter the mission, I plan to hunt some demon beasts to obtain demon blood essence. Is your strength... enough to protect me fully?"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely, more than enough. With me around, I'll make sure you return with a full harvest!" Yang Guang guaranteed, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>Demon blood essence could enhance one's strength, but each person could only absorb a limited amount.</p><p></p><p>Even with Blood Stasis Pills, one couldn't consume too much.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang believed that given Qi Yuan's strength, the demon blood essence obtained from hunting an early-stage Jade Blood realm demon beast would be more than enough.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, thank you for your help, Brother Yang Guang," Qi Yuan smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>With a fighter by his side this time in the game, he could take it easy.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang nodded confidently.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this time, the Genius Alliance entry credentials would definitely be his. The only thing he needed to be careful and vigilant about was Zhou Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He might strike in secret.</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a few more sentences, the clouds in the sky flashed with light.</p><p></p><p>The nearly twenty people present finally arrived in the world of their mission.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Tong family, located in the center of Zhenyang City, was a well-known gentry clan in the city.</p><p></p><p>The late Old Master Tong had once served in the Secretariat, as a third-rank Secretary Supervisor, holding a high position with great authority.</p><p></p><p>However, after Old Master Tong retired, before his political legacy could be utilized, the northern regions fell into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Numerous gentry and aristocratic clans migrated south.</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang City held a special position, with Mount Shu Demon in front of it.</p><p></p><p>The mountain had treacherous terrain, unsuitable for large-scale migration.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Mount Shu Demon was home to many demons, including a demon hero.</p><p></p><p>This demon hero had ambitions, unifying three thousand demons on Mount Shu Demon, forming a demon stronghold and training demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Zhenyang, Hengyang, and Qishui, three cities, were all besieged by Mount Shu Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Tong family's grandson had been abducted by demons from Mount Shu Demon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Tong family residence, Qi Yuan, wearing the uniform of the Demon Suppression Department, was yawning.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang took out a token and, looking at the trembling shop assistant in front, spoke with an authoritative voice: "Where is Tong Youwei? What year did he die?"</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the mission world, Yang Guang planned to start by questioning locals to investigate the Tong family's affairs before entering the Tong residence.</p><p></p><p>The shop assistant was an elderly man with white hair, hunched over, looking less than 1.5 meters tall: "Reporting to the official, Old Master Tong Youwei passed away three years ago, dying suddenly in the Tong family courtyard.</p><p></p><p>It's said that his death was extremely tragic, with his entire heart dug out. People say it was a demon disaster, such a sin!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning demons, the shop assistant's eyes were filled with hatred, as if demons had devoured his family.</p><p></p><p>"His heart was dug out?" Yang Guang frowned.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard the shop assistant say:</p><p></p><p>"Poor Old Master Tong and Old Madam Tong, their Tong family had only single heirs for seven generations, and they loved Old Master Tong Youwei dearly.</p><p></p><p>The day he died, Old Madam Tong's hair turned white overnight, aging her by more than ten years."</p><p></p><p>"Did the Tong family investigate which demon was responsible?" Yang Guang asked.</p><p></p><p>"How would the Tong family dare to investigate? Even if they found out, could they... dare to go to Mount Shu Demon to demand answers?" The shop assistant shook his head, his aged face showing regret.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang narrowed his eyes, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan spoke up: "Let's go see if there are any clues at the Tong residence."</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang nodded.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao, leading a tracking dog, also headed towards the Tong residence.</p><p></p><p>By now, quite a few of Qi Yuan and his companions' colleagues had already entered the Tong residence.</p><p></p><p>So, the arrival of Qi Yuan's group of three people and a dog was unimpeded.</p><p></p><p>They were greeted by an old steward of the Tong residence.</p><p></p><p>"With the young master abducted by demons, the old master has fallen ill with worry and is bedridden, unable to receive guests. Please understand," the steward, quite elderly, said, walking with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Where did Tong Youwei live? Take us to see," Qi Yuan asked casually, scanning the Tong residence.</p><p></p><p>This mission had two parts: finding Tong Tianyou and investigating the truth behind Tong Youwei's death.</p><p></p><p>Tong Tianyou had been abducted by demons, so to find him... it was simple and direct, just a trip to Mount Shu Demon.</p><p></p><p>The truth behind Tong Youwei's death required their investigation.</p><p></p><p>"Well... after the young master passed away, the house he lived in suddenly caught fire, burning everything clean, leaving nothing behind," the steward replied.</p><p></p><p>"What about his wife?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Alas... she died in childbirth... giving birth to the young master..." the steward said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Outside, people say Tong Youwei was killed by a demon. Which demon was it exactly?" Yang Guang asked.</p><p></p><p>The steward quickly shook his head: "This servant doesn't know. The county magistrate also sent people to investigate, but they found nothing, only saying it was the work of demons."</p><p></p><p>"Where is your young master buried?" Yang Guang asked again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they would need to exhume the body for examination.</p><p></p><p>"This..." the steward looked conflicted, "Are you gentlemen planning to examine the body? The officials who came before had the same idea, but... you might be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>After the young master was buried, there was a demon incident in the cemetery, and the young master's body... was stolen."</p><p></p><p>"What?" An Qiao exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"This case is very strange!" Yang Guang narrowed his eyes, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>Tong Youwei's death was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>His residence burned down, his body stolen.</p><p></p><p>If it were just one coincidence, it might be understandable, but one after another, it couldn't be coincidence.</p><p></p><p>It indicated that there was a hand behind the scenes hiding something.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, what do you think?" Yang Guang looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Based on my years of TV-watching experience, usually when a body can't be found, it's a case of faking death!" Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>That's how it always plays out on TV.</p><p></p><p>There's also the trope of pushing an enemy off a cliff or stabbing them through the heart... and they still survive.</p><p></p><p>That's why when Qi Yuan kills someone, he makes sure to grind the bones to dust and see with his own eyes that they're dead.</p><p></p><p>"But since the game settings say he's dead, I guess he must be dead," Qi Yuan didn't want to argue with the game designers about the settings.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang couldn't help but smile, agreeing with Qi Yuan's words. He continued to ask the steward: "Did Tong Youwei have any enemies in Zhenyang City?"</p><p></p><p>"The young master was kind-hearted, never made enemies, and rarely went out. He had no enemies!" the steward said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, a kind-hearted shut-in, is that right?</p><p></p><p>Indeed... not many enemies.</p><p></p><p>After all, there's no internet here, so they can't flame each other online.</p><p></p><p>"How was Tong Youwei's relationship with your old master?" Qi Yuan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"The old master and madam loved the young master dearly. Once when the young master fell ill with a fever and was unconscious, the madam personally went to Wangshan Temple to seek Buddha water, kowtowing every step of the way up 762 stone steps, finally getting a holy monk to help cure the young master's illness.</p><p></p><p>This incident is well-known throughout the northern regions.</p><p></p><p>In Zhenyang City, anyone you ask would know that our old master and madam loved the young master so much they would have plucked the sun from the sky for him if they could." As the steward spoke, his expression became somewhat desolate. "After the young master passed, the old master and madam's health has been deteriorating.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the little young master, I'm afraid... sigh.</p><p></p><p>This time, if the little young master doesn't return safely, the Tong family lineage... might end.</p><p></p><p>Officials, please make sure to bring the little young master back safely!"</p><p></p><p>The steward seemed to empathize deeply with the old master, his old eyes becoming misty.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yang Guang transmitted a message: "Can we trust what this steward is saying?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... his words are true, but whether he's hiding anything is another matter," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>When the steward was speaking earlier, his nose didn't grow longer.</p><p></p><p>This meant the steward wasn't lying to him.</p><p></p><p>"So what should we do now?" Yang Guang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see their old master," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the head of the Tong family, the old master would surely know the most.</p><p></p><p>And since Qi Yuan could detect lies, he wasn't afraid of being deceived by the old master.</p><p></p><p>Although everyone said Tong Youwei was killed by demons, it was also possible... that he was killed by the old master.</p><p></p><p>After all, anything is possible.</p><p></p><p>However, just as they were following the steward towards the old master's quarters, they heard a rough voice.</p><p></p><p>"You're not even old enough to grow hair, and you dare to meddle in my affairs? We from the Demon Suppression Department are here to investigate the Tong family's matters.</p><p></p><p>A mere county magistrate, if he wants to see me, he should come and invite me personally!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, they saw this person kick out, sending the young-looking yamen runner flying.</p><p></p><p>The youthful yamen runner lay on the ground, clutching his stomach, his face showing pain, but not daring to make any retort.</p><p></p><p>"This yamen runner looks quite young, probably not even fourteen. This person's attack was so heavy-handed, it's really despicable!" An Qiao couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang also frowned, quickly going over to help up the yamen runner who still looked like a child.</p><p></p><p>He was still kindhearted.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang looked at the attacker with an unfriendly gaze: "Although we're on a mission, they are still living people!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yang Guang, the attacker was clearly wary of Yang Guang's strength and immediately lowered his head, saying: "I was wrong in this matter!"</p><p></p><p>In the Netherworld, strength is supreme.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to offend Yang Guang, so apologizing wasn't a big deal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, standing not far away, looked at the top of Yang Guang's head where sunlight was pouring down, and couldn't help but say: "His bald head is really shiny."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

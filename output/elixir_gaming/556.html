        <h1>Chapter 556</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was somewhat fanatical, even... ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Just like a cat seeing a mouse.</p><p></p><p>This reaction left Red Mei and Zhao Yan dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>After all, just from hearing the description of the Master of the Academy, they knew how powerful, terrifying, and even desperate the enemy they were facing was.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful, yet unkillable.</p><p></p><p>How to fight such an enemy? How to kill them?</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy also had a hesitant look, with a confused expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the past, many talented cultivators had asked him about the existence of the Mysterious Deities, and without exception, all who heard his narration were filled with despair and gloom.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, with his fanatical expression, was a rare sight.</p><p></p><p>He seemed not to be a person of the Divine Wood Universe, but rather one of the Mysterious Deities.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of Bai Yue Guang is truly exceptional," Qi Yuan was even about to drool.</p><p></p><p>This expression left the usually calm Master of the Academy somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, the Master's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Deities... have arrived."</p><p></p><p>He was not anxious, but merely regretful, as if also reminding Qi Yuan to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Deities?" Qi Yuan squinted his eyes, "What Mysterious Deities? This is my beloved Bai Yue Guang!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rose from the recliner and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the sky and earth suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>Massive shadows replaced the vast expanse of the land.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Blood City, many civilians instinctively looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>When they saw those towering figures, many people were stunned, abruptly sitting on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Some kept kowtowing, with snot and tears flowing.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Deities have descended!"</p><p></p><p>"I told you, those fellows, why couldn't they just live peacefully? They had to resist, and now they've provoked the wrath of the Mysterious Deities!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, ninety-nine Mysterious Deities gathered.</p><p></p><p>The smaller ones were perhaps only a few hundred zhang in size, while the larger ones spanned dozens of li.</p><p></p><p>The descent of the Mysterious Deities blocked out the sun, giving a sense of the arrival of a vast celestial army.</p><p></p><p>However, to describe them as a celestial army would be an overestimation.</p><p></p><p>No one knew, not even the strongest in the Divine Wood Universe, the Primal One, that in the core region of the Mysterious, the Yang Deities... were merely the celestial soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these Mysterious Deities, his gaze falling on the familiar Dark-Eyed Mysterious Deity: "So you're still alive!"</p><p></p><p>The Dark-Eyed Deity looked at Qi Yuan with some trepidation, but remembering the other Mysterious Deities behind him, he regained his arrogance.</p><p></p><p>"Mere human, how do you know of the greatness of Lord Kai Huang?</p><p></p><p>If you kill me, with Lord Kai Huang here, I can be revived at any time!"</p><p></p><p>The Dark-Eyed Deity said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>The other Mysterious Deities also eyed Qi Yuan with malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>As for the Master of the Academy...</p><p></p><p>In their sight, the Master seemed to not exist at all.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became even more joyful.</p><p></p><p>This was an experience package.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let them get scared away.</p><p></p><p>He pondered deeply, trying to think of a way to lure all these Mysterious Deities down.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he thought, he couldn't come up with a good plan.</p><p></p><p>Even if his acting skills were excellent, he would still give the impression that they could easily kill him.</p><p></p><p>However, they had not cast any debuff, so he could just die a few times and then flee.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, upon seeing us, you do not flee, showing that even a withered mythical legend has such confidence," the white-bearded Kai Huang spoke, his face as confident as ever.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I flee?" Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Especially his left eyebrow, it was jumping frantically!</p><p></p><p>It was probably jumping too fast, almost as if it had stopped.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew this was a sign of great fortune and wealth.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, with mythical realm strength and the Mandate's favor, you have the qualifications and confidence to not fear us," Kai Huang said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in the fallen regions of other worlds, even if the Mysterious Deities gathered together, they might not be able to subdue Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"But alas... you have encountered me!" </p><p></p><p>Kai Huang's face flashed with a sharp gleam.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan felt a powerful, massive force attracting him.</p><p></p><p>This force was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>His left eyebrow twitched violently again.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan shouted, "What is this? Don't pull me in!"</p><p></p><p>Although he shouted this, Qi Yuan did not resist at all, but rather seemed to actively dive into that treasured object.</p><p></p><p>The Kai-Wings Deity saw this and flattered, "Indeed, you are a Mysterious Deity who has emerged from the Mysterious, Lord Kai Huang's casual display of a treasure can so quickly draw in a mythical realm expert."</p><p></p><p>The other Deities echoed in agreement, "Even the mythical cannot resist at all."</p><p></p><p>Kai Huang was extremely pleased.</p><p></p><p>The effect of this treasure was even better than he had expected.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let us enter the treasure, do not keep that human waiting long."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the nearly hundred Mysterious Deities swiftly entered the treasure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood quietly in the treasure.</p><p></p><p>The treasure was ethereal, like a true vacuum, occasionally revealing some meteorite fragments or stellar debris.</p><p></p><p>As Kai Huang and the ninety-nine Deities entered, a look of apprehension appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"There's no way out of here?"</p><p></p><p>His voice trembled, as if he had some fear.</p><p></p><p>Before Kai Huang could speak, the Kai-Wings Deity said, "This treasure was bestowed by Lord Kai Huang's uncle, even Yang Deities cannot escape from it."</p><p></p><p>Kai Huang nodded in satisfaction, adding, "Not even the first layer of Yang Deities can escape."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly dissatisfied with the Kai-Wings Deity's description of the treasure's level.</p><p></p><p>"So strong? Doesn't that mean... we all have to stay here?" Qi Yuan looked very apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he was just trying to gather more information.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this treasure has its own sentience... as long as you die, or we are all wiped out, then we can naturally leave," Kai Huang did not mind telling a dead man more.</p><p></p><p>This behavior was akin to the enemy's crystal being invaded, the jungler not attacking the tower, and taunting in front of the enemy's fountain, waiting for them to revive, while also showing off his famous sword to block the fountain's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"I don't die, and you can't get out?" Qi Yuan's eyes widened, looking very... fearful and worried.</p><p></p><p>His nose did not grow longer, which meant the other side was not lying.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, now you're afraid, aren't you?" The Dark-Eyed Deity said.</p><p></p><p>"Look at him, being a mythical legend, his body trembling, not even better than a commoner!"</p><p></p><p>"But don't underestimate him, after all, he is a mythical legend!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, although Lord Kai Huang has many Mysterious sources, we shouldn't waste them."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, wasting a bit won't hurt, I... have many Mysterious sources, and my uncle has many as well," Kai Huang said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining this information, Qi Yuan suddenly burst into laughter, "Hahaha haha haha..."</p><p></p><p>This behavior startled the Mysterious Deities.</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>"Is he insane?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze turned to Kai Huang, his eyes burning with fanaticism: "So your name is Kai Huang, eh? After you die, I'll erect a tomb for you in the Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was always deeply devoted to his Bai Yue Guang.</p><p></p><p>To ensure their legacy was not devoured by others, he would personally take care of the Bai Yue Guang's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>As for Kai Huang, he was even more considerate, wanting to erect a tomb and offer sacrifices to him.</p><p></p><p>Although Kai Huang did not have an elderly aura about him.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's eyebrow was twitching, comparable to refining the Heavenly Emperor's Banner, even stronger by a fraction.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" Kai Huang raged.</p><p></p><p>The other dozens of Mysterious Deities were also furious.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now, you can only rely on your eloquence!" </p><p></p><p>Facing the attacks of the gods, Qi Yuan's expression was relaxed and casual: "In order to play with you properly, I've decided... to temporarily not become mortal!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to temporarily not become mortal.</p><p></p><p>This decision is akin to... seeing a beautiful woman on a certain platform, and commenting: "For you, I'm willing to get a villa and luxury car for free."</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" Qi Huang raged.</p><p></p><p>The ninety-eight mysterious gods did not hesitate at all, rushing towards Qi Yuan. "Together with you!"</p><p></p><p>Dazzling death! Tyrannical power!</p><p>Absolute adaptation!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's combat power was at its peak.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had slain the Phoenix Cry with a single sword, fusing the embryonic form of the universal rules.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his full firepower unleashed, his combat power was even stronger than when he was mortal.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle!"</p><p></p><p>With just a single sword strike, Kai Chi, who ranked among the top three in power, was slain. Kai Chi was a great Saint who had reached the Sixth Step of the Heavenly Ascension.</p><p></p><p>Slain with a single sword? </p><p></p><p>The other mysterious gods were stunned, somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang narrowed his eyes: "Unexpectedly... you actually have the combat power of a fully realized mythical being."</p><p></p><p>This was far stronger than the Withered Mythology.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it weren't for their mysterious origins, they might not even be a match for him.</p><p></p><p>"As the Mandate Bearer, you are blessed by the Mandate. If it were other mysterious gods, perhaps you could turn the tables on them, but unfortunately, you've encountered me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang was full of self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it were Uncle Luan, he would still die today, let alone you!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Luan was the mysterious god who had defeated the mortal Qi Yuan a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't worry... just self-detonate, a quick victory, to give this human a little... shock from the Black Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang was a fool with deep pockets.</p><p></p><p>His mysterious origins were endless, and he had no fear of exhausting them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other mysterious gods did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Human, let you see the gap between us!"</p><p></p><p>"Despair!"</p><p>"Fear!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, ninety-seven brilliant fireworks rose up.</p><p></p><p>This kind of tremor, if unleashed in the outside world, would be enough to tear the heavens and earth apart.</p><p>In the Canglan Realm, it could almost sink a entire continent.</p><p></p><p>All the attacks landed on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was like firecrackers going off, cracking and popping.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p>"It hurts so much!"</p><p>"Wah wah wah, I'm going to die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted frantically, his acting reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>As for his injuries? </p><p>There were none.</p><p></p><p>The Absolute Adaptation combined with the embryonic form of the Death Radiance Rule allowed him to be immune to any power weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>These attacks couldn't even tickle him.</p><p></p><p>But he had to keep wailing.</p><p></p><p>His experience bar was rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had experimented before - the monsters he had "scared to death" also gave him experience points.</p><p>These explosive attacks naturally caused his experience to skyrocket as well.</p><p>In just a few breaths, he had leveled up by 1 whole level.</p><p></p><p>"You're still alive..." Qi Huang was stunned, "Is this the peak of mythology?"</p><p></p><p>The other self-detonating mysterious gods also revived one by one, looking at Qi Yuan with astonishment.</p><p>They saw Qi Yuan's weak and fragile appearance, obviously severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"But we are all in our prime state, the advantage is mine!" Qi Huang said proudly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kai Chi stepped forward: "Lord Qi Huang, I wish to slay him!"</p><p>He was unsatisfied after being slain by Qi Yuan earlier.</p><p></p><p>"He is the Mandate Bearer, although he only has a thread of life left, you going to slay him would certainly not be a match." Qi Huang said grandly, "I'm in a hurry, continue self-detonating."</p><p></p><p>The other mysterious gods saw this and did not hesitate.</p><p>They self-detonated again.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah!"</p><p>"It hurts to death!"</p><p>"Mommy!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wailed again, his aura seeming to have only a thread left.</p><p></p><p>When the revived mysterious gods looked at Qi Yuan again, they all felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>One drop of blood and he still wouldn't die? Has he been blood-locked? Qi Huang narrowed his eyes: "Is this the Mandate Bearer? Self-detonate again, twice is not enough, three times, five times, ten times should be enough!"</p><p></p><p>His mysterious origins could support the revival of Realm Lord-level mysterious gods many times over.</p><p></p><p>"Mandate Bearer, even when you meet me... you must kneel!" Qi Huang was full of confidence and arrogance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>The Academician looked at the disappeared mysterious gods and Qi Yuan, his expression complex.</p><p>Zhao Yan gritted his teeth, the events of the day were too many, each one exceeding his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... should not have died in this battle." The Academician sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>He made a decision.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of a bronze mirror, a mysterious aura permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>The bronze mirror reflected a dilapidated battleship.</p><p></p><p>The dried blood stained the battle flag, and the gaping hole the size of a bowl was pitch black, bottomless.</p><p></p><p>On the battleship, various divine artifacts and ancestral divine artifacts were placed.</p><p>Carefully observing, one would find the battleship was covered in weathered scars, as if left over from an ancient battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifted, and a towering man was reflected in the bronze mirror.</p><p></p><p>In tattered robes and armor, his long hair scattered, blood dripping from his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... I need your help." </p><p></p><p>The other person in the bronze mirror was none other than Yuan, the number one powerhouse of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p>The Second Layer of the Solar Deity, at the peak of the Great Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Yuan spoke, his voice aged, yet with an eternal solar brilliance hidden within.</p><p></p><p>"In the Kuijin Realm, I discovered a Mandate Bearer, his talent... is very high.</p><p>He is only one step away from the Ancestral Deity, if he breaks through and establishes himself, perhaps... he has the hope of reaching your level in the future." The Academician said.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's handsome face revealed a bitter smile: "Is he very dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Academician replied.</p><p></p><p>"Within ten years, two Ancestral Deities will go to the Kuijin Realm to bring him to the Primordial Star Realm."</p><p></p><p>The scene in the bronze mirror disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Academician let out a sigh of relief: "I hope he can survive the next ten years, after ten years, everything may still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>The Academician looked at Red Plum, his gaze filled with sorrow: "Alright, it's time for us to leave... the Kuijin Realm."</p><p></p><p>Red Plum was stunned, looking at Zhao Yan with an unwilling expression: "Teacher, I..."</p><p></p><p>The Academician shook his head: "He is different from you, he belongs to the Kuijin Realm, let's go."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and three years had passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Now, the situation in the Kuijin Realm was rather treacherous.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious gods had disappeared, and the rebel army was marching triumphantly, occupying many cities.</p><p>Fierce battles were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other cities, Cloud Blood City seemed much quieter.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang was eating a bun, stuffing it into his mouth: "Don't worry, the young master is a god descended from the heavens, the world could be destroyed and he would still be fine!"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Shen Lingxuan's cold face carried a hint of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the Kuijin Realm, a man in blue robes appeared, his face filled with intense battle intent.</p><p></p><p>"Good job, Qi Yuan, to avoid my challenge, you actually hid in the Kuijin Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I still found you!"</p><p></p><p>"Soon, you will know who is the true number one powerhouse of the Sixth Step of the Heavenly Ascension!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

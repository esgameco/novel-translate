        <h1>Chapter 324</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the tracking dog's words were too shocking.</p><p></p><p>And it was easy to explain why Qi Yuan, a newcomer, had such powerful abilities.</p><p></p><p>Connecting all of this made everything logical and reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the people in front of him with a gaze as if looking at idiots.</p><p></p><p>"Are you missing a screw in your heads? If I were the Sea God, why wouldn't I just marry my child bride directly? </p><p></p><p>Why go through all this trouble to marry her in such a roundabout way?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that there were still too few smart people like him in this world.</p><p></p><p>These words left An Qiao stunned.</p><p></p><p>The man in black tight clothes was a bit confused... He wanted to say, what does what you're saying now have to do with whether or not you're the Sea God? However, if the other party really was the Sea God, he probably wouldn't be saying so much to them.</p><p></p><p>This made him lower his guard slightly. Could it be that the other party really wasn't the Sea God?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, ten-meter-high waves stirred up by the sea came rolling in from afar, sweeping from the sea surface onto the beach.</p><p></p><p>The towering white waves were an impressive sight.</p><p></p><p>All the villagers trembled in fear, and any thoughts of disloyalty vanished from the village chief's mind in that moment.</p><p></p><p>The position swept by these towering waves was exactly where the bridal sedan chair was.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Mei was confined inside the sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>If the waves hit, she would surely die.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan sighed leisurely: "How come it's not like what happens on TV? Does this mean... I have to snatch the bride early?"</p><p></p><p>On TV, they always start snatching the bride when questions are being asked.</p><p></p><p>Now no one was asking questions! He took a step forward, preparing to make his move.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an unexpected change occurred.</p><p></p><p>A loud shout suddenly came from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"Die... you all must die, everyone must die!"</p><p></p><p>A staggering figure appeared, emanating the powerful aura of the Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>That figure appeared abruptly, pushing out a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red killing intent boiled, flashes of jade-like light flickered, and eighteen blood palms could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>The roar of a terrifying beast also sounded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this was that powerful Jade Blood realm expert unleashing his innate martial technique.</p><p></p><p>The powerful palm strike pushed out violently, striking the huge waves.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen blood palms continuously struck the huge waves.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The huge waves rolled and shattered under such a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a madman!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare he attack the Sea God!"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's face was full of surprise.</p><p></p><p>The one who attacked was the deranged man they had been secretly following.</p><p></p><p>The deranged man hovered in the air, his hair disheveled, making it impossible to see his face clearly.</p><p></p><p>However, his presence in the air put immense pressure on almost everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Such a palm strike was not something humanly possible.</p><p></p><p>Even if faced with a thousand cavalry, he could probably escape.</p><p></p><p>The deranged man shattered the sea waves, his clothes soaked. He stood amidst the waves, his expression ferocious: "Demons... they should all die, they must all die!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he attacked the sea again.</p><p></p><p>Each strike hit the sea, stirring up huge waves, but it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>The village chief stood on the high platform, his body trembling.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the villagers also felt fear in their hearts at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"He really is mad. Recklessly venting like this, wasting his blood martial energy. When the Sea God appears later, what will he use to fight?"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly is this person? There clearly weren't any Jade Blood realm martial artists in Yunyan County!"</p><p></p><p>The man in black tight clothes looked suspicious as he watched the deranged man slapping the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>"He is... Luo Bufan!" Just then, a heavy voice came.</p><p></p><p>Two men were seen quietly appearing near An Qiao.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomers, An Qiao's face showed a delighted expression: "Captain!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the captain, she felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>Although the captain wasn't in the Jade Blood realm, he had reached the peak of Qi Blood and was the strongest among them.</p><p></p><p>The captain's gaze fell on Qi Yuan, with a look of surprise in his eyes: "You actually really came in here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Chen Fan, shrugging: "What a coincidence, we actually got matched up together."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the captain and Qi Yuan knew each other, An Qiao and the man in black tight clothes' previous doubts vanished.</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog had a strange expression, sniffing hard again, but said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's attention quickly turned back to the deranged man in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Bufan, is he that Luo Bufan from the Luo family?" An Qiao had a look of sudden realization, "Wasn't he just at Qi Blood level? How did he reach Jade Blood so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>It was understandable that Luo Bufan went mad, after all, his whole family was killed, and his fiancée's family was also wiped out.</p><p></p><p>But such a huge leap in his strength so suddenly was very abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"Because... the people of both the Luo family and Chen family were killed by him." Chen Fan's gaze was deep and extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>"What?" An Qiao and the man in black tight clothes were shocked.</p><p></p><p>This answer was beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Their mission was to investigate the truth behind the massacre of the Luo and Chen families.</p><p></p><p>Just finding the culprit wasn't enough, they also needed to clarify the motive and the reasons behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that he killed his relatives to improve his strength, extracting their bloodlines?" An Qiao's expression became complicated.</p><p></p><p>The other two men in black tight clothes beside her also had changing expressions: "What a ruthless person, killing his entire clan just to advance one realm!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan remained silent, merely gazing at the sea ahead.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, staring at the deranged Luo Bufan: "He did indeed kill those people, but... there might be a more interesting reason behind it."</p><p></p><p>[Luo Bufan, early stage Jade Blood realm martial artist, deranged and mentally disturbed, killing his relatives with his own hands will be his lifelong pain.]</p><p></p><p>This was the hidden information he saw today.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday when he saw Luo Bufan, the information was different, mostly about Luo Bufan's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Several people watched Luo Bufan's madness, but none dared to step forward to stop him.</p><p></p><p>In Luo Bufan's current state, if they went to stop him, they might perish.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, the village chief's body on the high platform stiffened.</p><p></p><p>His murky eyes became deep, and his eyes changed to snake-like pupils like a cobra.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly rose into the air, his voice extremely cold.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Bufan, you killed your entire family, and now... you come to disrupt my wedding, what are your intentions!"</p><p></p><p>The old village chief had clearly been possessed by the Sea God, now it was the Sea God inhabiting the old village chief's body.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan's body suddenly stiffened on the sea surface. He turned around, his eyes full of killing intent, looking at the old village chief: "Demons that wreak havoc in the world should all be killed!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud shout, he suddenly attacked.</p><p></p><p>However, this attack was blocked by the Sea God.</p><p></p><p>A look of contempt flashed in the Sea God's eyes: "I may be a demon, but I never kill my own kind.</p><p></p><p>And you? You wiped out your entire family with your own hands, not sparing any parents or elders, not even young children. What does that make you?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I didn't!" Luo Bufan's body stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In his mind, countless images tumbled.</p><p></p><p>He saw pairs of fearful eyes, and his parents lying in pools of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you'd even sacrifice your own parents to increase your power. What kind of person are you?" The Sea God's eyes were full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that to kill demons and increase power, anything can be abandoned?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I didn't!" Luo Bufan shouted, suddenly falling from the air. </p><p></p><p>He clutched his head, seemingly unwilling to accept this reality.</p><p></p><p>"After killing your whole family, you felt regret and intense remorse. With nowhere to hide, you went to see your fiancée Chen Xinlian. She kindly took you in and cared for you. But then, she accidentally learned that you had killed your parents. You flew into a rage, fearing the truth would get out and ruin your reputation as a great demon-slayer. In your panic, you killed your poor fiancée, and then... you killed her entire family too!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea God's words struck at Luo Bufan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan collapsed to the ground, losing control of himself, hands clutching his forehead. "Stop talking, stop talking!"</p><p></p><p>In his mind, images spun wildly. He seemed to see Xinlian dying in his arms, her eyes still carrying a smile and a hint of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luo Bufan's aura was rapidly declining, his mind in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the faces of the Demon Suppression Department members changed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this is the truth!"</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the Sea God has discovered us, he won't let us go!"</p><p></p><p>"We're done for, we're definitely dead this time!"</p><p></p><p>They never expected that a casual investigation would attract the attention of a Jade Blood Realm great demon.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Bufan is also a ruthless person. If he could regain all his power, he might be able to suppress the Sea God. What a pity... his condition isn't good now, we can't borrow his strength. Let them fight it out!" An Qiao couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't drag innocent dogs into this!" The tracking dog spoke up for itself.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's words were quite agreeable to the Demon Suppression Department members present.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan was indeed not a good person.</p><p></p><p>But was the Sea God a good demon?</p><p></p><p>They were equally bad, so let them fight each other.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Bufan... shouldn't you atone for your crimes with death?" the Sea God spoke, his voice carrying a hint of bewitchment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a female corpse wearing a wedding dress floated up from the sea.</p><p></p><p>The corpse opened its eyes, looking at Luo Bufan, its eyes suddenly turning vicious: "Luo Bufan, give me back my family's lives!"</p><p></p><p>"Xin... Xinlian!" Looking at the bride's corpse, Luo Bufan closed his eyes in pain, "Could it be... I was really wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Demons were rampant, and Yunyan County was in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly one day, a friend brought news that a giant demon would appear in Yunyan County.</p><p></p><p>Once this giant demon manifested, Yunyan County would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't much time left for Yunyan County.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan, always known as the great demon-slayer, was anxious but helpless.</p><p></p><p>Without Jade Blood Realm power, he couldn't intervene in such a major event.</p><p></p><p>And on that day, his friend happened to casually mention a bloody method to increase power.</p><p></p><p>At the time, his heart was momentarily moved, but he suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>On one side were all the people of Yunyan County, on the other were his closest family members.</p><p></p><p>But for those few days, he was extremely distracted, even experiencing hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when he came to his senses, everyone was dead.</p><p></p><p>Dead.</p><p></p><p>All dead.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Bufan, I originally thought you were a righteous man. I only told you a method to increase power, who knew... you would actually use it. Sigh, it's all my fault, I shouldn't have told you these things. I've let down your mother, and even more so Xinlian. I couldn't protect her."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man stepped out from the crowd, his face showing guilt and deep remorse.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xinlian's corpse in the wedding dress, a trace of deep affection flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan sat dazed, losing control of himself.</p><p></p><p>The young man continued: "Xinlian won't forgive you, and neither will I!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan's aura became chaotic, his blood energy constantly boiling, as if demons had entered his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What an interesting drama." Qi Yuan, not far away, had no sunflower seeds to munch on, so he could only applaud. "Everyone, whether far or near, arrives on time."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" An Qiao, who had been immersed in Luo Bufan's ferocity, was startled by Qi Yuan's words. "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you think Luo Bufan's friend appeared too conveniently? It's really like watching a TV show. This kind of coincidence doesn't happen in reality. A group of people keep talking non-stop at one person, just waiting for him to..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't finish his sentence.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao seemed lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>The man in black tight clothes was very anxious: "What should we do? After Luo Bufan dies, it will be our turn. This Sea God clearly isn't a good demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't this mission ended yet? Could there be some inside story?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Suppression Department members present were extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>The Sea God's cold gaze fell on Luo Bufan, his voice piercing: "Luo Bufan, if you don't end your own life, how can you face your loved ones?"</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Bufan, a life for a life. If you end your own life, perhaps Xinlian... might forgive you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan knelt on the ground, his hair disheveled, his mind unclear.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand to his crown, as if he would strike down in the next moment to atone with his death.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Chen Fan suddenly flew out, shouting loudly: "Luo Bufan, what's done is done. The most urgent matter now is to slay the demon! Do you want the 176 members of the Luo family to have died in vain? Kill it first, then die if you must!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chen Fan's words, Luo Bufan's hand stopped in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be pondering Chen Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Bufan, can you face Xinlian?" Luo Bufan's friend spoke again, "Back then, you and I both pursued Xinlian, and in the end I chose to give up. Didn't you promise me that you would love and protect Xinlian for life? And what happened? You killed Xinlian with your own hands. She died at the hands of the demon-slayer she admired most, the man she loved most!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan's eyes, which had just cleared, became clouded again.</p><p></p><p>The thought of death arose in his heart once more.</p><p></p><p>"If I were you, I would end my life right here." Luo Bufan's friend said again, then turned to look at Chen Fan, "You believe the words of these government dogs? Back then, when we begged the government for help, how did they treat us? They asked us to raise 100,000 taels of silver. In the end, did your family and mine raise the silver? And what happened? They took the silver and did nothing! He's just a government dog, what right does he have to interfere in Yunyan County's affairs? Just because of that official uniform?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan's friend was indignant, seemingly extremely dissatisfied with the government.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chen Fan forcefully tore off a layer of skin from his face, his voice heavy: "Because I am... Luo Bufan!"</p><p></p><p>As the human skin mask was torn off, Chen Fan's face revealed features that were 80% similar to Luo Bufan's.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

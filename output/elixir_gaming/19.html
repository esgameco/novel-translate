        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded the great sword, weaving through the robes and hats... no, the demonic robed figures.</p><p></p><p>His minor skills were constantly activating.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Fracture Skull!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Rain of Xiang River!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Light Escape!"</p><p></p><p>Experience +300.</p><p>Experience +200.</p><p>...</p><p>Experience +400.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was killing with great delight, finally finding the feeling of playing a game.</p><p></p><p>These in front of him were all experience packages!</p><p></p><p>He was rampaging in the game world.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Slashes Trousers!"</p><p></p><p>"Splits the Robe!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Stabs the Suspender!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was killing with great joy.</p><p></p><p>And the demonic robed figures around him were increasing.</p><p></p><p>The trees were broken, the demonic robed figures were shattered.</p><p></p><p>Within dozens of meters, this was Qi Yuan's main battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He was like a killing god, and once he approached a demonic robed figure, that figure became his experience baby.</p><p></p><p>Due to the night, those demonic robed figures could not quickly gather together, fighting individually.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly like a wolf entering a flock of sheep for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The reason he could rampage in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land was that the demonic beasts there were not united.</p><p></p><p>But now, all the demonic robed figures in the Robe Forbidden Land were slowly awakening.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was on a killing spree, and some of the awakening demonic robed figures were still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that even demons can experience a trampling incident."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw the "trampling" in the distance and rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The trampling incident of the demonic robed figures was naturally different.</p><p></p><p>It was because they had just woken up and had an emergency response, directly attacking blindly.</p><p></p><p>This also caused many weak demonic robed figures to be implicated.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan transformed into a liver god, rampaging in the game.</p><p></p><p>However, after just a few hours, Qi Yuan decided to flee.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to run!"</p><p></p><p>Those demonic robed figures, although their senses were much weaker at night, had now slowly formed an army formation and were coming towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was time to run.</p><p></p><p>Just like before, Qi Yuan directly dug a pit and buried himself in it.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, I've leveled up to 84, and my strength has increased a lot."</p><p></p><p>He had grinded all night, accumulated one and a half levels of experience, and leveled up twice.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try to completely conquer the Robe Forbidden Land in half a month!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he could do this kind of raid every night.</p><p></p><p>Probably in half a month, he would have tormented the demonic robed figures in the Robe Forbidden Land enough.</p><p></p><p>By then, he might even reach level 90 and awaken another powerful skill.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his strength in the game world would be further enhanced, and the speed of clearing other forbidden lands or even the ultimate forbidden lands would also increase, allowing him to collect the spiritual treasures for cultivating the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about this and suddenly felt depressed: "Cultivating immortality is too difficult. Just for one Heavenly Dao foundation, I have to kill my way through a whole world? The so-called geniuses of Heavenly Dao foundation, how strong must they be! In the future, I'd better keep my distance when I encounter them."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay in the pit, changed to a comfortable position, and as usual, sent a message to Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>He talked about today's night raid, and finally said good night and logged off.</p><p></p><p>Because, staying in the game for too long, his mental state would not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>He had tried it before, and now, if he stayed in the game for more than half a day, the situation would be very serious.</p><p></p><p>How serious? </p><p></p><p>It would be like a normal person experiencing a low blood sugar attack, with sudden blackness in the eyes.</p><p></p><p>So, he almost never stayed in the game for more than 12 hours.</p><p></p><p>But just before logging off, he felt a sense of loss and sighed: "In the game, I can strike hard, but in reality, I can only nod and agree."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's true that in the game, he slaughtered the demons and made them rout.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he was timid and meek, unable to even kill a Yuandan.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait for the knife to be born with spiritual intelligence before he had a chance to kill the Yuandan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a chance, not a guarantee.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when Qi Yuan woke up, he seemed to hear thousands of ducks quacking.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, got dressed, and washed up.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the courtyard, looked at the three young ladies in front of him, and took a deep breath of the morning air: "It's early morning, what are you talking about?"</p><p></p><p>Among the three young ladies in front of him, one was his junior sister Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>The other one he had seen before, was the top-ranked student who had just joined the Shenguang Sect this year.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had chosen Jiang Lingsu as his junior sister and excluded this girl.</p><p></p><p>This girl, on the surface, looked innocent and pure, but there was a subtle allure in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remembered that when he first saw her, he noticed that this young lady had a special constitution, and had even caught the eye of the old demon Black Chicken.</p><p></p><p>The last young lady was quite ordinary, the most noticeable thing about her was the many freckles on her face.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, cultivators rarely have freckles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>The three young ladies greeted him with courtesy.</p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple, his status was noble, even though yesterday Zheng Jianghe had led a team out and encountered Qi Yuan on the way, they had stopped to greet him and then left.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan's not-yet-fully-awake appearance and couldn't help but say, "Senior brother, it's already noon now, how can it be early?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was big and round.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the three young ladies.</p><p></p><p>Ah, ah, ah... He must have been thinking about forming the Golden Core lately, seeing everything as big and round.</p><p></p><p>"What are you discussing that seems to have you so indignant?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of the Heishan Sect!" said the innocent-looking young lady, her face full of anger.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly remembered that yesterday Zheng Jianghe had led the Jingang Hall to Rongcheng, and it seemed to be related to the Heishan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"A while ago, a true disciple of the Heishan Sect, named Chu Tianxiong, committed evil acts in Rongcheng, raping several newly-married women, and even wiping out their entire families, it's truly abhorrent!</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe senior brother led the Jingang Hall and captured Chu Tianxiong in Rongcheng!" The innocent-looking young lady became more and more excited, her words becoming a bit unclear.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu said, "Xiao Ran, don't get so worked up, let me tell you.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong was captured by the Jingang Hall, and was extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Just as Zheng Jianghe senior brother was about to bring Chu Tianxiong back to the sect for punishment, a Heishan Sect elder appeared on the way and directly took Chu Tianxiong away, and even... even injured Zheng Jianghe senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>The three young ladies present were all very angry, the freckled young lady also clenched her fists, wishing she could kill Chu Tianxiong herself.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran said, "The Heishan Sect is really too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The freckled young lady couldn't help but speak up as well: "If it weren't for the old demon Black Chicken, how would the Heishan Sect dare to be so arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the mention of the old demon Black Chicken, Jiang Ran's face also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then said, "I've seen many TV dramas, and the villains never have a good ending!"</p><p></p><p>The three young ladies were puzzled, not knowing what TV dramas were.</p><p></p><p>But they understood the latter half of the sentence.</p><p></p><p>They fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Do bad people... really not have a good ending? Jiang Lingsu still remembered that the once mighty demonic cultivator who had massacred an entire country, was received with courtesy by her clan's father and grandfather when he came to their sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a world where strength was supreme.</p><p></p><p>Bad people... may live better than good people.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is right, good is rewarded and evil is punished, it's not that it won't be punished, the time just hasn't come yet!" Jiang Lingsu echoed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>A man in a blood-red robe wielding a blood-colored long sword walked through the vast desert. </p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe fluttered in the wind. From afar, the solitary figure looked like a streak of bloody sunset.</p><p></p><p>The wounded young woman, clutching her bloody wound, resolutely chased after that blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>"Such a cruel and merciless sword strike on your body, yet you still pursue him for thousands of miles. Tianxin Palace Master, you really are... infatuated," Ling Yayi sighed.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's expression remained unchanged, only staring at the mirror surface: "She is her, I am me."</p><p></p><p>She naturally did not want to accept that the young woman in the ancient mirror was her reality.</p><p></p><p>The scene changed again.</p><p></p><p>The delicate young woman with willow-leaf eyebrows found the man in the blood-red robe again. She stared at him blankly, softly murmuring: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed she wanted to say something more, but could not get the words out, only able to softly call his name.</p><p></p><p>The man in the blood-red robe looked up, his gaze cold and emotionless. There was no young woman in his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was only air, a vague figure with an indistinct face.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is illusory, everything is forgotten."</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword again, a flash of blood-red sword light.</p><p></p><p>This time, his sword seemed to strike with more force. The young woman was cut in half at the waist.</p><p></p><p>The young woman's face bore an expression of disbelief, tears already in her eyes: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>She could not say anything else, only softly calling out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the expressions of those present were somewhat complex. Feelings of anger arose in their hearts towards that blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>"This person is too heartless!"</p><p></p><p>"Without feeling or loyalty, he must be a demon."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what happened either, let's keep watching."</p><p></p><p>A trace of melancholy flashed through the eyes of the White Emperor's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Is this the suffering experienced in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons?</p><p></p><p>The scene continued. The blood-red robed figure wandered aimlessly through the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that without the young woman's attachment, he walked faster and killed more viciously.</p><p></p><p>When he encountered a town, he drew his sword and killed.</p><p></p><p>When he encountered a city, he drew his sword and slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>All living beings that entered his sight, he killed, killed, killed.</p><p></p><p>Those present were shocked: "This is a god of slaughter!"</p><p></p><p>"He must have fallen into demonic ways!"</p><p></p><p>"Tianxin Palace Master, how could you love such a great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao watched coldly, biting her lip, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored figure was like the strongest demon in the world, slaughtering all enemies that entered his sight.</p><p></p><p>Wind and snow raged, wild gales howled.</p><p></p><p>On the city walls, a general in heavy armor led an army of tens of thousands out of the city to face that blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of troops marched bravely to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>The great battle lasted seven days and seven nights.</p><p></p><p>The entire nation's army gathered there.</p><p></p><p>That blood-colored figure was like the god of death, constantly reaping the lives of the world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one night, the blood-red robed man was exhausted. He tightly gripped his broken sword, confusion in his eyes: "Am I... this weak?"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe did not understand why he was so weak.</p><p></p><p>He clearly remembered that he had once slaughtered three thousand cultivators of the same level without changing expression.</p><p></p><p>Why could such an army take him down?</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored figure was captured, heavy chains locked onto his body.</p><p></p><p>His entire person was wrapped in layer after layer of iron chains.</p><p></p><p>The people of the entire capital came out, spreading the news. They watched the blood-colored figure in the prisoner cart, dancing and laughing with joy on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Cursing and insulting.</p><p></p><p>Rotten eggs, stones, rotten cabbage were all thrown at the blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>The great general of the nation had captured the blood demon. The blood demon was paraded for seven days, to be executed by fire at the palace gates on the seventh day.</p><p></p><p>For seven days, the capital was extraordinarily lively.</p><p></p><p>All the gloom was vented upon that blood-colored robed figure.</p><p></p><p>After seven days passed, the blood-red robe was tied to an iron pillar.</p><p></p><p>Below was a high pile of firewood.</p><p></p><p>Women cursed at him viciously: "Demon, burn him to death, burn him!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a demon should die, fall into hell forever, never to reincarnate!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the insults, confusion appeared in the eyes of the blood-red robed figure: "Am I... a demon?"</p><p></p><p>He felt he had forgotten something.</p><p></p><p>The roaring fire was lit, the smoke making it hard for him to open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A somewhat familiar voice came: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>A petite figure flew over the crowd below, tightly embracing the man tied in chains. She tried hard to break the chains, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl..." The young woman was anxious. As the fire spread, she hugged the blood-red robe tightly, constantly pushing his body, as if trying to wake him up.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The blood-red robed figure had a moment of clarity, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, but could not see anything.</p><p></p><p>He clearly felt someone embracing him, but he could not see them.</p><p></p><p>"I..." The young woman wanted to say something, but could not speak. She could only keep calling the name "Blood Pearl".</p><p></p><p>The fire continued to spread. Under the watch of thousands upon thousands of people, their faces showed joy and happiness.</p><p></p><p>The young woman grasped the blood-red robe, unwilling to let go even as the fire burned her body.</p><p></p><p>The delicate young woman tightly hugged that blood-red robe, consumed by the great fire in the icy snow.</p><p></p><p>Snow continued to fall, the fire burned more and more fiercely, until... complete nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi continued to sigh: "Truly infatuated."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at Ning Tao, his expression tragic.</p><p></p><p>"That demon deserved to die, but it's a pity about the young woman who jumped into the flames with him," He Wu said.</p><p></p><p>"Truly unwise," a woman sighed. "Although we are the Thirteen Demons of the North, we should not sympathize with or pity a demon who kills innocents indiscriminately, much less fall in love with one."</p><p></p><p>"Tianxin Palace Master, I didn't expect you to have such a past," someone said from the side.</p><p></p><p>The young woman in the scene appeared foolish to everyone present.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the scene in the ancient mirror changed again.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled: "It's not over yet?"</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor's avatar said softly: "There is reincarnation in the world, let us all observe."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked.</p><p></p><p>It was still in an icy, snowy land.</p><p></p><p>A young woman tightly hugged an infant, walking barefoot through the snow.</p><p></p><p>The sky was pitch black, only the snow was still white.</p><p></p><p>Countless torches spread, shouts came from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Put down the demon child!"</p><p></p><p>"This infant is considered inauspicious, it must be killed!"</p><p></p><p>The young woman hugged the infant tightly, evading the pursuit of hundreds of people.</p><p></p><p>The two fled into the mountains, entering a cave.</p><p></p><p>The young woman looked at the infant, a gentle smile in her eyes: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>Her finger unconsciously moved to his mouth.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the infant suddenly opened its mouth wide. Rows of tiny teeth bit down hard, fresh blood staining his mouth red.</p><p></p><p>The young woman's heart jolted, but she hugged the infant tightly.</p><p></p><p>Those watching had stern expressions: "This is truly a demon... it should be killed!"</p><p></p><p>The scene changed. The demon infant of the past became the blood-red robed man from before.</p><p></p><p>He was very antisocial, seeming to rarely interact with others.</p><p></p><p>He sat by a stream, staring blankly at the water every day.</p><p></p><p>When fish swam by in the water, a flash of blood-red appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a rip, the fish's body was pierced through.</p><p></p><p>Like red ink dripping in, spreading.</p><p></p><p>The delicate young woman appeared, her eyes filled with heartache.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe suddenly turned: "I'm not Blood Pearl, I... am a demon, I am the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>After entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, the Great Demon's consciousness began to assimilate him.</p><p></p><p>The path he walked was the path the Great Demon had once walked.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he were Qi Yuan, how could he have been captured by an army?</p><p></p><p>He was merely experiencing the Great Demon's cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at where the young woman was, then his figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>The young woman anxiously chased after him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, those present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"He is the Great Demon...!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the South may not know about the Great Demon, but those of the North knew very well.</p><p></p><p>Legend had it that all demonic creatures in the world were created by the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>The current battle between North and South, the current tragic state of the Liufeng Realm, were all caused by the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red robed man was actually the legendary Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that make Ning Tao... a demoness! Everyone looked at Ning Tao, deep wariness in their eyes, unconsciously moving away from her.</p><p></p><p>Surprise also flashed through Baize's eyes. He thought of something and said solemnly: "This is an illusion, not reality. Rather, he... has fallen into the Great Demon's reincarnation cycle.</p><p></p><p>Rather than saying these things happened to him, it's better to say this is the Great Demon's past!"</p><p></p><p>These events all happened to the Great Demon, none of it was real.</p><p></p><p>Only that out-of-place golden oriole, constantly trying to awaken the blood-red robe, everything was real for her.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, that blood-red robe left the mountains, like a demon escaping Pandora's box.</p><p></p><p>He wielded a long sword, constantly killing.</p><p></p><p>On a rainy night, he killed an entire household.</p><p></p><p>That young woman appeared again, anxiously calling out: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>Killing intent flashed in the eyes of the blood-red robed youth. He said to the air: "I... am not Blood Pearl, I am the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>All demons should slaughter all things.</p><p></p><p>All demons are hated by heaven and man."</p><p></p><p>But the young woman hugged the youth tightly, unwilling to let go.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" A merciless sword strike burst forth. The young woman's clothes were stained red, blood at the corner of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Time passed. The self-proclaimed Great Demon in the blood-red robe wielded a long sword, slaughtering all living beings. It was as if that was the only meaning in his life.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eight great sects' top experts emerged together to suppress the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>In the battle at Sky's End, the Great Demon slaughtered half his enemies before finally exhausting his strength. </p><p></p><p>The eyes in the blood-red robe showed no fear, only a trace of confusion and endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that familiar young girl appeared. She embraced him as he had no strength left, and leapt down into the endless molten lava below.</p><p></p><p>This world... faded away.</p><p></p><p>In the first life, he slaughtered all living things. Captured by ten thousand soldiers, he was burned by raging flames. She held him tightly, suffering the agony of being consumed by the great fire.</p><p></p><p>In the second life, he killed endlessly. Surrounded and attacked by the eight great sects, he finally exhausted his strength. She embraced him and jumped into the roiling lava.</p><p></p><p>The third life also began.</p><p></p><p>She locked him up, confining him in an ancient tower. Dressed in plain blue clothes, she prayed for him every day.</p><p></p><p>One night, he remembered again that he was the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>He broke free and carried out endless slaughter. </p><p></p><p>In the end, he was suppressed by three thousand Buddhas in the ancient Ke purgatory. She accompanied him, enduring fifty years of burning by fire, stabbing by swords, and freezing by water.</p><p></p><p>In the fourth life, he wreaked havoc everywhere and was sunk to the bottom of the sea. She searched the entire seabed before finally finding him, and sank with him.</p><p></p><p>Life after life.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe was always killing, killing, killing.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to forget who he was, only remembering that he was the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>He was meant to kill everything.</p><p></p><p>And she always watched him, accompanied him, accompanied him as he sank into the cycle of rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Cursed by ten thousand people, enemies with the whole world, suffering divine punishment - it was the Great Demon, and also Blood Pearl.</p><p></p><p>She always stood by his side.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was truly moved.</p><p></p><p>Even Ning Tao felt somewhat numb.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know how many sword wounds that young girl had received from him.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know exactly what kind of suffering that young girl had endured.</p><p></p><p>She only knew it must have been very painful.</p><p></p><p>No matter what happened, the young girl foolishly stood by his side, supporting him without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>It was incomprehensible and difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Baize, who had been silent all along, spoke again: "The scenes in the ancient mirror may be an illusion. Back then, to save all living things in the world, my master entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons alone to suppress the demon in his heart... And you all entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Spirits to awaken my master..."</p><p></p><p>There was surprise in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this was said to be an illusion, it would indeed be easier to accept.</p><p></p><p>However, even if it was an illusion, the endless killing over several lifetimes was still hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>Even just as observers, they could feel the young girl's pain.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention she herself, suffering constant killing from the person dearest to her.</p><p></p><p>What kind of pain was that?</p><p></p><p>"An illusion?" Just then, a contemptuous voice suddenly rang out, "Is this really an illusion? This is clearly... the Great Demon's entire life, just replayed in an illusion. Blood Pearl is obviously the true Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>With this voice, a woman in white robes appeared, her face wearing an alluring smile, exuding charm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, everyone's eyes suddenly narrowed: "Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>A look of confusion also flashed across the White Emperor's face, before his expression sank: "Your Eminence, don't distort the facts!"</p><p></p><p>The arrival was none other than a clone of Her Eminence.</p><p></p><p>"Baize, why deceive yourself?" Her Eminence smiled charmingly, "For the sake of a so-called master, you're not even willing to believe your own wife... you're not even willing to call my name?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Her Eminence's eyes revealed a sorrowful look: "You still refuse to believe me. Look at the demon girl again - in the illusion, even when the Great Demon slaughtered all living things and beat and killed her at will, she still never left him, wanting to awaken him. The only pity is that while the demon girl had feelings, the Great Demon was heartless. Baize, can you trust me the way the demon girl trusted the Great Demon?"</p><p></p><p>With Her Eminence's words, seven terrifying figures also descended.</p><p></p><p>The auras of these seven were all clearly Great Supreme Beings, and not ordinary ones at that.</p><p></p><p>The seven figures surrounded Baize and the Northern Demon Thirteen Spirits present.</p><p></p><p>Baize's expression was desolate: "Yanran, why make baseless guesses about groundless matters? The Fate Stone Tablet has influenced you far too much."</p><p></p><p>Her Eminence was Shang Yanran, the wife of the White Emperor Baize.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran took a step forward, her powerful aura spreading.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Demon Thirteen Spirits present all felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>There was also deep wariness in Ning Tao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength was simply not something she could resist.</p><p></p><p>"The Fate Stone Tablet is just a treasure, how could it influence me?" There was a trace of contempt in Shang Yanran's eyes, "Actually, whether the master is the Great Demon, whether she is the demon girl... if we keep watching... won't we have the answer?</p><p></p><p>Baize, if the master is the Great Demon, if she is the demon girl, would you be able to suppress and kill them both for the sake of all living things in the world?</p><p></p><p>Only with the Great Demon and demon girl completely dead can the Flowing Wind Realm truly restore peace to the myriad realms! The battle between North and South, the fight for the Gate of Ten Thousand Spirits, can then truly be settled!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Baize hesitated.</p><p></p><p>There was a smile in Shang Yanran's eyes. She knew she couldn't persuade Baize now.</p><p></p><p>She was actually also very curious how the former Blood Lord had walked out of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Demons... was not something one could easily awaken from just by entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Once trapped inside, if not already the Great Demon, one would become the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>He would walk the path the Great Demon had walked again, experiencing everything the Great Demon had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>The seven powerful experts stood behind Her Eminence, coldly watching everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded, the White Emperor was also extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>This clone of his could barely hold off Shang Yanran's clone.</p><p></p><p>But those seven powerful experts were simply not something the Northern Demon Thirteen Spirits could resist.</p><p></p><p>He said nothing, but accepted Shang Yanran's suggestion to watch the ancient mirror together.</p><p></p><p>In the images, endless cycles of rebirth.</p><p></p><p>For the blood-red robe, it was all killing.</p><p></p><p>For the petite young girl, it was being hurt again and again by her dearest loved one, ultimately dying together each time.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like an unsolvable cycle.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years, ten thousand years, only the most deeply etched memories would appear in the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>But everyone lost count of how many sword wounds there were, how many times they died.</p><p></p><p>What they saw was already so painful.</p><p></p><p>How much more was there that they didn't see?</p><p></p><p>The north howled, the blood-red robe slaughtered an entire city.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't kill the young girl with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the girl with a face like a pear blossom, his voice wavering for the first time: "I am a demon. You shouldn't follow me. I've never seen you, I don't know where you are. Or perhaps you don't exist at all, you're just my delusion. This city... is called No Return. Wait for me here, for a thousand years or ten thousand years. If I can come back, I'll come see you. If I can't come back, then leave."</p><p></p><p>After endless years of killing.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe seemed to remember something.</p><p></p><p>The moment he entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, he became the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>He was the Great Demon!</p><p></p><p>The young girl looked at the blood-red robe, her face full of reluctance, tightly grasping his sleeve, unwilling to let go: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe raised his sword. The girl stubbornly looked at him, unwilling to let go.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Northern Demon Thirteen Spirits were all moved. Would that sword swing down like before?</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood-red light, blood splattered, a severed arm tightly grasped by the girl.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the blood-red robe had cut off his own arm, disappearing into the endless desert.</p><p></p><p>The girl tightly held the severed arm. She could finally speak completely, but it was as he truly left: "Blood Pearl... you must remember, you are not the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>This was her purpose in coming here.</p><p></p><p>Once he believed he was the Great Demon, then he truly could not be awakened.</p><p></p><p>She sat alone in the empty city.</p><p></p><p>One person, one city, waiting for one man.</p><p></p><p>Peach blossoms bloomed in the mortal world, light boats drifted over ten thousand mountains, the spring breeze of Jiangnan was hidden in letters, when opened, the absent loved one in the bitter cold winter seemed to feel spring as well.</p><p></p><p>Time turned, seas changed to mulberry fields, the young girl sat on the city wall every day, not knowing who she was waiting for.</p><p></p><p>She looked once - ten years, a hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years...</p><p></p><p>After endless years.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe slaughtered an empty city, he suddenly laughed lightly: "I am not the Great Demon..."</p><p></p><p>When he entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, he became the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had forgotten.</p><p></p><p>"I am not the Great Demon... then who am I..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment in the barrier, a look of surprise flashed in Her Eminence's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, no matter who the Blood Lord was before, he would become the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>But now, why had the Blood Lord in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons... broken free?</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand, truly didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Of course she didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's awakened innate divine ability was forgetting.</p><p></p><p>He forgot the fact that he was the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>So he broke free of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons' constraints.</p><p></p><p>So he was not the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>The images in the ancient mirror blurred.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe no longer killed, but entered the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he stood dazed by a stream, murmuring: "Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he sat under the eaves, watching the rain fall: "What have I forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he looked at the ants on the ground: "I seem to have forgotten everything."</p><p></p><p>He was like a stone, crouching there.</p><p></p><p>Dust settled on him.</p><p></p><p>Withered leaves drifted onto his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>In the deep mountains, he turned into a stone.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years, ten thousand years, the mortal world had already gone through endless cycles.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice reached his ears: "In the great desert, a city has appeared. Inside is a woman who has been waiting for someone."</p><p></p><p>City? The giant stone pondered.</p><p></p><p>Stone fragments fell away, a blood-red figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Endless thoughts flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Someone is still waiting for me."</p><p></p><p>P.S. These experiences all belong to the Great Demon and demon girl. Qi Yuan entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and experienced the Great Demon's cycle of falling into demonhood, while Golden Canary saw these scenes in the Gate of Ten Thousand Spirits, constantly trying to awaken Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

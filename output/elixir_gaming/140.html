        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lingfeng Crossing.</p><p></p><p>This was originally a ferry crossing, with boats crisscrossing.</p><p></p><p>Later, strange things often happened here. Passersby would frequently be blown away by mysterious winds. So this crossing was abandoned, with few people coming.</p><p></p><p>But now, this crossing has become lively again. </p><p></p><p>Because the Palace of Light has arranged to meet the Blood-Robed Sword God here at Lingfeng Crossing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a large treasure ship was docked at Lingfeng Crossing. Three Divine Infant stage officials from the Palace of Light had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Two were at the late Divine Infant stage, one at the mid Divine Infant stage. This level of strength was comparable to several major sects in Chen Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, besides the three Divine Infant officials from the Palace of Light, there were also many Divine Infant powerhouses from Chen Kingdom on the treasure ship.</p><p></p><p>"This so-called Blood-Robed Sword God is probably the Marquis of Earth Sword. We thought he was dead, but unexpectedly he's still alive and has joined the Divine Flower Society, causing trouble for the True Lords," said Duke of East Prosperity, his face full of deep remorse.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Wukong glanced at the Duke of East Prosperity and said in a buzzing voice: "This matter is not your fault. It's that Blood-Robed Sword God who is stirring up trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Back then, True Lord Wukong had come to Chen Kingdom for leisure and took a liking to the Marquis of Earth Sword's mansion. </p><p></p><p>Beneath the mansion was a spirit eye, which produced the treasure Xingluo Essence.</p><p></p><p>This substance absorbed the essence of heaven and earth, containing metal killing qi, sufficient to serve as a vessel for a high-grade Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>So True Lord Wukong merely expressed his desire.</p><p></p><p>The Duke of East Prosperity then drove out all the people from the Marquis of Earth Sword's mansion.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the people from the Marquis's mansion were unwilling to leave, crying and wailing. When True Lord Wukong heard this, he became irritated and blurted out: "Drive them to the dog kennel!"</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Earth Sword's over 90-year-old, decrepit daughter was forced to live in a dog kennel.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Duke of East Prosperity even secretly took action, massacring the entire household of the Marquis of Earth Sword.</p><p></p><p>After all, since they had already offended people, they might as well cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, leaving no future troubles! The Duke of East Prosperity came here now to curry favor with the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>After all, that Marquis of Earth Sword seemed to have changed his name to Blood-Robed Sword God, and his cultivation appeared to have progressed, otherwise he wouldn't dare act this way.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of Earth Sword's family met this fate entirely due to their own actions, offending the True Lord," the Duke of East Prosperity said righteously. "When that Blood-Robed Sword God arrives, I will certainly advise him to return from his misguided path and apologize to the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>The Duke of East Prosperity was just saying these words.</p><p></p><p>He actually hoped the Blood-Robed Sword God would clash with the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Using the Palace of Light's hand to eliminate the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"Apologize? Hmph!" True Lord Wukong was angry.</p><p></p><p>This incident had blown up, causing quite a stir even in Cuiyun Continent. </p><p></p><p>He had been forced to come out of seclusion from his cultivation and come to this godforsaken place to apologize. How could he not be full of pent-up anger? Apologize?</p><p></p><p>Let's see if that Blood-Robed Sword God dares to accept an apology from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood-Robed Sword God is clearly a cowardly rat, only daring to provoke in secret. I estimate that with all of you here, he won't show up," said a Divine Infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this time, many cultivators from Chen Kingdom were standing on the side of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>They were even more angry and disgusted with the Blood-Robed Sword God, wishing to get rid of him as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>They feared that because of the Blood-Robed Sword God's matter, it would affect their status in the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for the True Lords of the Palace of Light to take action. If he comes, we will capture him and make him apologize to the True Lords of the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, True Lord Wukong drank wine, his dissatisfaction at coming to this godforsaken place finally dissipating somewhat.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the treasure ship, on a small boat stood a young woman in blue robes, accompanied by an old woman.</p><p></p><p>The old woman looked at the huge treasure ship and said softly, "The Palace of Light is here. Would Miss Ya like to board the ship and speak with them?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman was a Divine Infant stage cultivator, while the young woman in blue beside her was at the Yuan Dan stage, but the old woman was especially respectful towards the young woman in blue.</p><p></p><p>The young woman in blue was named Jiang Ya, ranked fifteenth on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>There were so many geniuses in the Eastern Lands that even among a hundred countries, it was hard to find one who could enter the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Yet this woman was ranked fifteenth. If she didn't die young, she would certainly become a Purple Mansion powerhouse in the future.</p><p></p><p>This kind of talent was enough to look down on the entire Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>But what was most terrifying about Jiang Ya was not her cultivation talent, but her thorough understanding of worldly techniques, as well as her annotations and modifications.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that she was accepted as a disciple by the master of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This was something that even the top three on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, known as the Old Man Without Sky, was the person closest to the legendary Yin Spirit realm among the Purple Mansion powerhouses of the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>That was the Yin Spirit realm, said to touch upon the domain of immortals and gods.</p><p></p><p>Once the Old Man Without Sky stepped into the Yin Spirit realm, how could Jiang Ya's status be compared to even the top three on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings?</p><p></p><p>"No need," Jiang Ya shook her head. "I came here only because there might be some conflicts, to observe the battles. As for the Palace of Light... Ling Su detests them greatly, so how could I get involved with the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>The Ascending Heaven Pavilion collected techniques from all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was interested in any technique in the world.</p><p></p><p>For her at the Yuan Dan stage, observing Divine Infant cultivators fighting would be quite beneficial.</p><p></p><p>Her path was to modify and create techniques.</p><p></p><p>She had been persistently walking down this path.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when she entered the Divine Infant stage, she would be able to awaken related divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>When she entered the Purple Mansion realm and understood the essence of this world's spiritual energy, she would be able to comprehend her own origin divine ability from her path.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya thought of something and suddenly said, "If that Blood-Robed Sword God's strength is low and he is quickly defeated, Old Stone, please trouble you to fight with those people from the Palace of Light. I want to see their techniques."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old woman nodded: "As you command, Miss Ya."</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and a small boat floated on the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya stood at the front of the boat, her consciousness immersed in a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>At every moment, she was practicing her own path.</p><p></p><p>Vast waves, moonlight flowing over misty islets.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Ya opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The old woman also raised her head, a hint of solemnity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>They saw a man wearing a blood-red robe walking on the water amidst the vast waves.</p><p></p><p>A full moon hung in the sky, its cold light shining on him, reflecting a red glow.</p><p></p><p>"Such a strong bloody aura!"</p><p></p><p>"How many people has he killed?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the treasure ship of the Palace of Light, the gazes of over a dozen Divine Infant cultivators all fell on the blood-robed figure on the water's surface.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with doubt and a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>The three Divine Infant cultivators from the Palace of Light saw the blood-red robe and were stunned at first, then True Lord Wukong shouted loudly: "Blood qi surging to the heavens, how many grieving souls have you created? If I had known earlier of such a great demon, I would have slain you on the spot. How could I have allowed you to remain and harm the world?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, the three Divine Infant cultivators from the Palace of Light had planned to go through the motions of apologizing before dealing with the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>But upon seeing the Blood-Robed Sword God, they felt there was no need for pretense.</p><p></p><p>This dense bloody killing aura all over his body, how many people had he killed to create it? This was no Sword God, this was clearly a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Such a great demon should be slain directly.</p><p></p><p>Under the full moon, an eerie light shimmered on the blood-red robe. His voice was hoarse and cold.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already entered his role, playing his alter ego.</p><p></p><p>"My daughter was innocent and naive, quick-witted and clever as ice.</p><p></p><p>I wished I could pluck the stars and moon from the sky to give to her.</p><p></p><p>But what happened? You forced her to live in a dog kennel. This matter is not over!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Duke of East Prosperity's face showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Innocent and naive?</p><p></p><p>Quick-witted?</p><p></p><p>Marquis of Earth Sword, your 90-year-old daughter barely had any teeth left, right?</p><p></p><p>However, the face of this Blood-Robed Sword God before them seemed to be covered by a layer of blood mist, and they couldn't see his features clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Such a demon, your ancestors for eighteen generations should go to hell!" the Duke of East Prosperity also seized the opportunity to say.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a hint of confusion appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Didn't you from the Palace of Light come to apologize? Is this your attitude?"</p><p></p><p>He had come here precisely because the Palace of Light said they would apologize.</p><p></p><p>He was prepared to extort something.</p><p></p><p>"If you were a righteous cultivator, I would apologize for my past minor mistakes, but... you, a demonic cultivator, are worthy of my apology?" True Lord Wukong once again stood on the moral high ground, feeling refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes showed disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still overestimated some people's moral standards."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that everyone from the Palace of Light was a gentleman, concerned for the world.</p><p></p><p>The path of immortality is vast, yet they are willing to subdue demons and eliminate evil, truly worthy of being called immortal heroes.</p><p></p><p>Alas, alas, I was thinking that if you compensated me with some spirit stones, I would not pursue the matter further."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he looked truly disappointed, as if in a daze.</p><p></p><p>This made the three Divine Infant cultivators from the Palace of Light on the treasure ship somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Did this person really admire their Palace of Light?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" True Lord Wukong would not let the Blood-Robed Sword God off because of this. "A demonic cultivator, worthy of admiring our Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>The late Divine Infant stage cultivator beside him couldn't help but ask: "How much spirit stone compensation did you want?"</p><p></p><p>"She was my dearest daughter, at least... ten million..." As Qi Yuan spoke, he felt he might have asked for too little.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He steeled himself and raised the price, "100 trillion spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>There was silence on the treasure ship. </p><p></p><p>After a few breaths passed, East Chang Gong's face showed an angry expression: "Sword Marquis of Earth, are you making a joke of the True Lord of the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>100 trillion spirit stones? It was an unimaginable amount! The other divine infants of Chen Kingdom also began verbally attacking Qi Yuan at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Truly laughable, first fabricating slander against the True Lord of the Palace of Light, and now deliberately extorting money. Such a thief must be executed!"</p><p></p><p>The group of divine infants denounced Qi Yuan, condemning him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan faced the accusations alone. </p><p></p><p>He felt small and helpless.</p><p></p><p>Although he was fabricated, but... was something fabricated necessarily false? He was very angry, like a migrant worker whose wages had been withheld: "I'll kill you all!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan charged directly towards the treasure ship. True Lord Wu Kong's eyes held a contemptuous smile: "A mere divine infant from the Hundred Kingdoms region, what level of divine ability do you have? You dare to attack me?"</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities awakened by divine infant cultivators were also ranked.</p><p></p><p>Among them, ninth grade was the lowest, first grade the highest. </p><p></p><p>Seventh, eighth and ninth were low grade, first, second and third were high grade.</p><p></p><p>Above first grade, there were even higher levels.</p><p></p><p>And True Lord Wu Kong's divine ability was first grade.</p><p></p><p>Divine infants from places like the Hundred Kingdoms region mostly had low grade abilities, even if there were occasional exceptions, they were only middle grade.</p><p></p><p>So when divine infants from the Palace of Light came here, it was like fighting across dimensions, the gap was too large.</p><p></p><p>On the small boat, the old woman shook her head: "The three divine infants from the Palace of Light all have high grade divine abilities. There are twelve more divine infants above them. For that Blood-Robed Sword Immortal to act this way is quite unwise."</p><p></p><p>The divine infants from the Hundred Kingdoms region had abilities that were too weak.</p><p></p><p>Their combat power was naturally a level below the divine infants from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Ya looked at that Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, a trace of confusion flashing through her eyes.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal gave her a strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan held a blood-red long sword, his face fierce: "You think you're the only ones with divine abilities? I have them too!"</p><p></p><p>He flew towards the treasure ship holding his sword, like a blood-colored crow in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Wu Kong's eyes held a cold smile: "Let me test you!"</p><p></p><p>He flew away from the treasure ship, raising his hand to the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Heavens Divine Thunder!"</p><p></p><p>"Glorious Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Exterminate All Evil!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, endless sunlight fell upon him.</p><p></p><p>His entire being became holy and radiant.</p><p></p><p>A sword of light condensed in his hand, he was like an immortal Taoist of righteousness.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike could sweep away all evil under heaven.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at that sword of light and shook his head: "That's not how you use a light sword. You need to change your clothes, remember to transform. No, you should change your personality first, then transform with the light sword to have flavor!"</p><p></p><p>On Blue Star, there was a period when light sword transformations were popular in short videos.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary clothes, then a light sword appears, then changing into sexy attire under dim lighting.</p><p></p><p>Some versions even went too far in their extent.</p><p></p><p>Now True Lord Wu Kong's divine ability was being critiqued by Qi Yuan as a light sword transformation.</p><p></p><p>Righteous energy emanated from True Lord Wu Kong, his face filled with rage like an angry god: "First grade divine ability Glorious Sword, let's see how you withstand it!"</p><p></p><p>"How will you withstand my divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood-colored long sword in Qi Yuan's hand was finally unsealed.</p><p></p><p>It revealed a terrifying, bizarre aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hadn't even used it yet, just the blade being revealed turned the water at his feet blood red.</p><p></p><p>The red color continued to spread.</p><p></p><p>Even the brilliant sunlight of the Glorious Sword was contaminated by the blood color.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Wu Kong seemed to have fallen into the endless hell, entangled by the blood color.</p><p></p><p>"Let me show you... my divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>The Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Summoning activated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The blood color was no longer limited to that small area.</p><p></p><p>The entire Ling Feng Crossing seemed to have sunk into a blood prison.</p><p></p><p>Yin winds howled, blood seas churned! All the divine infant cultivators' faces showed shock and horror.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Wu Kong was even more terrified: "Or-origin divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>He was afraid, he retreated, but had already sunk into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Summoning was inscribed on the blood-colored long sword.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike was comparable to a supreme being using an origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The level of the Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Summoning's origin divine ability was not low.</p><p></p><p>To deal with a divine infant? That was like using nuclear weapons to kill a chicken! In just one breath of time, True Lord Wu Kong had turned into a pool of blood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at that pool of blood and boasted: "Is my divine ability stronger than yours?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, True Lord Wu Kong was already dead and couldn't answer him.</p><p></p><p>On the treasure ship, those divine infants trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Origin... divine ability! What the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal had used was actually an origin divine ability! Although many of them had never seen a Purple Mansion powerhouse in action.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as Qi Yuan made his move, they knew it was an origin divine ability! Origin divine abilities were techniques mastered by Purple Mansion powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Seeing through the essence, it was simply not something divine infants could resist!</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Immortal... was actually a Purple Mansion powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>A Purple Mansion powerhouse had appeared in the Hundred Kingdoms region?</p><p></p><p>East Chang Gong on the scene felt his heart skip a beat, filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly become Purple Mansion level?</p><p></p><p>The faces of the other two divine infants from the Palace of Light also changed greatly, but they still maintained a bit of composure.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were still dozens of Purple Mansion powerhouses in the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, using an origin divine ability against True Lord Wu Kong's divine ability is bullying him too much." The previously arrogant divine infant from the Palace of Light now spoke much more mildly.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer as overbearing as before.</p><p></p><p>But that innate arrogance was still there.</p><p></p><p>After all, they came from the Palace of Light, and had no direct grudge with the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Wu Kong had a grudge with the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, so killing him was fine.</p><p></p><p>"How is an origin divine ability not a divine ability?" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>This line he had plagiarized from Wu Tong, but since he had already killed Wu Tong, it didn't count as plagiarism anymore.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he carried his sword towards the treasure ship.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant from the Palace of Light's expression changed slightly: "Does senior intend to kill us all?</p><p></p><p>Although senior is Purple Mansion level, my Palace of Light does not lack cultivators of your level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, senior has already killed True Lord Wu Kong who insulted you, this matter should end here.</p><p></p><p>I hope senior will think thrice before acting!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, they couldn't win in a fight.</p><p></p><p>They could only try to reason.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Qi Yuan coldly looked at these people, "You weren't saying this earlier."</p><p></p><p>When he first appeared, these divine infants had been constantly insulting him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, almost all the divine infants looked at him with killing intent in their eyes,恨不得立即替天行道。</p><p></p><p>Now... they had changed their tune?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, have you really decided to make an enemy of our Palace of Light?" That late-stage divine infant cultivator said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"It's your Palace of Light that wants to make an enemy of me!" Qi Yuan said, no longer hesitating.</p><p></p><p>The Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Summoning erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The huge treasure ship seemed to be dyed red with blood in an instant.</p><p></p><p>All the divine infants on the ship's expressions became crazed.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I shouldn't have, shouldn't have killed my brother and violated my sister-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't mean to, who told him to have such high talent."</p><p></p><p>As heart demons emerged, the magnificent treasure ship turned into a blood-colored demonic realm in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen divine infant cultivators danced wildly with twisted faces, heart demons rampant, in a miserable state, all perishing in the end.</p><p></p><p>The servants and singing girls on the treasure ship now trembled in fear, as if they had seen the most terrifying thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Boring, not even worth one sword strike." Qi Yuan sheathed his sword.</p><p></p><p>These people from the Palace of Light were too weak, he didn't even need to use his golden core's power.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that even those Purple Mansion powerhouses from the Palace of Light couldn't force him to use his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Probably... only the Imperial Rank Startling Dragon Crown was worth him using his golden core for.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, the Imperial Rank Startling Dragon Crown could exert power at the Yin Immortal level.</p><p></p><p>Yin Immortal... too strong, too strong.</p><p></p><p>Those were true immortals and gods!</p><p></p><p>Immortals and gods that did not reveal themselves in the mortal world!</p><p></p><p>Immortals and gods that mortals and cultivators had to prostrate themselves before when seen!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sheathed his sword and swept his gaze around, his voice rolling: "The Palace of Light falsely apologized but actually sent people to surround and attack me. If this grudge is not repaid, it would be against heaven's will!</p><p></p><p>I, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal, officially declare war on the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>Either the Palace of Light is destroyed, or I perish!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted, his voice carrying for dozens of miles.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present who had surrounded him were shocked and deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword Immortal was actually a Purple Mansion powerhouse! The Hundred Kingdoms region had finally produced a Purple Mansion powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and all the storage bags fell into his possession.</p><p></p><p>These pure loves had traveled thousands of miles to see him, how could he not accept their gifts.</p><p></p><p>After taking the storage bags, he was about to leave when a gentle voice came: "Senior, please wait."</p><p></p><p>PS: There's one more chapter very late, everyone can read it when they wake up in the morning, sorry sorry.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 567</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even the mighty Sun God, when coming into contact with this terrifying monster, was instantly shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Only the Realm Lords could still support themselves for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Devour! Devour! Devour!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's consciousness had completely dissolved, leaving only a trace of his true spirit.</p><p></p><p>Now, he no longer resembled a human, but rather a blood-red, ravenous snake, devouring everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>The three Throne Sitters sat in the heavens, watching as one Sun God after another was devoured, unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Countless universal rules were consumed and smelted, and the rules Qi Yuan commanded had increased to over a hundred.</p><p></p><p>Even the time rule, which was the most difficult for him to grasp, was now under his control.</p><p></p><p>Flame, dark light, true words, gold, and other rules had all become part of the seven halos of light.</p><p></p><p>Now, the seven lights were in complete disarray.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had become a terrifying behemoth, devouring everything.</p><p></p><p>"Has he finally grasped the concept of 'doing as he pleases' in this game?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, although Qi Yuan was very strong, recklessly slaughtering Sun Gods in the Black Sky, he still had to avoid the Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Now, he seemed to truly be able to do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>This supreme principle had been comprehended.</p><p></p><p>However, it had not yet been transformed into a universal rule.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that "doing as he pleases" did not wish to be constrained by the universal rules.</p><p></p><p>Countless Black Tombs, countless Sun Gods were devoured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to operate the Great Oblivion Heart Sutra, preserving the only trace of his true spirit.</p><p></p><p>All the rules were fused at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Enlightenment dawned upon him.</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of light flashed in the depths of Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Heavenly Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"My path of the Yin God?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the tens of thousands of Sun Gods remaining in the Black Sky,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was hungry.</p><p></p><p>To open the Heavens, without sufficient material, how could it be enough? So Qi Yuan opened his gaping maw.</p><p></p><p>All the Sun Gods were suddenly devoured, becoming Qi Yuan's experience.</p><p></p><p>The rules and materials were shattered into fragments, all swallowed into Qi Yuan's belly.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness became even more turbid and chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Only a trace of the true spirit remained, struggling to maintain itself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>If the true spirit could not be maintained, he might become a terrifying and unique monster, instinctively devouring everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand something. After devouring all the Sun Gods and Realm Lords, he raised his horrifying head and looked towards the three Throne Sitters.</p><p></p><p>"Now... can you tell me what the Black Sky is?"</p><p></p><p>The three Throne Sitters were all in the Heavenly Realm, a realm that was difficult to fathom.</p><p></p><p>Even if the universe were to be destroyed, the Heavenly Realm cultivators could still create a new world and new beings in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you already known?" one of the Throne Sitters spoke, his voice enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>Another Throne Sitter had a mechanical smile on his face: "You can also be the Black Sky?"</p><p></p><p>"The devouring of the Black Sky is irreversible... Do you want to stop it?" the last Throne Sitter questioned.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that you're letting him devour your game?" At this moment, Qi Yuan's eyes had lost the clear brightness of a university student, becoming turbid instead.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky's devouring of the world is an established fact, irreversible. How can you stop it?" The Throne Sitter's voice was mechanical.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't try, how will I know?" Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was now incredibly powerful, feeling that he could swallow the entire Divine Wood Universe with just a single bite, when facing the massive black bubble of the Black Sky, his right eyebrow still twitched uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>This meant that he had no chance of victory whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>The Throne Sitters' eyes revealed a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky exists in the past, or in the future, but never in the present."</p><p></p><p>"What you see before you is not the Black Sky, but merely an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"This realm has already been devoured by the Black Sky in a certain time period."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he understood why when he looked at the Black Sky, he could not see any information.</p><p></p><p>Because he was not seeing the Black Sky, he was seeing a void.</p><p></p><p>The current Black Sky was devouring the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>It was not in the present tense, but in the past tense.</p><p></p><p>This was profoundly mystical and utterly absurd.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to a teenager on the Blue Star kissing the air, and then ten years later, all the men and women in the world becoming pregnant.</p><p></p><p>How would the future Qi Yuan stop it? He looked at the black bubble with a terrifyingly calm gaze.</p><p></p><p>"In the past... or the future?"</p><p></p><p>"If I go back to the past, or forward to the future... can I stop it?"</p><p></p><p>The Throne Sitters' eyes revealed a sinister smile: "Except for the Black Sky, there is no existence that can coexist with it in the same timeline, unless... you abandon your true spirit and become a part of the Black Sky."</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's current state, if he were to lose his true spirit, his condition would be similar to the Black Sky's.</p><p></p><p>Not existing in the present space-time, endlessly devouring everything.</p><p></p><p>What is being displayed to all the people now are anomalies, but they are the true reality.</p><p></p><p>Unless he reaches the same level as the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>But to reach the same level as the Black Sky, Qi Yuan would become a part of the Black Sky, or in other words, become the Black Sky itself.</p><p></p><p>How could he stop it then? "The so-called Black Sky is the fourth layer of the Sun God!"</p><p></p><p>"To stop the Black Sky, you need to break through to the fourth layer of the Sun God!"</p><p></p><p>"But... are you willing to?" one of the Throne Sitters asked with a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>"Above the third layer of the Sun God, there are only two paths: break through to the fourth layer, or you will be unable to break through to the fifth layer."</p><p></p><p>"If you skip the fourth layer and break through to the fifth layer, becoming a Dao Master... I'm sorry, but you won't be able to stop the Black Sky either," another Throne Sitter's mechanical voice seemed to carry a hint of bitterness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The fourth layer of the Sun God.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky is the fourth layer of the Sun God.</p><p></p><p>It does not exist in the present, only in the past or the future, a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Like the Root Demon, it has become the Root Demon Calamity in the hearts of countless Sun Gods.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Sky is different, the Black Sky is chaotic and disorderly, devouring is its only purpose, its ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Qi Yuan felt immense pressure and a sense of being undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>Without entering the fourth layer of the Sun God, he could not see the Black Sky, nor could he stop it.</p><p></p><p>If he stepped into the fourth layer of the Sun God, he would become the chaotic Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>Consciousness dissolved, true spirit vanished...</p><p></p><p>"So, go back. With your strength, perhaps you can protect the beings of the Sixteen Realms," one of the Throne Sitters said calmly.</p><p></p><p>They all lacked wisdom and consciousness, merely being a program, a projection.</p><p></p><p>However, even this program, this projection, possessed the power of the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was truly terrifying. The gap between each layer of the Sun God was like an abyss.</p><p></p><p>The third layer of the Sun God could never witness the fourth layer in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But the third layer would be unconsciously devoured by the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>This game was too dangerous?</p><p></p><p>Return?</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to return! Not only was this his own game, but if he returned, the Black Sky would also spread to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The next to be devoured would be the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>So, unlike other games, Qi Yuan had no retreat this time, not even the ability to return to reality and end the game.</p><p></p><p>"I insist on seeing if I can stop it!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a profound expression flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Great Oblivion Heart Sutra!</p><p></p><p>This time, he would forget his own self.</p><p></p><p>"I am not Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"I am not in the Heavenly Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I am not the fifth layer of the Sun God!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the fourth layer of the Sun God!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Oblivion Heart Sutra was continuously activated.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have forgotten himself.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red, terrifying behemoth, the true spirit dimmed to the extreme, as if it could disappear at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had forgotten...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I only remembered that I was a cultivator, and that I was at the fourth layer of the Yang God.</p><p></p><p>"This way... can it stop the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>The final whisper faded, and Qi Yuan's figure disappeared at that moment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, the Void Realm Lord looked at the Black Heavens in the void sea, his expression indescribable: "Qi Yuan's true spirit... has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>The burly bearded man's expression stiffened: "Gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qi Yuan... is gone." Sheng Nü had a sorrowful look on her face.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether she was grieving for Qi Yuan's death in battle or for the impending fate of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's all over!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm useless, why can't I forge the eighth Enlightenment Artifact!" The usually refined Ancestor God of Artifacts roared in anger.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was in despair.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had fallen, the seven Enlightenment Artifacts were shattered, and even if they could forge the eighth Enlightenment Artifact, what use would it be?</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's demise, the Divine Wood Universe was doomed.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a strange expression flashed in the Void Realm Lord's eyes: "The Black Heavens' devouring... has slowed down."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Some Ancestor Gods were stunned.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan gone, there was no one left to stop the Black Heavens, so how could its devouring have slowed down?</p><p></p><p>"It must be that Lord Qi Yuan used his own demise to obstruct the Black Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qi Yuan..." All the Ancestor Gods sighed, their hearts stirred, some even deeply grieved.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yuan asked: "May I ask the Realm Lord, how much time does the Divine Wood Universe have left before the Black Heavens devours it?"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at the Void Realm Lord with hopeful expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord shook his head: "I do not know."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent, not expecting such an answer, somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Black Heavens could devour at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This "any moment" could be the next second, or it could be a hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>Yuan took a deep breath: "Please, Void Realm Lord, take the beings of the Three Realms away."</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Spring comes and autumn goes.</p><p></p><p>Countless years pass in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling of steam cars never stops, and Wang Ku hugs a book, reading it intently.</p><p></p><p>"This old man really knows how to brag, the book is all in simplified characters, and the cover is new, yet he claims it was dug up from an ancient tomb, what bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>"But... the content in this book is so mysterious, but it seems quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku looked at the book very seriously.</p><p></p><p>This book is called "Tung Language".</p><p></p><p>In the book, it tells many small stories.</p><p></p><p>"This male protagonist is too much of a simp, he gave his eyes to the female protagonist, and he still hasn't defeated the big villain?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the male protagonist is so tragic, how many times has he died now?"</p><p></p><p>"This time, it's his ears that are gone, he has lost his hearing."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I'm a prophet, the male protagonist has lost his mouth this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Next time, it'll probably be his ears, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, does the author of this book have some kind of problem? Why can't the male and female protagonists meet each other? Is it intentional?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be intentional, the male protagonist only needs to wait there for a year, and he can meet the female protagonist."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... this big villain doesn't seem that strong, I wonder if I can run him over with a train and kill him."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Wang Ku hugged the book and slowly drifted off to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he was too immersed in the book, he even dreamed about the content of the book in his sleep.</p><p></p><p>"This male protagonist... is much more handsome than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>In the dream, Wang Ku saw a tall figure in a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>That figure was holding a long sword, standing on a black vortex.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was covered in wounds, his body battered, even missing an eye, which was filled with blood.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red robe wielding the sword seemed to be confronting the massive bubble in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that massive bubble, Wang Ku's young heart trembled, as if he was looking at the most terrifying thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>"A train definitely can't kill it!" Wang Ku thought to himself, then muttered, "According to the book's account, they've been confronting each other for a billion years, this is really exaggerated, how long have humans existed?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku looked at the figure in the blood-red robe and couldn't help but shout, "Hey, go find the female protagonist quickly, you can't defeat the big villain alone!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the tall figure confronting the black bubble slightly stiffened, and his chilling gaze fell on Wang Ku.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku felt as if he had been targeted by a terrifying beast, feeling that he could die at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why am I so afraid in my own dream? Aren't I the master of this dream world?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku woke up from the dream, only to find himself covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ancient book on the bedside table and started reading it carefully again.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, the male protagonist has died again, this time... his grave doesn't even have a name, buried in the Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>What is the Divine Wood Abyss? It sounds familiar."</p><p></p><p>"I'm so hungry, I need to go eat a bun."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku muttered as he opened his leather bag and took out two buns, not caring that they were cold, and stuffed them into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>In the room, the radio was playing various news.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking news, our country has discovered extraterrestrial beings!"</p><p></p><p>"The Shenruo Sect claims that in three days, it will be the end of the world."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heaven Cult declares: The Black Heavens will arrive, and all things will wither."</p><p></p><p>"Why are they all talking about mystical things, there's no useful news at all, this book is better than that."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku turned off the radio.</p><p></p><p>Whether he believes in the end of the world or not, it won't change the reality.</p><p></p><p>Rather than worrying about whether the world will end, he's more concerned about whether the villain in the book has died.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, will this author even let the villain die?"</p><p></p><p>During this time, Wang Ku had been reading "Tung Language" non-stop, neglecting his sleep and meals.</p><p></p><p>"Clichés, all clichés!"</p><p></p><p>"How many times has the male protagonist died?"</p><p></p><p>"At least ten thousand times, right!"</p><p></p><p>"But he still hasn't killed the villain!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't he at least meet the female protagonist? And team up with her to fight the villain!"</p><p></p><p>"Trash book, I'm not reading it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the night, Wang Ku had another dream about the book.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how many times he had had this kind of dream.</p><p></p><p>This time, he couldn't help but shout again, "Hey, go see the female protagonist!"</p><p></p><p>When he woke up the next morning and saw the heavy dark circles in the mirror, Wang Ku felt like crying.</p><p></p><p>"I can't read this book anymore, it's driving me crazy."</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door and took a deep breath of the fresh air outside.</p><p></p><p>"After all, reality is better."</p><p></p><p>Just then, the neighbor next door opened the door, revealing a delicate face and youthful, fair legs.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku's neighbor was a female college student, and when she saw Wang Ku, she had a shy look on her face. But then, as if remembering something, she blinked her eyes and asked, "Wang Ku, I heard they recently excavated an ancient tomb in the south district, and there are many cultivation techniques inside, do you want to go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're a college student now, don't be so superstitious, where would there be any cultivation techniques?" Wang Ku said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>The college student girl looked disappointed.</p><p></p><p>This neighbor was really not romantic at all.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Ku, you haven't had breakfast, right? I've cooked some porridge..."</p><p></p><p>"Porridge is nowhere as good as buns to eat." </p><p></p><p>Wang Ku refused and slammed the door shut.</p><p></p><p>"The book is still better to read, people outside are too annoying, always mumbling nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ku reopened the book and started reading it seriously again.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the words on the page, his gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>"As Qi Yuan was fighting the Black Heavens, he vaguely heard a hurried voice whispering in his ear, 'Go see the female protagonist quickly.'</p><p></p><p>He did not know that this voice belonged to the young man, Wang Ku."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, who's playing a trick on me?" Wang Ku was stunned.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

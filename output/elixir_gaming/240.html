        <h1>Chapter 240</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's gone!"</p><p></p><p>In the mortal realm, in the southern lands, all the ancient gods and ordinary people looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>At the huge opening, the giant blood sun that was originally there had now vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>What this meant, the ordinary people did not understand, but how could the ancient gods not know?</p><p></p><p>An elderly man wept with tears streaming down his face: "The Evil God... is gone!"</p><p></p><p>The Evil God that had ravaged the mortal realm for hundreds of thousands of years, that being above True Gods...</p><p></p><p>Was gone.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but recall not long ago, when the sky was torn open and the terrifying being above True Gods was roaring in rage.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Lord from the northern lands, wearing a blood-red robe, entered the sky.</p><p></p><p>Five thousand gods followed behind, vowing to slay the Evil God!</p><p></p><p>After seeing just a corner of the eye of the being above True Gods, the ancient gods of the mortal realm understood.</p><p></p><p>This battle could not possibly be won.</p><p></p><p>The power of the being above True Gods was beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Its body was even larger than the mortal realm itself.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods were born and raised in the mortal realm. All the resources they had obtained put together did not amount to even one ten-thousandth of that being above True Gods.</p><p></p><p>To fight was certain defeat.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>That blood sun that had shone upon the mortal realm for tens of thousands of years had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The mortal realm had won.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Lord had won.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"The Great Lord of Pear Mountain... has fallen."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Bai Xi... is gone!"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired and bearded elder flashed into the cave dwelling. When he saw that all thirty lanterns hanging in the room had been extinguished, his heart was filled with immense grief.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods who had gone to the northern lands had left a trace of their aura on the life lanterns.</p><p></p><p>The flames in the lanterns going out meant they had died in battle outside the sky.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired and bearded elder looked up at the sky, hoping to see ancient gods falling like meteors.</p><p></p><p>But alas, he was destined to be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Flying Desolation City, the city lord's daughter Huang Mengling had a wistful expression.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but recall when she first met that young man.</p><p></p><p>He was eating at a banquet.</p><p></p><p>She had invited him to leave Clear Water Village, that place of danger, and come with her to the city, even recommending he join the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>That strange ancient god had refused, and his actions were erratic.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought he could actually...</p><p></p><p>The events of the past were still before her eyes, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a weak voice sounded in Huang Mengling's ear.</p><p></p><p>"My injuries have healed thirty percent. Has Flying Spirit Prefecture sent any Evil Gods?"</p><p></p><p>The one sending the message was Ancient God Yuan, who had been injured and sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when Flying Desolation City was in danger, she had awakened briefly before quickly falling dormant again.</p><p></p><p>Even while healing, she had been worried about the situation in Flying Desolation City.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Lord killing the descending Evil God would surely provoke retaliation from the Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ancient God Yuan's words, Huang Mengling was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know how to answer this question.</p><p></p><p>She hesitated for a bit, and finally said: "The Evil Gods... are all gone."</p><p></p><p>"Gone?" Ancient God Yuan's voice carried a hint of bewilderment and incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she looked up at the sky, her eyes moved, then shocked.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling's somewhat desolate voice came to her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, the Origin Lord led several village ancient gods to attack the being above True Gods... They went beyond the sky and have not returned."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night was hazy, and the ancestral grounds of the Ancient Clan were silent.</p><p></p><p>It was not the time for the ancestral grounds to open, so they were completely empty now, without a single person.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a flash of blood-colored light appeared, and Qi Yuan's figure appeared in the ancestral grounds.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ancestral grounds without joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the ancestral grounds. Even I in my current state can sense intense danger."</p><p></p><p>Within the ancestral grounds lay dormant countless puppet gods.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan was a Yang God, yet not a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with the Blood Sun Great Saint and Blood God Great Saint, he had actually used a trick.</p><p></p><p>Those two had coveted the mortal realm for a long time and were tainted with too much primordial qi, which was why they were frozen by Qi Yuan's "All Beings Are Me" and then killed.</p><p></p><p>That freezing was not permanent.</p><p></p><p>Turning the two into puppets was unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Great Lord, Zhu Zhuangshi and those other subjects had used the Evil God's assimilation method to voluntarily become part of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was the true "me".</p><p></p><p>Primordial beings represented infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, if ordinary Yin Gods revered Qi Yuan as their lord and used assimilation on themselves, they still could not become Qi Yuan's "me".</p><p></p><p>"All Beings Are Me" was actually a law, but it was limited to the laws of the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>If it could be used universally across realms, or even across many universes, then... it would be no ordinary law.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze swept across the ancestral grounds, his expression deep and profound.</p><p></p><p>He turned and landed in an empty area.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to have been a tall tower here before, but now... it was gone.</p><p></p><p>"The aura here... feels somewhat familiar."</p><p></p><p>The vanished tower before him gave Qi Yuan a familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>"The God Observing Method?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured, understanding somewhat.</p><p></p><p>With his current level and knowledge, the law of conservation of energy still existed.</p><p></p><p>The God Observing Method that appeared out of nowhere had consumed some special towers within the ancestral grounds.</p><p></p><p>"The civilization of these ancestral grounds is quite formidable. I wonder... if it's from this... universe."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He stayed in the ancestral grounds for a moment, then his form dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't my quest to protect Clear Water Village... been marked as complete?"</p><p></p><p>The night was hazy.</p><p></p><p>Clear Water Village was exceptionally quiet at this time.</p><p></p><p>However, many ancient gods were gathered outside Clear Water Village. These ancient gods mostly had reverence in their hearts, looking at Clear Water Village before them as if on a pilgrimage.</p><p></p><p>"The power of one village produced Great Lords. Clear Water Village... should be a holy land of the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, we won't be able to wait for them to return."</p><p></p><p>Someone lamented, overcome with grief.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, two ancient gods with sharp features were secretly communicating.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Sovereign is so powerful, Blue Water Village must have secrets!" One ancient god's eyes lit up, his body trembling slightly. "Wang Can, your divine domain specializes in stealth. Now with so many ancient gods here, you deploy your domain, and the two of us will sneak into Blue Water Village. We'll split whatever we find 50-50!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Can hesitated: "The Origin Sovereign just averted disaster. What we're planning seems... inappropriate."</p><p></p><p>"Gratitude is gratitude, profit is profit... The opportunities in Blue Water Village would be wasted otherwise. We might as well benefit from them!" The man's gaze was greedy.</p><p></p><p>"But... if our actions are discovered, we may have no place to stand in the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we're communicating secretly, what are you afraid of? No one can know of our plans. </p><p></p><p>If we secretly obtain the opportunities in Blue Water Village, even if we're discovered, so what? We could become the next Origin Sovereign. What would those ancient gods amount to then? Even if the Origin Sovereign is reborn, so what?" The man said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>If not for Wang Can's special divine domain, the man wouldn't have cooperated with him at all. It would have been better to sneak in alone.</p><p></p><p>A flash of greed passed through Wang Can's eyes. He finally made his decision: "Let's do it!"</p><p></p><p>The two were secretly communicating and about to continue speaking when they suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Not far from Wang Can, a slender woman was holding a fox in her arms.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the woman's body trembled slightly, and goosebumps appeared on her skin under her brown dress.</p><p></p><p>Wang Can's gaze suddenly changed, and his divine domain silently expanded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the fox the woman was holding.</p><p></p><p>That fox was his heart fox!</p><p></p><p>His heart fox could hear cultivators' secret communications!</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Qingyu, what did you hear?" Wang Can's divine domain expanded, his eyes concealing killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Qingyu's body trembled as she tightly hugged the heart fox: "Senior, I didn't hear anything."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was both afraid and angry, only wanting to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Wang Can smiled. "It seems it was a misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't release his divine domain.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had already decided to keep Zhao Qingyu here.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my task wasn't completed. It turns out... someone still covets my Blue Water Village."</p><p></p><p>With this voice, a figure in a blood-red robe appeared.</p><p></p><p>The man had long hair and an extremely handsome face, like a demon god descending to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Wang Can and the other ancient god were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They were both utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>It was actually the Origin Sovereign. He was still alive!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Qingyu's whole body trembled, her eyes flashing with intense light.</p><p></p><p>She very much wanted to tell the Origin Sovereign what she had just overheard, but she couldn't open her mouth to speak at all.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a flash of blood-red light passed by.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that just because you're talking about me behind my back, I can't hear you."</p><p></p><p>Wang Can and the nearby ancient god widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored aura rushed into their divine domains. Their domains were as fragile as thin paper.</p><p></p><p>The immensely powerful divine domain broke through effortlessly, as if there were no defenses at all.</p><p></p><p>Terror filled their hearts as the aura of death swept over them. Their bodies fell, dead beyond dead.</p><p></p><p>Even in death, they didn't know how the Origin Sovereign knew... of their scheming.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a secret communication, and Zhao Qingyu had clearly been controlled.</p><p></p><p>As Wang Can perished, the pressure on Zhao Qingyu suddenly vanished. She looked at Qi Yuan and bowed solemnly: "Thank you, Sovereign, for saving my life!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, streams of light flashed by, clearly indicating that the ancient gods near Blue Water Village had discovered the anomaly here.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Qi Yuan, these ancient gods were either shocked or excited.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Sovereign... was actually still alive!</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Origin Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>Near Blue Water Village, over ten ancient gods had now gathered around Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at them indifferently.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an old man stepped forward, hunched over: "May I ask the Sovereign, what happened to the Evil God and the others?"</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the blood sun indicated that those above True God level had perished.</p><p></p><p>But since they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they were still uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Dead," Qi Yuan said flatly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, the ancient gods present felt relieved. Then they heard Qi Yuan say:</p><p></p><p>"Blue Water Village is my territory. Outsiders are forbidden to enter."</p><p></p><p>The task of guarding Blue Water Village had to continue.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods had little reaction to this, as they were still immersed in the news of the Evil God's demise.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan seemed to think of something: "Previously, I had promised to host banquets in some cities, but unfortunately never went.</p><p></p><p>These matters... I wonder if I could trouble you all with them?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many of the ancient gods were delighted.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Qingyu hurriedly stepped forward: "To serve the Sovereign is this humble woman's honor!"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Who should be revered in this realm... was clearer than ever.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave it to you then."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"You may all return now."</p><p></p><p>His figure also disappeared, entering Blue Water Village.</p><p></p><p>The primordial place.</p><p></p><p>The quiet Blue Water Village was no different from any ordinary village.</p><p></p><p>The crops in the fields were growing vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm guarding Blue Water Village, I might as well move Blue Water Village."</p><p></p><p>"I am Blue Water Village, and Blue Water Village is me!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, the Blue Water Village before him underwent a special transformation.</p><p></p><p>Stones, tiles, adobe, soil, trees, spirit rice... all became ethereal and were suddenly drawn into Qi Yuan's divine domain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face turned pale for a moment, then instantly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the game's prompt sounded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

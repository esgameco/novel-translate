        <h1>Chapter 332</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Director... Director? Huang Weiming was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the young couple not far away, a look of amazement flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He considered himself someone of some status, having attended many gatherings and seen many handsome men and beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>But none could compare to these two before him.</p><p></p><p>Not just in terms of looks, but also in aura and bearing.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Huang Weiming the most was that the brick that had just hit him on the head was now in the young man's hand.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if he had just been through a dream.</p><p></p><p>Everything that had just happened seemed like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"I'm... not a director," he answered instinctively.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the brick in his hand, a look of disappointment on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It really is all lies. How could you randomly drop a brick in the capital and hit a director?"</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary's bright eyes revealed a smile: "If you want, he can be a director."</p><p></p><p>"Cheating takes the fun out of it."</p><p></p><p>This strange dialogue between the couple left Huang Weiming confused.</p><p></p><p>Brick?</p><p></p><p>Hitting people?</p><p></p><p>Director? Wasn't that just an illusion?</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say something more, but suddenly realized that the young couple had completely disappeared from his sight.</p><p></p><p>He quickly looked around but found no trace of the two anywhere.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly searched all around, but there was simply no sign of the young couple.</p><p></p><p>If they were human... it would be impossible to leave his sight so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... ghosts? Huang Weiming then smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The mental pressure was too great, his nerves had become weak, and he was even having hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>A big brick falling down, plus the man asking about a director.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it felt bizarre.</p><p></p><p>He put these thoughts aside and trudged home with a worried face and tired body.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... life is so difficult... it might as well all be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiming felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>He had even thought about lashing out in anger, blood splattering five steps.</p><p></p><p>But that was impossible.</p><p></p><p>First, he had family, attachments and ties.</p><p></p><p>Second, the Mu family was one of the Seven Martial Star families, their descendants protected by nanobots - he simply couldn't make blood splatter five steps.</p><p></p><p>"Do I... just have to accept this fate?"</p><p></p><p>He felt unwilling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly his phone screen lit up.</p><p></p><p>A message appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The densely packed text made him think it was spam, and he was about to delete it.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, his expression froze.</p><p></p><p>"Vote? What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Dear Mr. Huang Weiming, you are of legal age and a lawful citizen of Qinyuan Country. </p><p></p><p>You are hereby invited to vote on the following matters..."</p><p></p><p>"The Mu family? Seven Martial Star families? Treason?</p><p></p><p>Evidence listed, proceeding to vote?"</p><p></p><p>This information entered Huang Weiming's mind, leaving him confused and his head in a muddle.</p><p></p><p>Was someone playing a joke on him?</p><p></p><p>Judging the Seven Martial Star families? Ridiculous! Who didn't know that the Seven Martial Star families were the true emperors of Qinyuan Country.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-year-old family, standing firm and unshakable - who could judge them?</p><p></p><p>However, he still quickly clicked on the link provided in the message.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the information there, he was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"If this is a joke... it's too much work!"</p><p></p><p>Clicking on any person randomly, he could see their life story.</p><p></p><p>The information was extremely detailed, recording everything the person had done in their life.</p><p></p><p>Both good and bad deeds were included.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each character introduction had robot lawyers providing explanations, stating what punishment should be given according to Qinyuan Country's laws.</p><p></p><p>Such vast information, professional explanations, and detailed data simply couldn't be explained as a joke.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Mu Kong?"</p><p></p><p>When he saw the familiar name, he was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>The one who had seized his property was none other than this Mu Kong.</p><p></p><p>He was actually also in this list for judgment.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiming felt a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>He continued reading.</p><p></p><p>"Murder... rape... currently suspected of attempting to seize assets from a merchant surnamed Huang..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiming was startled when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this referring to him?</p><p></p><p>He was extremely excited at this point, feeling both absurd and ridiculous. He quickly went to check social media platforms to see what was really going on.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, on all major platforms, information about the "vote" had become a hot topic.</p><p></p><p>"Vote, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"What is this Mu family?"</p><p></p><p>"Public voting?"</p><p></p><p>"Who initiated this!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss... could it be that the Mu family offended the other Seven Martial Star families at the same time?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, even if the Mu family falls, the Seven Martial Star families wouldn't allow voting, the implications behind this..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that the gods have shown themselves?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the hazy moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had his arm around Golden Canary, looking at the Seventh Prince in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand: "I'm very busy, too lazy to see these idle people, let them go back.</p><p></p><p>Don't disturb me and affect my mood, otherwise... I'll have to vote."</p><p></p><p>When the Seventh Prince heard this, his heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The word "vote" made his tense nerves jump.</p><p></p><p>Although not all of the Seven Martial Star families had extremely bad family traditions.</p><p></p><p>But they really couldn't withstand a vote.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Mr. Qi!" the Seventh Prince quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also too lazy to interfere with what happens next, I'll leave it to you officials, after all... I'm just an ordinary person, I can only make suggestions... Now go quickly, I need to sleep, I have to return to Long Tai City tomorrow, and in a few days... I still have to attend the Martial Arts Tournament!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Martial Arts Tournament, Qi Yuan's expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>This was the most important period.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Martial Arts Tournament, what were the Seven Martial Star families? They didn't even count as a fart.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Seventh Prince felt sweat forming on his back.</p><p></p><p>How could that be just a suggestion? It was more effective than an imperial edict! Who in Qinyuan Country now would dare to offend Qi Yuan without considering the consequences?</p><p></p><p>Even the other Seven Martial Star families treated Qi Yuan like an ancestral god to be worshipped.</p><p></p><p>After paying his respects, the Seventh Prince walked out of the hotel.</p><p></p><p>In the lobby outside the hotel, a group of old men were standing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>These old men, the youngest of whom was over sixty.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, they were standing respectfully outside the hotel, not even daring to sit in chairs.</p><p></p><p>Since they were meeting Qi Yuan, they didn't dare to exercise special privileges as before, nor did they block the roads or prohibit others from entering.</p><p></p><p>So, from time to time people passed by, looking curiously at the group of old men standing there.</p><p></p><p>Some even took photos.</p><p></p><p>No matter how they imagined, they couldn't guess that this group of old men were the most powerful people in Qinyuan Country.</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the Seven Martial Star families, and the king of the Qinyuan royal family.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Seventh Prince come out, these old men hurried forward.</p><p></p><p>Old Patriarch Fang asked, "What did Mr. Qi... say?"</p><p></p><p>There was still a tremor in Old Patriarch Fang's voice.</p><p></p><p>In all his long life, he had never been so cautious before.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi doesn't wish to see you all," the Seventh Prince answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"What?" "Mr. Qi doesn't want to see us..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>These old fellows looked as if they had lost their parents.</p><p></p><p>They thought Qi Yuan was angry and was going to deal with them too.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi said he's very busy and too lazy to see you..." the Seventh Prince had a good memory and went on to repeat Qi Yuan's original words to these people.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, these old men all breathed sighs of relief.</p><p></p><p>"We will take Mr. Qi's words to heart and wouldn't dare disobey!" Old Patriarch Fang spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The other patriarchs also chimed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Not seeing Qi Yuan was, for them, they didn't know if it was</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Good thing or bad thing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, some people were also uneasy inside.</p><p></p><p>What if... Mr. Qi got unhappy and killed them all, what would they do? Not seeing Mr. Qi... was also a good thing in some ways.</p><p></p><p>"We will... definitely obey the law and be good people in the future. We will also strictly require our clan members to absolutely not disturb Mr. Qi!" Elder Fang of the clan added as compensation.</p><p></p><p>The other elders also chimed in agreement, like Young Pioneers taking an oath, just short of wearing red scarves around their necks.</p><p></p><p>Young men and women stopped not far away, seeing this scene, and couldn't help but take photos.</p><p></p><p>"This is so interesting, are they filming a video?"</p><p></p><p>"So creative, inviting a group of old men to film a promotional video about respecting the law, it's sure to go viral."</p><p></p><p>"This Mr. Qi is probably a big internet celebrity. This is the capital, not the countryside. Inviting these old men to film a video, one egg probably isn't enough."</p><p></p><p>"At least ten eggs."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>Longtai City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan breathed in the fresh air as he looked at the azure sky and couldn't help saying:</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a rumor that randomly throwing a brick will hit a bureau chief,</p><p></p><p>The bad air in the capital... is true."</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch also took a deep sniff and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"The only regret about this trip to the capital is... those old guys were too poor. Although they met my moonlight requirements in terms of age, their other hardware and software were too lacking, not even comparable to a meal replacement."</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan didn't meet those old men.</p><p></p><p>But he was originally an old man killer.</p><p></p><p>His favorite people were old men.</p><p></p><p>After all, the probability of finding a moonlight among old men was the highest.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he couldn't help but climb to a high vantage point to see if there were any desirable moonlights.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, reality was too harsh.</p><p></p><p>That group of old men was too inferior.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even qualify as meal replacements.</p><p></p><p>"I've done some simple investigation these past few days... there are probably very few here who could be your moonlight," Goldfinch said considerately.</p><p></p><p>Having been with Qi Yuan for so long, she had also adapted to his way of speaking.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we can only rely on fate," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the two once again arrived at the building that was formerly the branch of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The competition would begin tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Today, all the participating contestants would undergo physical examinations and then be arranged for accommodation.</p><p></p><p>The competition would start tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a bus stopped and a group of young men and women got off.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu's eyes were filled with smiles: "So this is Longtai, it really does look much more prosperous than our Tianyue."</p><p></p><p>"So many martial artists, are they all here for the martial arts competition?" Wang Shiqiao's eyes sparkled.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xu Tiehua had performed brilliantly in the city-level competition, shone in the provincial competition, and earned a spot in the national competition.</p><p></p><p>For their martial arts school, this was a big deal.</p><p></p><p>So, five or six people from their school had come with Xu Tiehua to Longtai City.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao and Xing Yu, as the beauty representatives among the girls in the school, naturally came to cheer him on.</p><p></p><p>All expenses were covered by the school master anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, you must make it into the top 100 in this competition!" Xing Yu encouraged Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua shook his head: "It's too difficult. This time I'm just here to broaden my horizons.</p><p></p><p>As for next time... I don't know if there will be a next time. Recently... too many things have happened."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Xing Yu and Wang Shiqiao also felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Especially the voting from two days ago, which was even for the legendary Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>Even someone of Xu Tiehua's status, with some power in the local area, didn't have the qualifications to interact with members of the Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>But now, everyone could vote to decide their life or death.</p><p></p><p>This caused a huge stir within the Qin Yuan country, sparking much discussion.</p><p></p><p>There were many different opinions, but no conclusion.</p><p></p><p>However, people reached one consensus.</p><p></p><p>The world was probably going to change, and unprecedented changes were coming.</p><p></p><p>"Some say that immortal cultivators have already appeared in this world, and martial arts... will be phased out in the future, sigh." Xu Tiehua let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had practiced martial arts for so many years. If martial arts were to be phased out, he didn't know what he would do.</p><p></p><p>"Shiqiao, do you think there are really immortal cultivators in this world?" Xing Yu asked Wang Shiqiao.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>Her memory went back to that time, to that human head.</p><p></p><p>When she received the head gift, she was on edge for several days.</p><p></p><p>Later, after learning about the Guiran military camp incident and seeing the leaked videos,</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought arose in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Are there really immortal cultivators? Is Qi Yuan... an immortal cultivator? But why would an immortal cultivator practice martial arts, why would he send her a human head to earn a million from her?</p><p></p><p>An immortal cultivator surely wouldn't need that million.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... he has a secret crush on her?</p><p></p><p>As she was lost in these wild thoughts, suddenly a voice came:</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence, you're also here for the National Martial Arts Competition."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the familiar voice, Xu Tiehua and the others quickly looked over.</p><p></p><p>When they saw who it was, their eyes first showed surprise, then amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, why are you here?" Xu Tiehua couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu was pondering.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Qi Yuan was a strange person.</p><p></p><p>At the martial arts school, he had the female celebrity An Qi picking him up every day.</p><p></p><p>Now in Longtai, he was accompanied by a woman of indescribable beauty.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here for the National Martial Arts Competition. This is my fiancée, her name is Ning Tao, also called Goldfinch. Isn't she beautiful? Would you say she's the number one beauty in Gongxing?" Qi Yuan held Goldfinch's small hand, looking at her with a rather warm gaze.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch, who used to be so vain, had been cursed by the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and gone through so much.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still felt quite guilty towards Goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>She was not only the number one beauty of Jiupan Mountain, but had always been very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Fiancée? Where did you meet?" Xing Yu's eyes flashed with amazement, "In the past, if someone said there was a world's number one beauty, or a beauty of 5000 years, I wouldn't have believed it.</p><p></p><p>But now, I acknowledge her!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Xing Yu simply couldn't describe the beauty of Ning Tao before her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"See, Goldfinch, you're not just the number one beauty of Jiupan Mountain, but also the star flower of Gongxing." Qi Yuan occasionally spoke flirtatiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in the past when I asked you to introduce me as the number one beauty of Jiupan Mountain, you were quite reluctant." Goldfinch let out a cute "hmph" rather coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's memory also seemed to return to Jiupan Mountain, a hint of reminiscence flashing in his eyes. He held Goldfinch's hand even tighter.</p><p></p><p>"The past is the past, now is now."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, stop flirting you two, it's too sour. Hurry up and tell us how you qualified for the martial arts competition. I don't remember you even participating at the city level?" Xing Yu said.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao, who was usually talkative, fell silent now, seeming somewhat afraid of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I came through a special channel," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Special channel?" Xu Tiehua was surprised, his gaze towards Qi Yuan changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a broadcast suddenly sounded from inside the building.</p><p></p><p>"Attention all contestants, in order to 'promote civility and establish new customs', in this martial arts competition, contestants are prohibited from using any form of profanity, threats, or provocation towards opponents.</p><p></p><p>Violators will be immediately disqualified from the competition, and..."</p><p></p><p>The broadcast's voice reached the ears of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Those martial artists had strange looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, what does 'promote civility and establish new customs' mean? We've never had this before?"</p><p></p><p>"Not allowed to provoke opponents, isn't that too boring?"</p><p></p><p>"Can we give the middle finger?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

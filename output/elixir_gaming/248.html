        <h1>Chapter 248</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words fell on the ears of everyone present, causing all the Divine Infant cultivators to be stunned.</p><p></p><p>The disciples and elders of the Divine Light Sect also looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Jiang Lingsu covered her face with her sleeve. She frowned and whispered helplessly to Jiang Ran, "Big Senior Brother is acting crazy again!"</p><p></p><p>Big Senior Brother was good in every way, except for his tendency to act crazy.</p><p></p><p>What did he mean by "not enough Divine Infants"? The Wild Sword True Lord stroked his beard and said, "True Lord, your words... are perhaps too shocking?"</p><p></p><p>"For us cultivators, shattering the Golden Core to form a Divine Infant means condensing one Divine Infant. How could one possibly condense two?" Tea Language True Lord also asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Divine Zhi Feng's expression turned ugly, but she couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Divine Infant cultivators present doubted Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>After all, condensing one Divine Infant was the common understanding.</p><p></p><p>It was like how one plus one equals two.</p><p></p><p>Could someone really condense two Divine Infants?</p><p></p><p>Only Shen Wushen, upon hearing Qi Yuan's words, furrowed his brows and kept pondering, muttering, "Too few Divine Infants?"</p><p></p><p>In his understanding, one could naturally only form one Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Infant was condensed from a shattered Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>One Golden Core could naturally only condense into one Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Even if one forcibly condensed two, wouldn't it still be the amount of one Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't separating it actually make it weaker? Shen Wushen looked at Qi Yuan with a puzzled expression and said, "Divine Infants originate from Golden Cores. Even if one had the ability to condense two, there wouldn't be any fundamental difference."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen asked Qi Yuan earnestly, seriously discussing the matter.</p><p></p><p>This made the other Divine Infant cultivators feel strange.</p><p></p><p>Was this... even worth discussing?</p><p></p><p>Divine Zhi Feng's expression changed several times. She wanted to remind Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, she suppressed the idea in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"What you say is correct. That's how ordinary people think. Only true geniuses would take a different approach. To solve this problem is simple - don't shatter the Golden Core to form a Divine Infant! Let the Golden Core follow the path of the Golden Core, and the Divine Infant follow the path of the Divine Infant. Two broad roads, both leading to Rome." Qi Yuan's words were too shocking, and the term "Rome" was incomprehensible to them, making his words seem profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The other Divine Infant cultivators all frowned, seemingly pondering the true meaning behind Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Could the Golden Core really follow its own path?</p><p></p><p>Could the Divine Infant follow its own path?</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen also furrowed his brows tightly, seriously contemplating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Divine Zhi Feng said, "Nonsense. How could such a great dao exist in this world? Young Master, don't be deceived by him!"</p><p></p><p>She naturally felt that Qi Yuan was talking nonsense, deliberately teasing these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many Divine Infant cultivators shared this thought.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was too incredible, or rather, incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's very difficult to change people's perceptions.</p><p></p><p>It's like if someone on Earth told a passerby that the Earth was flat, that passerby probably wouldn't believe it either.</p><p></p><p>"Unless you show us two Divine Infants," Divine Zhi Feng said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged, "Why should I take out my Divine Infants to show you?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had organized this Divine Infant conference to show off, there was a difference between actively showing off and being forced to do so.</p><p></p><p>Divine Zhi Feng was stunned for a moment, then said, "Ten jade-level secret techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt no ripples in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was more like it.</p><p></p><p>However, remembering his bet with Shen Wushen, he said, "What if I do have two Divine Infants?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to extract more.</p><p></p><p>"If you have them, I'm willing to give 100,000 spirit stones!" Divine Zhi Feng said, "If you don't, you'll be Shen Gongzi's sparring partner for ten years."</p><p></p><p>A crazy fan is still a crazy fan, still thinking about Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>"No good, I'm not interested in spirit stones," said Qi Yuan, who indeed no longer cared for spirit stones at his current level.</p><p></p><p>He could now say, like Jack Ma, that he wasn't interested in money.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivation techniques could pique his interest now.</p><p></p><p>Divine Zhi Feng gritted her teeth. As the leader of a sect, she could naturally offer more.</p><p></p><p>But she couldn't bet with sect resources either.</p><p></p><p>She thought for a moment, then said through gritted teeth, "If you have two Divine Infants, I'll eat Wu Dian Monk's boots. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>There was such an entertaining option?</p><p></p><p>Usually, when dealing with his first loves, Qi Yuan always acted to benefit himself at others' expense.</p><p></p><p>Now, if Divine Zhi Feng were to eat Wu Dian Monk's boots, it would be harming others without benefiting himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quite liked this kind of thing too.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators on the scene all looked at each other, some trying to hold back their laughter.</p><p></p><p>Wu Dian Monk hadn't expected the matter to involve him. He blinked his eyes and looked at Qi Yuan, "True Lord, quickly show us your two Divine Infants!"</p><p></p><p>He especially hoped that Qi Yuan really had two Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>This way, his boots would have a destination.</p><p></p><p>Wu Dian Monk had always gone barefoot, and there was actually a reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Wu Dian Monk had a pair of magical boots, extremely precious, that could increase his flying speed considerably.</p><p></p><p>Those boots were also one of Wu Dian Monk's favorite treasures.</p><p></p><p>He had once practiced a foot technique. This dao technique related to footwork was very powerful, but Wu Dian Monk encountered a mishap during cultivation and went astray.</p><p></p><p>He ended up with terribly smelly, rotten feet.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't ordinary mortal stink, but cultivator-level stink.</p><p></p><p>His magical boots were also contaminated by this stench, emitting a foul odor like a dead rat in a drain or a rotting snake by the roadside.</p><p></p><p>Because of that foot technique, Wu Dian Monk could no longer wear shoes, and the stench on his feet only dissipated when barefoot.</p><p></p><p>However, he still kept those magical boots, always wanting to sell them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even at a price of 20,000 spirit stones, no Divine Infant cultivator was willing to buy them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the stench on the boots remained.</p><p></p><p>Wu Dian Monk excitedly said, "Sect Leader Shen, if you want to eat my boots later, you'll have to pay me 20,000 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>This was why Wu Dian Monk hoped Qi Yuan would win.</p><p></p><p>This way, the boots he had been unable to sell would finally find a good home.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out two boots from a separate storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a terribly foul odor spread.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Dian Monk, put those away quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>Even Divine Infant cultivators couldn't stand this stench.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Qi Yuan smiled and said, "The cultivation world is better. When betting to eat boots, they really eat them."</p><p></p><p>After all, there were so many scammers on Earth.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan encountered them, he would have to make them honest people.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, my two Divine Infants."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had many Divine Infants, so taking out two was easy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, unlike when treating his junior sister Jiang Lingsu's illness, he didn't need to activate the Divine Infants or put them in a semi-awakened state.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, two streaks of light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Around Qi Yuan floated two crystal-clear Divine Infants, like infants.</p><p></p><p>Each Divine Infant emitted an ancient, restrained aura, as if hiding immense energy.</p><p></p><p>All the Divine Infant cultivators present sensed an extremely dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His body seemed to be trembling.</p><p></p><p>However, they still let out exclamations of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Infant... two of them!"</p><p></p><p>"Really, two!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I can finally sell my boots!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Withered Wood also widened his eyes, not expecting there to really be two Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone in this world have two Divine Infants? This was even more unbelievable than reaching Divine Infant stage at twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible!" Shen Zhifeng's pupils contracted, her eyes emitting a terrifying golden light as she used her eye technique, trying to penetrate Qi Yuan's disguise.</p><p></p><p>But even with her eye technique, there were still two Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen looked at the Divine Infants, countless streams of light flashing in his gaze. </p><p></p><p>What he saw was far more than the Divine Infants present.</p><p></p><p>"These are Divine Infants..."</p><p></p><p>"No, how can there be such terrifying Divine Infants!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Divine Infants before him, it was as if he wasn't facing Divine Infants, but terrifying Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>His master was a Yin God who had taken seven steps to heaven, revered as a legend.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the feeling his master gave him was not as strong as one of Qi Yuan's Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>This was too inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've shown you my two Divine Infants. Monk Wudian's boots... shouldn't you eat them now?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>Doing things that harm others without benefiting oneself brings such joy.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng's expression changed several times.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen beside her spoke up: "Once a promise is made, it's as precious as gold and jade. If you don't want to fulfill a promise, then don't make promises in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Zhifeng lowered her head: "Young master's teachings are correct."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, she looked towards Monk Wudian.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty thousand spirit stones to buy your boots for use!"</p><p></p><p>Monk Wudian's face lit up with joy as he handed his foul-smelling boots to Shen Zhifeng.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Shen, my boots may smell strong, but they have an excellent taste. Made from golden water rare wood and ginseng silk, the flavor is somewhat sweet and spicy."</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng took the boots, and as soon as she smelled the stench, she couldn't help but feel nauseous.</p><p></p><p>However, she still gritted her teeth and forcefully put the boots in her mouth to eat them.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators present watched as if enjoying a spectacle, but none dared to truly laugh.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Zhifeng was the sect leader of the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan clapped his hands: "Not bad, keeping your word and following through decisively. Much better than the people on Blue Star."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already decided that if he had the chance to return to Blue Star, he would definitely rectify the atmosphere there, making those who cheat and deceive as honest and trustworthy as Shen Zhifeng, doing what they say they will do.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng frowned, turning her head away, unwilling to look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Her expression at this moment was extremely interesting as she held her breath.</p><p></p><p>If Shen Wushen hadn't still been here, she would definitely have run back to cut open her stomach and find the boot fragments to throw away.</p><p></p><p>Now, even her breath smelled foul, and she didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen, what about the techniques?" At this point, Qi Yuan looked towards Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>He had defeated Shen Wushen, so all the techniques on Shen Wushen's person were to be given to him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Wushen was also very generous, without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"These are all the techniques I possess."</p><p></p><p>"For the divine technique, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out a blank jade slip and recorded the techniques he had cultivated into it.</p><p></p><p>"The divine technique is called 'Supreme Chaotic God Technique'. Please don't leak it to others, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>The storage bag fell into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Qi Yuan obtained one divine technique, fourteen heaven-grade techniques, and three profound-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for earth-grade techniques, Shen Wushen didn't have any.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't show the techniques you've given me to others."</p><p></p><p>Anyway, these techniques would all become fertilizer for the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>He didn't lack spirit stones, what he lacked were techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, are you in great need of techniques?" At this point, Shen Wushen looked at Qi Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he had immense admiration for Qi Yuan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the holy son of Mount Futu would be no match for Qi Yuan at the Divine Infant realm.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the holy son of Mount Futu was the personal disciple of the Yang God, personally trained by the Yang God.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was still inferior to someone from the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>To him, even if Qi Yuan were placed in the upper realm, he would definitely be a genius among geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"I do, especially in need. What? Do you have a way to get new ones?" Qi Yuan looked at Shen Wushen with an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>"I can... but it's troublesome." Shen Wushen said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"How about this, if you can get me a divine technique, I can help you improve the divine technique you're cultivating for free once, increasing its power by at least twofold. What do you think?" Qi Yuan quickly said when he saw this, "If you bring more heaven-grade techniques, I can also give you some pointers, helping you go further on the path of Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, my Divine Infant can't be replicated, but yours... still has a lot of room for improvement."</p><p></p><p>Now, as Qi Yuan's strength increased, he could see more and more things with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Mortal Heart Realm, he had once transformed into a Yang God and giving pointers to a Divine Infant was the simplest thing.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Wushen stared at Qi Yuan, and finally said slowly: "Deal!"</p><p></p><p>He chose to believe Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because such a genius had no need to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>As for modifying techniques, he didn't fully believe it, after all, divine techniques were created by Yang Gods, how could a Divine Infant modify a divine technique?</p><p></p><p>Even if modified, it would probably only get worse, not better.</p><p></p><p>What he believed in were Qi Yuan's pointers.</p><p></p><p>"It's a deal!" Qi Yuan also said from the side.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a joyful voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Father is eating here and didn't call Jianjun?"</p><p></p><p>Only to see at this moment, a seven or eight-year-old girl floated over, her eyes filled with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators at the scene looked at the girl who suddenly appeared with surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because they couldn't see through this girl's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhifeng widened her eyes, her pupils filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>She knew that this girl was actually a Yin God Venerable! A Yin God Venerable calling Qi Yuan father? What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was also stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand something in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Qi Yuan's strength was so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He turned out to be the husband of Moon Lady! Moon Lady was one of the heirs of the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Her status was even higher than that of the holy son of Mount Futu.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Moon Lady had also come to the Azure Waves Realm before, and had a daughter with Qi Yuan? Later, Moon Lady returned to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>But because of the Azure Waves Realm, Qi Yuan was unable to return to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>If so, everything could make sense.</p><p></p><p>After all, only a true genius like Qi Yuan could attract Moon Lady's favor.</p><p></p><p>After all, Moon Lady of the Moon God Palace rarely falls in love, and when she does, it's for life... with one person.</p><p></p><p>"This is my daughter, Qi Jianjun." Qi Yuan introduced to the Divine Infant cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators at the scene were a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Qi Yuan only twenty years old? How could he have such a grown daughter?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Jianjun suddenly transmitted a message to Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with a bright smile: "Father, this person in front of us... is from the upper realm!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

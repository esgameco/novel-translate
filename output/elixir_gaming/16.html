        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After confirming that there was no one behind him, he lay down in a valley.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a game, this is a fight for survival!"</p><p></p><p>He had just killed a dozen or so reclusive gentry demons, but as a result, hundreds and thousands of gentry demons directly surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>He kept running, exerting great effort, before finally escaping.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat up, with a puzzled expression on his face: "How did the rest of the gentry demons discover me?"</p><p></p><p>He was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that all the gentry demons share the same perception?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of the Zerg from the anime he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>In a certain anime, it was set up that the Zerg were all controlled by a mother body, using the same system.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then it's going to be troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>In that case, Qi Yuan's strategy of divide and conquer would be ineffective.</p><p></p><p>He was very troubled.</p><p></p><p>This game map was more difficult to clear than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Should I ask Jingli for help? Maybe she has some game guides."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, and then sent a message: "The gentry demons in the Gentry Forbidden Zone are really too many. </p><p></p><p>Today I saw a forest, where all the trees were hung with belly bags, the scene was shocking, if I take a photo with my phone and post it online, it would definitely go viral!"</p><p></p><p>"I encountered some problems in my hunt for the gentry demons today."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stated the problems he had encountered.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any guides on your end that you can send me? I would be extremely grateful!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Prime Minister, the Emperor has returned to the palace," a man in a long robe said respectfully. "The people we sent are gone."</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting was playing chess and smiled when he heard this, not paying attention to the man in the robe, but instead said to the civil official he was playing with, "Elder Brother, are you sure you want to place your piece here and let me take one of yours? My chess pieces are connected, with eyes everywhere, the overall situation is already decided, you are already a dead piece."</p><p></p><p>The civil official, upon hearing this, humbly joked, "This official's chess skills are far inferior to the Prime Minister's, the overall situation is already lost, I can only take what I can."</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting heard this and laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>The current Empress Jingli is like a black piece on the chessboard, without any chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>A struggling beast, death is only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>And the civil official then took the opportunity to say, "Six days from now, when Lady Qin is defeated, we will all rise up and attack her, at that time, the South Qian will be the Prime Minister's domain."</p><p></p><p>Prime Minister Sima Ting, upon hearing this, had an even greater smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that the South Qian is already his domain, but how can it compare to having it legitimately?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jingli was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>She had just seen Lady Qin and presented her with the imperial medicine, the Nine Flower Brocade.</p><p></p><p>With this imperial medicine, Lady Qin's injuries would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lady Qin might even have the chance to reach the realm of the Emperor! This was an exhilarating thing for Jingli.</p><p></p><p>In a world where might makes right, having one more imperial-level expert would give her more confidence in dealing with Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>And the one who brought her all this was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Qi Yuan, her emotions were complex.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Linglong Jade Pendant flashed with light again.</p><p></p><p>She took out the Linglong Jade Pendant, and her joyful emotions increased a little. She looked at the contents inside, carefully observing, more carefully than when she looked at memorials, word by word.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that Qi Yuan was in danger in the Gentry Forbidden Zone, she was somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that the trees in the Gentry Forbidden Zone were hung with belly bags, an involuntary smile appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Information about the Gentry Forbidden Zone?"</p><p></p><p>When she saw that Qi Yuan was asking her for help, she immediately took it to heart.</p><p></p><p>"I'll help you find information about the Gentry Forbidden Zone right away.</p><p></p><p>Be careful until I have a result."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, thank you for your concern."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's message was replied to very quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, the monsters in the Gentry Forbidden Zone are really strange..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan went on and on.</p><p></p><p>Jingli listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she had lost her identity as the Empress. In her eyes, Qi Yuan was no longer the mysterious and powerful figure, but just an old friend with whom she could have a heart-to-heart talk.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Jinli looked at the books on the jade throne and frowned, "There is so little record about the Dress Code Taboo?"</p><p></p><p>In front of her was only a thin book, and the information about the Dress Code Taboo was very limited, just a few pages.</p><p></p><p>And these introductions were all very basic, completely unable to help Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Summon the Grand Secretary of the Wenyuan Academy, Dong Shishun," Jinli said.</p><p></p><p>Dong Shishun, the Grand Secretary of the Wenyuan Academy, was one of the most erudite scholars in Southern Qian.</p><p></p><p>And Dong Shishun was also part of Jinli's faction, and she hoped to obtain information about the Dress Code Taboo from him.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before the Grand Secretary of the Wenyuan Academy, Dong Shishun, appeared in the Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>Jinli directly asked, "Scholar Dong, do you know any information about the Dress Code Taboo, especially the introduction to the Dress Code Anomalies?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Shishun was taken aback when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>The Dress Code Taboo was one of the four great taboos of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>It was tens of thousands of miles away from the capital of Southern Qian.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, why are you asking about this?" Dong Shishun answered truthfully, "This humble servant does not know."</p><p></p><p>The Dress Code Taboo was too far away, and information about it was indeed scarce.</p><p></p><p>Jinli heard this and felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Was she unable to help Qi Yuan? But at this moment, Dong Shishun seemed to be hesitating about something, and finally spoke up, "This humble servant..."</p><p></p><p>"Speak without reservation."</p><p></p><p>"In theYu Manor, there may be books recording information about the Dress Code Taboo. </p><p></p><p>The old marquis went to the Dress Code Taboo in his youth."  Dong Shishun knew that the Yu Manor had detailed records about the Dress Code Taboo, but he was hesitant because the relationship between the Marquis Yu and the Emperor was very strained, even hostile.</p><p></p><p>The daughter of the Marquis Yu was the former Imperial Consort, the mother of the current Emperor, who was the previous Empress.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Consort and the Empress had become enemies, and eventually died unexpectedly in the palace.</p><p></p><p>The Marquis Yu blamed the Empress for this incident, and also hated the current Emperor.</p><p></p><p>If Jinli were to ask for the books, she would definitely be harassed.</p><p></p><p>Jinli also realized this, but she was still very happy in her heart, finally finding a clue.</p><p></p><p>She waved her sleeve, "I will go and visit the Marquis Yu myself!"</p><p></p><p>She didn't have many people under her, and if she sent someone to the Marquis Yu to ask for the books, they would definitely be recognized. It would be better for her to go herself.</p><p></p><p>Being harassed a bit was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>As long as she could find the information about the Dress Code Taboo, it would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Late at night, Jinli left the Marquis Yu's manor, hugging the books.</p><p></p><p>After kneeling for so long, her legs were a bit uncomfortable, but her face was filled with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Commander of the Imperial Guards, Hua Xian, supported Jinli, and her beautiful eyes were filled with anger: "The Marquis Yu was too unreasonable. He clearly knew that Your Majesty's legs were injured in the past, but he still deliberately harassed you. Your Majesty is of noble birth, highly esteemed, but you had to kneel for the late Imperial Consort for three whole hours!"</p><p></p><p>Hua Xian was both angry and helpless.</p><p></p><p>In the previous Emperor's time, the imperial power had already declined, and the Sima clan had taken control.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Sima clan killed all the imperial clan members and supported a young girl to ascend the throne.</p><p></p><p>In the entire court, no one took Jinli, the Emperor, seriously.</p><p></p><p>She saw Her Majesty kneeling for several hours, and felt deeply pained.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person to kneel on the ground for three hours without moving was an excruciating experience.</p><p></p><p>For those who were pampered, they would probably faint early on.</p><p></p><p>Even for ordinary adults, it would be difficult to endure.</p><p></p><p>To truly kneel for three hours without being able to move, one would understand the depth of the pain.</p><p></p><p>Although Jinli the Empress had cultivation, she was not very strong, and her legs were somewhat injured. Otherwise, she would not have made a fool of herself when she first ascended the throne.</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on the ground for three hours was also a grueling experience for her.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, at least I got what I wanted," Jinli tightly hugged the books, feeling satisfied in her heart.</p><p></p><p>PS: The title of this book is too embarrassing, I might change it tomorrow. If any readers are following this, please pay attention, don't mistake it for another work.</p><p></p><p>Finally, please continue reading! Please recommend this, thank you!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

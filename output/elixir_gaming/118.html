        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The withered corpse was not actually substantial at all.</p><p></p><p>Even the kasaya robe was formed from spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The monk in front of Qi Yuan was in fact an amalgamation of inner demons.</p><p></p><p>When it attacked, it stirred up countless inner demons from the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, which was the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, to tear at and devour Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You are the same as me, harboring the greatest evil in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Greed, pride, lust... all kinds of sins, sink into bliss with me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's whole body surged with blood energy, his blood-red robe moving without wind.</p><p></p><p>A broken sword materialized in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The sword's edge was filled with all kinds of evil auras.</p><p></p><p>After slaying demonic creatures, Qi Yuan's source of evil had reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Sink?" The murderous aura around Qi Yuan was even stronger than these thousands of demons. He was like a demon overlord. "A bunch of experience packs, wanting to drag me down with you!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword in his hand was condensed from his source of evil.</p><p></p><p>The evil aura it emitted was stronger, not weaker, than these inner demons.</p><p></p><p>"Become my nourishment!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his sword, and all the inner demons biting him shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>He observed the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, gained mutation abilities, and the source of evil extracted from slaying demons was barely of the same origin as these inner demons.</p><p></p><p>Slaying inner demons could all be converted into his source of evil.</p><p></p><p>He walked forward step by step. Inner demons sprang up, only to be slain by his sword and become part of his source of evil.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the cultivation methods of the Canglang Realm all have loopholes, and practitioners become nourishment.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of extracting nourishment is really awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored the inner demons and kept slaying them.</p><p></p><p>His source of evil was also growing frantically.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the origin, Mutation Ability +9999.]</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the origin, Charm +1.]</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the origin, Laziness Ability +1.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan climbed the stairs. The dried corpse clung to his body, whispering in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"One step forward, a ten thousand zhang deep abyss, the world of extreme evil.</p><p></p><p>One step back, the boundless demon realm, the world of extreme bliss.</p><p></p><p>Sink into this Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, and merge with me to become the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on the stairs. Countless pale hands reached out from the pitch-black bottomless abyss, firmly grasping Qi Yuan's ankles and pulling at his clothes.</p><p></p><p>The dried corpse on his back also whispered in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there were endless demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly recalled a line:</p><p></p><p>"I am the sun!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, his whole body suddenly emitted ten thousand rays of light.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to purify this demon realm with his own sunlight.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand rays of light swept across.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought he could certainly restore this Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to bright clarity and slay these inner demons!</p><p></p><p>However... things developed a bit unexpectedly for Qi Yuan, with some small mishaps.</p><p></p><p>Those inner demons, upon seeing his ten thousand rays of light, not only were unafraid, but like moths to a flame, their faces showed fanatical expressions as they rushed towards his radiant light.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm not your daddy!"</p><p></p><p>The other side was very fanatical, but Qi Yuan still showed no mercy.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand rays of light swept across, turning all the inner demons into his source of evil.</p><p></p><p>"I shine like the sun in the sky, why aren't the inner demons afraid of me?"</p><p></p><p>"Just because my light... is blood red?"</p><p></p><p>"You're discriminating based on color!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was angry.</p><p></p><p>These inner demons clearly had no eyes, yet they still discriminated based on color.</p><p></p><p>Endless light devoured the demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was like a supreme demon lord, walking along the endless staircase corridor, slowly advancing up the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Countless insights and endless evil filled his body.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted, he could even directly condense his own origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Gluttony - Taotie's Throat.</p><p></p><p>Pride - Eyes of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Lust - Red Lotus Karmic Fire.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The seven deadly sins, seven origin divine abilities, then combining seven into one.</p><p></p><p>Once the origin divine ability emerged, it would stir everyone's spirit, causing them to fall into the endless demon realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Five Light Peak of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu stood outside the cave dwelling, respectfully looking through the water screen.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave dwelling was the master of Five Light Peak, Kang Fulu's teacher, the Five Light Peak Lord, True Lord of Great Light.</p><p></p><p>A hoarse voice came through as the True Lord of Great Light imparted to Kang Fulu the key points of condensing a golden core.</p><p></p><p>"To condense a golden core, one must first pass through the inner demon tribulation, then the heavenly tribulation, using the carried treasure as the core, solidifying spiritual energy to form the golden core."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the world has changed, the heavenly tribulation does not manifest. One only needs to pass through the inner demon tribulation to achieve the golden core."</p><p></p><p>"The inner demon tribulation is difficult... but not difficult.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's obsession and the firmer one's character, the stronger the inner demon tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Acting naturally and being frank and sincere can actually lead to having no inner demons, making it easier to pass through.</p><p></p><p>Just like that Qi Yuan from Seven Colors Peak, fixated on one thing with no distractions, it's actually easier for him to pass."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, don't be bewitched by inner demons. You must slay them!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple understands." Kang Fulu stood in front of the cave dwelling, pondering his master's words.</p><p></p><p>The inner demon tribulation...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, or the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons as the dried corpse called it, now had every kind of inner demon imaginable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body emitted an intense red light, with endless inner demons piling up on him.</p><p></p><p>He was like a small mountain of inner demons, struggling to climb towards the highest door.</p><p></p><p>Every minute, thousands upon thousands of inner demons fell from the mountain and turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>But still, more and more inner demons kept climbing onto Qi Yuan's back.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was the most delicious food in the world, the demon lord!</p><p></p><p>"Now I look like a giant inner demon."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The seven deadly sins formed countless emotions, all flashing through his eyes and turning red.</p><p></p><p>He carried endless inner demons on his shoulders, stepping forward on the stairs one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>These inner demons were his nourishment, ultimately becoming his source of evil.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan sensed something and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"All inner demons should become my nourishment. I think... if I want you to live, you live. If I want you to die, you die!"</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the origin, Power of Reincarnation +1.]</p><p></p><p>When the prompt came, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending for so long in the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, this was the first time he had comprehended such a high-level ability.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that just spouting some nonsense could lead to comprehension?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he quickly said:</p><p></p><p>"I control the great void, omniscient and omnipotent, the origin of all things.</p><p></p><p>When I close my eyes for an era, all things are destroyed and the universe shatters; when I open my eyes for an era, all things are revived and the universe restarts!</p><p></p><p>Time is a strand of my hair; space is the gap between my hair tips; the Heavenly Dao is my meditation when I doze off; matter and spirit are things I imagine!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exhausted his vocabulary, describing himself as lofty and grand.</p><p></p><p>He was very excited.</p><p></p><p>If he could really comprehend such powerful things, that would be a huge gain.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the origin, Boasting Ability +1.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan: "...That's it?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan deeply regretted wasting so much time.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he only got a useless boasting ability.</p><p></p><p>The dried corpse's voice still echoed in his ear: "Go back! If you go further, you will fall into a place of no return, completely sinking into the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons!"</p><p></p><p>The dried corpse's voice caused a ripple in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Endless inner demons are all my nourishment, what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>"No living being can withstand the evil force of an entire world!</p><p></p><p>Even arhats, even Buddhas, cannot do it!" the dried corpse howled.</p><p></p><p>Endless inner demons crawled out from under the stairs, continuously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes had completely turned red.</p><p></p><p>Even his skin had turned red.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>Is my path... the source of evil? To condense the source of evil into an origin divine ability?</p><p></p><p>There can only be one origin divine ability, and once decided it cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>Should he embark on this path? But with the endless inner demons pressing down, Qi Yuan also felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>Even he found it somewhat difficult to endure, urgently needing release.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a thousand times, ten thousand times more terrifying than the divine reflection before.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, pondering his own essence.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't remember, couldn't remember at all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he understood and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Since you worship me so much, I'll be merciful and condense you into part of my divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan made up his mind to forge ahead.</p><p></p><p>The stairs behind him also began to break.</p><p></p><p>The dried corpse revealed a ferocious smile: "The way back is gone, hahaha, you will sink forever into the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons like me, becoming an inner demon!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored the dried corpse's voice. An overbearing aura emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, and one-seventh of the demons on the mountain dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Pride - Eyes of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he condensed the divine ability of pride.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's mind appeared the curvaceous figure of his junior sister Jiang Lingsu under her loose long dress, and his master's cold</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The lonely silhouette, Ning Tao's enchanting long legs wrapped in black stockings, the petite and charming figure of the canary.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, and some of the evil on his body disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Lust - Red Lotus Karmic Fire!"</p><p></p><p>Countless images flashed through his mind as Qi Yuan stepped forward one by one. </p><p></p><p>The evil on his body was slowly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The mummy's voice came, full of endless allure.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think that by turning your inner demons into divine powers, they will disappear?"</p><p></p><p>"Wrong, terribly wrong. They will only become closer to you!"</p><p></p><p>"They will become you, and you will become them!"</p><p></p><p>"The path I once walked is the same as yours, haha... This path leads to becoming a demon!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored it.</p><p></p><p>He continued to concentrate on his divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red lotuses sprouted beneath his feet.</p><p></p><p>On his back, a blood-red light shone, like a blood demon Buddha!</p><p></p><p>"Gluttony - Taotie's Throat!"</p><p></p><p>"Envy - Endless Sea of Blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Sloth - Dream of Non-Action!"</p><p></p><p>"Greed - Soul-Devouring Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"Wrath - Nine Heavens Divine Thunder!"</p><p></p><p>The seven deadly sins condensed into seven divine powers.</p><p></p><p>All the inner demons on Qi Yuan's shoulders disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The corner of the mummy's eye revealed a ferocious smile: "Haha, you have become... an inner demon!"</p><p></p><p>He snarled and also became part of the divine power.</p><p></p><p>Endless inner demons filled Qi Yuan's entire being.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face was expressionless as the seven divine powers merged into one.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Master's Inner Demon Summoning!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the endless inner demons also spread into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>His body began to transform at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The mummy's voice sounded in Qi Yuan's mind again.</p><p></p><p>"From the moment you slayed the first inner demon, you set foot on a path of no return!"</p><p></p><p>"Pride filled your mind, greed made you lose reason, lust made you lust after all female creatures!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, perhaps at first, you were always suppressing yourself, forcibly controlling your desires!"</p><p></p><p>"But once you enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, all desires will surge like a raging flood, pouring down from the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Your body, your spirit, have already begun to demonize. Haha, even if the supreme Buddha intervened, he could not pull you out of this downfall!"</p><p></p><p>"You will be one of us!"</p><p></p><p>With the mummy's voice, Qi Yuan's feet seemed to be nailed to the steps.</p><p></p><p>What the mummy said was indeed true.</p><p></p><p>After slaying demons and extracting their essence, Qi Yuan's temperament had undergone subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>Images he had never thought of before would inadvertently flash through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He confined himself to one city, rarely interacting with others, either to guard the City of No Return, or to prevent inner demons from easily growing.</p><p></p><p>He killed and killed, using killing to resolve desires.</p><p></p><p>When he gained enlightenment of the origin again and came to this life, he also killed non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the canary again, he also sensed her different charm from before.</p><p></p><p>Was it from his true heart? Or was it the work of inner demons? This didn't matter. For Qi Yuan, actions were the heart.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing desires, liberating one's nature? What nonsense! Kill, kill, kill until blood flows like a river, shatter everything with one sword!</p><p></p><p>"Become an inner demon, merge with us!" The mummy's voice kept spreading in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"You have no way back!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat motionless on the steps, his whole body blood-red. His body was constantly demonizing, turning into evil inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>Within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, a terrifying giant demon seemed to be taking shape.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard nothing. What was he thinking? He seemed unable to remember.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the ends of the earth, the sea was blood-red.</p><p></p><p>The canary stared blankly at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions: "When will Blood Bead... come out?"</p><p></p><p>It had been eleven years since Blood Bead entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>For these eleven years, she had been waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>Five years ago, a special change occurred in the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, and all the surrounding seawater turned red.</p><p></p><p>Now, the red color had begun to spread, reaching the canary's feet.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran appeared beside the canary and said worriedly, "He will come out someday."</p><p></p><p>They didn't know the changes inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>But Shang Yanran clearly sensed that within the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, a tremendous demon was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Once it succeeded and the demon was born, this realm would fall into irredeemable disaster.</p><p></p><p>And this demon... was very likely to be the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yanran, you don't need to comfort me." The canary's small face was still beautiful, her makeup exquisite. "Entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions will turn one into... a demon."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shang Yanran sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions had determined the Blood Lord's fate.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of all living beings, the Blood Lord entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, closing it and sacrificing himself to feed the demons.</p><p></p><p>...And becoming a demon.</p><p></p><p>"If he comes out, I'll wait for him here," the canary said with a bright smile. "Just like at Mount Jiupan, I hope I'm the first person he sees when he comes out."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran said nothing.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace had already begun to retreat from the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>The people living here were also constantly migrating, leaving this place.</p><p></p><p>"It would be nice if he's still as handsome after becoming a demon," the canary said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Baize also appeared, his face full of fatigue: "The Fate Stone Tablet has been found."</p><p></p><p>He reached out and took out the Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Fate Stone Tablet, Shang Yanran's eyes showed no excitement: "It's too late."</p><p></p><p>Now... the Blood Lord had obviously become a demon. Even the Fate Stone Tablet could not save him.</p><p></p><p>If it was when the Blood Lord had just entered, they might have been able to use the Fate Stone Tablet to find a way to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Blood Lord had become a demon, what the Fate Stone Tablet revealed was only the method to slay demons.</p><p></p><p>Baize fell silent, his eyes full of self-blame.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shang Yanran said, "Canary, in a few days, we will leave this place."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The canary's voice was resolute. "Don't try to persuade me to leave, and don't knock me out and take me away, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, and finally nodded: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran and Baize left, leaving only the canary alone in the vast ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>She sat on the huge rock where she used to sit with Blood Bead, looking at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>Her voice carried a hint of tears: "Blood Bead, everyone else has stopped waiting for you, but I'm still waiting!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone says that what comes out will be a demon.</p><p></p><p>But he is still her childhood sweetheart, her Blood Bead.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, just like at Mount Jiupan, waiting for that childhood sweetheart to appear again.</p><p></p><p>Time is unpredictable. Now, the Blood Palace and the surrounding cities were almost deserted.</p><p></p><p>The ends of the earth had also turned cold, with blood-red frost condensing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The seawater had also frozen into blood-colored ice.</p><p></p><p>In the Blood Palace, there were still over ten people who hadn't left.</p><p></p><p>These were also the only people left in this place.</p><p></p><p>The little old man had traveled a long way from Mount Jiupan but hadn't seen the Blood Lord. He looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, his eyes showing disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Did the master really not mention my name? Is it because my name is too ugly?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Daoren shook his head: "Nangong Dagou, the master cares about the world, how would he have time to mention you?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Dagou felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>They stood here, looking at the canary in the distance, their expressions moved.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, they would leave this place completely.</p><p></p><p>Here, only the canary would remain.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the master cared about all living beings, yet was slandered by the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman. Just after the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman was killed, the master entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions for the sake of the world, sacrificing himself to feed the demons." Baize's eyes were full of emotion and admiration.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was moved to have such a master.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, as if wanting to take one last look.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present showed shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>They saw the endless sea of blood, the frost disappearing, turning back into seawater.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red frost on the ground was also disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The canary's small hands, frozen red from the cold, felt a touch of warmth, but her face showed a fearful expression: "Blood Bead's... aura... why has it disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so people present all flew towards the canary. They looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions, their eyes showing shock and extremely complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>Now that the blood-colored frost had disappeared, the human world seemed to return to clarity.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the giant demon in the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions was also rapidly diminishing, as if that demon was about to permanently disappear from this world.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's face was sorrowful: "The Blood Lord... after becoming a supreme inner demon, he was actually able to reawaken a bit of humanity, severing his own life force and departing this world forever."</p><p></p><p>The Buddha of the past had turned into a great demon and entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>Even the Buddha had fallen and was unable to awaken his humanity to destroy himself.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be moved that the Blood Lord was able to do this?</p><p></p><p>P.S. Have you guessed what Qi Yuan's original divine power is?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The leader of Cloud Palace fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't quite understand. </p><p></p><p>What did the Dragon King mean by "asking for a crooked mouth"?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, there's really a generation gap with you old fogies," Qi Yuan lamented, seeing the Cloud Palace leader's silence.</p><p></p><p>He also understood something.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the white moonlight always remained white moonlight, unable to become official - the age gap was too big.</p><p></p><p>The corner of the Cloud Palace leader's mouth twitched: "Elder, you really know how to joke."</p><p></p><p>He said, looking at Huang Tu beside him: "Elder, could you do me a favor and spare this young man's life?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, deep fear filled Huang Tu's eyes. </p><p></p><p>How could this man in blood-red robes possibly be the Blood Sword God? The Blood Sword God he viewed as a nightmare and wanted to devour the flesh and crush the bones of was right beside him, yet he didn't dare harbor any resentful thoughts, his body trembling.</p><p></p><p>Because the Blood Sword God was truly capable of killing.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I do you a favor? He wanted to kill me, so I'll kill him. It's only natural," Qi Yuan said calmly, glancing at Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses around Huang Tu felt as if they had fallen into an ice cellar. They all moved away from him, treating him like the plague.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, if you kill Huang Tu, I'm afraid... it will be very difficult to reconcile with the Palace of Light," the Cloud Palace leader said. "This Genius Battle is crucial, and Huang Tu is the Palace of Light's only hope of entering the top twenty."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, he's from the Palace of Light? And so important to them?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Huang Tu looked familiar - he was a descendant of the white moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"More important than a Purple Mansion cultivator, even... comparable to a Palace Lord," the Cloud Palace leader emphasized Huang Tu's importance.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to want to protect Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>Hoping the Blood Sword God would spare Huang Tu's life because of this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless. Could the people of the Palace of Light not survive without Huang Tu? Couldn't they watch videos?</p><p></p><p>A cold smile appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "Then he must be killed even more."</p><p></p><p>His hand flicked, sending a spell flying towards Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader's expression changed slightly, wanting to block it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his strength was far inferior to the Blood Sword God's. He simply couldn't block Qi Yuan's attack.</p><p></p><p>Even if he touched it, he would be injured.</p><p></p><p>As the spell landed, Huang Tu's eyes froze.</p><p></p><p>His body went limp and he collapsed to the ground, all life force gone.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader's face looked particularly grim.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses present were all somewhat terrified.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Sword God was truly beyond common sense.</p><p></p><p>He really killed geniuses!</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of being criticized for bullying the weak at all.</p><p></p><p>With Huang Tu's death, the Cloud Palace leader sighed: "Elder, why must you make relations with the Palace of Light so tense?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored the Cloud Palace leader, instead clapping his hands and looking at the Rogue Immortal Lord: "Another one dead, your ranking on the Genius List has improved again. How far are you from the official list? Do you want me to kill some more?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, those geniuses were frightened and their faces changed greatly. They all took several steps back.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Sword God must be crazy, right?</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord was completely dumbfounded at this point. He squeezed out a smile uglier than crying: "No... no need."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Gao Jien stood still, not daring to move at all.</p><p></p><p>If not for the two Purple Mansion cultivators here, he would have definitely gone to ask his junior brother what was going on with the Blood Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader looked at Qi Yuan and slowly said: "Actually, the Palace of Light had some words they wanted this junior to pass on to Elder."</p><p></p><p>"You're the Palace of Light's lapdog?" A murderous aura swept out from Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>This was the white moonlight after all, valuable.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all." Sweat formed on the Cloud Palace leader's forehead. Just now he had sensed a crisis of death. "I have no relationship with the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the murderous aura on Qi Yuan's body disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, may I have a word in private?" the Cloud Palace leader spoke up at this time.</p><p></p><p>In public, some things were ultimately not good to transmit via voice.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, alright, two words is fine too." Qi Yuan nodded, looking at the Rogue Immortal Lord beside him, "Rogue Immortal Lord, when the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance starts later, remember to record it for me, thanks."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he disappeared with the Cloud Palace leader.</p><p></p><p>Only leaving behind a group of geniuses with faces full of awe and shock.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord sat blankly in place, his mind a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses all looked at him, their eyes filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gao Jien hurriedly transmitted: "Junior brother, what's going on exactly? What Blood Sword God? What Palace of Light? Should we run away now and quickly return to Thunder State?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother... I'm actually not very clear either." The Rogue Immortal Lord's mind was still a bit chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the cave dwelling, a faint incense was lit, adding a hint of immortal charm to the entire mansion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wore a blood-red robe, the bloody aura on his body permeating. He looked at the Cloud Palace leader: "Speak, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Elder shouldn't have killed Huang Tu. This has thoroughly offended the Palace of Light," the Cloud Palace leader said.</p><p></p><p>"I've already offended them before," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He was going to destroy the Palace of Light anyway, so why worry about offending them? What was there to fear about offending dead people?</p><p></p><p>Even in this immortal cultivation world, he had completely annihilated his enemies in body and spirit, so they couldn't possibly become ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Elder may not know how important it is for the Palace of Light to enter the top twenty in this Eastern Land Genius Battle," the Cloud Palace leader said.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it just to gain the qualification to enter a new world?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader was slightly stunned: "Since Elder knows this, shouldn't you know what it means?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What does it mean?" Qi Yuan looked confused. "Don't give me riddles, speak clearly."</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace leader's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Blood Sword God really didn't know.</p><p></p><p>But... shouldn't all top forces or orthodox major forces in each state know these things?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... this Blood Sword God was an independent cultivator? Thinking of this, the Cloud Palace leader admired him even more.</p><p></p><p>His expression became difficult: "Elder, this matter concerns heavenly secrets. I really can't say. Otherwise, if I speak of it, I'm afraid I would die on the spot. I can only reveal eight words to Elder: Great calamity is coming, prepare early."</p><p></p><p>"Great calamity?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't pursue the question further.</p><p></p><p>Judging by the Cloud Palace leader's appearance, he wouldn't be able to get an answer anyway.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Eastern Land has discovered a new world. The three... Yin Gods of the Eastern Land have discussed that any sect or force whose genius ranks in the top twenty of the Eastern Land Genius List will have the opportunity to enter that world and expand their territory," the Cloud Palace leader continued.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Land has three Yin Gods?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This was what he cared about.</p><p></p><p>"Such secrets, this junior does not know," the Cloud Palace leader shook his head, not expecting the Blood Sword God to ask this.</p><p></p><p>"How strong are Yin Gods? Could ten thousand of you kill a Yin God?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." The Cloud Palace leader was very embarrassed. "Elder, please don't put this junior in a difficult position. Yin Gods... are already like gods in this world. This level, this junior cannot fathom, and doesn't dare to have any thoughts of comparison at all."</p><p></p><p>"If I took down the sun from the sky and smashed a Yin God with it, would it kill them?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat covered the Cloud Palace leader's head.</p><p></p><p>Why was this Blood Sword God so fixated on Yin Gods? As soon as he opened his mouth, he wanted to fight Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit, the Blood Sword God's strength was very powerful, almost on par with the master of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But Yin Gods and Purple Mansion cultivators were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>One was still cultivating immortality, while the other was already an immortal god.</p><p></p><p>"It should be able to kill them..." the Cloud Palace leader said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan made up his mind: "By the way, that new world, which world is it? How strong is it?"</p><p></p><p>"The Wangyue Continent. It's very weak, with the strongest beings only comparable to the Divine Infant stage in our Azure Wave Realm. So the top twenty geniuses of the Eastern Land Genius List are enough to sweep across the Wangyue Continent."</p><p></p><p>"Wangyue Continent?" Qi Yuan's eyelashes twitched.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected to hear about this world.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the world in his game? The place where he had built his Heavenly Dao Foundation?</p><p></p><p>Jin Li...</p><p></p><p>Was it just the same name or the same place? His heart stirred with waves, but he looked very calm: "Do I qualify to go to the Wangyue Continent?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the matter decided by the three Yin God Venerable Ones cannot be changed. You must enter the top twenty of the Eastern Land Genius List to have a chance to enter the Wangyue Continent."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I understand." There were still some waves in Qi Yuan's heart. "I'm leaving."</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only leaving behind the Cloud Palace leader with a bitter smile in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it seems the grudge between the Blood Sword God and the Palace of Light cannot be resolved."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Third Palace Lord Zi Yan's face bore a respectful expression, with killing intent deep in his eyes: "Great Palace Lord, Huang Tu... was killed by the Blood Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Palace Lord's entire body was shrouded in light, making it impossible to see his face clearly. One only knew he was a majestic man.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the Great Palace Lord said calmly. "I have already spoken with the Eastern Land leader of the Divine Flower Society. He will help us arrange a meeting with the Blood Sword God so we can sit down and have a good talk."</p><p></p><p>"Still talk?" The Third Palace Lord didn't understand, his face somewhat fierce. "He killed Huang Tu, cutting off one of our escape routes!"</p><p></p><p>"Great calamity is coming. Everything... must prioritize the plan."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We can't delay any longer on such a trivial matter. We should concede when necessary, it's just a matter of losing some face," the Grand Master said calmly. </p><p></p><p>"Unless the Blood-Robed Sword Saint walks into our trap and comes to the gates of Light Palace, we won't be able to encircle and kill him no matter how much manpower we waste. Why bother with futile efforts? This matter should end here."</p><p></p><p>He certainly wanted to execute the Blood-Robed Sword Saint. If only the Blood-Robed Sword Saint would come to Light Palace headquarters, with the help of numerous Purple Mansion cultivators and the Imperial Dragon Crown, he could easily ensure the Blood-Robed Sword Saint would never leave alive. </p><p></p><p>However, as a powerful expert, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint was no fool. How could he come to his death? </p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Grand Master could only make peace with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint for now.</p><p></p><p>"Before returning, I personally met with that person. That person said our Light Palace can accept one more disciple. Xu Tongchen's talent far surpasses Huang Tu's. He will certainly enter the top twenty, or even the top ten. We'll take Seven Words Sect's spot for ourselves." The Grand Master was decisive, determining Seven Words Sect's fate with one sentence. </p><p></p><p>As for whether Seven Words Sect agreed or not, that was no longer his concern.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>With an uneasy heart, Xu Tongchen came to Qi Yuan's cave dwelling again.</p><p></p><p>This time, unlike before, Qi Yuan seemed to be playing chess with two friends. </p><p></p><p>At the moment, Qi Yuan was holding a black piece, pondering where to place it.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan... long time no see." Xu Tongchen looked at Qi Yuan, his legs trembling involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that this ordinary man who practiced cultivation with him every day was actually the renowned Blood-Robed Sword Saint of Cuiyun Continent?</p><p></p><p>His unusual behavior caught Jiang Ya's attention. She glanced at Xu Tongchen, then at Qi Yuan, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Xu Tongchen: "Come sit down. Wait until I finish this game of chess, then I'll go practice cultivation with you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen sat down beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's opponent was Kang Fulu. He placed a black piece and looked at Qi Yuan smugly: "Junior Brother, you've lost this game."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the board and could only shake his head: "Indeed, I'm still only suited for playing Five-in-a-Row."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya sat to the side, a smile in her eyes. </p><p></p><p>These two, Qi Yuan and Kang Fulu, were truly terrible at chess.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu's face grew even more smug, but then he seemed to think of something and couldn't help asking: "Junior Brother, did you not attend the Fish Dragon Banquet yesterday? Why didn't I see you?"</p><p></p><p>"I attended," Qi Yuan replied, "You were with Senior Sister Jiang Ya at the time, and... Xu Tongchen was also nearby."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, strange, how did I not see you?" Kang Fulu said. He asked Xu Tongchen, "Fellow Daoist Xu, did you see my Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he had attended the Fish Dragon Banquet with Jiang Ya and encountered Xu Tongchen, whom he had met once before at Qi Yuan's place. The three of them had walked together.</p><p></p><p>"I... I saw him," Xu Tongchen said, stealing a glance at Qi Yuan. He didn't know how to answer.</p><p></p><p>Should he say that Kang Fulu's Junior Brother was actually the terrifying Blood-Robed Sword Saint?</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, Fellow Daoist Xu, you saw my Junior Brother and didn't even tell me? Could it be that you were also stunned by the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's murderous aura?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Kang Fulu's expression grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood-Robed Sword Saint... he and I both come from the Hundred Countries. His strength is truly terrifying. I don't know where he killed so many people to cultivate such a powerful blood aura. Such a peerless killing god is probably quite antisocial. Ordinary people wouldn't dare to stay around him for long, fearing they might be killed by the Blood-Robed Sword Saint at any moment."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen was at a loss for words. </p><p></p><p>He had no idea how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Kang Fulu: "Senior Brother, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint is actually a very nice person. He's not interested in young people like you, he only likes killing old people."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu rolled his eyes at Qi Yuan. He had seen the Blood-Robed Sword Saint kill geniuses like dogs. What would Qi Yuan, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, know about the Blood-Robed Sword Saint?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you two go practice cultivation," he said, not bothering to argue with Qi Yuan anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Qi Yuan didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he had some insights into the Solar True Fire. </p><p></p><p>This time, he planned to fully comprehend the Solar True Fire in one go.</p><p></p><p>Following Qi Yuan, Xu Tongchen entered the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>This time entering the dwelling, his attitude was very different from before.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although he treated Qi Yuan as an equal, the pride of being in the top thirty of the Genius Rankings would still occasionally surface.</p><p></p><p>But now, that pride had completely vanished, replaced only by reverence and fear.</p><p></p><p>"Summon the Solar True Fire. I must comprehend it this time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the boss speak, Xu Tongchen hurriedly summoned the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression suddenly became serious and solemn as he entered a state of focus.</p><p></p><p>The Solar True Fire before him was dark inside and bright outside, emitting a golden light.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Solar True Fire, Qi Yuan felt as if he was inside a sun.</p><p></p><p>Within the sun, powerful flames burned wildly, as if they could incinerate everything.</p><p></p><p>Those flames seemed to notice Qi Yuan's arrival and burned even more vigorously, appearing more lively.</p><p></p><p>It was like a daughter meeting her godfather.</p><p></p><p>"Solar True Fire, you are my Solar True Fire," Qi Yuan murmured, repeating it.</p><p></p><p>Within the sun, a strand of Solar True Fire danced with extreme excitement, suddenly flying out and landing in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, a flame flickering in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a delighted expression: "I've comprehended the Solar True Fire!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen was shocked, but remembering that the person before him was the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, his shock lessened somewhat: "Congratulations, Senior! Felicitations, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was now also somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>For a Purple Mansion powerhouse who had comprehended an Origin Divine Ability, why bother learning his Solar True Fire? Even if mastered, it would only be a powerful ordinary divine ability, only useful for killing Divine Infant realm cultivators, and completely useless against other Purple Mansion realm peers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were just thoughts. He wouldn't dare ask them out loud.</p><p></p><p>"You've worked hard these past days, but it's been mutually beneficial," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew that with Xu Tongchen by his side, the Solar True Fire would flourish.</p><p></p><p>The other party had also treated him like an old man.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... then this junior shall take his leave," Xu Tongchen said hesitantly, testing the waters.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Qi Yuan knew Xu Tongchen had recognized his identity, but he didn't care.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other's teacher was still a member of his music troupe.</p><p></p><p>He would have to bring him along when he went to encircle and kill Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Tongchen left, Qi Yuan entered the Divine Flower Society's jade slip again.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been posting on the Divine Flower Society forum, live streaming his plan to destroy Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>He had gained many people's approval.</p><p></p><p>This time, he logged into his main account and entered the chat group of the Four Emperors of Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the group, he saw Rogue Immortal Lord bragging.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know, Origin Venerable is a true big shot!"</p><p></p><p>"When I first met him, he was overly approachable. I thought he was a real newbie. But then Purple Mansion cultivators appeared and acted like dogs before Origin Venerable! I was completely shocked! Origin Venerable is a true big shot!"</p><p></p><p>"Before Origin Venerable left, he asked me to record the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance. As a result, I was allowed to stand directly on stage during the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance performance. If there weren't so many people... no, if I hadn't remembered Origin Venerable's instructions, I really would have been unable to resist doing some strange things."</p><p></p><p>"This old lady saw at a glance that Origin Venerable was no ordinary person. I'm just waiting for Light Palace to be destroyed," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, you won't have to wait long. My plan to destroy Light Palace has reached its final stage. In a few days, I will go to destroy Light Palace," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Now, all of Light Palace's people had retreated to their headquarters.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Grand Master would return soon. He had to take them all out in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the big shot is here! Let me serve you tea!" Rogue Immortal Lord was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, you're here?" Great Sun Flame Emperor sent a message in the group.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then saw his private messages flashing.</p><p></p><p>It was from Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, are you really going to destroy Light Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the plan has been implemented. How could I leave it unfinished?" Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat curious why Great Sun Flame Emperor would private message him.</p><p></p><p>"Light Palace's strength is not ordinary. They have deep connections with a Yin God Venerable," Great Sun Flame Emperor warned.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Tathagata Buddha came, he couldn't stop me!" Qi Yuan said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Great Sun Flame Emperor knew Origin Venerable had made up his mind. He said,</p><p></p><p>"Your affair with Light Palace has caught the attention of the Divine Flower Society's upper echelons. I estimate that the Divine Flower Society's president has probably applied to add you as a friend on your Blood-Robed Sword Saint jade slip."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? I'll go check later and accept it."</p><p></p><p>He still had to give face to the forum moderator, the authority dog.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable... if a Yin God Venerable acts against you in the Light Palace matter, you can mention the name of Lord Feng. It might save you from danger once," Great Sun Flame Emperor hesitated, but finally said.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he wasn't optimistic about Origin Venerable being able to destroy Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>He feared Origin Venerable's temperament would offend that Yin God Venerable.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

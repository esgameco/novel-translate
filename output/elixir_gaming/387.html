        <h1>Chapter 387</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When Ice Mountain Domineering Sister wakes up, remember to tell her that I've reached the Purple Palace realm!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left a message in the Divine Flower Society group chat, then exited the group.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the paths of Divine Light Sect, all the cultivators, whether disciples or elders, looked at Qi Yuan with awe and reverence. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, Qi Yuan had now become a legendary figure in Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the senior brother?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard he's even stronger than Senior Brother Kang Fulu!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't Senior Brother Kang make it onto the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings?"</p><p></p><p>Some disciples exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Forget about the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings, even the Great Shang Genius Rankings were an unattainable existence for them.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Lands Genius Rankings are nothing. Senior Brother Qi Yuan has been on... the Canglan Genius Rankings!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What ranking is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, bet you didn't know. My uncle's nephew's brother told me he saw with his own eyes Qi Yuan mysteriously appear on the Canglan Genius Rankings!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it, it must be a rumor. Senior Brother Kang Fulu is Divine Light Sect's number one genius. He dares to... peek at junior sisters bathing!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan is the real deal. He dares to steal beautiful female elders' underwear!"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, these people started arguing heatedly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan felt helpless: "Hey, I've never stolen any beautiful female elder's underwear. Please don't spread rumors!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!" Those disciples hurriedly bowed their heads in greeting.</p><p></p><p>The female disciple who had spoken up for Qi Yuan earlier said proudly: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan didn't steal any beautiful female elder's underwear. The beautiful female elders delivered it themselves at night!"</p><p></p><p>She felt proud of her quick wit, lest Senior Brother Qi Yuan be portrayed as a thief.</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless. </p><p></p><p>Such things... seemed to have actually happened.</p><p></p><p>However, that was when he was cultivating the Five Elements Qi, causing some madness and chaos in Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>"You, you. Haven't seen you in three years, but you've made some progress and become an official disciple. Don't spread baseless rumors anymore! Official disciples are also the face of Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually said to this fan, then his figure dispersed and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young woman's eyes lit up with joy: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan... actually remembers me!"</p><p></p><p>Back then, she was an errand disciple at Divine Medicine Peak, specifically responsible for reception. When Senior Brother Qi Yuan went to Divine Medicine Peak seeking medicine, she was the one who received him and recommended he find Elder Xuanchong.</p><p></p><p>Later, Senior Brother Qi Yuan had pointed out issues with her body's cultivation, which she then resolved, increasing her cultivation and becoming an official disciple.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Returning to Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan was in quite a good mood.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Purple Palace realm, his status and class naturally had to be elevated. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't allow there to be any houses in Divine Light Sect more classy than his own.</p><p></p><p>Withered Wood True Lord had taken Qi Yuan's design plan and was already looking for people to start construction, building a small tower for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"With a small tower, it will finally match my status.</p><p></p><p>My wives can move in without worrying about not having their own private bedrooms!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was also his daughter Qi Jianjun who was always running around fishing randomly.</p><p></p><p>Now, his daughter Qi Jianjun had gone off somewhere unknown to fish.</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Wushen, he should still be in the upper realm. Calculating the time, he would descend to the lower realm after another period to pass on divine methods to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Shen Wushen, Qi Yuan's gaze couldn't help but turn towards the palace halls atop Seven-Colored Peak and that huge ancient Qichun tree.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen once said the letter would take three years to reach Jin Li's hands. Two and a half years have already passed..."</p><p></p><p>In another half year, Jin Li would receive his letter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mood rippled with faint waves.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the small figure of Moon Girl by July Lake, and the Empress Jin Li whom he had never met.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, an urgent voice rang out. Jiang Lingsu, dressed conservatively, flew quickly to Qi Yuan's side and tightly hugged his arm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's voice suddenly jolted Qi Yuan from his melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" he asked, "Why are you in such a hurry? Has the sky fallen or something?"</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan was a legendary Purple Palace great cultivator, he naturally had to have composure, remaining calm even if Mount Tai collapsed before him.</p><p></p><p>"My father is coming!" Jiang Lingsu said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The image of that enthusiastic uncle immediately appeared in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At that time, on the spirit boat, that uncle had been very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his grand plan, Qi Yuan had "tricked" everyone into uploading techniques to the Divine Flower Society, personally making up stories under the name Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Stories about having a humble background, being looked down upon by senior brothers, and receiving cold shoulders from others.</p><p></p><p>Then, uploading techniques to the Divine Flower Society, exchanging for powerful techniques, attracting countless admirers, cold senior sisters giving flirtatious glances, busty junior sisters sneaking to his room at night.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Jiang Ruhua had taken Origin Venerable's story as true, personally using his own experiences to guide Qi Yuan, advising him to choose the busty junior sister.</p><p></p><p>As for the busty junior sister's father not agreeing? Simply turn the rice into cooked rice, have the busty junior sister appear with a big belly, and her old fogey father would have no choice but to accept it with gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Sharing experiences with juniors and satisfying the desire to teach others was very enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>But... when that busty junior sister's father was himself, Jiang Ruhua couldn't hold it together anymore.</p><p></p><p>He stopped managing his businesses and directly moved to Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Qi Yuan had awakened, he immediately rushed over.</p><p></p><p>Hearing it was Jiang Ruhua, Qi Yuan also became a bit flustered: "We really should run, otherwise... it would be too awkward!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very socially anxious and didn't dare to face Jiang Ruhua again.</p><p></p><p>Meeting face to face would be so awkward.</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!" Qi Yuan picked up Jiang Lingsu and vanished into a blur.</p><p></p><p>Outside Seven-Colored Peak, Jiang Ruhua in blue robes looked at that streak of light in the sky and couldn't help cursing: "You little brat, why are you running!"</p><p></p><p>He wanted nothing more than to slash up there with his sword.</p><p></p><p>But his daughter was still there!</p><p></p><p>"You brat, even having me muted on the Divine Flower Society. No respect for elders at all!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua was indignant.</p><p></p><p>Originally he had planned to spread rumors on the Divine Flower Society forum, but who knew, as soon as he cursed Origin Venerable once, he was muted.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, miscalculation, miscalculation. Originally passed on dragon-slaying techniques to that kid, who knew I myself was the dragon!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Helan Province was located in the north of the Eastern Lands, ranking middle to lower among the thirteen provinces of the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on a tower, a man in a blood-red robe leaned against the railing, his gaze occasionally sweeping over the cultivators passing below, his eyes carrying a thoughtful look.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Jiang Lingsu held a communication jade slip, seemingly chattering away with someone, apparently complaining about something.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "I'm so hardworking and diligent."</p><p></p><p>After arriving in Helan Province, Qi Yuan had been using his eyes every day to "peep" at the cultivators of the world.</p><p></p><p>Anyone Foundation Establishment or above had a mark inside their body. His eyes would receive an information prompt each time he looked at a person's mark in a day.</p><p></p><p>So, he "peeped" at the marks inside people's bodies all over the world in order to find ways to remove and seal the marks.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately I was looking from far away, otherwise if I was on the subway, wouldn't I have been posted online?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very grateful that he lived in an era without subways. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with his high-intensity surveillance, he would definitely have been caught and labeled as a creepy guy taking secret photos.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was certainly not a creepy guy. Although he peeped, he only looked at the marks, never looking at even a tiny bit more.</p><p></p><p>In these days, he had seen so many marks, but hadn't gained much.</p><p></p><p>However, he did have some ideas and backup plans.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, how's it going?" Seeing that her senior brother was no longer focused on thinking about the problem, Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>Actually, she was bursting with the urge to complain right now, just waiting for Qi Yuan to finish his important business.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't know what her senior brother was doing, she was willing to be a listener.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding sealing the marks, I have two plans.</p><p></p><p>The first plan is to use my innate divine ability, the Great Forgetting Sutra, to chant sutras to the marks every day, making them forget they are poisonous.</p><p></p><p>The second plan is a bit cruel - kill all the people with marks. When people die, it's like a lamp going out, so wouldn't the marks disappear?</p><p></p><p>Finally, I'll establish an underworld, and let them be reborn in my underworld. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned for a moment. Looking at Qi Yuan, she said seriously, "Senior brother, did you really come up with these two...plans? They don't seem like something your brain would think of!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, never plagiarize!" Qi Yuan quibbled, but then immediately added, "These two plans both carry great risks. If there's even a slight mistake, sigh."</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, are you going to keep observing?" Jiang Lingsu asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"No more observing. I've finished looking at all the cultivators in Helan Prefecture. Let's take a break." Qi Yuan had naturally not just been looking at the cultivators wandering around the city.</p><p></p><p>He had peeped at all the Foundation Establishment and above cultivators in the entire Helan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you really know how to boast, even more than Qiong Yunting!" Jiang Lingsu rolled her eyes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if her senior brother had advanced to the Purple Palace realm, it was impossible for him to have looked at all the cultivators in Helan Prefecture with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>"What did your 'sister' boast about this time?" Qi Yuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the few days since arriving in Helan Prefecture, that painter had gone out and not returned.</p><p></p><p>So, Qi Yuan had stayed at the Jiang family's property in Helan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>One of Jiang Lingsu's "sisters" knew Jiang Lingsu had arrived and kept finding her to play. On the surface it was to play, but in reality, it was to "boast" about how amazing a Dao companion she had found.</p><p></p><p>At first, when that Qiong Yunting saw Qi Yuan, her eyes lit up, thinking he was Jiang Lingsu's sweetheart.</p><p></p><p>But later, when she heard Qi Yuan came from a small country that didn't even have Purple Palace realm cultivators, Qiong Yunting's bright eyes turned to disdainful ones.</p><p></p><p>She actually came to play with Jiang Lingsu, showing off her fiancé every day.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of damn sister!" Jiang Lingsu said angrily, "Her fiancé came out of seclusion and entered the Divine Infant realm."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you sisters?" Qi Yuan asked in surprise, "Didn't you get along well before?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled Jiang Lingsu and Qiong Yunting's previous meeting.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting praised Jiang Lingsu for having such a good figure despite eating so much, saying she was envious. She herself ate very little every day, still did figure management, weighed less than 100 jin, yet why didn't she have such a good figure? Jiang Lingsu also praised Qiong Yunting for being so cute and having such fair skin.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to be praising each other, getting along very well.</p><p></p><p>"How is that getting along well? Hmph, she's just a green tea bitch!" Jiang Lingsu said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The term "green tea bitch" was something Jiang Lingsu had learned from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan didn't think much about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, thinking too much would grow his brain.</p><p></p><p>Too tiring.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a coquettish voice came. A woman wearing a palace dress walked over: "Sister Lingsu, I knew you were here.</p><p></p><p>Oh my, that wine-red long dress really suits you today.</p><p></p><p>It's just a bit youthful. When you grow up a bit more and mature a bit, it will definitely look great!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had a kind smile on her face, but was actually gritting her teeth and sending a voice transmission to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"She's saying I'll look good when I grow up, but she's actually saying I don't look good now, saying I'm pretending to be mature!"</p><p></p><p>While sending the voice transmission, Jiang Lingsu said in a soft voice, "I can't compare to sister. At this age, you're still so cute.</p><p></p><p>This long dress is actually just ordinary. I think sister won't be able to wear it in this lifetime. If you wore it, it would be like a little girl wearing an overcoat, hard to tell front from back!</p><p></p><p>I'm still envious of sister, when you buy clothes, you don't have to consider size.</p><p></p><p>After killing some robber cultivators, you can even directly wear the male robbers' magic robes!"</p><p></p><p>The smile on Qiong Yunting's face froze slightly, then spread again as she said with a smile, "Although sister's background isn't as good as yours, I'm lucky to have found a good husband.</p><p></p><p>I don't care for those robber cultivators' magic robes anymore.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, this is also a worry. I now miss the times when I was poor. When I killed a robber cultivator and found dozens of spirit stones in their storage bag, I would be so happy.</p><p></p><p>Now that's not possible.</p><p></p><p>So, sigh, sister envies you. You can kill any robber cultivator, open their storage bag, and be happy for several days.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, sometimes being rich really isn't good. Many joys have disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting was speaking in a very pretentious manner.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was rolling her eyes wildly in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The other person was insulting her and her senior brother for being poor.</p><p></p><p>However, she still had a kind smile on her face, organizing her words to prepare a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan spoke up: "I just love killing robber cultivators. They are all my enemies, my true love! The ancients once said, 'Time passes like flowing water, never stopping day or night!' I hope my enemies are just like this saying, dying day and night without stopping, then giving me all their accumulations.</p><p></p><p>I'm too short on money, sigh, being poor is tough. I can't even afford to buy a piece of land."</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting was slightly stunned when she heard Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Because she didn't understand much of the content.</p><p></p><p>But she understood part of it, and felt some contempt in her heart.</p><p></p><p>People from small places really have limited knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Still short on money.</p><p></p><p>"How many spirit stones does Junior Brother Qi need? My husband's family in Yuntian City is considered to have some wealth. Casually taking out tens of thousands or over a hundred thousand spirit stones is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Considering my years of friendship with Lingsu, lending you some spirit stones is not an issue."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Qi Yuan's face was full of joy.</p><p></p><p>He really was short on money.</p><p></p><p>Short on money to buy land for the underworld, and short on money to buy star-arching.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, my husband is holding a Divine Infant Realm celebration banquet tonight. You two can casually prepare some gifts, say some nice words, and I'll whisper in my husband's ear. He'll definitely be able to lend you enough spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>With so many years of friendship between Lingsu and me, I wouldn't deceive you!"</p><p></p><p>"The sisterhood between you two is as deep as the sea!" Qi Yuan said happily, "With nothing else to do, it would be great to go to the Divine Infant Realm banquet and take a look, and borrow some money while we're at it."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan like this, Qiong Yunting felt even more smug in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she and her husband would play good cop bad cop, and casually give out a few thousand spirit stones to get rid of them.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you must definitely come to this Divine Infant Realm banquet. Many important figures from Helan Prefecture will be attending.</p><p></p><p>Your Jiang family's business in Helan Prefecture is in quite some trouble now, almost being driven out of Helan Prefecture. If you get to know some powerful great cultivators, you might be able to solve your Jiang family's troubles!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The supreme divine thunder fell into the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>All the divine infant cultivators in the Palace of Light were executed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out a recording stone and captured this scene.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Shenhua Forum doesn't allow posting images or videos. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the footage of the Palace of Light being struck by heavenly punishment and divine thunder leaked out, I could stand on the highest moral high ground.</p><p></p><p>Even the divine thunder couldn't resist striking you - is this Palace of Light still good?"</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't post videos, Qi Yuan thought he should still record it.</p><p></p><p>You never know when it might be able to spread.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the recording, Qi Yuan also prepared to leave the Wei Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still had many places to go.</p><p></p><p>There were still many alternate identities he hadn't revealed yet.</p><p></p><p>Although in some places, he simply threw the blood-colored long sword there to act as an alternate identity.</p><p></p><p>But it still wasn't enough. </p><p></p><p>He needed to cause chaos everywhere to make it seem like there were many people and forces, right?</p><p></p><p>He held the recording stone, and was about to leave amidst the divine thunder.</p><p></p><p>He saw many cultivators in the vast imperial palace looking up at him and bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>There were elders, young and strong men, and children.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving our Wei Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>"The Wei Kingdom will never forget senior's kindness!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the bloody battle of the hundred kingdoms, some kingdoms were willing to make peace, while others were not.</p><p></p><p>However, in front of the powerful Palace of Light, they had no ability to resist at all and could only become pawns.</p><p></p><p>The more severely they resisted the Palace of Light, the more they would fall into the demonic faction and sink completely.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the goodwill of many cultivators, Qi Yuan said loudly: "We cultivators who commit too many evil deeds will surely face heavenly punishment! You should do more good deeds in the future!"</p><p></p><p>After promoting some positive energy, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Only leaving behind a group of excited yet confused cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Bloodless City.</p><p></p><p>The blood crystal mine stretched for dozens of miles, and as far as the eye could see, there was a sea of blood red.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the graceful figure in front of him, a hint of tenderness flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia was in the blood crystal mine, picking up massive amounts of blood crystals one by one, hiding them somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan revealed an affectionate smile.</p><p></p><p>Feeding Little Jia always made him happy.</p><p></p><p>About an hour passed, and Little Jia walked out of the blood crystal mine and flew to Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>She tightly grasped Qi Yuan's sleeve, and the happy wooden sign slipped out of her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Eat as you like, the mine here is already my private property," Qi Yuan said generously.</p><p></p><p>The blood crystal mine in Bloodless City had already been taken over by True Lord Kumu for him.</p><p></p><p>Every day, many blood crystals would be sent to Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan had asked permission from the sect leader to come to Bloodless City to collect blood crystals.</p><p></p><p>In reality, most of the time, he wasn't staying in the mine.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his alternate identities were out killing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, others all thought he was in the mine.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go home, Little Jia," Qi Yuan said, holding Little Jia's hand as they left the blood crystal mine.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the blood crystal mine.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan had an anxious look on his face, while his granddaughter Duan Qianrou stood to the side, also with many thoughts in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, Liu Guan had participated in besieging the Black Chicken Demon, teaming up with a mysterious prodigy. In the end, his soul was injured and he fell unconscious, and was sent home by that mysterious prodigy.</p><p></p><p>He had always been curious about the identity of that mysterious prodigy.</p><p></p><p>After all, that prodigy was able to kill a late Foundation Establishment stage cultivator while only at the Foundation Establishment stage himself!</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather, is he really that person? What if he's not?" Duan Qianrou also recalled the young man her mother had encountered on the flying ship before.</p><p></p><p>Later when riding the cloud rabbit carriage, she had met that young man.</p><p></p><p>At the time she didn't think much of it, but looking back now, it might have been the one who destroyed Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan had a helpless expression: "Let's hope so..."</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou had a complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>This blood crystal mine was under her control.</p><p></p><p>Previously, a true disciple of the Demonic Desire Sect had used his power to pressure them, making the Duan family transport a portion of blood crystals to the Demonic Desire Sect regularly.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou naturally had to agree.</p><p></p><p>But later, the Divine Light Sect intervened and took all the blood crystal mines in Bloodless City for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Their blood crystals could only be provided to the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for that person from the Demonic Desire Sect, they had to cut him off.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that a few days ago, that true disciple from the Demonic Desire Sect would come knocking on their door.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou had already explained all the reasons clearly, but that person from the Demonic Desire Sect completely disregarded them, giving a deadline of a few days.</p><p></p><p>He even threatened that if they didn't hand them over, he would take them himself.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou had already reported this matter to the Divine Light Sect, but unfortunately the Divine Light Sect was far from here, and the person sent to handle it hadn't arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>Now, they were pinning their hopes on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The main gate of the blood crystal mine opened, and Qi Yuan appeared in a white robe, looking extraordinarily handsome and elegant.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia was in a big red blood-colored dress, obediently following behind him.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this scene was a bit creepy for Duan Qianrou.</p><p></p><p>But she still forced herself to say: "Greetings, Young Master Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept a glance at the two of them: "Why are you waiting for me here? What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Young Master, Ji Ruxue from the Demonic Desire Sect..." Duan Qianrou answered truthfully, while also paying attention to Qi Yuan's reaction.</p><p></p><p>After all, these true disciples of sects were high and mighty. For this kind of matter, not only might they not help, they might even blame them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at Duan Qianrou: "Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"It's absolutely true, this little one wouldn't dare deceive Young Master!" Now Duan Qianrou was extremely humble in front of Qi Yuan, completely different from her proud attitude when first facing Qi Yuan before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Duan Qianrou, hidden information appeared, confirming she wasn't lying. Qi Yuan said coldly: "I didn't expect someone would dare to come steal Little Jia's snacks, they're really too bold."</p><p></p><p>Ever since Qi Yuan viewed the Palace of Light as a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>He had rarely encountered small fry enemies.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was a small fry coming to steal Little Jia's snacks, so he naturally had to take action.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally stepping on small fries and changing flavors was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, always fighting divine infants and Purple Mansion stage cultivators would get boring after a while.</p><p></p><p>After all, even Old Biden would become dull after fighting too much.</p><p></p><p>It's better to mingle with young people to feel young himself.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why did those rich people in his previous life on Blue Star like college girls so much?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look and see just how big the guts of this Ji Ruxue from the Demonic Desire Sect are."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Duan Qianrou felt relieved inside, and a bit delighted.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qi Yuan took the lead, this matter could be resolved.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Bloodless City, the manor was located in a remote area, but was very luxurious.</p><p></p><p>Ji Ruxue's hair was as white as snow, and her appearance was even more attractive than her sister Ji Boying by several degrees.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her jade fingers were twirling her white hair, a smile on her face: "I didn't expect to come here and encounter the person that True Lord Fengnu specifically named to capture."</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Desire Sect was divided into two factions, one surnamed Ji, one surnamed Shen.</p><p></p><p>The Shen surname kept a low profile and was hardly seen.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Ji surname held the power in the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, the Demonic Desire Sect had colluded with the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Her sister Ji Boying was even sent to accompany that old man True Lord Liuqin.</p><p></p><p>At this time, beside Ji Ruxue, two divine infant cultivators had smiles in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingqiu smiled happily: "Qi Yuan is really bold, actually daring to go out alone.</p><p></p><p>This time, we will surely capture him and send him to True Lord Kumu!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Kang Fulu is very cautious now and won't leave the sect, we can only catch this... Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, his weight is still too light.</p><p></p><p>Even if we send him to True Lord Fengnu, he won't value us much even if he agrees to let our Demonic Desire Sect relocate away from the hundred kingdoms!" True Lord Ji Chu spoke, a hint of regret in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad to have someone to catch, yet you're still picky!" Ji Mingqiu said.</p><p></p><p>"The spies we sent out have already gotten news that he's heading this way and will arrive soon. It saves us the trouble of going to him proactively," Ji Ruxue said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The three people in the room were already sure of victory.</p><p></p><p>After all, with two divine infants and one Foundation Establishment cultivator, how could Qi Yuan resist? Even if Kang Fulu came instead it wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength was already giving Qi Yuan way too much credit.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes an incense stick to burn passed.</p><p></p><p>Outside the residence, Qi Yuan, Little Jia, Liu Guan and Duan Qianrou appeared.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou was about to knock on the door.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze stopped her, and he stepped forward, saying lazily: "The people inside the house, come out quickly, you've already been surrounded by me."</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou and Liu Guan looked at each other in dismay, but didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a light laugh came from inside the courtyard, and a woman with a head full of snow-white hair pushed open the door and came out. There was a relaxed smile in her eyes: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan has come here, do you have important matters to discuss?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ji Ruxue's relaxed demeanor, Duan Qianrou's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, she had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan also frowned.</p><p></p><p>Although Ji Ruxue was Ji Boying's sister, she was an illegitimate daughter with poor talent. In the Demonic Desire Sect, she was just an ordinary true disciple, not at all comparable to Qi Yuan who was the head disciple of a peak.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't she too confident?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed not to notice these things, and said bluntly: "I came here to notify you, if you forcibly steal my Little Jia's snacks, then go to hell to accompany your Ji family ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan killed at the drop of a hat.</p><p></p><p>Ji Ruxue was stunned.</p><p></p><p>She knew Qi Yuan had come to cause trouble for her. But how did it escalate to killing without a word?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately...</p><p></p><p>Ji Ruxue</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her face turned cold: "You want to kill me? You should worry about saving your own life first!"</p><p></p><p>As Ji Ruxue spoke, suddenly two extremely powerful auras permeated the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingqiu and Ji Chu, two Divine Infant stage cultivators, suddenly appeared. Their powerful auras surged, causing the spiritual energy in heaven and earth to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chu's eyes held a smile: "Worthy nephew, long time no see?"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Infants?"</p><p></p><p>With the sudden appearance of two Divine Infant cultivators, Duan Qianrou's face instantly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan was even more terrified, his eyes revealing an incredulous expression. </p><p></p><p>Had they gotten involved in a major conflict?</p><p></p><p>It was over, it was all over, they were all going to die here.</p><p></p><p>Facing the two Divine Infants, Qi Yuan remained very calm: "Sigh, I just wanted to deal with some small fries, why are some big fries so eager to come and die?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Chu and Ji Mingqiu were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingqiu said coldly: "As rumored, you're truly insane."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he immediately attacked.</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual power of a Divine Infant cultivator surged forth.</p><p></p><p>This was simply not something an Essence Core cultivator could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Liu Guan's back turned cold, his heart anxious and desperate.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, that mysterious protagonist had killed a late-stage Essence Core cultivator with one slash. Even if that person was Qi Yuan, it was enough to be considered a peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>But now they faced two Divine Infants, one of them even at mid-stage Divine Infant, on par with the sect master of Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>When such powerful experts attacked, it would surely be a thunderous move, leaving no survivors.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan yawned: "Indeed, Divine Infants from small places still can't compare to those from big places."</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense the gap between the Divine Infants before him and the Divine Infant cultivator from the Palace of Light he had killed that day at Lingfeng Crossing.</p><p></p><p>The gap was large, but they were equally weak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lightly pointed his finger, and a broken sword condensed out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Facing Ji Mingqiu's attack, he gently thrust the broken sword forward.</p><p></p><p>"To kill you, why would I need divine abilities?"</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the broken sword swept through Ji Mingqiu's attack like sweeping away dead leaves and rotten wood. The sword continued forward, forcefully breaking through Ji Mingqiu's protective spiritual energy and landing on his Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant shattered instantly, more fragile than a balloon.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingqiu's eyes widened. He hadn't even reacted before... he died.</p><p></p><p>A mighty mid-stage Divine Infant, one of the strongest in Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>Just like that... he died?</p><p></p><p>Ji Chu's eyes nearly popped out, revealing an expression of disbelief: "You're not Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>The scene before him was too terrifying and exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he immediately used a divine ability to escape.</p><p></p><p>However, his escape was like a turtle's pace to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Die." Qi Yuan spoke, as if his words became reality.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chu, a mighty Divine Infant, inexplicably exploded, dying as thoroughly as possible.</p><p></p><p>Two Divine Infant cultivators, in the span of a single breath, had all perished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Ruxue's face was full of terror. She kept backing away, when suddenly her neck twisted, and she also died here.</p><p></p><p>Three enemies, all resolved in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened so suddenly and hastily.</p><p></p><p>It was as if those who died weren't Divine Infant True Lords, but... Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Liu Guan's eyes widened, unable to believe what he saw.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Qi Yuan a disciple of Seven-Colored Peak?</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly... kill two Divine Infants? Even the sect master of Shenguang Sect couldn't do this, right?</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, completely unable to comprehend the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>As for Duan Qianrou, she lay on the ground, seemingly knocked unconscious by the battle's aftermath.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, people are killed, time to go. Stop pretending to be unconscious." Qi Yuan glanced at Duan Qianrou.</p><p></p><p>This act of feigning unconsciousness was too poor, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Only then did Duan Qianrou get up.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes full of fear.</p><p></p><p>That's right, fear.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Duan Qianrou's voice carried a slight tremor.</p><p></p><p>"Why call me senior, am I that old? Call me... Young Master Qi Yuan." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Duan Qianrou's gums trembled, not knowing what fate awaited her.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had rashly witnessed such a terrifying event, and were very likely to be silenced.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Liu Guan: "You're quite a decent person."</p><p></p><p>Back when they were ambushing the Black Chicken Demon, no one was willing to team up with him, a Qi Refining cultivator, except Liu Guan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Guan thought of something and his heart leapt with joy.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... it was really him?</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry, I'm not a bloodthirsty person," Qi Yuan said casually. "You just need to swear on your heart demon that you won't reveal today's events in any way, and this matter will be over."</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Palace of Light had not yet been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he still needed to keep his true strength hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, if I reveal even a bit of today's events, may I die a horrible death!" Liu Guan quickly swore after speaking.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou also hurriedly swore.</p><p></p><p>Both of them felt as if they had narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, their gazes towards Qi Yuan carried deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>What happened today was like a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, people are killed, I need to return to the peak." After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he left with Little Jia. Before leaving, he looked at Liu Guan, "Compared to before, you're not as weak now. If you had fainted today, I would have had to send you away."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan and Little Jia's figures disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only Liu Guan and Duan Qianrou were left, their hearts unable to calm for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Duan Qianrou looked at Liu Guan: "Grandfather, was it really him?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes... absolutely!" Liu Guan's eyes burst with intense light.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan killing a late-stage Essence Core cultivator at Foundation Establishment was still understandable.</p><p></p><p>But this scene today exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan was actually a reincarnated deity? Only this could explain it!</p><p></p><p>What an enormous stroke of luck was this? His heart was shocked.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, his emotions finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Qianrou, don't mention moving away anymore in the future.</p><p></p><p>We will share the fate of Great Shang! Collect more blood crystals, next time I'll personally deliver them to Shenguang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>With such a huge opportunity, how could they not hold on tightly?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan returned to Seven-Colored Peak, he received a summons from the sect master.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan stood in the main hall of the sect, looking at True Lord Kumo, and slowly said: "What matter does the sect master have for me?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he also glanced at Kang Fulu beside True Lord Kumo.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu had now entered the Essence Core realm.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Do you still remember the Eastern Lands Genius Competition I mentioned some days ago?" True Lord Kumo spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I remember."</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Lands Genius Competition has suddenly been moved up, it will begin in just a month or two.</p><p></p><p>This time, you and Kang Fulu will go together to participate." True Lord Kumo said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>So soon?</p><p></p><p>"How long will it take for the Eastern Lands Genius Competition to produce results?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was in a hurry to complete his great undertaking of destroying the Palace of Light, where would he find time to participate in some genius competition.</p><p></p><p>"At shortest half a month, at longest several years, there's no definite conclusion on this matter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's face fell: "Can I not go?"</p><p></p><p>True Lord Kumo was stunned, he looked at Qi Yuan without speaking further, but his expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu then said gently: "Has junior brother Qi Yuan encountered some trouble? Feel free to speak up, we'll help you resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"I was just preparing to destroy the Palace of Light, I don't have time to participate in this genius competition." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, no one believed what he said, so he might as well tell the truth.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as soon as he finished speaking, the gentle smile on Kang Fulu's face froze.</p><p></p><p>Your trouble is truly troublesome, you really dare to say it!</p><p></p><p>True Lord Kumo looked at Qi Yuan and said coldly: "This Eastern Lands Genius Competition will be held in Cuiyun Prefecture, not far from the Palace of Light. It won't delay your destruction of... the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>He emphasized the last four words, expressing his inner emotions.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's face lit up with joy: "In that case, sect master, rest assured. When I destroy the Palace of Light, I'll definitely participate in the genius competition along the way and achieve a good result!"</p><p></p><p>Since it was on the way, it wouldn't affect his destruction of the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>True Lord Kumo looked at Qi Yuan with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Eastern Lands Genius Competition to be moved up either.</p><p></p><p>You've only recently entered Foundation Establishment, your cultivation hasn't improved much.</p><p></p><p>For the Eastern Lands Genius Competition, you don't need to achieve too good a result, just do your best."</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Eastern Lands Genius Competition wouldn't have been so rushed, and with Qi Yuan's talent, there would have been time to improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, with its sudden start, Qi Yuan's strength hadn't improved much, making the hope of entering the top 100 even more remote.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Kumo could only place all his hopes on his son-in-law Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>"Sect master, don't worry. The treasure you gave me last time has been very useful to me.</p><p></p><p>This time, I'll definitely bring back your clan's treasure no matter what!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Kumo smiled helplessly: "When you go to the Eastern Lands this time, don't reveal your identities. There's a Divine Infant steward in the Palace of Light who seems to be hostile towards you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The sect master must be referring to True Lord Feng Nu?</p><p></p><p>He's long dead.</p><p></p><p>The news will probably spread in a few days.</p><p></p><p>Thank you ←God Without Tears for the repeated three thousand reward; thank you Golden-Winged Ancestor Dragon for the three thousand reward, thank you Li Muzi, AISLAND, Looking Up at the Stars 2020, Montpellier is Number One in the World, Sun Quan's Heavy Schemes, Street Lamp in the Rainy Night, Cloud Poor, Wind Seeking, East Wind Blowing Leaves 12, Gennr, Reader 20210110161752304, Reader 20180609000331862 for the rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, the thick phlegm transformed into a five-colored gas.</p><p></p><p>Jin Zu took the gas, gave a few instructions to Xiao LÃ¼, and then led Qi Yuan deeper inside.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, all the coffin lids in this place suddenly lifted.</p><p></p><p>One by one, human-shaped spiritual beings sat up, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>A rugged man spoke, his words tinged with a hint of amazement: "Unexpectedly, he has already stepped into the Divine Realm, truly a heaven-gifted talent, second only to Yu."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards Yu.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land, the only two peak experts of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there are only three peak experts of the Divine Realm in the world.</p><p></p><p>Yu, dressed in white robes covered in feathers, had an exceptionally handsome appearance, like a beautiful and peerless goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Given a few thousand years, he may even become a Divine Realm Overlord, what a pity." Yu's voice was extremely gentle, leaning towards a feminine tone.</p><p></p><p>"If he can achieve something in the Five Elements Tempering Land within three hundred years, combined with the blessing of the Empress of the Bridal Robe, he may be able to display the combat power of a Divine Realm Overlord."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm Overlord, the strongest power beneath the Divine Realm peak, is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p><p></p><p>However, the person who mentioned the Empress of the Bridal Robe caused many in the audience to have a glimmer in their eyes, as if they had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Deity was once able to dominate the world, and the Empress of the Bridal Robe played a significant role.</p><p></p><p>If they could obtain the Empress of the Bridal Robe, the combat power they could display would be at least that of an Overlord, and they might even be able to display the power of a Divine Realm peak.</p><p></p><p>If Yu and Long Pan were to obtain her, they might even be able to display power surpassing the Heavenly Deity.</p><p></p><p>Facing the demonic forces from the outside world, their grasp would also be enhanced.</p><p></p><p>However, they also understood that the Empress of the Bridal Robe was not so easily obtained.</p><p></p><p>Yu spoke softly, "No infighting."</p><p></p><p>In his gentle voice, there was a hint of admonition.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew Yu's character; the fewer words he spoke, the more significant the matter.</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent, hiding their secret thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the green-robed young lady couldn't help but say, "That Clothing Sect Master, his intentions are sinister. He wants to... control the Five Elements Forbidden Land!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" The rugged man heard this and was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The green-robed young lady quickly told the gathered group about the events that had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expressions of these people varied.</p><p></p><p>"Completely controlling the Five Elements Forbidden Land, his ambition is not small."</p><p></p><p>"This kid, could it be that he's an ingrate, siding with the demonic forces from the outside world?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Five Elements Forbidden Land is controlled by an outsider, we may be individually destroyed by the demonic forces from the outside world before the Demon Slaying Assembly in three hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"You're overthinking too much. With the Five Ancestors present, what do you have to fear? Do you really think that kid's talent... is stronger than the Heavenly Deity, and can gain the approval of the Five Ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>In the Five Elements Forbidden Land, there are the Gold Ancestor, Wood Ancestor, Water Ancestor, Fire Ancestor, and Earth Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>These Five Ancestors are the key to controlling the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>It is because of these Five Ancestors that the Five Elements Forbidden Land has not been invaded by the demonic forces from the outside world, unlike the Clothing Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>The group discussed the matter for a while, all feeling that it was somewhat ridiculous and not to be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>The rugged man sorted out his thoughts and said to the green-robed young lady, "Little Green, I know you're concerned about Gold Ancestor, but don't be afraid. That kid, even if his talent is extraordinary, he won't be able to truly control the Five Elements Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had one more thing he didn't say, that even if the Clothing Sect Master controlled the Five Elements Forbidden Land and had terrifying talent, they would still lack the foundation to face the demonic forces from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>What they lacked was not only talent, but also the accumulation of time, and the... diversity of the world.</p><p></p><p>Little Green heard this and her eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>That's right, that guy might just be boasting.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a reincarnation of the Heavenly Deity, he couldn't say he could control the Five Elements Forbidden Land from the hands of the Five Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>It's not about strength, but about talent!...</p><p></p><p>Following Gold Ancestor, Qi Yuan arrived near the Five Elements Tempering Land.</p><p></p><p>Gold Ancestor said, "The Five Elements Tempering Land has the Gold Essence, Wood Essence, and the other five essences.</p><p></p><p>These five essences contain the Qi of the five elements, which can assist us in our cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Slaying the five souls required can be used to comprehend the divine realm and improve one's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Each divine realm expert or celestial domain expert has relatively singular attributes, and the cultivation techniques they practice may only align with one or two of the five elements.</p><p></p><p>This allows them to cultivate more efficiently.</p><p></p><p>It's similar to how cultivators with pure spiritual roots can cultivate faster than those with mixed spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>If one tries to cultivate all five elements, their progress will be greatly hindered.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, those who can reach the divine realm mostly cultivate a single attribute, with only a few cultivating multiple attributes.</p><p></p><p>As for celestial deities, they are rare, with gold being the primary element and the other four as secondary.</p><p></p><p>"To what extent do I need to reach in order to control the five element forbidden lands?" Qi Yuan asked the question he cared most about.</p><p></p><p>"The five element forbidden lands have five patriarchs. If you can perfect the gold attribute, you will earn my recognition. </p><p></p><p>Mastering the water attribute will earn you the water patriarch's recognition.</p><p></p><p>Once you have perfected all five elements, you will become the lord of the forbidden lands!" the gold patriarch said.</p><p></p><p>This condition is extremely difficult, even for a celestial deity, requiring hundreds of years to perfect the gold attribute alone.</p><p></p><p>Mastering all five elements? The Slaughter Demon Assembly has already ended.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not all experts are suited to the other elements, even if they have slain the five souls, they may not be able to obtain the powers of the five elements.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." Qi Yuan was filled with enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just like collecting fragments in a game? </p><p></p><p>Once all five fragments are gathered, you can exchange them to become the lord of the forbidden lands.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he held the hand of his little wife and looked at the gold patriarch: "I'm going."</p><p></p><p>The gold patriarch watched Qi Yuan enter, reminding him cheerfully, "In the five element trial grounds, there may also be some geniuses of the five element forbidden lands. If you encounter them, you should cooperate with each other."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Qi Yuan responded, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a water shadow appeared, transforming into a woman - the water patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Gold Patriarch, do you think he can gather all five elements?" the newcomer asked.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Patriarch shook his head and said, "I hope he can.</p><p></p><p>Then, during the Slaughter Demon Assembly, we will have another peak divine realm expert.</p><p></p><p>That would give us more confidence."</p><p></p><p>The Water Patriarch sighed, "It's just more confidence, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you all just want him to become the lord of the forbidden lands? Even if he does, he may not be able to defeat the evil demons from the outer realms. </p><p>And we? We'll be the ones who end up dead!" A raging fire flared up, and the irritable Fire Patriarch appeared.</p><p></p><p>"We have already perished, only a wisp of lingering will remains. How can we die again?" the Wood Patriarch, barefoot, emanated a peaceful and reviving aura.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, you old immortal, why did you have to bring that up? I had just managed to forget the fact that I'm already dead, and you had to remind me of it! Now I won't be able to sleep tonight!" The Fire Patriarch cursed and ran off in a huff.</p><p></p><p>The remaining patriarchs in the room exchanged glances, their thoughts not entirely aligned.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the five element trial grounds, Qi Yuan held his little wife's hand and looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"These monsters are not high-level, only around levels 40-50, and the experts are around levels 70-80, no, there are even some level 90s."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the five element monsters, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to establish my Heavenly Dao foundation, wouldn't my cultivation be unstable?</p><p></p><p>If I were to refine this five element power and transform it into five element qi, wouldn't I be able to reconstruct my cultivation base?</p><p></p><p>If I succeed, wouldn't my foundation be far superior to those of my peers?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was thinking that his Heavenly Dao foundation seemed to lack a solid base, and if he could fill it with the five element powers, perhaps he could re-establish his earth, water, wind, and fire foundations.</p><p></p><p>If he could find a desolate planet, maybe he could rebuild his foundations from the ground up.</p>

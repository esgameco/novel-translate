        <h1>Chapter 531</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Several bandits rushed forward, surrounding Qi Yuan, Liu Chuchun, and the others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes were not filled with fear, but rather a carefree contentment.</p><p></p><p>"If I had an abnormal thought process, I would definitely say, why only kill the men and not the women?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" the one-armed bandit roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding bandits wielding large knives suddenly started hacking at the horses of Qi Yuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>These bandits were all Mysterious-rank Armored Soldiers, considered elite members within the Blood Cloud Bandits, serving as squad leaders.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with ordinary passing merchants would be easy for them.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun's face showed a look of disgust. </p><p></p><p>She had always detested these evil and sinful bandits.</p><p></p><p>With her signal, the two Judgment Enforcers in black robes behind her acted in unison.</p><p></p><p>A sword beam flashed, and the four attacking bandits were immediately torn apart, their bodies and heads separated.</p><p></p><p>Between Earth-rank and Mysterious-rank Armored Soldiers, there was an insurmountable chasm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this scene and a trace of regret flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the people weren't killed by me. It's a bit of a waste." </p><p></p><p>Although these few were weak, their experience was still experience, right? Liu Chuchun kept her eyes on Qi Yuan, her gaze gentle: "Big Brother Qi, your heart is too kind. These people deserved to die, you don't need to be saddened by their deaths."</p><p></p><p>She mistook Qi Yuan's regret for sadness.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the one-armed bandit's gaze suddenly changed: "Two Earth-rank Armored Soldiers?"</p><p></p><p>His mind was quick, rapidly turning.</p><p></p><p>"How about we call it a day, gentlemen?" the one-armed bandit said fearlessly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew they were from the Blood Cloud Bandits.</p><p></p><p>Out on the road, those Armored Soldiers would usually show them some face, fearing them.</p><p></p><p>Now, their people would have a hard time slaying those two Earth-rank Armored Soldiers, so it was better to call a truce.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing happened often. </p><p></p><p>Out on the road, although they should seek vengeance, it's better to avoid injury if possible.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young Miss Zhao's eyes were filled with panic, and she immediately broke down in tears, the tears falling like rain. Her expression was lonely and helpless, eliciting pity: "Please save us, they are the Blood Cloud Bandits, and also people of Lord Liu!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun's eyes flashed with a trace of compassion, and she said in a lofty manner to Qi Yuan: "You see, these helpless victims are the ones worthy of our mercy, these bandits are not worth regretting their deaths."</p><p></p><p>After "educating" Qi Yuan, Liu Chuchun felt a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the one-armed bandit, her voice cold: "All Blood Cloud Bandits must die!"</p><p></p><p>The two Judgment Enforcers beside her immediately left their horses, their long swords in hand, charging into the Blood Cloud Bandits.</p><p></p><p>Swords flashed, blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>The two Judgment Enforcers entered a realm of no one, giving these bandits no chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike severed a bandit's knife and body, another beheaded another bandit.</p><p></p><p>In just dozens of breaths, these bandits were cleared away like weeds.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed bandit, seeing the situation turn grim, wielded his knife and fled hastily.</p><p></p><p>The two Judgment Enforcers were entangled by the remaining bandits, and with the one-armed bandit also being an Earth-rank Armored Soldier, it was difficult to catch up to him.</p><p></p><p>In the end, all the bandits were slain, only the one-armed bandit escaped.</p><p></p><p>The old master and young Miss Zhao had an expression of having survived a calamity.</p><p></p><p>Especially the young Miss Zhao, her snow-white face still had two tear tracks, her eyes brimming with water, extremely delicate, able to evoke a strong protective instinct, of course, for the "lowly men", it would be a frenzy of ravaging.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, heroes, this old man has a small gift, please accept it!" The old master Zhao bowed deeply, his posture very low.</p><p></p><p>He produced three thousand taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Not much, but not little either.</p><p></p><p>"Upholding justice without seeking reward is our principle." Liu Chuchun spoke, directly refusing.</p><p></p><p>She didn't lack money.</p><p></p><p>The Judgment organization also didn't lack funds.</p><p></p><p>So she directly refused.</p><p></p><p>What she admired the most was the God of Judgment from a century ago.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old master Zhao was somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his smile grew even brighter: "Miss, your lofty character, unbound by worldly things, is admirable!"</p><p></p><p>Since she didn't like gold and silver, she must like to hear pretty words.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun nodded, looking in the direction the one-armed bandit had fled: "It's a pity... one got away. Big Brother Qi, this matter has been satisfactorily resolved, we should be going now."</p><p></p><p>The old master Zhao and the young Miss Zhao both heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan spoke: "The matter is not yet over."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Liu Chuchun was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"There are still evil people who haven't been killed." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"That person is an Earth-rank Armored Soldier, he ran too fast, we couldn't catch up." Liu Chuchun said, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm referring to these two." Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the old master Zhao and the young Miss Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The young Miss Zhao's delicate face turned deathly pale, about to cry again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, one of the silent Judgment Enforcers spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, before we arrived, they were already loudly calling for help, and also... pointed out the connection between the bandits and the bloodstained ones, they were afraid the bandits would spare us."</p><p></p><p>The other Judgment Enforcer also spoke: "During our battle with the bandits, they were preparing to flee, and only when they saw us gaining the absolute upper hand did they choose to stay."</p><p></p><p>"No, the noble ones are wronging us... the young miss only cried out in fear." The young Miss Zhao was on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>The old master Zhao hurriedly said, "Xingyu was at a loss for words, causing trouble for the noble ones, it is our..."</p><p></p><p>They quickly apologized and admitted their mistakes, their attitude extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun narrowed her eyes, thoughtfully considering: "Being frightened and losing one's wits is also normal."</p><p></p><p>"Chuchun, if we were just ordinary people, then... it would have been us who died." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>One of the Judgment Enforcers also said softly, "We came here without revealing our auras, indistinguishable from ordinary people, yet they chose to call for help... what intentions do they have, do you need to wonder?"</p><p></p><p>The young Miss Zhao and the old master Zhao turned deathly pale, loudly claiming their innocence.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun was somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"If only the God of Judgment was still here, then we would know their true intentions." Liu Chuchun sighed.</p><p></p><p>Now, all these words were just subjective judgments.</p><p></p><p>Even if reasonable, they were still just conjectures.</p><p></p><p>She had already believed Qi Yuan and the Judgment Enforcers, but without proof, she couldn't get over that mental hurdle.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as she finished speaking, a flash of light appeared.</p><p></p><p>The heads of the old master Zhao and the young Miss Zhao fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes still held expressions of extreme terror and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun's gaze suddenly fell on Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with disbelief: "Did you kill them?"</p><p></p><p>She was a bit dazed. Qi Yuan, who didn't even want to kill ants, had just killed these two? "Towards kind ants, I am very gentle. Towards evil people, I never hold back my hand." Qi Yuan said righteously.</p><p></p><p>This demeanor had a touch of the feeling that stray animals are the real family.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchun looked deeply at Qi Yuan, a slight knot forming in her heart, but she took a deep breath and said, "Big Brother Qi, you acted rashly, you should have clarified the facts before killing."</p><p></p><p>But the people were already dead, so she didn't dwell on it further.</p><p></p><p>It's just that other thoughts began to emerge in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the judgment outpost.</p><p></p><p>Chichang Le's eyes were filled with anger: "Now, I'm afraid that a third of the suffering in Dingbo Prefecture is caused by this Blood Cloud Bandit."</p><p></p><p>Wang An nodded: "In this Dingbo Prefecture, who doesn't know that the mastermind behind the Blood Cloud Bandit is the Blood-Handed, that is, the Duke of Dingyuan?"</p><p></p><p>The original Dingbo Prefecture, although it did not reach the level of "doors unbolted at night and everyone having meat to eat", bandits and thieves absolutely did not dare to be as rampant as they are now.</p><p></p><p>The Duke of Dingyuan came to suppress the bandits, but he was not suppressing the Blood Cloud Bandit, but the Liu family instead.</p><p></p><p>"If I were the patriarch of the Liu family, I would now dispatch troops to annihilate the Blood Cloud Bandit!" Liu Chuchong couldn't help but say angrily.</p><p></p><p>Chichang Le shook his head and said, "The court has sent the Duke of Dingyuan to suppress the bandits, this bandit... Except for the Duke of Dingyuan... Who dares to suppress them? To suppress the bandits? This is to go against the court!"</p><p></p><p>Wang An's face darkened when he heard this: "The officials and bandits are in cahoots, but... Every now and then, there are bandit heads presented as military achievements."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchong gritted her teeth when this was mentioned. She had already heard about this.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Cloud Bandit would burn, kill, and plunder, slaughtering villagers and some merchants, collecting their heads, and then sending them to the generals under the Duke of Dingyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not bring up these matters, we don't want to scare Brother Qi." Chichang Le said.</p><p></p><p>Rather than saying it scared Brother Qi, it would be more accurate to say that aside from making oneself feel frustrated and unable to find relief, there was no other benefit.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the current power of the judgment, could they change the situation? No, they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"If only the God of Judgment were still here, with the crimes of the Blood Cloud Bandit and the Duke of Dingyuan, they would definitely be judged by the God of Judgment a hundred years ago!" Liu Chuchong said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually said, "Without the God of Judgment, there is still judgment. As long as everyone works hard, the days will become more hopeful."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the stronghold of the Blood Cloud Bandit.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed bandit knelt on the ground, his face full of fear, with beads of sweat on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you capture them?"</p><p></p><p>The young long-haired man spoke up, standing quietly and playing with a exquisite bone knife in his hand. This bone knife was made from the bones of a beauty, and it was the young man's most prized possession.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master... They were rescued by a group of people, among them were two mid-level Imperial Guards, I was no match for them!" The one-armed bandit groveled on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was the adopted son of Liu Supervisor. Even the leader of the Blood Cloud Bandit had to show him respect. As a mere small-time leader, the other party could kill him if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"Was it General Li's subordinates, or someone else?" Liu Wen asked.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." The one-armed bandit shook his head.</p><p></p><p>A dangerous look flashed in Liu Wen's eyes: "If you don't know, then what use do I have for you!"</p><p></p><p>The bone knife flew, the one-armed bandit clutched his neck, blood gushing out, his breath gradually fading until it ceased.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Imperial Guards were unfazed by this sight.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wen stood up, drew out the bone knife, and wiped the blood off it.</p><p></p><p>He looked at a burly man beside him and spoke calmly, "Seventh Captain, how was the harvest this time?"</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Captain's face showed a troubled expression: "Young Master Liu, this time we only got three hundred... heads."</p><p></p><p>"Heads" was a special term used among the Blood Cloud Bandit and the Duke of Dingyuan's army, referring to bandit heads that could be exchanged for military achievements.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred? Too few." Liu Wen's gaze was deep, "In half a month, you take people and wipe out the Xiaoliang Village."</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Captain's face changed slightly: "Xiaoliang Village is not far from General Li Zhao's camp, if we wipe it out... General Li Zhao's face won't look good."</p><p></p><p>"That's exactly what I want, for him to lose face, actually daring to snatch my woman!" Liu Wen's eyes flashed with a trace of fury, and he kicked the table over with one foot.</p><p></p><p>However, the fury dissipated quickly, and Liu Wen's eyes regained a gentle smile: "I'm not unreasonable, the heads from Xiaoliang Village can all be sent to Li Zhao as military achievements."</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Captain broke out in a cold sweat. These officials really had black hearts.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't give him a good beating, he'll really think this world was conquered by his group of ruffians? It was conquered by my ancestors!" Liu Wen said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Only two strongholds were found, the efficiency is too slow."</p><p></p><p>Five days had passed, Qi Yuan was a bit leisurely.</p><p></p><p>The dispatched drones had entered the mountains and found two strongholds of the Blood Cloud Bandit so far. The main stronghold had not yet been found.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Qi Yuan would have gone to suppress the bandits right now.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, just wait a little longer." Qi Yuan was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the series of copper coins on the table, and a strange look flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The copper coins were stained with a lot of sweat odor.</p><p></p><p>These copper coins were given to Qi Yuan by Wang An.</p><p></p><p>Just today, Wang An was unloading cargo at the dock and accidentally bumped into the steward of a wealthy family. That arrogant steward threatened to have Wang An drowned in the sea.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan secretly lent a hand to Wang An, causing the steward to accidentally drown himself.</p><p></p><p>Wang An knew that Qi Yuan had helped him, so he took out the silver he had saved to thank Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These were all small matters.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Qi Yuan the most was that his faint Mandate of Heaven had actually increased because of this incident.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, do you know what kind of situation can increase the Mandate of Heaven?" Qi Yuan took out the Divine Wood Token and asked the staff member of the Thorn of Blood again.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the staff member of the Thorn of Blood was like an AI, answering questions readily.</p><p></p><p>"My name has the 'Wei' character, but I'm not called 'Hey'."</p><p></p><p>Well, in Qi Yuan's view, the staff member of the Thorn of Blood would sometimes pretend to be human and say some words with emotional tones. </p><p></p><p>But after that, they would still return to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"Well... There are generally three reasons.</p><p></p><p>The first is that you have devoured the Mandate of Heaven of other Mandate of Heaven bearers;</p><p></p><p>The second is that you have obtained some special treasures.</p><p></p><p>The third is that you have changed the original fate trajectory of some people.</p><p></p><p>However, not every change in the fate trajectory of people qualifies to increase your Mandate of Heaven, otherwise all the Mandate of Heaven bearers in this world would be trying to change the fate of others, right?</p><p></p><p>Only some special people, some specific events can qualify."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>These special people, special events, were the kind that would be recorded in history books and tested in exams.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that by saving Wang An, he had changed the fate? "How special?" But Qi Yuan still asked.</p><p></p><p>"Those that can be recorded in the 'Blue Mountain Book' are considered special events."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what does that mean?" At this time, the submerged Yiwu Run asked with doubt.</p><p></p><p>She had a hundred thousand questions in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The "Blue Mountain Book" records some special events, and as long as you change them, you can increase your Mandate of Heaven?</p><p></p><p>Then these special events... are they events that have not yet happened?</p><p></p><p>Only events that have not yet happened, that are about to happen, can be changed, right?</p><p></p><p>But how can the "Blue Mountain Book" record future events?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

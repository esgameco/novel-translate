        <h1>Chapter 560</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two perplexed ancestral gods and casually said, "Your knowledge is still too limited."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever heard of wave-particle duality?"</p><p></p><p>"In a world called the Blue Star, many ordinary men and women have mastered this skill."</p><p></p><p>"I can be the Yin God, the Realm Lord, or even the Purple Palace... Why can't I coexist?"</p><p></p><p>It's just like the Tang Nui inequality - accepting a gift does not mean agreeing.</p><p></p><p>I am the Realm Lord, but that does not mean I am only the Realm Lord, I can also be the Purple Palace! You cannot define me!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao were even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Has Qi Yuan's brain been cultivated to madness?</p><p></p><p>At this point, this is the only explanation.</p><p></p><p>But they could not ponder too much, as a vast and mighty aura swept through at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, fifteen majestic figures descended from the heavens above, each emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these fifteen people, Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao's faces tensed.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Gods!</p><p></p><p>The Yang Gods of the Black Heaven and Black Earth have arrived! Fifteen mighty Yang Gods hovered in the sky, their might shaking the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Such a large-scale battle was rarely seen in the Stellar Realm, apart from the frontlines of the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, come out and die!" A solemn, undeniable voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next instant, before the people of the Kui Jin Realm could react, a lazy voice covered them.</p><p></p><p>"Those who obstruct my descent to the mortal realm, shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a kitchen knife slashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"From today, the Chaotic Stellar Realm... is under my control!"</p><p></p><p>The ordinary kitchen knife cut through, but the earth did not crack, the mountains and rivers did not collapse, not even a ripple in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the fifteen majestic Yang Gods were shattered and fell.</p><p></p><p>They tried to reform their bodies, but were met with the same unrelenting knife strike.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the fifteen Yang Gods with disdain: "They are too useless, with so little Ominous Qi, they can be killed with just a stick of incense."</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife hung in the sky, slashing down one by one, killing the fifteen Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>If these fifteen Yang Gods had enough Ominous Qi to continuously revive, this single knife strike could last for three thousand years, endlessly slaying and resurrecting them until their final death.</p><p></p><p>This place would become a forbidden land or a cosmic wonder, worthy of the world's admiration.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao's pupils shrank dramatically.</p><p></p><p>What did they see? How could this be? He... really is the Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>How is that possible?</p><p></p><p>"How can you be so strong?" Shangguan Qingmiao blurted out involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, there could not possibly be a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>To prove oneself a Realm Lord, one must sacrifice all the Mandate Bearers.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... from other universes? Even more impossible.</p><p></p><p>His mind was in turmoil, unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Why am I so strong?" Qi Yuan paused, then said, "Because I understand the Art of War, and excel at using strength to overcome weakness, so I am undefeatable."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao felt the air suddenly turn cold, not just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Because after telling the cold joke, Qi Yuan deliberately made the air turn cold to match the mood.</p><p></p><p>Without further addressing the two, Qi Yuan indifferently said, "Those who obstruct my descent to the mortal realm shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan's figure became ethereal and intangible.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Stellar Realm, hundreds and thousands of worlds overlapped or were hidden in the dust motes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a mighty Dao voice echoed from tens of thousands of worlds.</p><p></p><p>"From today, I control the Chaotic Stellar Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The vast voice resounded across the land, heard by all living beings in the Chaotic Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many were puzzled, including the Thorn Blood members.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to be so bold?"</p><p></p><p>Some Black Heaven and Black Earth Yang Gods surged into the sky, like flowing light.</p><p></p><p>However, they were met with a colossal hand.</p><p></p><p>The hand came from nowhere, covering the sky and sky, as if space and time flowed through it.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heaven and Black Earth Yang God turned deathly pale, his aura instantly extinguished, only to be revived and extinguished again.</p><p></p><p>This happened across the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Towering giant hands descended, slaughtering all Ominous Spirits and Ominous Gods.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Gods with infinite Ominous Qi revival were killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Countless people looked up at the sky, their faces filled with shock and amazement.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>They did not understand, but they knew that from this day on, the sky above the Chaotic Stellar Realm had changed.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Mountain Realm, the game began.</p><p></p><p>A colossal hand descended, and all the Ominous Spirits withered and crumbled to dust.</p><p></p><p>"So you dare to steal my drone, seeking death!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's palm slapped down, instantly reducing a Heaven-level Ominous Spirit to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, the Ominous Spirits terrorizing the Azure Mountain Realm were all slaughtered and exterminated.</p><p></p><p>Many looked up at the sky, their eyes filled with fear and horror.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of mighty existence is this?"</p><p>"A celestial being?"</p><p>"A god has descended?"</p><p>"Brother-in-law? Is that Brother-in-law's voice?" Someone exclaimed joyfully, like a fool.</p><p></p><p>Others were amazed, for the overbearing and extraordinary voice in the sky was indeed too familiar.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Imperial City, a beautiful and petite woman heard the voice in the sky, her eyes flashing with wild delight: "Grandpa Cai?"</p><p></p><p>As the one who had become the Realm Lord, Qi Yuan could hear any voice related to him, even if he was countless miles away.</p><p></p><p>When he heard "Grandpa Cai", he couldn't help but grimace.</p><p></p><p>However, being a cultured person, he couldn't be bothered to respond.</p><p></p><p>His gaze seemed to transcend time and space, falling on Shen Lingfeng in Feng Mountain Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Tell my mother-in-law that Lingxuan is safe with me now."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's eyes shone with joy: "It really is you, Brother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, also tell my mother-in-law that I am no longer the small useless son-in-law I used to be, I won't be washing her feet anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Brother-in-law!" Shen Lingfeng was very excited.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Shen Residence, the Shen Family Master and Madam Shen, like ordinary people, were filled with fear of the unknown at the sight of the giant hand in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, Madam Shen had a strange feeling: "Dear, don't you feel that voice sounds familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"Careful, don't provoke this mighty existence!" The Shen Family Master hurriedly said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful existence could not be fathomed by common logic.</p><p></p><p>Madam Shen saw this and did not speak further, but her heart was filled with doubt.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shen Lingfeng rushed in.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother... Brother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Madam Shen immediately understood that her foolish son had also recognized that the voice sounded like Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>Madam Shen quickly said, "Don't talk nonsense, that's not your brother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>"It is Brother-in-law! It's definitely him!" Shen Lingfeng said happily, "Just now, Brother-in-law told me that the voice in the sky is his!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Lady of the Shen Family and the Master were both shocked, their bodies frozen.</p><p></p><p>"So it really is Qi Yuan?" "Your brother-in-law also said that he is no longer the small son-in-law from before, and won't be pouring water for your bath anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a spiritual manifestation appeared, falling into the Sunset Cliff and ultimately entering the Mystic Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's spiritual manifestation looked at the magnificent and desolate Mystic Wood Abyss, an odd expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Blind girl?"</p><p></p><p>He called out softly.</p><p></p><p>This voice contained the Domain Lord's understanding of the rules, the sound able to reach any corner and awaken the comatose.</p><p></p><p>But just like last time, no one responded.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual manifestation swept its gaze across everything, finally revealing a look of helplessness in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, even after becoming a Domain Lord, I still cannot uncover the truth."</p><p></p><p>At the Domain Lord realm, the universal rules are under one's control.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the universe cannot escape detection.</p><p></p><p>But in the Mystic Wood Abyss, all that Qi Yuan's eyes saw was the unknown. </p><p></p><p>Broken colorful lines, overlapping digital chaos, messy and disorderly, like primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand to try and touch it, but alas, it was all illusory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, listening intently.</p><p></p><p>"The eyes cannot see, but what about the ears?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of the soundless voice.</p><p></p><p>It did not exist in the world, as if no one could hear it.</p><p></p><p>Only his special abilities might be able to vaguely perceive it.</p><p></p><p>Clad in white robes, he stood in the Mystic Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he murmured, "I hear the sounds of the clouds, the rain, and the soundless thunder."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes, his gaze turning desolate.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he inexplicably felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan flipped his hand.</p><p></p><p>A tree leaf fell into his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This leaf was obtained in the Exotic Realm, a primal fragment of forging the Radiant Treasure.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the leaf, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Society. </p><p></p><p>Jade pavilions and jade towers, like an immortal palace.</p><p></p><p>"That fool Wu Dong... actually died in the Mystic Wood Universe."</p><p></p><p>The tall woman's gaze flickered like stars.</p><p></p><p>She hailed from the Radiant Universe, the second strongest of the Five Heavenly Steps in the Radiant Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Little Fengti, is that Qi Yuan really that powerful?" The tall woman looked at Fengti.</p><p></p><p>The Fengti before her was not the true Fengti, only a copy, a copy of the Fengti who had reached the Five Heavenly Steps.</p><p></p><p>So the tall woman called him "Little".</p><p></p><p>Fengti's gaze was profound: "If you want to know, go challenge him yourself."</p><p></p><p>He had no memory of the previous events.</p><p></p><p>But even he, carrying the Nine Lives, was still slain. This meant that Qi Yuan's strength absolutely surpassed his, and by no small margin.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for having to obstruct those wastes of the Black Abyss, this young lady would have gone to challenge that so-called Qi Yuan long ago. You... really are a disgrace to our Radiant Universe." The tall woman said.</p><p></p><p>At their level, having lived for so many years, their thoughts were free and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>"You're afraid." Fengti said, "Wu Dong died for no reason, even the Domain Lord of the Eon couldn't save him."</p><p></p><p>"Are you an idiot? Wu Dong's death is definitely related to the Black Sky, how could you think a local of the Mystic Wood Universe could..."</p><p></p><p>The tall woman's words were abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>A hoarse, desolate voice suddenly resounded in the Radiant Society's palace.</p><p></p><p>"All members, prepare to evacuate immediately, leave the Chaotic Star Realm."</p><p></p><p>The tall woman's face showed confusion: "Old man, what's wrong? Has the Black Sky and Black Abyss broken through the Void Sea defenses and invaded the Chaotic Star Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Her status was noble, so she could naturally ask the Palace Master of this Radiant Society.</p><p></p><p>"A Domain Lord has appeared in the Chaotic Star Realm, we will only meet our deaths if we remain here." The Palace Master replied.</p><p></p><p>"A Domain Lord... how is that possible? Has the Domain Lord of the Black Sky and Black Abyss come?" The tall woman was astonished, unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Although her talents were extraordinary, Domain Lords were still existences she had to look up to.</p><p></p><p>A Domain Lord's will could easily annihilate her.</p><p></p><p>"No, it is not the Domain Lord of the Black Sky, but a Domain Lord born in the Mystic Wood Universe, named Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He... Fengti has even encountered him before, when Fengti went to the Azure Mountain Realm, he was slain by him."</p><p></p><p>"The Eon Domain Lord has confirmed this? Wait... slain Fengti?" The tall woman was filled with a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>The person she had wanted to challenge... was a Domain Lord?</p><p></p><p>And the Mystic Wood Universe... how could it have produced a Domain Lord?</p><p></p><p>All of this was too bizarre, or rather, beyond her comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and leave this place, otherwise... even a Domain Lord's intervention won't be able to save us!"</p><p></p><p>The tall woman did not hesitate, she also knew that for now, retreat was the wisest choice.</p><p></p><p>If she was too late, she might not even make it out alive.</p><p></p><p>That was a Domain Lord, in some ordinary universes, a Domain Lord could be the strongest existence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord hung his head, a gloomy expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Fengti, stop cultivating, there's an important matter."</p><p></p><p>Fengti emerged from his cultivation, looking at the Three Wood Domain Lord with resignation: "Old Three Wood, what's the matter again?"</p><p></p><p>He had been cultivating well, preparing to break through to the third layer of the Yang God Domain Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>But this old Three Wood kept coming to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you still remember the person I told you about last time, the one who defeated... your copy body?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the local of the Mystic Wood Universe." Fengti said indifferently, "He can be considered a genius."</p><p></p><p>"Not just a genius... my disciple was defeated, not only that, he died, and I even sought the Eon Domain Lord's help but could not retrieve his true spirit."</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord spoke bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you've come to find me, this matter is indeed strange." Fengti said.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a small matter, the most important thing is, that person... named Qi Yuan, has now broken through to the Domain Lord realm."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" Fengti's eyes revealed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the special true spirit residing in Fengti's body also trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>Fengti's divine light flickered as he sensed something: "An event of such magnitude... the Dao Ancestor will likely be interested, but it has nothing to do with me, who hasn't even reached the third layer of the Yang God."</p><p></p><p>Fengti waved his sleeve, as if shooing the other away.</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Domain Lord left, grumbling.</p><p></p><p>A puzzled voice rang in Fengti's ears:</p><p></p><p>"Strange... why didn't I know that a Domain Lord had appeared in the Mystic Wood Universe?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this something special?"</p><p></p><p>"Very special, very strange." The voice was ethereal, "The more special and strange, the more dangerous. Fengti... you should leave the Radiant with me."</p><p></p><p>"If you stay in the Radiant, you'll never be able to step into the Domain Lord realm."</p><p></p><p>"You've already been frozen at the second layer of the Yang God."</p><p></p><p>"Just like... the destruction of the Mystic Wood Universe has already been determined."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

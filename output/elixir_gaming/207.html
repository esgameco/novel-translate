        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The eight villagers were very excited.</p><p></p><p>Especially Zhu Zhuangshi, whose expression was animated, as if Qi Yuan was passing the high tower.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, don't look at how timid old Zhu has been along the way. After today, old Zhu is going to strike hard!"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator at the Yuan Dan level was speaking so boldly, confusing the true gods present. </p><p></p><p>Was this person ill? A Yuan Dan talking about striking hard? Too laughable.</p><p></p><p>These true gods looked at the eight people, feeling their joy was a bit exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level of divine observation method the divine lord will be able to contemplate this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhu can't be suppressed by a dog for a lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>The eight people were full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Eighteen Arhats - eighteen legends, apart from Subduing the Dragon and Tiger, the rest had all become true gods.</p><p></p><p>How could the eight present not be envious?</p><p></p><p>It could be said that these eight were the earliest to follow Qi Yuan, truly his direct disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Since the divine lord is preparing to contemplate, shall we go into the contemplation grounds to take a look?" the twin sister suggested at this time.</p><p></p><p>She was also very curious why Qi Yuan wanted to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Anyway it was boring now, might as well enter the contemplation grounds to see.</p><p></p><p>"Right, hopefully there will be a flash of golden light in the contemplation grounds, otherwise it would be a waste to enter."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't a flash of golden light common for the mighty and extraordinary divine lord?" Ancient God Wang Song was flattering.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods entered the contemplation grounds, joking around.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the usually low-key divine official Shen Tu spoke up: "I hope when you enter the contemplation grounds, your eyes won't be blinded by the brightness!"</p><p></p><p>[The passage continues describing Qi Yuan entering a chat group and contemplating powerful divine figures, with reactions from others in the group and world. It ends with Qi Yuan successfully contemplating multiple mythical-level divine beings.]</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Eight... mythical beings!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes were fanatical, filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>These were eight mythical beings! Eight completely unfamiliar mythical beings! How could his heart not be shaken?</p><p></p><p>It was a thousand times, ten thousand times more shocking than the twenty-one legends from before.</p><p></p><p>Those were mythical beings, starting at the mythical level at the very least! It's possible that even visualization methods for mythical-level great lords could be at the legendary or epic level.</p><p></p><p>Mythical-level visualization methods were for mythical powerhouses never before visualized! The tremors at the visualization site before him were far, far stronger than for ordinary mythical beings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were all unheard-of mythical beings. </p><p></p><p>How could the Great Lord of Lishan not be excited?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, this is... too terrifying!" The Great Lord of Lishan suddenly felt that their Mythical Plan was a joke.</p><p></p><p>Although the Mythical Plan had already gathered five Children of Destiny.</p><p></p><p>These five Children of Destiny were still being cultivated, just to be able to fully visualize five mythical-level deity visualization methods.</p><p></p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, eight mythical-level deity visualization methods had appeared. How could he not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>He stared at the ancestral land ahead, his eyes nearly popping out: "When will this Origin Venerable come out!"</p><p></p><p>"Why does he need to visualize? Could he have encountered an enemy he can't defeat!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Lord of Lishan was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.</p><p></p><p>The other two great lords were the same.</p><p></p><p>They had originally come just to join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Thunder God Great Lord had asked them to look after his disciple.</p><p></p><p>With nothing else to do, they had come with the Great Lord of Lishan to gather outside the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the Origin Venerable would visualize eight mythical-level visualization methods?</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, the entrance to the visualization site is closed, otherwise I would definitely charge in!"</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense about Children of Destiny, they're not worth a hair on the Origin Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Lord of Lishan was filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>Why had he introduced the Origin Venerable to that unreliable old Thunder God Great Lord back then! How had he failed to discover such an outstanding talent, such an unparalleled genius?</p><p></p><p>They waited anxiously outside the ancestral land, afraid something unexpected would happen.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Great Lord of Lishan spoke: "Regarding the Origin Venerable visualizing eight mythical-level deity visualization methods, don't let this leak out at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The other great lords quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>Although all the ancient gods in the visualization site knew that Qi Yuan had visualized eight mythical-level deity visualization methods, they had no idea who had done it.</p><p></p><p>And a terrifying genius like Qi Yuan absolutely had to be protected.</p><p></p><p>The Great Lord of Lishan had already decided that as soon as Qi Yuan came out of the ancestral land, he would take him away directly and apply for a great lord at the Six Steps of Heaven Treading level to personally protect him! The Mythical Plan had originally seemed hopeless.</p><p></p><p>If the eight mythical-level deity visualization methods visualized by the Origin Venerable were properly utilized on eight great lords, then the Mythical Plan might actually have a chance of succeeding!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the high tower in the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister's mouth was wide open, her eyes full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were the same, the shock in their hearts unable to dissipate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... real?" The twin sister couldn't help but murmur.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi was immediately delighted: "How about it? Did the deity visualization methods visualized by the Divine Lord emit golden light! I can't be outdone by that big black dog!"</p><p></p><p>"Judging by their expressions, they must have emitted golden light, hehe." Shi Zhongshan was also somewhat pleased, "It seems I'll be qualified to sit as an equal with my sworn brother in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other villagers were all extremely happy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an ancient god spoke with difficulty: "The Divine Lord's visualization methods... they're not for you to use, are they?"</p><p></p><p>"What else would they be for?" Zhu Zhuangshi was extremely smug, "I am the Divine Lord's most loyal subject, what's wrong with rewarding me with a visualization method?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods felt their worldview collapse yet again.</p><p></p><p>Those were mythical-level deity visualization methods, given to eight... ordinary villagers to use?</p><p></p><p>This was too... wasteful! They had already felt it was wasteful when ordinary villagers were given Linmu Immortal Liquid to drink earlier.</p><p></p><p>Now, eight mythical-level deity visualization methods, that was beyond wasteful!</p><p></p><p>"The Lord is truly... terrifying!" At this point, the twin sister couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were extremely shaken, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Yuan's performance had completely exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan emerged from the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, everyone's gaze turned towards him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the ancient god Wang Song: "It's a pity, there's too little demonic god power, otherwise I would have condensed a deity visualization method for you to play with too."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Song's white beard trembled constantly, his eyes brimming with tears: "The Divine Lord still remembers me, this old slave is extremely grateful!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, he shamelessly referred to himself as an old slave.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were shocked to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Divine Lord could still visualize more?</p><p></p><p>He hadn't visualized more only because there wasn't enough demonic god power?</p><p></p><p>This was simply unbelievable! At this point, Qi Yuan looked at the eight subjects beside him: "Most of you have been following me for some time now. These eight deity visualization methods are my reward to you."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi was extremely excited: "Thank you, Divine Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The others also came forward to express their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Zhuangshi couldn't help but ask: "Divine Lord, after cultivating this deity visualization method, will I be able to defeat... the big black dog? </p><p></p><p>Old Zhu doesn't want to be bullied by the big dog anymore!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present looked at Zhu Zhuangshi's foolish expression and couldn't help but beat their chests and stamp their feet in frustration.</p><p></p><p>Such a fool, someone who viewed a dog as his great enemy, could also obtain a mythical-level deity visualization method? They were filled with envy and jealousy! If they were given a mythical-level deity visualization method, they would even be willing to lower their cultivation to the Purple Palace realm and start cultivating anew!</p><p></p><p>"As long as you work hard, you probably won't be bullied by the big black dog anymore." Qi Yuan rarely spoke in absolutes.</p><p></p><p>After all, the big black dog had extraordinary talents and could even summon the shadow of that being.</p><p></p><p>That being, in terms of combat power, was actually a bit stronger than what he intended to give Zhu Zhuangshi.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked full of anticipation, as did the other seven villagers.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan waved his hand, and eight deity visualization methods appeared.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the deity visualization methods emitting purple light, the eight ancient gods looked on with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>The eight villagers were also completely stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Mythical-level deity visualization methods, I never thought I would have the chance to see such high-level visualization methods in my lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>"A full eight of them!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, alas, alas!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were about to cry.</p><p></p><p>After all, such visualization methods were being given to eight ordinary villagers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and the eight visualization methods fell into the hands of the eight people respectively.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's bodies trembled, hardly daring to believe their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi even shed tears, clutching the visualization method tightly: "Divine Lord, I'm not your illegitimate son, am I?"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he, Zhu Zhuangshi, be worthy of such a terrifying visualization method!</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, feeling more and more that this was a possibility.</p><p></p><p>He was as wise and mighty as the Divine Lord, as handsome and imposing!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the pile of fat on Zhu Zhuangshi's body with disgust: "If my son had your appearance, he wouldn't have been born!</p><p></p><p>You fool, hurry up and visualize, get into the state, I'm in a hurry!</p><p></p><p>If you keep talking nonsense, I'll take back this visualization method and give it to Wang Song."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, what I said just now was all nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't hesitate any longer and immersed his consciousness into the visualization method.</p><p></p><p>The other seven villagers did the same, forcibly suppressing the excitement in their hearts with their techniques and seriously examining the visualization methods.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't use techniques, they wouldn't be able to calm their hearts at all, nor would they be able to immerse themselves.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the scene became quiet.</p><p></p><p>These eight people seriously studied the visualization methods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the remaining ancient gods and said softly: "I will take my subjects away for a while, you wait here for a bit."</p><p></p><p>The Lost Glow Stick was about to activate, and Qi Yuan wanted to take these subjects to the past to break through to True God realm.</p><p></p><p>The True Gods present were a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Where were they going?</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of Qi Yuan's power and mysteriousness, they didn't raise any objections.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" the twin sister said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Stand still and don't move, otherwise you'll wake the puppet gods here and you'll all die."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan looked at his group of subjects.</p><p></p><p>He waved his large hand.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the light of the Lost Glow Stick enveloped the subjects present.</p><p></p><p>And in that moment, the eleven of them instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other ancient gods all showed surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea how the Origin Venerable had disappeared! But thinking that he might be able to visualize eight mythical-level deity visualization methods, and viewed the dangers of the ancestral land as nothing, it all seemed normal again.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Venerable is truly a divine being, this old slave has followed the right person!" Wang Song's eyes were filled with exaggerated joy.</p><p></p><p>P.S.:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the updates, I sincerely apologize.</p><p></p><p>I'm really not in a good state. As everyone knows about the Myriad Worlds story, changing arcs definitely causes a drop in readers. Many people don't like certain arcs, and when there are a lot of voices it does affect my state. I can't type anything at all when I look at the computer.</p><p></p><p>But for each arc, the author can only try to write it well and try to complete it.</p><p></p><p>If there are voices of dislike, and I rush to finish quickly, then later arcs may follow the same pattern, entering a vicious cycle. This would also be irresponsible to the book and to the readers.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I want to thank the big boss ←上帝無淚 again for the 3000 reward and constant support, thank 明天就会更好 for the 1000 reward, and 初级阶段 for the donation.</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for your continued support and understanding.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

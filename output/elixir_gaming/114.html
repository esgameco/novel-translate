        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Several terrifying figures appeared, each emanating an extremely frightening aura. They seemed to merge with heaven and earth, becoming one with this world.</p><p></p><p>"A Supreme?" Purple Daoist looked at Supreme Yubai's corpse, killing intent surging in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"And a Terrestrial Myth. Hmph, such a little bug dares to come to our headquarters. Truly seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the several Supremes present were not very pleasant. </p><p></p><p>To have someone kill their way into headquarters and assassinate a Supreme.</p><p></p><p>This made everyone smell danger, and also feel it was a great humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Especially Purple Daoist who had just arrived here.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to slay Supreme Yubai, that Supreme from the South has some skills," Purple Daoist said, his deep eyes staring at Supreme Yubai's corpse, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"After slaying Supreme Yubai, that Southern Supreme must have fled towards Great Sorrow City. In a few days, our army will march on Great Sorrow City. We must teach those Southern cultivators a lesson!" a Supreme said sternly.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, another Supreme suddenly said: "There's an incident at the Ape Demon Cave. A... Supreme is attacking!"</p><p></p><p>The Ape Demon Cave was very close to the Liuchuan Demon Cave.</p><p></p><p>The Supremes present were all bewildered when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't leave, but dared to go to another demon cave?"</p><p></p><p>"How audacious, not taking us seriously at all!"</p><p></p><p>The Supremes present were all furious.</p><p></p><p>After assassinating a Supreme, instead of fleeing, he continued to wreak havoc. </p><p></p><p>This was completely disregarding them.</p><p></p><p>Killing intent also flashed in Purple Daoist's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His finger lightly tapped the stone tablet in his robe. When he sensed no danger, he said loudly: "Everyone, come with me to the Ape Demon Cave to slay this villain!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist was a Great Supreme. With these words, no one present dared to refuse.</p><p></p><p>All the Supremes set out together, rushing towards the Ape Demon Cave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, inside the Ape Demon Cave, Qi Yuan had already gone berserk with killing.</p><p></p><p>Countless demon spawn died under his sword.</p><p></p><p>Under his powerful attacks, no demon spawn was a match for him.</p><p></p><p>He was like a god of death, entering the demon spawn army and going on a rampage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Chen Huan's eyes were filled with shock: "This is... too abnormal."</p><p></p><p>He knew Qi Yuan was strong, one of the top Terrestrial Myths, but he didn't expect him to be this powerful.</p><p></p><p>Just in terms of slaying demon spawn, Qi Yuan, a mere Terrestrial Myth, was even faster than him when he wasn't using his Origin Divine Ability!</p><p></p><p>And as a Supreme, Origin Divine Abilities weren't infinite, so how could he use them casually?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's voice came: "What are you dawdling for? Hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan was stunned, then suddenly realized something: "Big brother, let's run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Having recently become a Supreme and slain a Supreme, Chen Huan had been feeling like he was in a dream.</p><p></p><p>His mind had been in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Only now did he realize that if they kept killing here, they would be surrounded by the Northern Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his sword horizontally, and all demon spawn were slain where the sword light passed.</p><p></p><p>His eyes carried intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The experience bar was also rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>He was very close to level 120.</p><p></p><p>"The plan is ahead of schedule. We've already entered the third step. How can we retreat now? We should strike while the iron is hot and complete the third step. Wait for me to become a Supreme, then I'll chop that old dog Purple Daoist to death!" Qi Yuan said fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The more demon spawn he killed, the more demonic essence he extracted, and the more negative emotions Qi Yuan suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, we should run quickly. Even if you become a Supreme, we... we..." </p><p></p><p>Chen Huan was really getting anxious.</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist was a cultivator at the Great Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>The gap between a Great Supreme and an ordinary Supreme was very, very large.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that even if Purple Daoist just stood there and let Chen Huan hack at him, Chen Huan still couldn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>Although his big brother was mysterious, he was still too young after all.</p><p></p><p>He believed that given a thousand years to mature, his big brother would easily surpass Purple Daoist.</p><p></p><p>"Run? We can't run anymore. They're already here." Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, but his hands didn't stop moving.</p><p></p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p></p><p>His eyes only saw slaughter, as if he wanted to kill his way through this world and shatter the Liufeng Realm!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan also sensed several extremely powerful auras spreading towards them.</p><p></p><p>Among them was one that was obscure and profound.</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme! It must be the Great Supreme Purple Daoist!</p><p></p><p>Escape... they really couldn't escape now.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's face fell. He felt there was no way out.</p><p></p><p>His great-great-great-granddaughter was about to give birth, and he hadn't gone back to see her.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if his dozens of concubines missed him.</p><p></p><p>If he died here, the world of pleasure would have nothing to do with him anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, we're about to die soon. Can I make one request?" Chen Huan asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>"If you have something to say, say it quickly. If you have to fart, fart quickly!" Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered with Chen Huan, continuously slaughtering demon spawn as if racing against time.</p><p></p><p>Sorrowful emotions spread across Chen Huan's face as he said sincerely: "Huan has been alone and helpless all his life. Before death, I wonder if I could have the chance to acknowledge you as my adoptive father?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Qi Yuan cursed loudly.</p><p></p><p>The broken sword in his hand was like a long dragon, charging into the Ape Demon Cave.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds and thousands of demon spawn continuously fell.</p><p></p><p>The auras of the Supremes were also rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>A long-absent prompt sounded in Qi Yuan's ear again.</p><p></p><p>[You have reached level 120. You have gained one chance to comprehend an Origin. Do you wish to use it?]</p><p></p><p>After slaying demon spawn in the Liufeng Realm for nearly a hundred years, plus one Supreme, Qi Yuan's experience bar had finally reached level 120.</p><p></p><p>Level 120 was a watershed.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into it meant becoming a Supreme.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan could be considered half-step Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Because he didn't have his own Origin Divine Ability yet.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend." He naturally wouldn't miss the chance to comprehend an Origin Divine Ability provided by leveling up.</p><p></p><p>And this time, he would also condense his most powerful Origin Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the present world was frozen.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan opened his eyes again, he appeared in the place he was most familiar with - Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>However... the current Mount Jiupan was very different from the Mount Jiupan in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Overgrown with weeds and thorns, desolate and uninhabited.</p><p></p><p>The once lively Mount Jiupan was now like a wild, uninhabited mountain.</p><p></p><p>"How many years have passed?" Qi Yuan looked around nostalgically, his gaze somewhat desolate.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of loneliness filled his heart.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head to look at the sky, his gaze suddenly becoming resolute: "I must become a Golden Immortal of the Great Luo Heaven, a Mixed Origin Saint, and toy with that little bastard the River of Time!"</p><p></p><p>Putting aside his lonely emotions, Qi Yuan's divine sense swept across Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't find anything familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Canary... Gate of Ten Thousand Differences..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems this time I can't stay confined to Mount Jiupan. I should go out and travel this world myself."</p><p></p><p>He needed to comprehend his Origin at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Now at level 120, his strength should be enough to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got to the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, the faster he could comprehend, and the more benefits he would gain.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a blood-red robe, Qi Yuan looked at the desolate Mount Jiupan, a nostalgic expression on his face: "Sometimes, not having someone constantly chattering in your ear is actually quite boring."</p><p></p><p>He left Mount Jiupan and went down the mountain. Suddenly, he deliberately slowed his speed, just like a cultivator who had just started cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Less than a dozen breaths of time passed before several human cultivators wearing purple robes appeared, their faces excited: "A remnant of the Blood Lord! Quick, catch him!"</p><p></p><p>The five purple-robed cultivators charged towards Qi Yuan. Their realm was about that of an Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these five people, his expression cold: "What did you call me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the leader's eyes rolled, and he said to the person next to him: "He doesn't seem to be a remnant of the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>If he were a remnant of the Blood Lord, he would have run as soon as he saw them appear.</p><p></p><p>"Who cares if he's a remnant of the Blood Lord or not. Appearing here means he's a remnant of the Blood Lord. We'll get a reward all the same if we catch him!" said a purple-robed cultivator with a large mole on his face.</p><p></p><p>The five reached a consensus and looked at Qi Yuan with fierce expressions: "Brother, don't blame us. Blame your bad luck!"</p><p></p><p>The five charged towards Qi Yuan, about to capture him. However, at this moment, a long spear swept by, and a black-robed youth appeared.</p><p></p><p>The long spear was like a python, directly piercing through a purple-robed cultivator's chest.</p><p></p><p>Several flying daggers also shot out at this time, embedding themselves in the foreheads of the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>These five purple-robed cultivators had no chance to resist before they were cleanly and neatly eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, people of the Purple Sky Alliance all deserve to die!" The short-skirted girl with a high ponytail looked spirited and valiant. It was she who had thrown the flying daggers, killing the rest of the</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed cultivator was shot dead.</p><p></p><p>The spear-wielding man in black tight clothing stood shoulder to shoulder with the short-skirted girl. He looked at Qi Yuan and said slowly, "Brother, these people have already been killed by my junior sister. You'd better leave quickly, otherwise when the Purple Sky Alliance people arrive, you won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both for saving my life," Qi Yuan said, looking at the two with a puzzled expression. "May I ask, what is this Blood Master remnant, and what is this Purple Sky Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know about the Purple Sky Alliance?" The short-skirted girl Bai Luo looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"I've been cultivating in the mountains and don't know about worldly affairs," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the black-robed man revealed a cautious look. </p><p></p><p>They had originally thought this blood-robed man was just a low-level cultivator, which was why they had stepped in to help.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed he was not so simple.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man said, "It's a long story. Why don't you come with us and we can talk as we go?"</p><p></p><p>If they stayed here, the Purple Sky Alliance people would likely arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The three quickly left Nine Coils Mountain, talking as they went.</p><p></p><p>The man in black was named Hei Yu. He said, "The Purple Sky Alliance is a powerful force that was established in the past few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Purple Sky Alliance is called the Purple Sky Mystic Woman. </p><p></p><p>She claims to have come from the future."</p><p></p><p>"The future?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had also come from the future.</p><p></p><p>If the Purple Sky Mystic Woman had really come from the future, it did give him a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, he was a game player, what was there to fear from an NPC? So he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred years ago, the Blood Master disappeared. His followers established the Blood Palace, continuing to spread his teachings and disseminating the 'Demon Trapping Technique' throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>This was originally a great deed to benefit all living beings! But who would have thought, that Purple Sky Mystic Woman would suddenly appear out of nowhere. She declared that the Blood Master was the root of all demonic thoughts!" As Hei Yu spoke, he gripped his spear even tighter.</p><p></p><p>The short-skirted girl Bai Luo said indignantly, "That damn Purple Sky Mystic Woman, she's clearly just satisfying her own ambitions by slandering the great Blood Master.</p><p></p><p>She proclaimed that the Blood Master was the reincarnation of the source of all demonic evils! Even more shamelessly, she said that if the Blood Master hadn't felt guilty, why would he have created the 'Demon Trapping Technique' to benefit the world?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt the latter half was similar in spirit to saying "If you didn't hit them, why did you help them up?"</p><p></p><p>"With the Blood Master labeled as a great demon, the Blood Palace became a demonic palace.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Purple Sky Alliance targeted the Blood Palace extensively.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that old witch Purple Sky Mystic Woman even claimed ownership of the 'Demon Trapping Technique', distributing it to other groups themselves!" The girl Bai Luo said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>After hearing all this, Qi Yuan understood the general situation.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Alliance had set their sights on the 'Demon Trapping Technique', wanting to claim credit for it as their own.</p><p></p><p>So they slandered him as a great demon.</p><p></p><p>"Are you two from the Blood Palace?" Qi Yuan looked at the pair.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Hei Yu hesitated, then nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>"How is the Blood Palace faring now?" Qi Yuan was somewhat worried about the golden canary, hoping it was alright.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Palace is not doing well, forced to retreat to just one region," Bai Luo said.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a golden canary in the Blood Palace? How is it doing now?" Qi Yuan asked the question he was concerned about.</p><p></p><p>Hei Yu looked at Qi Yuan warily: "How do you know about Senior Golden Canary? Could it be... you were also one of the Blood Master's followers back then?"</p><p></p><p>The girl Bai Luo beside him also widened her eyes: "Are you a disciple of the Blood Master?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Hei Yu and Bai Luo's reactions, the golden canary should still be around and unharmed.</p><p></p><p>If so, then all was well.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a possibility... that I am the Blood Master?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Hei Yu was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Bai Luo quickly said, "Sir, that's not a joke to be made lightly."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised, their reaction was unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Bai Luo say: "The reason the Purple Sky Mystic Woman was able to control the narrative was because she obtained a supreme treasure of the world... the Destiny Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>"Destiny Stone Tablet?" This was the first time Qi Yuan had heard this name.</p><p></p><p>"When Buddha was born, flowers bloomed in abundance and snow fell in July.</p><p></p><p>A supreme treasure, the Destiny Stone Tablet, was born together with Buddha.</p><p></p><p>This stone tablet is the supreme treasure of the mortal world. It is said to be able to glimpse the future and see the past.</p><p></p><p>Through the Destiny Stone Tablet, the Purple Sky Mystic Woman learned that the Blood Master was no longer in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>It was after obtaining this information that the Purple Sky Mystic Woman became bold and began targeting our Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because they possess the supreme treasure of the Destiny Stone Tablet that the Purple Sky Alliance has the power of discourse, recklessly slandering our great Blood Master, saying he is a great demon!" The more the girl Bai Luo spoke, the angrier she became.</p><p></p><p>Hei Yu also said, "Creating the 'Demon Trapping Technique' exhausted all of the Blood Master's vital energy. His passing... was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>When the Destiny Stone Tablet revealed that the Blood Master had perished, the Blood Palace specially held a grand funeral for him."</p><p></p><p>"I'm... not dead yet, isn't it a bit abrupt to hold a funeral for me?" Qi Yuan said helplessly. He asked again, "Where is the golden canary?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Golden Canary didn't attend that funeral back then. She was overcome with grief and unwilling to accept the fact that the Blood Master had perished.</p><p></p><p>Now, Senior Golden Canary and the other seniors of the Blood Palace are all at the End of the World."</p><p></p><p>The End of the World was countless tens of thousands of miles away from Nine Coils Mountain.</p><p></p><p>At the very edge of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, the Purple Sky Alliance has been hunting down cultivators of the Blood Palace. If it weren't for Senior Shang Yanran's extraordinary strength, able to contend with the Purple Sky Mystic Woman, the Blood Palace would likely have been destroyed long ago.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the cultivators of the Blood Palace have been forced to the End of the World." When Bai Luo mentioned this, her words were filled with bone-deep hatred for the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Hei Yu also said, "Just three months ago, the Purple Sky Alliance joined forces with seven major sects to send a united army to the End of the World, intending to... completely annihilate the Blood Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's heart tightened: "Do you have a map I could look at?"</p><p></p><p>"I have one." Bai Luo took out a crumpled map.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened it. The map was somewhat crude.</p><p></p><p>But it was very clear.</p><p></p><p>The place where Qi Yuan was now, called Nine Coils Mountain, was in the far north of the realm, the northernmost point of this world.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Alliance was in the very center of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The End of the World was in the far south of the realm, the southernmost point of this world.</p><p></p><p>To go from Nine Coils Mountain to the End of the World would require traversing the entire Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Going straight through would happen to pass right by the Purple Sky Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both." After understanding the situation, Qi Yuan felt it was time to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Here's a small gift for you two." As Qi Yuan spoke, he casually conjured a drop of blood-red liquid out of thin air, split it in half, and let it fall into their hands.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's figure completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>Hei Yu and Bai Luo looked at each other, both revealing surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>"That was definitely a great expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... a Realm Protector?"</p><p></p><p>The two left Nine Coils Mountain with lingering doubts.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, they returned to a small village.</p><p></p><p>An angry voice rang out: "You two ran off again!"</p><p></p><p>A short old man walked out, his face full of fury.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the old man, Hei Yu and Bai Luo both revealed fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>This old man was their master.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we didn't go out to cause trouble, but to uphold justice! Today, we saved one of our Blood Palace members from Purple Sky Alliance cultivators!" Bai Luo said proudly, sticking out her tongue.</p><p></p><p>Hei Yu remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man's anger dissipated somewhat: "Sigh, how many times have I told you, never go out. If the Purple Sky Alliance discovers your master is here, you'll never see your master again."</p><p></p><p>"Master, we know, you're in the top 500 on the Purple Sky Alliance's wanted list, they're really focused on you!" Bai Luo said flatteringly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man shrugged: "The Purple Sky Alliance is blind. Back when the Blood Master was preaching, I was among the first 100 to enter Nine Coils Mountain to listen. But on their wanted list, they ranked me at 426th. It's truly hateful!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Bai Luo smiled helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Their master was good in every way, except he liked to... exaggerate.</p><p></p><p>Almost every so often, he would recount his glorious history, saying things like how he was among the first hundred to hear the Blood Master preach.</p><p></p><p>Every time after telling the story, he would say nervously that this secret must never be revealed, or it would be dangerous if the Purple Sky Alliance found out.</p><p></p><p>Bai Luo thought of something and said teasingly: "Master, today we met a senior at the foot of Nine Coils Mountain. That senior looked extraordinary, he might have even listened to the Blood Master preach alongside you.</p><p></p><p>I saw that senior had an extraordinary aura, he might have even been seated ahead of you."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, hearing this, the little old man immediately became dissatisfied: "How is that possible? Everyone ranked ahead of me has gone to the End of the World, how could there be anyone closer to the Blood Master than me? This person must be an imposter! What did he look like, tell me quickly, I'll expose him!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

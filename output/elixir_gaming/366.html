        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zero One.</p><p></p><p>As he looked at this iron lump called Zero One, he felt it still had some charm left.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew this was because Zero One had obtained data from here and evolved. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't have asked such a strange question about what love is.</p><p></p><p>For robots, evolution and awakening intelligence are similar, but very different. </p><p></p><p>The current Zero One was very different from before.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Zero One shook its head.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and understood - this was just an account number and password, you'd have to go to the banking system to know how much money was in it.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood to the side and said curiously: "This couldn't be breakup money, could it?"</p><p></p><p>In the mural, the male protagonist's mother took out a large sum of money to make the female lead leave.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Qi Yuan shook his head. </p><p></p><p>Now he found this bank card number and password quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>It was a new kind of system.</p><p></p><p>You could call it technology, but it wasn't entirely technology.</p><p></p><p>"This spaceship only has this coffin girl, so she is nominally the owner of the ship.</p><p></p><p>The things on this ship belong to her property.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi is her grandmother and guardian, so she can decide who the property goes to.</p><p></p><p>So taking this account number and password isn't stealing or robbing - it's payment for helping kill the bandits!"</p><p></p><p>The bandits were of course those divine infants that Qi Yuan had killed.</p><p></p><p>"Who agrees, who objects?" Qi Yuan looked at the others present.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivator hurriedly said: "This humble one agrees!"</p><p></p><p>"I agree!" Xie Tang also quickly said.</p><p></p><p>As for that lonely high-level cultivator, he couldn't help but shiver as he answered: "Agree."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he also handed over the Sky Eyes he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>"These all belong to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>By senior, didn't he mean everything in this relic belonged to him?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Purple Palace cultivator also took out his Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Fair," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He advocated peace and fairness.</p><p></p><p>He and Ning Tao had already taken the coffin.</p><p></p><p>The other things would naturally be divided among the other four people.</p><p></p><p>These four cultivators' minds worked quickly, rapidly understanding what Qi Yuan meant by fairness in his words, and divided up the Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>They divided them very quickly and evenly. </p><p></p><p>There was even one Sky Eye that couldn't be divided, so they split it into four parts.</p><p></p><p>They didn't want to be unfair and end up like those dead cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"How can there be an 80-year-old cat in this world?"</p><p></p><p>In the room, a smile appeared on the face of Xie Xinsu's cat, looking very smug and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>She quickly parkoured around the room, running east and west.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, they're all gone, that stinky robot Zero One is gone too!"</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this her chance? Jailbreak!</p><p></p><p>How could she not escape with such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"This cat's owner has such insanely good luck, not only does he have an adorable cat like me fall from heaven to be his pet.</p><p></p><p>He also has a beautiful female cultivator like Goldfinch to be his wife and help him enter the path of immortality. </p><p></p><p>He hasn't aged in so many years, he must be... Foundation Establishment, or Core Formation stage?</p><p></p><p>Hmph, what's Foundation Establishment, what's Core Formation, it's time for this cat to turn the tables and become the master!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu gave a cold smile, already fantasizing about escaping and finding the Xuantian Sect, having her junior sister and master come seek revenge on her cat owner.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she would definitely make the robot Zero One film videos by itself every day.</p><p></p><p>As for the owner, hehe.</p><p></p><p>How dare he pet a cat! In the future, it would be the cat petting the human! Thinking this, Xie Xinsu lightly leapt and opened the doorknob.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, before leaving, she felt a bit reluctant in her heart.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about being able to pet the owner in the future, she became smug again and resolutely left.</p><p></p><p>The room became empty.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later, on Dazzling Star.</p><p></p><p>A disheveled man sat high in the clouds, his hair flying, dense black eyeballs hidden within his hair.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless rays of light flashed and burst out of the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The disheveled man let out a strange roar.</p><p></p><p>This sound was like the wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves.</p><p></p><p>The officials and nobles gathered in the great hall saw this scene and all had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying expert in the clouds was clearly a great power from the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now nine-tenths of the power on Dazzling Star was controlled by the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The king was merely a puppet.</p><p></p><p>The princess stood in a corner, looking at that demon in the sky with deep wariness in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Beside the princess was a pale and weak man, looking at the terrifying expert in the sky with bitter hatred in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The demons of the Demon Court can't sit still anymore, war... is about to begin." The weak man named Fang Hun was a demon.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the Demon Court demons occupying Dazzling Star, they were the original inhabitants of the Myriad Demon Realm, enslaved demons.</p><p></p><p>He naturally hated the Demon Court demons intensely.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if war breaks out, we citizens of Dazzling Star can only become cannon fodder!" The tall and slender princess gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with strong dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Although Dazzling Star had been at war with Arching Star before.</p><p></p><p>But after so many years, the new king advocated recuperation and development.</p><p></p><p>But if the demons of the Myriad Demon Realm started a war, it would definitely be innocent Dazzling Star citizens who died.</p><p></p><p>"They have always been savage, cold-blooded, and tyrannical!" Fang Hun said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Ancestor Demon disappeared, these demons from the upper realm descended, established the Demon Court, and enslaved myriad demons.</p><p></p><p>Now on Dazzling Star, they were just repeating old tricks.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hun, can your grandfather help us?!" The princess looked at Fang Hun, her eyes pleading.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hun's grandfather was a powerful cultivator with superhuman abilities.</p><p></p><p>"My... grandfather probably can't." Fang Hun's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>If his grandfather could stop the Demon Court demons, they as ancient demons wouldn't have to live in secret realms, barely surviving.</p><p></p><p>"Even your grandfather can't?" The princess was dejected.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying expert in the clouds suddenly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Blood flows from Arching Star, heaven and earth dance together, in a hundred days, war begins!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the other demons all excitedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"War begins!"</p><p></p><p>"War begins!"</p><p></p><p>Those warmongers on Dazzling Star also frantically shouted.</p><p></p><p>"War!"</p><p></p><p>"War!" </p><p></p><p>"War!"</p><p></p><p>The sound spread like a tide, rising and spreading in the city.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the princess seemed to see broken spaceships, and land baptized by artillery fire and blood.</p><p></p><p>War... was finally about to begin.</p><p></p><p>And some intelligence agents hidden on Dazzling Star, upon learning this news, felt as if the sky was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Arching Star... was finished. The news was subsequently transmitted back to Arching Star.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Star families and the royal family all became anxious at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Although Dazzling Star had supported the Ancient Witches before, the support was limited.</p><p></p><p>Now with war about to break out, could Arching Star alone resist? Moreover, there were rumors that behind Dazzling Star was an incredibly powerful Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Demon Realm was far, far stronger than the cultivators of the Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the great hall, the king sat in the seat of honor, with the heads of the Seven Martial Star families gathered.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The last time all the heads of the Seven Martial Star families gathered was to deal with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, the king had changed by now, with the former Seventh Prince becoming the new king.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred years had passed, yet the Seventh Prince still looked to be in his prime, quite young.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, news from the Brilliant Star indicates war will break out within a hundred days," the king spoke, his voice unhurried but with a hint of urgency.</p><p></p><p>"The Brilliant Star's strength surpasses ours, and the Myriad Demon Realm behind them remains mysterious and unknown. This war... I'm afraid it will be very brutal!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, our Sky Eyes are not to be underestimated. If they dare come, we'll make sure they never return!" said a clan leader in his prime, his face filled with hostility. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Sky Eyes had given him much confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Fight, what else is there to say!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, war is inevitable. We must prepare for war and put the whole country on a war footing!"</p><p></p><p>The Qin Yuan of today was no longer the Qin Yuan of the past. Faced with the threat from the Brilliant Star, the Seven Martial Star families of Qin Yuan chose to confront them head-on.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the Myriad Demon Realm was, it was probably only somewhat stronger than the Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>With over a hundred Sky Eyes, they had enough to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This matter still needs to be reported to that person," the king said.</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They knew that person all too well.</p><p></p><p>He was the most solid rock on Arch Star, as well as the sword hanging over their heads.</p><p></p><p>When Qin Yuan declared a state of war, Qi Yuan had already entered the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he was now on the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Origin Land from the stronghold, one had to cross the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>All strongholds had ships heading to the Origin Land, divided into twelve routes in total.</p><p></p><p>On Qi Yuan's route, there weren't many people on the ship, only about a hundred Martial Kings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was lying on a lounge chair, looking extremely relaxed and comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan walked over with a smile on his face: "Brother Qi is living quite comfortably."</p><p></p><p>"Not really. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit melancholic," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He had a vague premonition that this game was coming to an end soon.</p><p></p><p>After the game ended, he would face the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>After resolving the great calamity, he would go to the upper realm to see Jin Li and find his master.</p><p></p><p>He felt melancholic.</p><p></p><p>Once he left this game, there would be no more civil affairs bureau.</p><p></p><p>Once he saw Jin Li and his master, he wouldn't be able to get a marriage certificate anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Leaving the world of death energy and heading to the Origin Land, to be honest, I also feel somewhat reluctant," Mu Yan's words carried a hint of desolation.</p><p></p><p>When they first entered the world of death energy, they carried out missions day and night, struggling on the edge of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Now, entering the Origin Land, such things would come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Once they became Martial Lords, they would change from chess pieces to chess players.</p><p></p><p>"Where are those followers of yours? Why aren't they here?" Qi Yuan looked at Mu Yan and asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan had several peak Martial Kings from ancient martial arts following him, who were supposed to accompany him to the Origin Land this time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a flash of loss crossed Mu Yan's expression: "They... are gone. It's my fault..."</p><p></p><p>This journey to the Origin Land was the official launch.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there had been many exploratory voyages before, scouting out routes.</p><p></p><p>During one of these explorations, many peak Martial Kings of the new martial arts were trapped in a certain place.</p><p></p><p>That place was extremely peculiar, reducing new Martial Kings to less than one-hundredth of their combat power, making them weaker than even Martial Spirits.</p><p></p><p>At that time, dozens of Martial Kings were trapped there.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, someone discovered that ancient martial artists were only weakened by half in that place.</p><p></p><p>Later, an army was formed by ancient martial artists to go and rescue them.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the ancient martial artists suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression was strange: "It feels a bit like a high-speed train getting stuck and having to call on steam engine ancestors for help."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the very impressive monkey-faced woman stepped forward and said softly: "Brother Qi, Brother Mu Yan is short-handed now. Do you want to follow him? If you follow him, when he enters the Martial Lord realm, he might help you step into the Martial Lord realm too."</p><p></p><p>There were generally two types of Martial Kings on the ship.</p><p></p><p>One type had the Martial Lord imprint. Upon entering the Origin Land and passing the test, they could receive the ancestral blood baptism and step into the Martial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>The other type was like Qi Yuan, without the Martial Lord imprint. Even if these peak Martial Kings were strong, their future prospects couldn't compare to those with the Martial Lord imprint.</p><p></p><p>"No need," Qi Yuan said with a smile, "I'm used to being free."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan looked a bit disappointed: "Brother Qi, if you help me, I, Mu Yan, will do my utmost to help you step into the Martial Lord realm!"</p><p></p><p>These Martial Kings entering the Origin Land would undergo a hundred-day ancestral blood battle.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Martial Lords would personally act as examiners, observing their performance.</p><p></p><p>Those who performed exceptionally well would be granted more ancestral blood.</p><p></p><p>Different levels and amounts of ancestral blood meant different potentials for them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mu Yan's words, Qi Yuan said lazily: "I want to become a Spirit Realm Martial Lord. Can you help me achieve that?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Realm Martial Lord... he had never heard of this term before.</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of this," Mu Yan said, "So I can't guarantee I can help you succeed."</p><p></p><p>He was a person who valued honesty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>He still had no clue about Spirit Realm Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Neither the Thunder Grand Venerable nor the other subjects in the Origin Land had discovered any information about Spirit Realm Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>It was like a mystery.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the monkey-faced woman looked a bit disappointed, her gaze towards Qi Yuan mixed with a hint of pity.</p><p></p><p>She was about to say something when Mu Yan pulled her away.</p><p></p><p>The two came to the lower deck, and the monkey-faced woman couldn't help but say: "This Qi Yuan seems a bit ungrateful. Brother Mu Yan, with your talent, you'll definitely become a Great Martial Lord in the future! If he misses this chance, he might not even have the opportunity to see you again later."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan's talent was indeed very strong.</p><p></p><p>In fact, among the Martial Kings on this big ship, his talent could rank in the top three.</p><p></p><p>Among all the Martial Kings heading to the Origin Land, his talent could enter the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, everyone has their own aspirations. Why force them? We've been through so many Mountain and Sea Scrolls, experienced so much life and death, we should have learned to see things in perspective by now," Mu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the monkey-faced woman didn't bring up this matter again, but instead said: "Brother Mu, I heard that one of the examiners for this ancestral blood battle is your ancestor. I wonder if you could put in a good word for this little woman?"</p><p></p><p>The monkey-faced woman's words carried humility.</p><p></p><p>This ancestral blood battle would have thirty-six examiners.</p><p></p><p>Among them, three were chief examiners.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan's blood ancestor was a Great Martial Lord and one of the examiners.</p><p></p><p>If they could get help from an examiner, even if their performance was a bit lacking, they could still be deemed "excellent".</p><p></p><p>"I can't guarantee this either. It all depends on one's own performance."</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan refused.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to get entangled with the monkey-faced woman.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan lay on the lounge chair, his eyes looking at the sky, occasionally glancing at the Black Sea, countless streams of information flowing.</p><p></p><p>"This place is not bad. There are traces of time everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Our ship seems to be sailing against time, from the present to the ancient, along the other shore of the river of time. It's very suitable for the Golden Canary."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Canary's divine realm was the same as time.</p><p></p><p>Bringing the Golden Canary here to comprehend time might rapidly increase its strength.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

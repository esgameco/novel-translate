        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jinli was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"I'm now in the Yiguan Prohibition, and I've subdued a group of little brothers. </p><p></p><p>Their strength should be decent, so defeating Sima Ting shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Do you want me to send them over to help you?" Qi Yuan had always kept Jinli's current situation in mind.</p><p></p><p>Since he had subdued the Yiguan Prohibition's Yibu Prohibition Army, he should quickly send them to help Jinli, as delaying even a day could lead to irreparable regret.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" A surge of immense joy welled up in Jinli's heart. If Qi Yuan was by her side, she couldn't imagine what crazy or somewhat abrupt actions she might take.</p><p></p><p>She dared to devote herself, but was afraid she wasn't worthy of him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you happy?" Qi Yuan said smugly, "I'll help you cheat."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt like he was a player who spent millions of yuan.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was just an ordinary player.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary player was also part of the gaming experience for a pay-to-win player.</p><p></p><p>Of course, more importantly, during his serious illness and living alone, Jinli was the only ray of light he could see.</p><p></p><p>"But if I send them over, the speed will be quite slow, and they'll have to attack from outside the city. Without anyone protecting you, Sima Ting might get desperate and make a reckless move.</p><p></p><p>How about this, you build a sacrificial altar and perform a ritual, and the Yibu Prohibition Army will appear.</p><p></p><p>Roughly three days should do it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully explained the method of summoning the Yibu Prohibition Army to Jinli, taking about half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted, Qi Yuan finally logged off.</p><p></p><p>And Xiaojia quietly embraced Qi Yuan, motionless, as if Qi Yuan was her everything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Summon the Yibu Prohibition Army!" A smile appeared in Jinli's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In it was the joy of surviving a calamity, as well as the joy of being able to see... Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the Minister of Rites Kong Qi..." Jinli spoke, then added another name, "and the Duke of Xue!"</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, Kong Qi and the Duke of Xue stood below the hall.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí, Hua Xian, and others also stood to the side.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Empress Jinli with a hint of confusion in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Minister Kong, I wish to build a sacrificial altar. Here are the blueprints, how long will it take to construct?" Jinli Empress handed a blueprint to Hua Xian, who then passed it to Kong Qi.</p><p></p><p>This blueprint was drawn by Jinli herself.</p><p></p><p>Kong Qi took the blueprint and looked at it carefully.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a puzzled expression appeared in his eyes: "Your Majesty, this sacrificial altar can be built in four to five days.</p><p>I wonder, what is the purpose of Your Majesty constructing this altar?"</p><p></p><p>Kong Qi was very perplexed.</p><p></p><p>The Duke of Xue next to him also seemed puzzled.</p><p>Now that Sima Ting had vicious ambitions, shouldn't they be thinking about how to respond or escape, why would she build this sacrificial altar?</p><p></p><p>Jinli's expression turned cold and stern: "Just do it, do not ask the reason!"</p><p></p><p>"This..." Kong Qi's expression became troubled, "Although I am the Minister of Rites, the Rites Department is actually under the control of that traitor Sima Ting.</p><p>To mobilize manpower and resources to build the sacrificial altar, I also need to find a suitable reason."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qin Yí was somewhat dissatisfied: "Doesn't the Emperor's decree count?"</p><p>Although she also didn't understand why the Emperor wanted to do this, she definitely supported the Emperor's actions.</p><p></p><p>"The reason can be that I want to make sacrifices to the heavens and my ancestors, is that enough?" Jinli said, feeling a bit distressed in her heart.</p><p>It was true that she had no control over the Six Departments at all.</p><p>She was like a lucky charm.</p><p>Her life and death were completely at the mercy of Sima Ting's mood.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty... I'm afraid it won't work." Kong Qi knelt on the ground, prostrating himself, his face full of shame, "I have failed in the imperial grace!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Although he was a great sage and had a renowned reputation in the Southern Qian, he could not even control the Ministry of Rites.</p><p></p><p>However, Kong Qi raised his head again: "Your Majesty, the most urgent task is to leave the imperial city. </p><p></p><p>Building the sacrificial altar is not a big deal. </p><p></p><p>Please Your Majesty focus on the overall situation, discuss the plan to leave the capital, and go to Yanbei Pass, ordering the Supreme Commander Tianqi to attack the rebels!"</p><p></p><p>In Kong Qi's view, building the sacrificial altar... what's the use?</p><p></p><p>The most urgent task now is for Your Majesty to leave the capital. </p><p></p><p>As long as Supreme Commander Tianqi is still loyal to Southern Qian, Your Majesty will still be the Emperor!</p><p></p><p>Jinli did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Building the sacrificial altar is very important. </p><p></p><p>But she could not say that she could summon the Imperial Guards, otherwise it might reach the ears of Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>This thing sounds strange, like a fantasy, but what if Sima Ting is cautious?</p><p></p><p>The Duke of Yu stood aside and also said in a low voice: "Your Majesty, it is better to leave the capital at this moment. </p><p></p><p>Leaving the capital is the only chance to survive!"</p><p></p><p>Although most of those present knew that it was almost impossible for the Emperor to successfully leave the capital, this was the only possible way to gain a chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's face darkened: "Build the sacrificial altar!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she must be stubborn and take a firm attitude!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Kong Qi was somewhat disappointed in Empress Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Although the previous emperor was also marginalized, he always wanted to break free from the cage and acted with the style of a wise ruler. </p><p></p><p>But Empress Jinli...</p><p></p><p>Kong Qi was bitterly distressed, and seeing Jinli's stubbornness, he burst into tears: "This humble official is useless and cannot relieve Your Majesty's worries. I wish to contribute three hundred and seventy taels of silver to help Your Majesty prepare for the construction of the sacrificial altar."</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and seventy taels of silver is a lot for ordinary people, but it is not enough for the construction of the sacrificial altar.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Duke of Yu sighed slowly: "Your Majesty, this is to share the decline of the country! I am willing to contribute eighty thousand taels of silver and eight hundred craftsmen to build the sacrificial altar for Your Majesty, which is the last thing this old man can do for Southern Qian."</p><p></p><p>Originally, his daughter Hui the Imperial Consort was pregnant, and the Empress was also pregnant. The two of them went out to appreciate the flowers together, and the palace maids brought a bowl of apricot flower snow and a bowl of ordinary soup.</p><p></p><p>Hui the Imperial Consort always liked to drink apricot flower snow, so the Empress shared some with her. </p><p></p><p>But who knew that someone had put poison in the soup, and Hui the Imperial Consort drank it and had a miscarriage, eventually dying in sorrow.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that if it were not for Hui the Imperial Consort, the one who drank that bowl of soup would have been the Empress, and then Empress Jinli would not have been born.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Hui the Imperial Consort and the child in her womb saved Empress Jinli's life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the outside world rumored that Hui the Imperial Consort was poisoned to death by the Empress out of jealousy, but the Duke of Yu knew that it was the work of Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>So when Empress Jinli came to the Duke of Yu's mansion to borrow books, the Duke of Yu violated the law and made Jinli kneel before his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Because his daughter, and the unborn grandson, died in place of Empress Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, he even treated Empress Jinli as his own granddaughter.</p><p></p><p>Jinli naturally did not know these things, and when she heard the Duke of Yu's words, she was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Duke of Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Money is important, but craftsmen are the most important. </p><p></p><p>The Duke of Yu provided eight hundred craftsmen, which can be said to have solved almost all the problems.</p><p></p><p>How could Jinli not be pleased?</p><p></p><p>The Duke of Yu looked at Empress Jinli and stood up, saying, "Your Majesty, I don't know what your purpose is in doing this. </p><p></p><p>But I want to say that your life was bought with the sacrifice of countless people! The life and death of Your Majesty is related to the safety of Southern Qian!</p><p></p><p>Please Your Majesty prioritize the country and the people. I will stay in the palace and build the sacrificial altar!"</p><p></p><p>His implication was that he would use the construction of the sacrificial altar as a cover, and then Empress Jinli could secretly leave.</p><p></p><p>Empress Jinli heard this, and even though she was not very smart, she could still understand the meaning behind the Duke of Yu's words. She said, "We understand."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

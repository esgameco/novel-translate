        <h1>Chapter 448</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Heavenly Venerable sat solemnly in the high seat, his eyes twinkling with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many of the younger generation will be able to grasp the Ultimate Truth at this Ultimate Truth Discourse Assembly, and whether anyone... will be able to comprehend the Supreme Ultimate Truth."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Heavenly Venerable was one of the elders of the Ultimate Truth Assembly. </p><p></p><p>All elders were at the realm of Great Ultimate Truth, the strongest beings in the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Winds stir and clouds gather, signs of a great era. Let us hope for more Ultimate Truths," said a Great Ultimate Truth expert from the Divine Luo Heaven, his voice mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if we can reach a hundred this time. Last time, only fifty-three grasped the Ultimate Truth," said another Great Ultimate Truth expert, his voice drawn out.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult."</p><p></p><p>"More than that, this old man is more concerned about whether anyone will comprehend the Supreme Ultimate Truth," said a Great Ultimate Truth expert from the Ghost Dominion Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables present all stirred upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Within the Six Heavens, it had been over a million years since a Yang Spirit had appeared who comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>Those few at the top were always the same.</p><p></p><p>"That Black Sword from the Black Demon Abyss... has extraordinary talent, and will likely comprehend the Supreme Ultimate Truth," said the Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable from the Moon Goddess Palace, her voice carrying a hint of praise and envy.</p><p></p><p>She was at the Great Ultimate Truth realm and possessed an offensive-type creation treasure. Apart from those few, she was among the strongest combat forces. </p><p></p><p>But she still deeply envied Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of Black Sword, all the Great Ultimate Truth experts present felt envious.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that at this time, the Black Demon Abyss would have such good fortune to produce a genius like Black Sword," sighed one Great Ultimate Truth expert, unable to hide the envy in his words.</p><p></p><p>He came from the White Dragon Abyss, one of the Four Abysses.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss had fewer Great Ultimate Truth experts than the Black Demon Abyss, and also lacked a Great Ultimate Truth expert who had mastered the Supreme Ultimate Truth to preside over it.</p><p></p><p>They were already weaker than the Black Demon Abyss, and now with the addition of Black Sword, the Black Demon Abyss had a bright future. How could he not be envious?</p><p></p><p>"Is Black Sword's talent and comprehension ability really as exaggerated as the legends say?" asked a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable curiously. </p><p></p><p>As a Great Ultimate Truth expert, he naturally understood how difficult it was to comprehend the Supreme Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with Yang Spirits as numerous as stars in the Six Heavens, those who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth would not number less than ten.</p><p></p><p>Some Great Ultimate Truth experts felt that Black Sword's talent was only as exaggerated as the legends claimed.</p><p></p><p>"If his talent and comprehension were not so extraordinary, why would all eight elders of the Black Demon Abyss gather to refine the Blood Essence Enlightenment Pill for him?"</p><p></p><p>"Refining this pill consumes the most vital energy. With the Linye Molt approaching, they dare to expend vital energy like this - they must be confident," said a Great Ultimate Truth expert.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of this, I heard that the Supreme Radiance Palace recently produced a genius who seems capable of comprehending the Supreme Ultimate Truth?" said the Supreme Heavenly Venerable, looking towards the Great Ultimate Truth expert from the Supreme Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables present were all shocked to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Because they had not received any news of this at all.</p><p></p><p>Especially Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable from the Moon Goddess Palace - her heart trembled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Radiance Palace had produced a peerless genius? The Great Ultimate Truth expert from the Supreme Radiance Palace narrowed his eyes with a brilliant smile: "As expected of the number one power in the Six Heavens, the Ultimate Truth Assembly can even obtain this kind of information.</p><p></p><p>Our Supreme Radiance Palace has indeed produced a genius, but as for comprehending the Supreme Ultimate Truth... that's another matter.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if he hasn't comprehended it yet?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Ultimate Truth experts present all wanted to suck in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Radiance Palace already had one Great Ultimate Truth expert who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>To add another... this was...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that expert from the Supreme Radiance Palace was already considered strong among those who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>To add another, wouldn't that mean the Supreme Radiance Palace would far surpass other powers and be on par with the Ultimate Truth Assembly?</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Heavenly Venerable narrowed his eyes, and no one knew what he was thinking: "It seems that in this Linye Molt, the Supreme Radiance Palace will be the biggest winner."</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens, the strongest power was naturally the Ultimate Truth Assembly, with a full two Great Ultimate Truth experts who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>This situation had persisted for nearly ten million years.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seemed there would be one more.</p><p></p><p>The Great Ultimate Truth experts present all smelled the thick gunpowder in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what the future holds?" said the Great Ultimate Truth expert from the Supreme Radiance Palace, glancing at Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable with a playful smile.</p><p></p><p>Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable felt wary and deeply worried.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Moon Goddess Palace was already slightly inferior to the Supreme Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>If the Supreme Radiance Palace gained another Great Ultimate Truth expert who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth, how could the Moon Goddess Palace contend?</p><p></p><p>But with this revelation, the Great Ultimate Truth experts present all fell silent, each sending messages back to their respective powers.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the Supreme Radiance Palace produced another Great Ultimate Truth expert who had comprehended the Supreme Ultimate Truth, the balance of power in the Six Heavens would shift again.</p><p></p><p>The most affected would be the Moon Goddess Palace and the Ultimate Truth Assembly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as the sound of the great Dao rang out, countless dao rhythms descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Great Ultimate Truth experts present all looked towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>They saw over a thousand Yang Spirits gathered together.</p><p></p><p>These Yang Spirits had surging auras and expressions that were either carefree or worried.</p><p></p><p>These Yang Spirits had all received invitations to the Ultimate Truth Discourse Assembly and gained the qualification to comprehend the Ultimate Truth at the Wall of Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these Yang Spirits, the Yang Spirits, Mythical beings and various geniuses in the surrounding area all looked on with envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when I'll be able to accumulate enough merits to go perceive at the Wall of Ultimate Truth," said a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable, his eyes full of envy.</p><p></p><p>He came from the First Heaven and had been working for the Ultimate Truth Assembly all along, just to accumulate enough merits to participate in the Ultimate Truth Discourse Assembly and go perceive at the Wall of Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>"These Yang Spirits will all be the true pillars of the Six Heavens in the future, bearing the Six Heavens on their shoulders!" said a Mythical expert enviously.</p><p></p><p>Some geniuses also looked on with jealousy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sister Ox Horn opened a jade slip and said enthusiastically: "The Ultimate Truth Discourse Assembly has begun. Hmm, Senior Brother Black Sword has already entered. See, that handsome one is Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>She was... live streaming.</p><p></p><p>That's right, live streaming for the other geniuses of the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the younger generation of the Black Demon Abyss all looked moved seeing this.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu thrust out her chest and glanced at Zi Yuan Xiao Lu: "Big Brother Black Sword can go perceive at the Wall of Ultimate Truth, while someone's admired Big Brother Blood Robe can only be a spectator."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu stomped her foot angrily: "Senior Brother Blood Robe is young, unlike some people who will probably smell like old people in a few years!"</p><p></p><p>"You..." An Xun Lu was also furious, her towering chest heaving up and down.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless gazes in the Six Heavens fell upon those thousand-plus Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yang Spirits rarely appeared in the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>For over a thousand Yang Spirits to appear at once was a sight many cultivators would see only once in their lives.</p><p></p><p>After all, normally they would find it difficult to even see one Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Now they could see so many, and not just ordinary Yang Spirits, but Yang Spirits with the potential for Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a man with an upright figure appeared, with endless halos behind him, looking majestic and boundless.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, if you enter the Ultimate Truth realm with the help of the Wall of Ultimate Truth and have no affiliations in the Six Heavens, you are welcome to join the Ultimate Truth Assembly at any time."</p><p></p><p>This Ultimate Truth realm Yang Spirit extended an olive branch.</p><p></p><p>As the power with the most Yang Spirits in the Six Heavens, the Ultimate Truth Assembly never forgot to recruit Yang Spirits to join.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason for the Ultimate Truth Assembly's continuous growth.</p><p></p><p>Many of these Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables were tempted, but even more</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Most remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, countless sacred places, taverns, and blessed lands were "broadcasting" scenes from the Dao Conference on Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, disguised as the Demon Flame Celestial Venerable, blended inconspicuously into the crowd. Suddenly, a gaze fell upon him with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Demon Flame seems somewhat different from before."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately looked over and saw an unfamiliar man.</p><p></p><p>The man wore a long dark blue robe that fit him perfectly. His expression was calm, but one could still sense the sharpness within.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this man, quickly searching through Demon Flame's memories: "Ah, it's Fellow Daoist Solar Day. We haven't met in many years. Your demeanor is even more impressive than before."</p><p></p><p>This Solar Day Celestial Venerable was from the Great Radiance Palace and had once briefly encountered Demon Flame.</p><p></p><p>Solar Day Celestial Venerable stared at Qi Yuan, his gaze profound: "It seems the Demon Luo clan will gain another Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit. Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>As Solar Day Celestial Venerable spoke, Qi Yuan sensed many powerful Yang Spirits turning their gazes upon him. </p><p></p><p>Of course, even more were focused on Solar Day Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Black Sword also approached, his gaze falling on Solar Day Celestial Venerable. With elegant wariness, he said: "The Great Radiance Palace has produced another prodigy. Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>Geniuses are always drawn to each other. Among so many Yang Spirits, he had immediately noticed Solar Day Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Solar Day Celestial Venerable's eyes held a smile, exuding indescribable charm: "I cannot compare to you, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Their exchange instantly attracted many gazes.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, he stood there like an insignificant figure, drawing almost no attention.</p><p></p><p>"This Demon Flame Celestial Venerable from the Demon Luo clan is too ugly. He's blocking my view of Brother Black Sword. I can't admire Brother Black Sword's beauty," An Xunlu couldn't help but lament.</p><p></p><p>However, some great Ultimate Principle cultivators revealed faint traces of strange expressions in their gazes.</p><p></p><p>"This Demon Flame seems somewhat special."</p><p></p><p>"His aura is hidden and subtle. Could he be about to achieve Ultimate Principle?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, they only spared him a glance.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to Black Sword and Solar Day Celestial Venerable, Qi Yuan's aura seemed far too weak.</p><p></p><p>The gathering of over a thousand Yang Spirits was shocking.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it wasn't that impressive. There weren't even as many as his spirit embryos.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start quickly. I just exercised my brain and feel incredibly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>During the Yin Spirit Dao Conference, Qi Yuan had rarely used his brain, and it was still in an active state.</p><p></p><p>This was rare and shouldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>So he was eager to go contemplate at the Wall of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a vast voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"All spirits enter. Let the Dao Conference begin!"</p><p></p><p>With this voice, suddenly an enormous, vast wall appeared in Qi Yuan's vision, covered in scars and wounds.</p><p></p><p>This wall bore various mottled marks, as if slashed and stabbed by swords.</p><p></p><p>This wall was the miraculous treasure, the Wall of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>All the Yang Spirits turned their gazes to this wall, their expressions becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, many Yang Spirits flew towards the Wall of Ultimate Principles, sitting cross-legged to carefully contemplate.</p><p></p><p>"Stillness tames the myriad movements, emptiness encompasses all realms. Today, I have come!" Solar Day Celestial Venerable strode forward, standing beneath the Wall of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>He did not sit, but stood.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword also slowly walked over, standing before the Wall of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan couldn't help but think: "Isn't standing or sitting very tiring? That's too much effort. You should conserve energy to let your brain work faster."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he walked to the base of the Wall of Ultimate Principles, brought out a bed, and sprawled out on it casually.</p><p></p><p>This way, blood flow to the brain would be more convenient, which was very scientific and beneficial for brain function in Qi Yuan's view.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by many cultivators, who were all shocked and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"This is... too frivolous, right? Actually bringing a bed to the Wall of Ultimate Principles!"</p><p></p><p>"What... is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Spirits were either sitting cross-legged or standing. No one had ever seen someone bring a bed like Qi Yuan before.</p><p></p><p>Even the great Ultimate Principle cultivators couldn't help but glance at Qi Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>"This Demon Flame Celestial Venerable is an interesting character. It's a pity he's from the Demon Luo clan. Otherwise, I would have liked to invite him to join our Ultimate Principle Association," Wusheng Celestial Venerable said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He continued, changing the subject: "Shall we place a bet on whether this Demon Flame Celestial Venerable can comprehend Ultimate Principle, and if so, at what level? I think he looks promising and should be able to comprehend... hmm, Earth-level Ultimate Principle."</p><p></p><p>"Wusheng Celestial Venerable, you seem to think highly of him?" the great Ultimate Principle cultivator from the Great Radiance Palace said calmly. "I've met Demon Flame before. He has some small talent, but not much. Being able to comprehend Yellow-level Ultimate Principle would already be considered very lucky for him."</p><p></p><p>"What's worth betting on this Demon Flame Celestial Venerable? If we're betting, we should bet on whether Black Sword or Solar Day will be the first to comprehend Supreme Ultimate Principle," the great Ultimate Principle cultivator from Ghost Dominion spoke up.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was particularly profound.</p><p></p><p>He harbored killing intent towards the prodigy from Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>If Black Sword truly comprehended Supreme Ultimate Principle, he would personally take action to kill Black Sword this time.</p><p></p><p>"I bet on Black Sword," Moon Radiance Celestial Venerable spoke, her voice calm.</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Palace had always been at odds with the Great Radiance Palace and had also fought with Black Demon Abyss, but their greatest enemy was the Great Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I also favor Black Sword," the great Ultimate Principle cultivator from Divine Luo Heaven said.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sword," the great Ultimate Principle cultivator from White Dragon Abyss said tersely.</p><p></p><p>They found it even more unacceptable for the Great Radiance Palace to gain another great Ultimate Principle cultivator who had comprehended Supreme Ultimate Principle than for Black Demon Abyss to gain a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>The one from the Great Radiance Palace had always acted tyrannically.</p><p></p><p>Back when the Buddhist Nation gained a great Ultimate Principle cultivator who sought to ascend to the Sixth Heaven, the Great Sun Radiant Buddha was directly killed by that one from the Great Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>If one who had mastered Supreme Ultimate Principle was already so tyrannical, two were simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the great Ultimate Principle cultivator from the Great Radiance Palace looked smug: "It seems none of you have faith in Solar Day. Naturally, I must vote for my own."</p><p></p><p>He looked particularly pleased, even somewhat arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Because when the Ultimate Principle Association announced the matter of Lin Yatuo to the world, he also had a major announcement to make.</p><p></p><p>At that time, hehe, these great Ultimate Principle cultivators would likely all be shocked.</p><p></p><p>This Sixth Heaven... was the Great Radiance Palace's Sixth Heaven!</p><p></p><p>All the powerful figures focused on the Wall of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>The birth of each Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit would change the dynamics of some regions.</p><p></p><p>If someone... comprehended Supreme Ultimate Principle, the balance of power in the entire Sixth Heaven would likely change.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, who do you favor?" Sister Ox Horn asked the Qi Yuan beside her.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan was of course not the real Qi Yuan, but one transformed from Qi Yuan's spirit embryo.</p><p></p><p>"I favor... Demon Flame. That guy looks like he can comprehend Supreme Ultimate Principle at a glance."</p><p></p><p>It's fine for one's own spirit embryo to praise oneself, right?</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Sister Ox Horn was stunned. "Has your brain malfunctioned again today?"</p><p></p><p>How could Supreme Ultimate Principle be so easily comprehended? Probably only Brother Black Sword could comprehend it this time.</p><p></p><p>As for the other prodigies, she hadn't heard any rumors about them.</p><p></p><p>So the attention and glory this time belonged to Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 284</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the residential complex.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu was driving the car, with Li Yan sitting in the passenger seat. The two were chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>Cui Fan lived in a different direction from the two of them. Li Yan and Wang Xu lived in the same direction, so Wang Xu gave Li Yan a ride.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the car, Li Yan's eyes sparkled: "You've only graduated for a year and already bought a car. Is the Maritime Affairs Bureau that lucrative?"</p><p></p><p>"Not really, it's just average. I was able to buy this car after working hard for a year, plus some help from my parents," Wang Xu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I heard your Maritime Affairs Bureau is quite busy. How come you're back in Tianyue this time?" Li Yan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Well... some criminals smuggled a batch of sea monsters into Tianyue City. I'm here to handle the handover," Wang Xu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The legendary sea monsters?" Li Yan exclaimed in surprise, covering her mouth. "What do they look like? Are they the same as on TV?"</p><p></p><p>"More or less. They're ugly, but the meat is tender and supposedly enhances male potency. That's why many rich people want to eat it. </p><p></p><p>However, sea monster meat is poisonous. Eating too much can cause physical mutations, so... it's best not to eat it at all." Talking about sea monsters, Wang Xu looked grave, as if recalling something frightening.</p><p></p><p>"I heard sea monsters have some magical abilities, like the legendary immortals with superpowers?" Li Yan asked eagerly, very interested in this topic.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu shook his head: "What era are we living in? Don't be so superstitious. There are no immortals in this world. Technology is the way forward!</p><p></p><p>Besides, even if the immortals recorded in ancient texts were to be reborn, they probably couldn't match our modern weapons!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning modern weapons, Wang Xu's eyes showed confidence.</p><p></p><p>In the mythology of the Qin Yuan Kingdom, immortals and martial gods were indeed powerful, able to fly and burrow underground, lift thousand-jin cauldrons! But even if they could lift thousand-jin cauldrons, could they match the power of a tractor?</p><p></p><p>Just like the martial arts that were mythologized, after modern scientific analysis and research, their upper limit is finite, merely tapping into the potential of one's physique and bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Even the champion of a martial arts tournament, if hit by a bullet, would lose most of their fighting power, not to mention more powerful technological weapons.</p><p></p><p>Studying martial arts is not as good as studying genetics.</p><p></p><p>As for mythology, it's just legend.</p><p></p><p>If those legendary gods who could fly and burrow appeared, could they survive being targeted by the Eye of Space?</p><p></p><p>The Eye of Space is the strongest weapon of the Qin Yuan Kingdom. Even if a Canstar battleship were hit by one shot, it would immediately collapse.</p><p></p><p>That's simply not something human power can resist.</p><p></p><p>"Although sea monsters are not worth mentioning, it's best for us ordinary people not to come into contact with them.</p><p></p><p>Those rich people who get into trouble still have ways to get rid of the problems, but for us ordinary folks... if we encounter them, we can probably only wait for death." Wang Xu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that exaggerated?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even more exaggerated than 'The Vampire Resurrection'!" Wang Xu chuckled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had finished communicating with Cui Fan and began to rest with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose those restarters have already begun... their adventure of a lifetime?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have much feeling about reincarnation or not.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if one used that foreknowledge, it would only be to make more money or pursue the path of power.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't care about those things.</p><p></p><p>If he needed money, wasn't there still high-interest loans?</p><p></p><p>If there were no high-interest loans, weren't there still those old and dim-sighted first loves?</p><p></p><p>Those people would surely be willing to lend him money.</p><p></p><p>He also couldn't be bothered to use foreknowledge to start a company or invest in some political figure.</p><p></p><p>Once his body was better, practicing martial arts was what he should be doing.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the bed, he began to compose a simplified version of the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in his current state, excessive mental exertion would make him feel drowsy and sleepy.</p><p></p><p>The creation of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" was also stumbling along, and he had to take short rests every now and then.</p><p></p><p>"This body really isn't fit for human habitation? I really admire my willpower on Blue Star."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>When he was on Blue Star, his body wasn't better than this one.</p><p></p><p>However, since this time he was only creating a simplified version derived from the "Qi Yuan Scripture", it was considered successful.</p><p></p><p>After about five hours, a simplified version of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" that could be cultivated to the seventh level of Qi Refining was completed.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, I even created an extra trash technique."</p><p></p><p>This revision also produced an additional, barely complete technique that could be cultivated to the seventh level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>This technique was naturally inferior to the simplified "Qi Yuan Scripture", but it was still created by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, those cultivators couldn't buy it even for a million spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Now I'm short on money... should I sell this technique?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"But before selling it, I need to give this technique an impressive name.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, clothes make the man and saddles make the horse. To sell it at a high price, I need to give it a grand and impressive name."</p><p></p><p>"How about calling it 'Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique'?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very satisfied with the name he came up with.</p><p></p><p>With such an impressive name, straightforward yet grand, selling it for 90 million wouldn't be too much, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, it's like a million per character in the name.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan registered an account on the most popular social media platform in Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>[Young man, do you want to become an immortal? Do you want to change your fate? For just 99.99 million, you can obtain the 'Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique'!]</p><p></p><p>For the video, he just took a few photos of the starry sky, casually typed a few words, and added a stirring background music.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to sell the technique, he also uploaded the first one percent of the technique's content.</p><p></p><p>"Appreciate 10,000 Qin Yuan coins, and you can send me a private message."</p><p></p><p>"Appreciate 100,000 Qin Yuan coins, and you can add my contact information."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan commented these two lines under the video he posted.</p><p></p><p>After all, without some barrier, what if some people harassed him? He was also too lazy to screen people. If it could be sold, that's good; if not, so be it.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Qi Yuan still invested 100 yuan to buy an advertisement for this video, to increase some exposure and views.</p><p></p><p>After finishing everything, Zero One also returned as night fell.</p><p></p><p>It brought several large bags of items and placed them in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes showed a worried expression: "Master, we don't have much funds left in our account, less than 2,000 yuan remaining."</p><p></p><p>As it spoke, it also printed out the shopping list for this time and handed it to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it's fine. Help me grind these materials..." Qi Yuan began to instruct Zero One.</p><p></p><p>These materials had different processing methods, but most needed to be ground.</p><p></p><p>He currently lacked physical strength and his kidneys were weak, so he needed to rely on this not-so-intelligent robot.</p><p></p><p>"As you command." Zero One received the order and went to the kitchen with the bags.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Zero One reappeared with the processed materials.</p><p></p><p>The room was filled with a special medicinal smell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and Zero One obediently left.</p><p></p><p>In the room, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the various medicinal liquids and began to mix them.</p><p></p><p>"Yingshan Blood is yin in nature, Purple Mountain Grass is yang, balancing yin and yang..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan drank the mixed medicinal liquid. Immediately, a spicy, cool sensation mixed with a special fragrance assaulted his taste buds, filling Qi Yuan's palate, like a combination of bitter gourd and fish mint.</p><p></p><p>The simplified version of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" also began to operate at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body was currently too weak. Without some supplementation first, rashly starting cultivation could lead to death.</p><p></p><p>That's why he needed the medicinal liquid as an aid.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy also entered his body at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes tightly, continuously circulating the technique.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, in his tightly closed eyes, he seemed to see a glimmer of spiritual light.</p><p></p><p>He quickly grasped it.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual light was consumed by him, and his body also began to slowly change at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Reached the second level of Qi Refining..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself. His skin was now whiter and more crystalline than before.</p><p></p><p>There was also an additional strand of spiritual energy inside his body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to his main body, this was insignificant, but on Gongxing, it could be considered as having some self-protection ability.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However... the feeling of physical weakness still persisted.</p><p></p><p>The curse within his body still existed, and its impact on his body was still very serious. </p><p></p><p>But due to his improved cultivation, the time he could stay alive had increased a little.</p><p></p><p>"Lightness Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately cast a spell on himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, his body was too heavy, and he would be out of breath after walking for a while. He could only use magic to alleviate this situation.</p><p></p><p>After using the Lightness Technique, Qi Yuan felt as light as a swallow, like he had just taken off sandbags tied to his legs. He went to the bathroom, washed up and bathed, then came to the living room.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One, how is the research on martial arts going? My body has greatly improved, and I want to practice martial arts to strengthen my body."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chose a more tactful way of expressing himself.</p><p></p><p>He was practicing martial arts not to court death, but to strengthen his body.</p><p></p><p>The robot Zero One paused for a moment, then answered honestly: "Generally speaking, there are three ways to get started with martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The first is to join a martial arts gym; the second is to find a famous martial arts master and become their disciple; the third is to stumble upon a martial arts secret manual."</p><p></p><p>"What martial arts gyms in Tianyue City can help me get started with martial arts?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He directly chose the first method.</p><p></p><p>The second method was equivalent to becoming someone else's successor, which was especially troublesome and might even require taking care of them in old age.</p><p></p><p>The third method was like something out of a TV show.</p><p></p><p>So, the first one was more reliable.</p><p></p><p>"There are 28 martial arts gyms in Tianyue City that meet the master's goals.</p><p></p><p>The closest one is called Mingwu Martial Arts Gym. The fee for regular students is 7,800 yuan per year.</p><p></p><p>To learn true martial arts, the registration fee is 120,000 yuan per year."</p><p></p><p>"So expensive?" Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have that much money now.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he needed to get some money.</p><p></p><p>For him now, there were two ways to get money.</p><p></p><p>One was through Cui Fan's high-interest loans, and the other was through the "Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique".</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he logged into his account to check the video he had posted.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had invested 100 yuan, and there were more than a dozen comments on the video.</p><p></p><p>"Have you gone crazy thinking about money?"</p><p></p><p>"I am the creator god from mythology, now reborn, in urgent need of startup funds. Send me 1 million and I'll make you the god of water."</p><p></p><p>"This scammer is so unprofessional!"</p><p></p><p>"This isn't a scammer, it's clearly a comedy video. Otherwise, who would name a cultivation technique 'Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique'?"</p><p></p><p>"At least they're not scamming poor people."</p><p></p><p>Looking at these comments, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is my name not good?" He thought it was quite good. "The people on this Arch Star are so rude, not at all like those on the Shenhua Forum."</p><p></p><p>On the Shenhua Forum, whenever he posted, 99% of the replies were compliments, full of praise.</p><p></p><p>It showed how harmonious society was and how moral cultivators were.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the people on Arch Star were full of keyboard warriors in the comments.</p><p></p><p>"As they say, when successful one should help the world, when poor one should cultivate oneself! After I master my divine skills, I must work hard to improve social morality and create a civilized and harmonious society."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then commented on his own post again.</p><p></p><p>"Those who want it, come quickly. Once I don't need money anymore, I won't bother selling it."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan logged off.</p><p></p><p>Three days passed, and Qi Yuan's post got more and more views and comments.</p><p></p><p>It even reached a thousand comments.</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a newcomer with a real-name account, so the platform would provide some support.</p><p></p><p>Most of the comments below were just memes.</p><p></p><p>Not a single person wanted to buy the technique.</p><p></p><p>"The economic power of this generation of netizens is not good, they can't even afford 9,999."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't bother to look anymore.</p><p></p><p>Everything would happen as it was meant to. If it didn't sell, then it didn't sell.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was about to go on a blind date with Xiao Mei.</p><p></p><p>And he still had to borrow money through Cui Fan's high-interest loan connection.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched his lazy body, cast a Lightness Technique on himself, and then walked out of his home.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sun in the sky, Qi Yuan felt lazy all over.</p><p></p><p>He scanned his surroundings, showing a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>This world was very similar to Blue Star, but obviously, the technology was a big step ahead of Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Interstellar travel had been realized, and there were even tourist routes established between Arch Star and Brilliant Star. Every year, some rich people and retired high-ranking officials would take spaceships to Brilliant Star for tourism or to settle down.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the community, Qi Yuan took the subway.</p><p></p><p>The place he had set for the blind date with Xiao Mei was called Qin Deji.</p><p></p><p>At first, he wanted to choose Yuan County Snacks, because there was a rumor online that blind dates at Yuan County led to sparks flying.</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, he still chose the more westernized Qin Deji.</p><p></p><p>Qin Deji's status in the Qin Yuan country was similar to that of Wallace in Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Choosing this place couldn't go wrong.</p><p></p><p>He soon arrived at Qin Deji.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't mealtime yet, so there were only a few scattered customers in Qin Deji.</p><p></p><p>However, occasionally some delivery riders would come to pick up takeout orders.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, playing with his phone, occasionally scrolling through the comments on the video he posted.</p><p></p><p>Most of the comments below were memes, and some were advertisements.</p><p></p><p>"Stealing business?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the comments below, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to respond.</p><p></p><p>"This Xiao Mei is already ten minutes late..."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the time, showing a strange expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, that Xiao Mei definitely had something going on with Cui Fan.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, how could she deliberately take time off for a blind date? Had something unexpected happened?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to wait a few more minutes. If she didn't show up, he would send a message to Cui Fan to ask about the high-interest loan.</p><p></p><p>About five minutes passed.</p><p></p><p>A faint fragrance wafted over, and a tall woman wearing a black bodysuit entered.</p><p></p><p>Her face was quite beautiful, with a somewhat foxy charm.</p><p></p><p>Accentuated by the bodysuit, her figure was also extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Qi Yuan, revealing a hint of profound meaning in the depths of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She walked straight over and sat down opposite Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hello Qi Yuan, I'm Xiao Mei, your blind date this time. I'm sorry I'm late, there was a traffic jam..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the woman, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>The woman before him was excessively beautiful and alluring, and she also exuded a strange aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who had experienced multiple worlds, could tell at a glance that this woman had killed before.</p><p></p><p>"As soon as you speak, my nose grows longer.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Zhang Wuji's mother was right, beautiful women love to lie the most."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually, not bothering to dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm hungry, why don't you order some food."</p><p></p><p>He knew that this blind date would probably end up fruitless.</p><p></p><p>Might as well take the chance to eat something.</p><p></p><p>He was short on money now, so it wasn't too much to let his blind date pay for the meal, right?</p><p></p><p>"You order, I'm fine with anything," said the woman called Xiao Mei, looking at Qi Yuan with a rather complex expression in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's a blind date, let's eat something good. Otherwise, people might look down on us. Let's get this 198 yuan family bucket," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The woman didn't have much reaction.</p><p></p><p>But a man nearby couldn't help laughing: "Bro, you're too funny. Such a beautiful blind date, and you bring her to Qin Deji? And you call a 198 yuan meal 'eating something good'?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the man and took out a card from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"Mind your own business."</p><p></p><p>The man was stunned, looking at the card, thinking Qi Yuan might be some kind of public official.</p><p></p><p>Even the woman in the bodysuit was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, when the man saw Qi Yuan's card clearly, a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even finish his meal, hurriedly paid and left.</p><p></p><p>He had encountered a mentally ill person!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan was quite pleased. This card was really useful.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the woman opposite him couldn't help but smile: "Qi Yuan, you're really unexpected."</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Please forgive the temporary update schedule. Once I'm feeling better, I'll make up for the missed updates.</p><p></p><p>Happy New Year!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

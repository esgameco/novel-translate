        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Anyone from the mortal realm with common sense knows that the Great Venerable Youlong is in charge of agriculture.</p><p></p><p>Yet, an additional Earth God appeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "This shows your lack of experience!"</p><p></p><p>In the previous life on Blue Star, the Earth God had extremely prosperous worship.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi still couldn't understand. </p><p></p><p>After all, this type of god with divine duties was rare and precious.</p><p></p><p>How many subjects practiced the Great Venerable Youlong's deity visualization method? Qi Qi knew it must be a lot.</p><p></p><p>When considering the crop yields in her godfather's fief, Qi Qi had thought about the Great Venerable Youlong's deity visualization method, but ultimately gave up.</p><p></p><p>Too many people visualized him, so it had almost no effect.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you take Little Snow to try it in the fields?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't explain further to Qi Qi, as he was busy compiling his own "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>He was also pondering which village to go feast in tonight.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Qi led her maid Little Snow, she couldn't help but imagine the scene of the big black dog knocking down Zhu Zhuangshi while feasting.</p><p></p><p>"Little Snow, now that you've reached the Purple Palace realm, you won't bully me, will you?" Qi Qi asked.</p><p></p><p>"How could I, Miss!" The maid Little Snow anxiously waved her hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi then smiled and said: "How does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>She was still puzzled in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation was that the true god was very powerful, and also held some divine duties related to agriculture.</p><p></p><p>Only this could explain why it was an epic one-star.</p><p></p><p>Leading her maid Little Snow, the two came to the ridge between fields.</p><p></p><p>Now Qingshui Village had water and grew many crops, similar to wheat, rice, and sweet potatoes.</p><p></p><p>These were somewhat similar to those on Blue Star, but not exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>There was some spiritual energy contained in these crops.</p><p></p><p>Being a cultivation world, it was not restricted by the four seasons.</p><p></p><p>"Miss!" The village chief saw Qi Qi arrive and had a respectful look on his face.</p><p></p><p>The adopted daughter of a deity was the treasure of their Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked at the man in hemp clothing beside the village chief: "Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Miss has been diligent in farming lately, so I invited Mr. Xu Youping here from Shisha Town.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xu is the most skilled in agriculture among the seven nearby towns. He has visualized the Great Venerable Youlong and gained some attainment." Village Chief Yu Lu introduced.</p><p></p><p>Shisha Town was the only one among the seven towns under Flying Wasteland City that worshipped the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping was an official in charge of agriculture in Shisha Town, with quite a noble status.</p><p></p><p>He had achieved considerable success in visualizing the Great Venerable Youlong.</p><p></p><p>Although many people visualized the Great Venerable Youlong, some geniuses still stood out and achieved remarkable accomplishments. He was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping looked at the fields of Qingshui Village and sighed: "The land is too barren. Even if I exert all my efforts, I'm afraid I can only increase the yield by half a percent."</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu was not surprised by this answer: "That's already very good."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi stood to the side and suddenly turned to her maid Little Snow: "Didn't the deity say your innate divine ability is related to agriculture? Why don't you give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu then looked at the maid Little Snow, with an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't she just at the Yuan Dan realm when they feasted together yesterday?</p><p></p><p>How did she directly... reach the Purple Palace realm?</p><p></p><p>Deity visualization method! Village Chief Yu Lu thought of this and was completely unsettled!</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping glanced at Little Snow and bowed: "I didn't expect to meet a fellow practitioner!"</p><p></p><p>There were many Purple Palace cultivators in Shisha Town, so Xu Youping was neither humble nor arrogant when facing a Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He thought Little Snow was like him, both visualizing the Great Venerable Youlong, so she knew some agricultural skills.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, too many people visualize the Great Venerable Youlong.</p><p></p><p>Even those who become true gods by relying on themselves can only increase crop yields by sixty to seventy percent." Xu Youping couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The maid Little Snow was eager to try: "Let me give it a try!"</p><p></p><p>She was about to use her innate divine ability, with Xu Youping watching from the side.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the maid Little Snow suddenly looked crestfallen: "Miss, part of the effect of my innate divine ability... still needs your cooperation."</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>An innate divine ability... that still needed cooperation from others?</p><p></p><p>This was simply unheard of to them.</p><p></p><p>"How do I cooperate?" Qi Qi asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to pray to me for a good harvest." The maid Little Snow said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was a bit confused, but still did as Little Snow said: "May all the crops in godfather's fief grow strong, have a bountiful harvest, and yield a bumper crop!"</p><p></p><p>The maid Little Snow then closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>A special aura spread from her body.</p><p></p><p>The innate divine ability she wielded was very special. One of its abilities was to connect heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>That is, to transmit the prayers of all people to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Little Snow was also a bit puzzled in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Then... the heavens responded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked at the maid Little Snow: "How is it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping said strangely: "This is the first time I've seen such..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, the maid Little Snow's height shrank dramatically, as if she had become a porcelain doll.</p><p></p><p>A special gas appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>She opened her eyes, which were majestic yet benevolent: "By the decree of the heavens, this land shall... have favorable weather and bountiful harvests!"</p><p></p><p>With her voice, the special gas flew from her hand and fell between the fields.</p><p></p><p>Not just the fields of Qingshui Village, but also those of Shi Family Village, Chen West Village, and others.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Xu Youping looked at the spreading gas with a confused expression.</p><p></p><p>How could agriculture be managed like this?</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't it involve rain, fertilizing, loosening soil, weeding, and pest control?</p><p></p><p>What was this little potato doing? However, in the next moment, his eyes widened!</p><p></p><p>Only to see that as the special gas fell between the fields, shocking changes occurred.</p><p></p><p>The crops that were just tender shoots suddenly grew at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>The stems became thicker, and branches kept sprouting.</p><p></p><p>The previously desolate fields were covered in green.</p><p></p><p>The young crop seedlings seemed to have experienced the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>"Pulling up seedlings to help them grow?" Xu Youping's eyes widened, "Could it be this kind of spell? But... this kind of spell only makes the crops look like they're growing fast, but they don't actually bear fruit!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Xu Youping thought only "pulling up seedlings to help them grow" could explain it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi was also startled.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be this kind of unorthodox agricultural divine duty?</p><p></p><p>Named agriculture, but actually an evil path.</p><p></p><p>However, what happened next in the fields completely dispelled her doubts.</p><p></p><p>The crops that seemed to have been "pulled up to help them grow" actually bore fruit.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen breaths of time, wheat, rice and other crops covered the fields, a golden expanse like waves of gold.</p><p></p><p>The branches were heavily laden with fruit.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the harvest, it was much stronger than normal growth... by who knows how much.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually not pulling up seedlings to help them grow! What on earth is going on?" Xu Youping grabbed a handful of rice and looked at it carefully, becoming unsettled, "What kind of innate divine ability is this exactly, which deity did you visualize?"</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, the previous crop seedlings had directly... matured.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but the yield had even doubled! Either of these alone would be enough to shock the world, but the two were combined.</p><p></p><p>This was too... outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"This innate divine ability is called Connecting Heaven and Earth. The deity I visualized is called the Earth God." There was nothing to hide about this, so the maid Little Snow quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"Earth God?" Xu Youping muttered this name with a bewildered expression, "How can there be such a true god? Why do I know nothing about it?"</p><p></p><p>He ranked third among those in charge of agriculture in Shisha Town.</p><p></p><p>He could say he knew everything about deities related to agriculture.</p><p></p><p>Yet he had never heard of this Earth God!</p><p></p><p>If it only had a little achievement in agriculture, that would be understandable.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that this so-called Earth God... was comparable to the Great Venerable Youlong.</p><p></p><p>How could such a big shot never have been heard of? Xu Youping was utterly perplexed: "Is this kind of innate divine ability... one-time use?"</p><p></p><p>If so, it would be understandable.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the maid Little Snow who seemed somewhat weak.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I've consumed too much energy." The maid Little Snow said, "I need to eat a whole pig to recover before I can use it again!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping: "..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi: "..."</p><p></p><p>In the temple, Qi Yuan's eyes showed curiosity.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the deity visualization method in his hand, which was still glowing golden.</p><p></p><p>"This deity visualization method seems to be usable for others to visualize as well.</p><p></p><p>It's just that... the effect may be worse than Little Snow's.</p><p></p><p>But... it should be good enough."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt it was time for a village to have an Earth God.</p><p></p><p>The Earth God didn't just manage agriculture, but could also keep an area safe and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed to have very keen ears, knowing about any disturbances.</p><p></p><p>In "Journey to the West", whenever Sun Wukong had something to do, he would always find the Earth God to inquire.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shisha Town.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping returned to town with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>After returning to town, he went to the temple first thing.</p><p></p><p>"Paying respects to the deity!"</p><p></p><p>The deity of Shisha Town was named Ruoyu, a divine being at the peak of the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Ruoyu wore all white</p><p></p><p>Here is an English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...with a feather stuck in his hair. His eyes were sunken, looking very tired.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen the ancient god of Qingshui Village?" Ruoyu asked.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, except for Shisha Town, almost all other towns and villages below worshipped the new gods. </p><p></p><p>The Origin Sovereign of Qingshui Village was an exception, and had even killed several new gods, making him quite conspicuous in the area.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that quite a few deities had already taken notice of him.</p><p></p><p>However, since Qingshui Village belonged to Kuangfeng Town, other powerful new gods had not made a move against the Origin Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't see him, but... something extremely exaggerated happened today!" Xu Youping described it as extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Ruoyu showed a hint of interest.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping then told Ruoyu about today's events.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ruoyu's eyes also showed a look of surprise: "It turns out to be a deity even more powerful than Lord Youlong, and in charge of agriculture? Strange, how come I've never heard of this before."</p><p></p><p>The memories before his death had already been revived.</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of such a deity.</p><p></p><p>"If this person came to our Shisha Town, I'm confident that grain production would increase several times every year, and we would never have to worry about people going hungry under our rule!" Xu Youping said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ruoyu also nodded: "Indeed."</p><p></p><p>However, there wasn't much excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even if agricultural yields were good, even if they increased tenfold or a hundredfold, so what?</p><p></p><p>This couldn't fundamentally change the big picture.</p><p></p><p>Now, the threat from the other six towns was imminent.</p><p></p><p>The ancient god Yuan had not appeared for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The entire Flying Wasteland City was in turmoil beneath the surface.</p><p></p><p>Only military power was the key to breaking the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>No matter how good the harvest in Qingshui Village was, no matter how much grain was stockpiled.</p><p></p><p>Once the evil god Civet Wolf of Kuangfeng Town made a move, wouldn't all these things fall into Civet Wolf's hands?</p><p></p><p>"What do you think about the Origin Sovereign?" Ruoyu asked.</p><p></p><p>"This ancient god must have had a very high status and position in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has produced two deity observation methods, which seem to be very precious and rare.</p><p></p><p>If given a few decades of time, plus treasures for breaking through to become a true god.</p><p></p><p>He might really be able to become a true god, like the ancient god Yuan." Xu Youping answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the worry in Ruoyu's eyes deepened.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, people from the five major families had secretly contacted the evil gods of the other six towns, seemingly plotting something big.</p><p></p><p>Ruoyu felt a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He felt that something big was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>"Tell that deity of Qingshui Village that something big may happen in Flying Wasteland City, and tell him to be prepared. If... the situation is already decided, self-preservation is paramount." Ruoyu spoke, his voice devoid of any emotional color.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the joy in Xu Youping's heart cooled by half, as if doused with cold water.</p><p></p><p>"Great Deity, is the situation that serious?" he couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan, with an elderly man behind him, had a curious look in his eyes: "Yu Lu, what did the great deity ask us to bring these people skilled in farming for?"</p><p></p><p>Now, the leaders of these few villages had all brought an old man most skilled in farming from their village.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to today's anomaly in the farmlands?" Chen Xifan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Today, all the farmlands suddenly had crops growing rapidly, with the crops immediately ripening.</p><p></p><p>Such a miracle truly shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The great deity has newly conceived a deity observation method, and wishes to bestow these observation methods on those skilled in farming." Village head Yu Lu smoked his pipe, his tone rather unbalanced.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shi Zhongshan and Chen Xifan's hearts suddenly skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"A new deity observation method?"</p><p></p><p>"Bestowed on those skilled in farming?"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, is it too late for me to go learn farming now?"</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the few villages present were envious and jealous.</p><p></p><p>This was a new deity observation method.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Zhu Zhuangshi's black dog learned a deity observation method, its status changed greatly, and it directly sat at the table to eat.</p><p></p><p>This made them extremely jealous.</p><p></p><p>Those old men in charge of farming, hearing this, showed expressions of pleasant surprise on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"This old man also has a chance to see a deity observation method?"</p><p></p><p>"The great deity is our eternal god!"</p><p></p><p>These people were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Under Yu Lu's lead.</p><p></p><p>These people came to the temple, first kowtowing, then entering.</p><p></p><p>More than ten people entered, and saw Qi Yuan with his eyes closed, creating techniques.</p><p></p><p>"You've come?" Qi Yuan opened his eyes and went straight to the point, "These people... are the ones skilled in farming?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The old men present hurriedly answered, joy evident on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"This deity observation method shall be bestowed upon you all to observe together!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan threw the observation method into the air.</p><p></p><p>Yu Lu, Shi Zhongshan, Chen Xifan and others saw the deity observation method shining with golden light, their eyes turning red.</p><p></p><p>This was an epic-level observation method that would definitely create true gods.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely envious, Chen Xifan even drooled.</p><p></p><p>Those few old men hurriedly knelt down to give thanks before starting to seriously observe those deity observation methods.</p><p></p><p>Standing to the side, Chen Xifan looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help but speak: "Great Deity... could I... could I observe the big black dog's deity observation method? Recently I've often been staying with the village dogs to learn."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shi Zhongshan inwardly cursed Chen Xifan for being shameless.</p><p></p><p>How could he say such things.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly also stood up and said: "Great Deity, the other day I already became sworn brothers of a different surname with the divine dog, and I yearn for that deity observation method in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two of them and said playfully: "That deity observation method is of limited level, probably only able to create one true god, so I won't show it to you."</p><p></p><p>After all, creating ten Purple Mansion realm cultivators is not as good as one true god.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two were immediately speechless.</p><p></p><p>True god?</p><p></p><p>They hadn't thought about it, being able to become Purple Mansion realm was already very exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>As a result... the great deity actually thought about true gods, overestimating them too much.</p><p></p><p>Could their broken mountain village produce true gods? Was their ancestral grave smoking?</p><p></p><p>"Today, continue to hunt and kill evil gods, then hold a feast.</p><p></p><p>The more spiritual power from evil gods, the more deity observation methods.</p><p></p><p>Don't worry, you won't lack them in the future." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Get ready, we're about to set out!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the people present were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>But some also had worried looks on their faces, afraid that the great deity was just giving them empty promises.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Flying Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying looked at the drizzle outside the window, her hands propping up her chin, her eyes filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a man wearing tight clothes knocked and entered. The worry in Huang Mengying's eyes disappeared, and she asked coldly: "How is it?"</p><p></p><p>The man lowered his head, his expression not very good: "A few days ago, the five major families have already gone to collude with the evil gods of each town, seemingly planning something big."</p><p></p><p>"Summoning new gods?" Hearing this, Huang Mengying's heart chilled.</p><p></p><p>The five major families have finally come to this step, no longer hiding?</p><p></p><p>"Most likely." The man answered.</p><p></p><p>"Pass down orders to prepare more medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>Also, go to the neighboring city and buy some medicinal herbs at a high price, and invite some doctors over!" Huang Mengying ordered.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the new gods summoned by the five major families, she had a rough idea.</p><p></p><p>It was a new god related to plagues.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the five major families and those new gods would definitely spread some plagues.</p><p></p><p>They could not kill those evil gods, nor could they prevent them from spreading plagues, they could only prevent and let fewer people die.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." The man said.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Huang Mengying thought of something and asked: "How is that ancient god of Qingshui Village?"</p><p></p><p>Back then, she and Nangong Wuji had met that ancient god once, and she had some impression of that ancient god.</p><p></p><p>"According to the news from below, he seems to have conquered several more villages of new gods."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Mengying couldn't help but sigh: "Truly an ancient god who hates evil, it's a pity that his strength is a bit weak, and the time left for him... is not much."</p><p></p><p>In such a chaotic world, those who believe in ancient gods have no way to survive.</p><p></p><p>And believing in new gods, although one can obtain temporary peace, in the long run, one will be assimilated and completely lose oneself.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying naturally did not want to see the place where she grew up filled with walking corpses everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Huang Mengying asked: "How is the contact with... the Ancient God Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the man's face darkened: "The Ancient God Alliance has no manpower to help our Flying Wasteland City, their liaison said that if we leave Flying Wasteland City, they can provide assistance."</p><p></p><p>"Leave... this matter cannot be mentioned." How could she, Huang Mengying, leave the place that gave birth to her and raised her, how could she bear to see tens of thousands of people become walking corpses, "Find a time to tell the ancient god of Qingshui Village about the news of the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He has good potential, if he goes to the Ancient God Alliance, it's not impossible for him to become a true god in the future."</p><p></p><p>PS: There's one more chapter, before 12 o'clock, sorry sorry.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to God's Tearless for the third thousand reward, thanks to LH Parallel Line, Gennr, Mainstream Lemon Tea for the thousand reward, thanks to Steel Comes Germany, Autumn Leisure Occupying the Sofa, Lacking Books Ah, deak, Dead Wood and Green Leaves, remylove, Book Friend 20200928025308099, Tomb Heart g, Book Friend 20210211024501502 and other big shots for their rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

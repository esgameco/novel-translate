        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scene of enlightenment from the past was long gone.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qi Yuan brought the canary and Ning Tao, it happened to rain.</p><p></p><p>This rain was just like in the past.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the canary used a banana leaf to shield Qi Yuan, who was a blood pearl, from the rain.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the canary got soaking wet and even sneezed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then used a small magic spell to light a fire for warmth.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he accidentally set the canary's tail on fire.</p><p></p><p>This infuriated the beauty-loving canary.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the rain fell again, the three of them got wet together.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan and the canary, a hint of affection flashing in her beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had been begging everywhere and had acquired nearly a hundred divine spells.</p><p></p><p>One divine spell was equivalent to a fixed star.</p><p></p><p>Now, with ten suns in the sky, his power was considerable, but Ning Tao understood how formidable the enemies Qi Yuan faced were.</p><p></p><p>Condensing one more fixed star golden core would increase her husband's strength significantly.</p><p></p><p>And to swallow a new fixed star required her full concentration.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan and the excited canary, making a decision in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"The world changes, but as long as one controls the power of time, one can return to the past somewhat."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stretched out her delicate jade hand, wielding the power of the divine realm in this moment.</p><p></p><p>The previously barren Jiupan Mountain suddenly became full of spring vitality.</p><p></p><p>Banana trees sprouted green leaves, red flowers bloomed, and streams gurgled in the mountain valleys.</p><p></p><p>Moss crept up the rocks, and green vines intertwined with trees.</p><p></p><p>The scene before them was just like before.</p><p></p><p>All that was missing were the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and the insects.</p><p></p><p>"It's just like before, only lacking some sentient creatures," Qi Yuan commented, memories of the past flooding back.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a banana leaf shielded his head, and the canary's little face turned red: "Isn't it better without other creatures? We can do whatever we want..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she secretly grabbed Qi Yuan's sleeve, her cute starry eyes filled with expectation, her long eyelashes fluttering.</p><p></p><p>"It's daytime now..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to this young lady's home!" The canary pulled on Qi Yuan's sleeve, walking towards her former home.</p><p></p><p>Petite and delicate, she was like a flower fairy.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao also came over at this time, her eyes smiling, dressed in a black gown, cold yet charming: "Didn't husband say rainy days are best for sleeping?"</p><p></p><p>The canary also blinked her eyes and said fiercely: "Two against one, the minority follows the majority, you have no choice but to comply!"</p><p></p><p>"You're not playing fair!"</p><p></p><p>The rain drizzled, sometimes stopping abruptly, another day of drunken revelry.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan once again believed that rainy days were indeed suitable for sleeping.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that many times were suitable for sleeping.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and three months was but a nap for immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Guiqi City was the center of the Flowing Wind Realm, the most prosperous and flourishing city.</p><p></p><p>Its name took the "Gui" character from Wugui City and the "Qi" character from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, few later generations knew the origin of this city's name.</p><p></p><p>Now, Guiqi City was bustling with noise and excitement, with Buddhist light shining brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, one might think they had arrived in the city of "Ultimate Wisdom".</p><p></p><p>Among three people, there must be one bald head.</p><p></p><p>This Great Buddhist Assembly held in Guiqi City was the biggest event in the Flowing Wind Realm in ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that wasn't all.</p><p></p><p>This matter also concerned the battles and potential unification of the Buddhist Holy Lands in the Fifth Heaven above.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this Great Buddhist Assembly not only had many Buddhist disciples from the upper realms participating.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Sixth Heaven above, many eyes were watching the Flowing Wind Realm, waiting for its outcome.</p><p></p><p>This small Great Buddhist Assembly concerned the future direction of the Buddhist Holy Lands.</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Buddhachild, dressed in monk's robes, stood amidst Buddhist light. Anyone who saw him involuntarily felt they had encountered a young true Buddha.</p><p></p><p>However, Ling Yayi beside him, though dressed properly with his head shaved shiny bald and pretending to be profound in Buddhist teachings, still looked sleazy and frivolous.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came: "Wuguang Buddhachild, the person you sought this time seems rather ordinary."</p><p></p><p>A bald Buddhist nun strode over, her loose white Buddhist robe revealing her chest.</p><p></p><p>Beside the bald Buddhist nun stood a wooden-faced bald old man.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi's gaze immediately went straight, then quickly moved away to land on the wooden-faced old man: "Hehe, Old Yu, you're not as handsome as this little old man after shaving your head."</p><p></p><p>This wooden-faced old man was Yu Daoren.</p><p></p><p>"This new person you found is no good. He has neither Buddhist nature nor the courage to act on his desires. If you want to look, look boldly!" As the Buddhist nun spoke, she deliberately pulled her robe open a bit more.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi's face immediately turned red, unable to speak, feeling somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>After all, he not only peeked but also wanted to help Yu Daoren get revenge by recording this bald Buddhist nun with a recording stone.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Lotus Buddhist Nun, they may lack Buddhist nature, but they possess the power of reincarnation, which is enough," Wuguang Buddhachild spoke, his voice clear yet solemn.</p><p></p><p>Purple Lotus Buddhist Nun then smiled: "The power of reincarnation is indeed our Buddha's infinite true words. I wonder if they have the insight to comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"If they can comprehend it, the endless wars in the Buddhist lands might cease."</p><p></p><p>A Buddhist child stepped forward, dignified and holy, representing another Buddhist Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>For every Holy Land, there was at least one true Buddha guarding it, that is, a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Within the Buddhist lands, there were nearly a hundred Holy Lands, which could be said to be extremely chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the Great Sun Bright Buddha comprehended the 'Great Sun Tathagata' infinite true words and gained the approval of the Creation Treasure Buddhist Land, thus unifying the Buddhist lands. How difficult that was!" a Buddhist nun sighed. She was dressed much more conservatively.</p><p></p><p>"The infinite true words at the peak of the Buddhist lands are too difficult to comprehend. If one could comprehend them, one could attain true Buddhahood and even have the hope of reaching the realm of Great Ultimate Reason!"</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist lands of the Ninth Heaven originated from the Creation Treasure Buddhist Land.</p><p></p><p>On the Creation Treasure Buddhist Land were inscribed infinite true words.</p><p></p><p>These true words of ultimate reason were regarded as treasures by Buddhist disciples.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending even a bit would bring immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the infinite true words inscribed at the peak of the Buddhist lands were even more complex and mottled. It was said that comprehending even a bit would give one the hope of reaching the realm of Great Ultimate Reason and becoming an overlord of the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>On the infinite true words inscribed at the very peak were "Reincarnation", "Sumeru", "Cause and Effect", "Merit", "Great Sun Tathagata", "Past", "Present", "Future", and others.</p><p></p><p>Among these, only "Great Sun Tathagata" had ever been comprehended by a Buddhist child, while the rest had never been comprehended by any Buddha.</p><p></p><p>These infinite true words might seem simple.</p><p></p><p>For example, "Cause and Effect" - who at the Yang Spirit realm wouldn't understand a bit of cause and effect? Yet still no true Buddha had comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>Or "Past", "Present", "Future" - the first two seemed similar to Yang Spirits cutting off their past selves and molding their present selves.</p><p></p><p>But they were completely different.</p><p></p><p>Especially "Future", which even true Buddhas in the Buddhist lands considered illusory.</p><p></p><p>After all, all Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables in the Ninth Heaven knew that the Ninth Heaven had no future.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Yang Spirits could cut off their past selves and condense their present selves, but could not condense future selves.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Sun Bright Buddha hadn't comprehended the "Great Sun Tathagata" infinite true words, all true Buddhas would have thought the infinite true words recorded at the peak of the Buddhist lands were illusory and impossible to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the endless wars in the Buddhist lands, it was because no one could comprehend the infinite true words at the peak like the Great Sun Bright Buddha had.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the appearance of people possessing the power of reincarnation, the various Buddhist Holy Lands naturally became excited, taking control of the Thirteen Northern Demon Monsters and helping them become Holy Buddhist Children.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of the power of reincarnation, this humble monk is more curious about that Blood Lord. I wonder how he obtained the power of reincarnation?" a Buddhist child in white monk's robes spoke, his eyes carrying a strange look.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, this Blood Lord had bad luck. He originally had an affinity with our Buddha and obtained the power of reincarnation. But his affinity with our Buddha was too deep, and he also obtained the Great Sun Golden Lotus," Purple Lotus Buddhist Nun said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, affinity requires moderation.</p><p></p><p>Having the power of reincarnation, one could be cultivated as a Buddhist child.</p><p></p><p>But possessing the Great Sun Golden Lotus, well, that's unfortunate.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus was originally an item of the Buddhist lands.</p><p></p><p>Now, without the Great Sun Golden Lotus, these warring Buddhist Holy Lands could hardly control even the Creation Treasure Buddhist Land.</p><p></p><p>Several times, the Creation Treasure Buddhist Land faced losing control, and the Buddhist Holy Lands were about to fall from the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Great Sun Golden Lotus must be stripped away and returned to the Buddhist lands to preside over them.</p><p></p><p>But after stripping away the Great Sun Golden Lotus, this Blood Lord would become useless even if he didn't die.</p><p></p><p>Even with the power of reincarnation, he would likely have no chance on the Buddhist path.</p><p></p><p>This was having too deep an affinity.</p><p></p><p>The reason Ling Yayi wanted to compete for the position of Holy Buddhist Child was to hope that when the true Buddha stripped away the Great Sun Golden Lotus, they might be a bit gentler.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, such a legendary figure would end up like this," a Buddhist child sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a small lower realm legend, not worth mentioning to outsiders," a little novice monk couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>"Apple, you've given rise to anger," a Buddhist child warned at this time.</p><p></p><p>The little novice monk then put his palms together, showing a guilty expression.</p><p></p><p>"The true Buddha sits in the Fifth Heaven, watching us. The Great Buddhist Assembly is about to begin, let us take our positions," Wuguang Buddhachild spoke, his voice solemn.</p><p></p><p>The other Buddhist children also nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast Buddhist sound descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Guiqi City was instantly filled with Buddhist chants and light like an ocean.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators felt the urge to bow down and worship in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The holy Buddhist light shining on their bodies was warm and gentle.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Buddhist Assembly begins!"</p><p></p><p>Only those half-Buddhas and monks proficient in Buddhist teachings understood the terrifying implications of these six words.</p><p></p><p>This was... the words of a true Buddha.</p><p></p><p>One word uttered, and all beings fall.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that if this true Buddha wished, one word could instantly extinguish all life in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Streams of light flashed by, and the holy radiance of Buddha permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Mortals in this environment would be immune to all diseases.</p><p></p><p>One by one, virtual images appeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All Buddhist disciples stood in solemn respect at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Only to see ninety-seven Buddhas sitting in the void above Guiqi City.</p><p></p><p>These Buddhas were all mythical powerhouses, each representing a Buddhist Holy Land!</p><p></p><p>"We pay respects to the Quasi-Buddhas!"</p><p></p><p>Mythical beings were called Quasi-Buddhas! These ninety-seven were all Quasi-Buddhas reflecting all heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist children and nuns present might only achieve this level at most in the future!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings concluded, enter the Buddha Tower, observe the infinite true words, debate Buddhist mechanisms, discuss Buddhist scriptures!"</p><p></p><p>The white-browed Quasi-Buddha's voice was compassionate and heart-penetrating, like a great Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"We obey!"</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Buddhachild waved his sleeve and soared into the air.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi looked worried as he scanned the surroundings, but couldn't find that familiar figure at all.</p><p></p><p>The other Northern Demon Monsters were the same, wanting to find the Blood Lord but unable to detect him.</p><p></p><p>He felt disappointed but still entered the Buddha Tower.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a corner of Guiqi City, Chen Huan's gaze was also searching, as if looking for someone.</p><p></p><p>Kun Xia Daoren squinted his eyes, looking at the Quasi-Buddhas above with some wariness in his eyes. He suppressed his aura, not letting any of his energy leak out.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a gu was already prepared. Once the Blood Lord appeared, he would look for an opportunity to use the gu to control him and turn him into a puppet.</p><p></p><p>While the Quasi-Buddhas above sat motionless, in reality, their divine senses were sweeping in all directions, trying to locate the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>After learning of the Blood Lord's appearance, the Buddhist lands had sent half-Buddhas to search, but unfortunately, they couldn't find any trace of the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Blood Lord had said he would come to the Great Buddhist Assembly.</p><p></p><p>But they still couldn't see any sign of the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they couldn't see him because their power was too weak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hand fell on Chen Huan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, a few years not seeing you and you've reached the Yin Spirit realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared in a blood-red robe, his eyes carrying a faint joy.</p><p></p><p>Later, after a night of passion with Ning Tao and the canary, Ning Tao and the canary returned to the fixed star golden core to capture new fixed stars using the golden core chapter of the magically expanded "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>He alone wandered the entire Flowing Wind Realm, searching for traces of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Or he would sit alone, perfecting the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Great Buddhist Assembly convening, he came alone.</p><p></p><p>"Big... Big Brother!" Hearing the familiar voice, Chen Huan suddenly turned his head, his words trembling.</p><p></p><p>This familiar voice, familiar face, and casual tone - it was definitely his big brother!</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Huan thought of something and quickly said, "Big Brother, you should leave quickly. I just saw Yu Daoren, and he held up one finger to me!"</p><p></p><p>This one finger was a signal Chen Huan and Yu Daoren had agreed upon before.</p><p></p><p>It meant danger... run quickly! Chen Huan naturally didn't know that the Buddhist lands were now looking for the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Daoren holding up a finger meant he should run! Although he had always trusted Qi Yuan's abilities, times were different now.</p><p></p><p>These half-Buddhas, Quasi-Buddhas, and even true Buddhas of the Buddhist lands - weren't they all geniuses of small worlds?</p><p></p><p>"Oh, run from what? I'm here to beg alms from these single dogs," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this familiar tone, Chen Huan felt greatly relieved, but still said, "Why don't we leave first?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kun Xia Daoren beside them squinted his eyes, looking for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I often beg alms. These single dogs are very nice, I always leave fully loaded!" Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>He felt begging alms was better than borrowing money.</p><p></p><p>When borrowing money, you have to worry about repaying, and also consider how much money others have.</p><p></p><p>Begging alms was different.</p><p></p><p>How dare you say your affinity with me is shallow? I'll sit here and not leave!</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Chen Huan was a bit confused, "These half-Buddhas are so easy to talk to?"</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise also flashed in Kun Xia Daoren's eyes. For some reason, he felt the Blood Lord's behavior was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Of course, what he didn't know was that the fear of Qi Yuan had already been etched deep into his soul.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that now, Qi Yuan had reached an unfathomable realm to him.</p><p></p><p>The former Blood Lord, now wearing a red robe, no longer held that terrifying blood-red demonic sword in his hand, but still made people feel that with just this face alone, he was a legend.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the void, facing ninety-seven quasi-Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, no matter who looked, it seemed as if those quasi-Buddhas were smaller and positioned lower.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here, you single dogs. I know you've been waiting for me for a long time, but don't rush."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this legend spoke bluntly.</p><p></p><p>Kunxia Daoist's forehead developed black lines as he looked at Chen Huan: "Is there... something wrong with the Blood Lord's head?"</p><p></p><p>How dare he call quasi-Buddhas single dogs! Although quasi-Buddhas were indeed single, calling them that was somewhat disrespectful to Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord's thought process is simply different from ordinary people," Chen Huan said anxiously. </p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Yu Daoist had hinted for him to run quickly. Calling quasi-Buddhas like this, the Blood Lord would be beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>The White-Browed Quasi-Buddha's expression changed slightly, maintaining the aura of a quasi-Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've appeared, hand over the Great Sun Golden Lotus," the White-Browed Quasi-Buddha spoke, not attacking directly.</p><p></p><p>Buddhas still cared about face.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Qi Yuan coughed, his blood-red robe fluttering, "Although I swallowed your Great Sun Golden Lotus, which means I owe you, I'm the type to repay kindness and hold grudges. </p><p></p><p>Let me compensate you, see if this works?"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Cantor Half-Buddha saw this scene and his mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>This harbinger of death had really come.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't really...</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how will you compensate?" The White-Browed Quasi-Buddha's voice boomed, spreading throughout Guiqi City. He was also sizing up Qi Yuan, as if trying to uncover his background.</p><p></p><p>"Your Buddha realm has been at war for years without rest. I have a way to solve this problem!" Qi Yuan said grandly.</p><p></p><p>"What method?" a quasi-Buddha asked, looking very patient.</p><p></p><p>Cantor Half-Buddha's forehead broke out in cold sweat, wanting to run away.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there endless disputes in the Buddha realm? Isn't it because you lack a Buddha? I'm kind-hearted and can't bear to see chaos in the Buddha realm.</p><p></p><p>So, I've thought of a method to solve the root cause - I'll give you a Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the atmosphere on the scene became oppressive and utterly silent.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to speak, all cultivators held their breath.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Lord... was really bold.</p><p></p><p>Did he not want to live?</p><p></p><p>Giving them a Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, why aren't you saying anything? Do you think my gesture is too small? How about this - if one Buddha isn't enough, I'll give you two, three, four! Don't worry, the candidates I recommend are absolutely suitable.</p><p></p><p>On Blue Star, I almost became a professional manager, but still angrily earned 300 yuan.</p><p></p><p>On a Q&A site, I solved countless netizens' relationship problems, helping seventeen broken-up couples get back together.</p><p></p><p>The people I recommend are definitely reliable!"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, cultivating such nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you arrange true Buddhas like this!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these quasi-Buddhas finally couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>If they let this person continue spouting nonsense, who knows what he would say next.</p><p></p><p>Where was the dignity of Buddha? Where was the law? Immediately, a quasi-Buddha made a move, a giant Buddha hand seal descending from the sky, seemingly wanting to grab Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's heart tensed: "It's over!"</p><p></p><p>He regretted it urgently, wishing he had run away with Qi Yuan earlier! After ten thousand years, how had the Blood Lord's temperament not changed at all?</p><p></p><p>However, in the next breath, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you need to show me some respect. I'm the leader of your future leader."</p><p></p><p>The casual, relaxed voice was like a thunderclap, as if it were a decree.</p><p></p><p>The giant Buddha hand seal dissipated in an instant. The quasi-Buddha's grabbing attack seemed to have never appeared.</p><p></p><p>The original Buddha light also turned blood-red with Qi Yuan's voice.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha light in the world also turned to blood light! The originally solemn and lawful place became an extremely ominous place.</p><p></p><p>The sky turned crimson, a sea of blood, shocking to the eye, as if a supreme demon was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the void wearing a blood-red robe, demonic and handsome.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha light had long been suppressed, the sea of blood surged, killing intent filled the sky.</p><p></p><p>"When the leader speaks, don't interrupt.</p><p></p><p>The local single dogs are so impolite!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the ninety-seven quasi-Buddhas sitting in the sky changed color drastically.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha light on their bodies also fell at this moment. In an instant, they turned into blood Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan saw this scene and widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Kunxia Daoist was even more dumbfounded, with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The dog Daoist beside Wuguang Buddha's son blinked his eyes: "Actually, it's reasonable for an old Daoist to pee on the ground!"</p><p></p><p>The quasi-Buddhas in the sky, as well as the half-Buddhas in Guiqi City, were completely shocked at this moment, unable to believe this scene.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Lord... why was he so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just a legend from a small world ten thousand years ago?</p><p></p><p>He wasn't even a Yin God!</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you?" The White-Browed Quasi-Buddha's gaze was moved, this blood-red light pressed down on him so he couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand, even if a true Buddha descended, they would fall in realm, but wouldn't put such great pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored the White-Browed Quasi-Buddha, instead looking up at the sky: "I came with sincerity, you should... send someone who can make decisions."</p><p></p><p>He was clearly speaking to the true Buddhas who were paying attention to this place.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Huan trembled and said to Kunxia Daoist: "Who is my big brother talking to?"</p><p></p><p>Kunxia Daoist's whole body shook, shrinking his aura to the extreme: "It should be... Yang Gods..."</p><p></p><p>"Masters of holy lands... hiss... I'll hiss again!" Chen Huan's face reddened a bit, shocked.</p><p></p><p>After ascending to the upper realm, he understood his own insignificance, and he also learned what Yang God Heavenly Venerable truly was.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if a Yang God Heavenly Venerable was willing, they could swallow the Liufeng Realm in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The former Blood Lord's campaign against the Demon Woman sounded very magnificent, but in the eyes of a Yang God Heavenly Venerable, it was no more than two groups of ants fighting.</p><p></p><p>Big brother... secretly became a Yang God?</p><p></p><p>What big brother? Grandfather!</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>The aura on three quasi-Buddhas changed.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, three true Buddhas had descended, falling onto these mythical bodies.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what business the benefactor has coming to the Assembly of Ten Thousand Buddhas?" The White-Browed Quasi-Buddha spoke, but the speaker had long since changed.</p><p></p><p>This true Buddha looked at Qi Yuan, with curiosity, confusion, and wariness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be guessing Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I say? To give you a Buddha," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>This true Buddha spoke again, his voice vast, making people sink into it: "The benefactor has Buddha nature and possesses the power of reincarnation, but to be the patriarch of the Buddha realm, much is still lacking."</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, I really have a friend, it's not me myself!" Qi Yuan was a bit anxious, "How about this, I'll call my friend over. They're all great guys, surely enough to be your Buddha."</p><p></p><p>This true Buddha narrowed his eyes, instantly communicating with the other two true Buddhas: "We shall see what tricks the benefactor plays."</p><p></p><p>On the Fifth Heaven, many true Buddhas also looked curious or surprised.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the realm of true Buddha, they rarely had fluctuations in their state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he really knows some Buddhist powerhouse?"</p><p></p><p>"No, all the Buddhas in the world are in the Buddha realm."</p><p></p><p>"Without seeing the Buddha realm, how can one obtain Buddha dharma?"</p><p></p><p>These voices murmured.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes penetrated through several layers of heaven, looking at Qi Yuan through the Ten Thousand Buddha Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the aura on Qi Yuan standing on the sea of blood changed. He became chaotic, yet seemed clear, mysterious, yet ancient.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe yangyang, the infant emerges from the divine storage, hear my command, Buddha light auspicious!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, suddenly a gust of wind blew in the world.</p><p></p><p>Everyone seemed to hear an angry roar from a divine Buddha.</p><p></p><p>At this time, everyone's gaze involuntarily looked towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the sky, a pair of golden eyes, bright and piercing, as if seeing through the sky, penetrating all illusions in the world.</p><p></p><p>Buddha light draped over his battle robe, like an invincible war god!</p><p></p><p>"Victorious Fighting Buddha, heed my command!"</p><p></p><p>The unruly monkey, the Victorious Fighting Buddha who guarded Lingshan Mountain with one staff!</p><p></p><p>Majestic and unable to be gazed upon.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's attention fell on him.</p><p></p><p>No one noticed that behind Qi Yuan stood a Buddha with disheveled hair. He stood in the shadows, as if he could not be observed by mortals.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Such strong Buddha intent!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a war Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"Who can match him at the same level!"</p><p></p><p>All the true Buddhas drew in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Such a war Buddha, with overwhelming fighting spirit to sweep away everything in the world, moved everyone.</p><p></p><p>Especially those true Buddhas, being true Buddhas themselves, they understood even more clearly how formidable the Victorious Fighting Buddha's fighting spirit was.</p><p></p><p>If he were at the same level as the Great Sun Bright Buddha, the Great Sun Bright Buddha would likely be defeated within ten moves.</p><p></p><p>Xuanxin True Buddha's gaze was moved, puzzled in his heart about where Qi Yuan had found such a war Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Why had they never heard of such a war Buddha in the Nine Heavens!</p><p></p><p>If such a war Buddha guarded the Buddha realm, how could the Buddha realm be in turmoil?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, Buddha sounds lingering: "Benefactor, this person should be a war Buddha among Buddhas, but cannot be a Buddha patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He summoned the Victorious Fighting Buddha first, actually with a bit of selfishness.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Victorious Fighting Buddha was a villager from Qingshui Village, one of the first to follow him.</p><p></p><p>"If the Victorious Fighting Buddha won't do, then... how about this Wutian Buddha patriarch behind me?"</p><p></p><p>Actually, just now Qi Yuan not only summoned the Victorious Fighting Buddha, but also summoned the Wutian Buddha patriarch! In Qi Yuan's memory, the Wutian Buddha patriarch swept through the three realms, occupied Lingshan Mountain, and forced the Tathagata down to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Sun Wukong merging with the sarira, they probably wouldn't have been able to defeat the Wutian Buddha patriarch.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Wutian Buddha patriarch was definitely a fierce character! Now, he wanted to give the Buddha realm a Buddha patriarch. Being unfamiliar with the place, they needed a fierce character.</p><p></p><p>All the true Buddhas looked at the Wutian Buddha patriarch at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"I see Buddha shattered!"</p><p></p><p>"The sea of blood is full of Buddha corpses!"</p><p></p><p>"The world turned upside down!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... the Buddha realm has fallen!"</p><p></p><p>All the true Buddhas' expressions suddenly turned pale at this moment, their minds frantically shaken.</p><p></p><p>Even their true bodies were affected, all waking up in shock.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, something terrifying happened.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the treasure of creation, the Buddha realm, constantly shaking at this moment, emitting wails, as if encountering a great enemy, wanting to flee.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha realm is abnormal, quick!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, stabilize the Buddha realm!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a great ominous Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the awakened true Buddhas acted together.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha light in the sky was like an ocean, vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha realm was as bright as day, Buddha light lingered, Buddha sounds constant, as if ten thousand Buddhas were chanting together.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the treasure of creation, the Buddha realm, finally calm down.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, screen off the Liufeng Realm, prohibit any forces from prying!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a true Buddha of the Ultimate Principle realm spoke.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, several true Buddhas of the Ultimate Principle realm acted together, cutting off all connections prying into the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Wutian Buddha patriarch seemed to concern the life and death of the Buddha realm.</p><p></p><p>If other forces knew about it, it would likely cause disaster.</p><p></p><p>In the void, countless murmuring and low voices arose.</p><p></p><p>"What happened in the Liufeng Realm, why was it cut off?"</p><p></p><p>"I saw a fighting Buddha."</p><p></p><p>"I saw a Buddha with disheveled hair?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Guiqi City, the expressions of the remaining ninety-four quasi-Buddhas changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that... the other true Buddhas of the Buddha realm had all descended at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, only a strand of consciousness descended.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they all had solemn expressions, looking at Qi Yuan with wariness, especially that Wutian Buddha patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of these people, Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, it seems you're not satisfied with him. But it's okay, I have many people. Let me recommend a few more. See if... that works?"</p><p></p><p>Taixing True Buddha's gaze was like gold, his voice compassionate: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>However, he stared at the Wutian Buddha patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The other true Buddhas all spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>They also stared at the Wutian Buddha patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't let the Wutian Buddha patriarch turn into a watermelon head, otherwise it would have been too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe yangyang, the infant emerges from the divine storage, hear my command, Buddha sounds long and drawn." Qi Yuan's expression was solemn, an ancient aura spreading again.</p><p></p><p>Murmurs, low voices, and transmitted sounds converged.</p><p></p><p>"This world-destroying Buddha, can't see through, can't see through!"</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Lord is too terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Who else does he want to call?"</p><p></p><p>"These two are already terrifying enough, how can there be other Buddhas in the world?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the world suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Only to see... countless golden light emerging from the void, dazzling and brilliant golden light, like Buddha light condensed and compressed into substance.</p><p></p><p>Vast Buddha sounds also swept across the entire world at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the true Buddhas and half-Buddhas seemed to hear Buddhas chanting at this moment, the scriptures directly pointing to the soul, making people tremble.</p><p></p><p>A Buddha seemed to come from the past, all around him like lamps.</p><p></p><p>"I come from the past, Dipankara Buddha, the Lamp-lighting Buddha greets my lord!"</p><p></p><p>A Buddha manifested in eight aspects, the Dharma body without form, manifesting the Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya.</p><p></p><p>"From nowhere, also going nowhere, Shakyamuni Buddha greets my lord!"</p><p></p><p>All the true Buddhas trembled, their minds shaking.</p><p></p><p>These two Buddhas... seemed to be from the past, existing in the present...</p><p></p><p>The treasure of creation, the Buddha realm, shook.</p><p></p><p>All the true Buddhas and half-Buddhas were</p>

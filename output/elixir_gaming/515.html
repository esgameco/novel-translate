        <h1>Chapter 515</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He stood quietly, with a few men in cloaks beside him.</p><p></p><p>"This rain is making me irritated." A thin, monkey-like man spoke up, with a hidden sleeve arrow.</p><p></p><p>He was a master of hidden weapons, with many concealed on his person.</p><p></p><p>"Because of the Water Lord, it's been raining a lot around Eyu Mountain lately. </p><p></p><p>That Shen Lingxuan... has been sticking close to the sect master of Tianxong, making her hard to catch." Xiang Shan, the sect master, spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll just capture her useless husband first." The man with the sleeve sword said.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan was hard to catch, but her husband Qi Yuan had no cultivation, and in their eyes, he could be easily bullied.</p><p></p><p>"That would alert the target, which is not ideal." Xiang Shan spoke, his eyes still carrying a hint of confusion, wondering why Wind Iron had not arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>Was he delayed by something? For some reason, listening to the pitter-patter of the rain, a sense of irritation rose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a card in his embrace suddenly began to glow.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Shan's expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!"</p><p></p><p>This mysterious card was obtained by him from exploring an ancient relic. </p><p></p><p>The card had mysterious functions, and he had learned his illusion arts from it.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, the card also had a warning function.</p><p></p><p>It was because of this card that he, as the number one flower thief of Moshan Country, even stealing the princess of Moshan, was able to evade the pursuit of the Heaven-level Imperial Guards and stay alive.</p><p></p><p>But now, the light on this card was very strong, even surpassing the last time the Heaven-level Imperial Guards had pursued him.</p><p></p><p>How could Xiang Shan not be anxious? Without any hesitation, he shot up like a cannonball, wanting to flee from Xiangyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The other men around him were dumbfounded, not knowing what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a bone-chilling sword intent suddenly attacked.</p><p></p><p>The three men present widened their eyes, and saw the rain curtain part, a crystal-clear water sword piercing through and rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely fast sword, fierce and swift like lightning, and they had no time to react at all.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi swept across, and their necks were severed.</p><p></p><p>The water sword did not linger, its edge rushing towards Xiang Shan.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Shan's fleeing speed was fast, but how could it compare to that water sword?</p><p></p><p>Even with the card's early warning, he could not evade it.</p><p></p><p>The water sword pierced through his throat, blood spurting, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>His body fell, his eyes filled with deep confusion and regret.</p><p></p><p>With the inheritance of the card, he had a bright future, not limited to just Moshan Country, yet he died for an unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>Even before his death, he did not know who he had offended and who had killed him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Shen Lingxuan's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>"This sword strike..."</p><p></p><p>In terms of power, it was naturally not as strong as her peak in her previous life.</p><p></p><p>After all, in her previous life, she had once refused an army with a single sword, establishing Tianxong and becoming its first Dao Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of exquisiteness, it far surpassed her.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her heart rippling: "Slaying four Earth-level Imperial Guards with a single sword... who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan's identity, she was very curious, and there was a hint of wariness in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, although his sword strike was exquisite, its power had not yet reached the realm of Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>If he coveted her Yin physique, she would have difficulty dealing with him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "If you let me ride you..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the smile on his face froze.</p><p></p><p>Because Shen Lingxuan's figure had dissipated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>She... had run away! Yes, she had directly run away.</p><p></p><p>This left Qi Yuan quite speechless, as he looked at Shen Lingxuan's slender back disappearing into the rain curtain, muttering to himself: "Do I really look like a bad person?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, when mortals see a divine being, they naturally fear." Chen Kangbao sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm her husband after all, I just wanted to ride her a bit, how boring."</p><p></p><p>"She is... Shen Lingxuan?" Chen Kangbao was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he had not recognized Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's do some good deeds and take care of their inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Stepping in the muddy ground, Qi Yuan entered the Xiangyun Temple.</p><p></p><p>The three Earth-level Imperial Guards did not have much silver notes on them, and Qi Yuan only collected a total of around a hundred thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>This left him somewhat disappointed, his mood akin to that of a bandit, taking care of his "friend's" widow, only to find the widow rather ordinary, even a bit ugly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Xiang Shan's corpse.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can give me a surprise."</p><p></p><p>He opened Xiang Shan's storage talisman, and a rich fragrance of rouge immediately assaulted his nose. He looked inside to find it filled with women's intimate clothing, in all kinds of colors.</p><p></p><p>"What a bad taste."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>In the storage talisman, he found six hundred and twenty thousand taels of silver notes.</p><p></p><p>A look of delight flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could be considered a millionaire.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his gaze was drawn to a card in Xiang Shan's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"This material, it's out of place in this world."</p><p></p><p>The card was overall gray in color, with many patterns on it, the material seeming like plastic.</p><p></p><p>[Illusion Art Card, from the Void Amusement Park, with functions of recording, warning, inheritance... The password is... There are 375 improvement plans.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes instantly saw a lot of hidden information.</p><p></p><p>"Void Amusement Park, what is that?" Qi Yuan had never heard of this name before.</p><p></p><p>"This old servant does not know either." Chen Kangbao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Since this card has a recording function, maybe I can use the password to enter and obtain a lot of useful information."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up the card and activated the Illusion Art Card according to the information he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Although Xiang Shan had possessed this card for many years and researched it, his understanding of the Illusion Art Card was only on the surface, and he had only obtained some illusion art inheritance.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, with his eyes able to see the hidden information, he could directly penetrate into the heart of the Illusion Art Card.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a lot of information appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Bailong, the Void Traveler?"</p><p></p><p>According to the records, the owner of this card was named Zhao Bailong, who was a being from another universe, chosen by the Void Amusement Park to become a Void Traveler.</p><p></p><p>This information also surprised Qi Yuan, as this Void Amusement Park had some similarities to the Sovereign Space he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>That universe was called the Zhou Universe.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhou Universe, many powerful beings were born.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the master of the Void Amusement Park, the Void Sovereign, was the number one strongest in the Zhou Universe.</p><p></p><p>"The master of the Void Amusement Park, the Void Sovereign, is at the third layer of the Yang God realm, the Opening Heaven Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The information recorded showed that the third layer of the Yang God realm had three stages: the Rule Realm, the Myriad Beings Realm, and the Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Rule Realm was when Yang God realm experts refined the truths of the universe into a single rule, entering the third layer of the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>The more rules one could condense, the stronger the rule power and the stronger the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Beings Realm was when one could comprehend and control at least nine universal rules.</p><p></p><p>As for the Opening Heaven Realm, it was the legendary ability to create worlds and life.</p><p></p><p>"This Opening Heaven Realm... finally has a touch of divinity. This Void Sovereign seems quite formidable."</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan's battle power...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Comparable to the greatest truths, but even if he were to create the heavens and the earth, he still wouldn't be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>Swallowing a star, however, is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Void Realm is the strongest expert in Zhou's universe. The Void Wonderland he created attracts Void Travelers, who constantly hone their skills in Zhou's universe, and he has also discovered the "cosmic embryo" where the Azure Mountain Realm is located.</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the owner of the Illusion Card, the Sovereign of the Void Realm discovered this "cosmic embryo" over hundreds of millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Void Realm has been constantly trying to incorporate this cosmic embryo into his own domain, but has failed due to unexpected reasons.</p><p></p><p>However, he continues to dispatch Void Travelers to enter the cosmic embryo and carry out missions, in order to deepen the karmic ties between himself and the cosmic embryo.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the deeper the karmic ties, the more likely he can incorporate this cosmic embryo into his territory.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean I, by holding this card, also have karmic ties with this Sovereign of the Void Realm?" Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>This Sovereign of the Void Realm is the strongest expert in a certain universe, the owner of the Illusion Card, and that Void Traveler does not have the qualifications to meet such a great figure.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, my guess is correct, in this world I am a Grade-Earth Armored Soldier, which would be equivalent to a Divine Infant in Zhou's universe."</p><p></p><p>Although the Grade-Earth Armored Soldiers in this world don't seem to have destructive power even comparable to Foundation Establishment, that is while they are within this cosmic embryo.</p><p></p><p>If he were to go to Zhou's universe, he would likely possess Fourth Realm battle prowess, which is the Divine Infant Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Void Travelers in the Divine Infant Realm of Zhou's universe, when they come here, would only have the battle power of a Grade-Earth Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>This is normal and understandable. Even though he is not yet two meters tall now, if he were to go to Zhou's universe, he might find that the stars there are not even as big as him - such things can happen.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information above, there are two main reasons why the Sovereign of the Void Realm has not swallowed this cosmic embryo: one is that the karmic ties are too shallow and he has not obtained the Mandate of Heaven; the other is that he is wary... of other terrifying experts?"</p><p></p><p>This is not a hidden secret, almost all Void Travelers know that the Sovereign of the Void Realm wants to swallow this cosmic embryo to establish his own cultivation ground.</p><p></p><p>"This cosmic embryo is indeed a delicacy, and it's likely not just the Sovereign of the Void Realm who has his eyes on it."</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a weak and helpless kitchen knife, I'd better just play the game, this Sovereign of the Void Realm is too far away from me."</p><p></p><p>However, this card not only let Qi Yuan know some background information about the game, but also gave him a clearer understanding of the path to the Third Layer of the Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>Condensing the greatest truths into the laws of the universe is the cultivation path for the Third Layer of the Yang Deity.</p><p></p><p>The more one condenses, the stronger one becomes, and ultimately, by mastering the endless rules, one can create the heavens and the earth, and give birth to all beings.</p><p></p><p>It's even said that by mastering the Dao of time and space, one can even revive the fallen beings in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is subject to certain restrictions.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, let's go, quickly find a chef, today I want to be a diligent and hardworking kitchen knife, and quickly ascend to godhood!"</p><p></p><p>As for riding Shen Lingxuan, that can wait for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Chen Kangbao said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the marketplace.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao stood up straight and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"A divine kitchen knife, only 999 taels, you can take it home.</p><p>It can cut vegetables, chop firewood, come and take a look, you won't be cheated, you won't be deceived."</p><p></p><p>"Hey old man, a kitchen knife for 999 taels, and you say we won't be cheated?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, where in this world can you find a kitchen knife that expensive? It's the same price as the divine artifacts of the Armored Soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand, this is a divine blade that can create heavenly delicacies!" Facing numerous doubts, Chen Kangbao argued passionately, spitting saliva.</p><p></p><p>"Liar!"</p><p></p><p>However, he was met with disdainful and skeptical gazes.</p><p></p><p>After all, where in this world would a common kitchen knife sell for a thousand taels of silver?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, young master, for such fated people, if it really doesn't work out, as your strategist, I must use my wisdom to help you find the fated one."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao thought to himself. The fated one for the kitchen knife must be a chef, not just any chef.</p><p></p><p>The one willing to spend 999 taels of silver must be both wealthy and a little "foolish".</p><p></p><p>"The best would be a sheltered young miss from a wealthy family who secretly escaped to wander around."</p><p></p><p>"But which young miss from a wealthy family would know how to cook?"</p><p></p><p>"I need to help the young master package it up a bit."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's thoughts were racing, he didn't even eat any steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>He scanned the young women around, looking for a target.</p><p></p><p>With his experience of living in the Asylum for years, he was good at reading people.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady looks really foolish!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't cook, no problem, I'll teach her to make steamed buns!"</p><p></p><p>"In this world, no one knows more about steamed buns than me!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly spat on his palm, smoothed his hair, and picked up the kitchen knife from the stall, hurrying after her.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Jiang Yunxi's gaze was attracted by the various items on the street, her big eyes blinking, looking adorable.</p><p></p><p>She held an ice sugar hawthorn in one hand and shook a small flower drum with the other, like a little child.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an aged figure appeared before her.</p><p></p><p>"Young lady, this old man has traveled the world, slaying demonic spirits, and passing through this place, I suddenly sense a purple aura, it seems you have encountered a benefactor."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi looked at Chen Kangbao with a wary expression in her beautiful eyes: "Old man, what do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>She may be inexperienced in the ways of the world, but she's not stupid.</p><p></p><p>"I have a kitchen knife here, it is the most extraordinary knife in the world. It is lacking a fated owner, and I think you are the one."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi looked at the kitchen knife strangely, "Since it's fated, then give it to me."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Kangbao felt he had a chance: "Young lady, you look like you have a heroic spirit, wielding this kitchen knife, you must be able to create unparalleled delicacies and slay endless demonic spirits."</p><p></p><p>He praised her.</p><p></p><p>"I don't like cooking, but I'm interested in slaying demonic spirits, give me the kitchen knife."</p><p></p><p>"It's only 999 taels." Chen Kangbao handed the kitchen knife to Jiang Yunxi and stretched out his hand for the silver.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi paused, then got angry: "Do you really think I'm a fool?</p><p></p><p>Just now, there was an old man who said I was the reincarnation of a savior, and he only wanted to sell me a secret for ten taels of silver, and you're charging 1000 taels?"</p><p></p><p>This had happened to her several times already.</p><p></p><p>She felt a bit wronged, did she have "I'm easy to fool" written on her forehead? How come all these cheating and deceiving people kept coming after her?</p><p></p><p>"Don't follow me, or I'll have you arrested at the yamen!" Jiang Yunxi was angry and a bit annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even fool a fool now.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Qi Yuan's voice suddenly sounded in his ear, and Chen Kangbao's face regained its confident expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Jiang Yunxi, if you miss this kitchen knife, it will be the biggest regret of your life."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's expression changed slightly: "How do you know my name?"</p><p></p><p>"I not only know your name, but also that you wet the bed when you were six, and the bracelet in your hand is a Mysterious-Grade spiritual artifact, a birthday gift from your mother when you were six, just to prevent you from wetting the bed."</p><p></p><p>With a "swoosh", Jiang Yunxi's face turned red, she was shocked: "How... how do you know that?"</p><p></p><p>These childhood embarrassments were only known to those close to her, how did this old man know?</p><p></p><p>"Because I am a true immortal!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

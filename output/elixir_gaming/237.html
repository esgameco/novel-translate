        <h1>Chapter 237</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stars twinkled and fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth seemed to be weeping, as a mysterious rain of blood descended.</p><p></p><p>"The weak have no right to resist!"</p><p></p><p>"Death is the only destination for the likes of you!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sun Great Sage was imperious, her eyes filled with arrogance and desire. </p><p></p><p>Her gaze pointed northward, her tongue darting out to lick her lips, as if looking at an exquisite delicacy.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Origin... if she obtained it, along with the Primordial World, to what heights could she grow?</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>"Submit to me, and I will make you my consort!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sun Great Sage's gaze penetrated thousands of miles, landing on the Origin Venerable in Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face bore a helpless expression: "Don't you know that disturbing someone's meal is very impolite? This is too disrespectful to the dead. Be careful, or the Secret Wheel Venerable might crawl out of hell to take revenge on you!"</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan had contemplated the Three Pure Ones and obtained the Devouring Origin.</p><p></p><p>Now, his power had reached an extremely terrifying level. </p><p></p><p>He could casually annihilate ordinary mythical beings.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his voice spread across the four seas and eight wildernesses.</p><p></p><p>All the people of the Mortal Realm heard the words of the legendary Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Hope arose in their hearts, hope that the Origin Venerable could slay that terrifying figure in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Although they knew such hope was extravagant!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Sun Great Sage's devouring body swept towards Feiwu City.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods entered her sight.</p><p></p><p>A trace of emotion and surprise flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in ten thousand years that she had been so moved.</p><p></p><p>Because those ancient gods... each one seemed to have limitless potential.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, each mythical being seemed capable of suppressing her from the mythical era!</p><p></p><p>She was heaven's favored daughter, a god who had entered the Yang Spirit realm!</p><p></p><p>But what did she see here? Her body couldn't help but tremble, then became wildly ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Devouring Origin... everything is mine!"</p><p></p><p>"These ancient gods will all become my nourishment!"</p><p></p><p>"All the gods you contemplated will be used by me!"</p><p></p><p>She naturally believed that Qi Yuan's achievements relied on the Devouring Origin.</p><p></p><p>Only the Devouring Origin could explain it!</p><p></p><p>"Mere avatar, how dare you speak so boldly!"</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan faced was actually an avatar of the Blood Sun Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>What the No Food Holy Mother had faced before was merely a projection of the avatar.</p><p></p><p>"This is my past self!" The Blood Sun Great Sage raged! Taking seven steps to heaven, wanting to become a Yang Spirit, she needed to complete the seven steps, then sever her past self to achieve her present self!</p><p></p><p>For a newly ascended Yang Spirit, the past self was not as strong as the Yang Spirit, but it was still the pinnacle of mythical beings, able to annihilate myths with a flick of a finger.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sun Great Sage's past self was enough to suppress the Mortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, she had also devoured the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>There were many mythical beings before her eyes, but given time, the Blood Sun Great Sage could annihilate them all!</p><p></p><p>After all, the past self of a Yang Spirit was not something mere mythical beings could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"I thought it was an avatar, but it turns out to be a dead person!"</p><p></p><p>Isn't the past self just a dead person? As Qi Yuan's voice rang out, he made his move, the profound meaning of the Three Pure Ones erupting at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!" The Blood Sun Great Sage's past self flew into a rage.</p><p></p><p>A mere mythical being dared to disrespect her! She opened her mouth, and suddenly her giant maw kept splitting, tearing to her ears.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>The entire sky was left with only one blood-red giant mouth.</p><p></p><p>"I will devour you to achieve my body!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red giant mouth suddenly covered everything, as if completely covering heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The world turned dark.</p><p></p><p>All Qi Yuan saw was endless blackness.</p><p></p><p>Surprise appeared in his eyes: "You dare to devour even the Three Pure Ones, who gave you such courage!"</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the Three Pure Ones completely erupted at this moment! The Dao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three!</p><p></p><p>Behind Qi Yuan, one after another, three terrifying shadows appeared.</p><p></p><p>Primordial, Chaos, Primal Yellow... various weighty auras swept forth.</p><p></p><p>The Mortal Realm trembled.</p><p></p><p>It was fear and awe towards higher planes.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to sit at past, present, and future.</p><p></p><p>These three were the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable, and the Moral Virtue Heavenly Venerable that Qi Yuan had contemplated.</p><p></p><p>The supreme deities of Taoism! The Taixuan Scripture says: The Great Luo gave birth to the three qi of Primordial, Numinous, and Moral, which transformed into the Three Pure Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial qi formed the Jade Pure Realm of the Clear Subtle Heaven;</p><p></p><p>The Numinous qi formed the Upper Pure Realm of the Vast Yu Heaven;</p><p></p><p>The Moral qi formed the Supreme Pure Realm of the Great Crimson Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As it is said, one qi transforms into the Three Pure Ones!</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan reached out his hand and suddenly grasped at the dark and gloomy sky.</p><p></p><p>The three shadows behind him also reached out their hands at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The three qi of Primordial, Numinous, and Moral seemed to come from eternity.</p><p></p><p>These three qi instantly entwined around Qi Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, heaven and earth suddenly became bright!</p><p></p><p>All the darkness was dispersed at this moment, and Qi Yuan saw a blood-red light. A crack appeared in the darkness, and the light from the sky fell along the crack into Qi Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>The light fell on Qi Yuan's face, making him appear incomparably heroic, like a heavenly god.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light was expanding, and that crack was also frantically growing, not just tearing open, but being forced open.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>With a miserable cry, the Blood Sun Great Sage's past self... exploded at this moment!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible, what was that!"</p><p></p><p>Just before exploding, the blood</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Dasheng's eyes were fixed intently on the three illusory shadows behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't understand what kind of beings they were! She was clearly already a Yang God, yet one of her past selves was instantly annihilated just by swallowing one of the shadows!</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Qi Yuan's figure appeared in the sky above, and he shouted, "Even the courage given to you by Liang Jingru is useless!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need the three pure shadows - he could easily kill this past self!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was very quiet, silent, even terrified. </p><p></p><p>The past self of a Yang God... was directly burst by the Origin Lord!</p><p></p><p>"The Lord will be victorious!"</p><p></p><p>"Long live the Lord!"</p><p></p><p>In Feiwu City, thousands of gods shouted in unison.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the first clash, the Origin Lord had won completely.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a hysterical voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You destroyed my past self, wasting 100,000 years of my time. Your crime is unforgivable!"</p><p></p><p>This voice was a hundred times more terrifying than Blood Sun Saint's voice earlier.</p><p></p><p>Everyone involuntarily looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw... the sky split open!</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, a pale white hand reached out and tore open a hole in the firmament.</p><p></p><p>A huge pupil peered through that hole, looking down at the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>That hole, and the pupil seen through it, was less than one ten-thousandth of the entire pupil.</p><p></p><p>What kind of pupil was it? Enormous and profound, with densely packed compound eyes within. As the hole was torn wider, more and more of the pupil was exposed to everyone's view.</p><p></p><p>The pupil seemed endless. Even if the entire sky of the Mortal Heart Realm was torn open, they still wouldn't be able to see the whole pupil.</p><p></p><p>One pupil was larger than the entire Mortal Heart Realm!</p><p></p><p>That eye fell on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan felt countless invisible hands reaching out from all corners of this world, tightly gripping his body!</p><p></p><p>Is this what a Yang God is?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became unprecedentedly solemn.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods of the Mortal Heart Realm felt their scalps tingle, not daring to look directly at those eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Its... eyes are bigger than the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"How can something above True God be so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"How... how can we fight this!"</p><p></p><p>The Mortal Heart Realm was a primordial world, where the strongest beings were mythical figures who had taken seven steps to heaven.</p><p></p><p>As for beings above True God, there were no records! Otherwise, the strongest in the Mortal Heart Realm would not be True Gods, but Yin Gods!</p><p></p><p>The gods of the Mortal Heart Realm had speculated about the power of beings above True God.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mother of No Food had once resisted an avatar of a being above True God for 20 breaths.</p><p></p><p>So there was some possibility in the Mythical Plan.</p><p></p><p>A mythical figure would act to attract the attention of the being above True God, while the seed of hope would escape.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the sky torn open, they saw what a Yang God truly was.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of a Yang God seemed even larger than the Mortal Heart Realm!</p><p></p><p>How could they fight such a terrifying being?</p><p></p><p>And how could they win! Although there were rumors that Yang Gods could swallow stars, the Mortal Heart Realm was sealed tight, so they didn't know how big stars were.</p><p></p><p>All the people of the Mortal Heart Realm felt fear in their hearts, their will to fight vanishing.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this scene, who wouldn't be shocked? Qi Yuan, however, remained relatively calm.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura swept out, breaking the chains that bound him.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the tearing, a vast voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Do you dare to come out and fight!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Saint roared.</p><p></p><p>His True God form could not squeeze into the Mortal Heart Realm, as that would crush it.</p><p></p><p>The Way of Heaven had not yet been fully consumed, so the Mortal Heart Realm could not be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm, even indifferent: "Why wouldn't I dare!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with an enemy, there was no escape! So... they could only fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>In Feiwu City, all the ancient gods were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to follow the Lord to slay the evil god!" Thunder God shouted, shaking heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Willing to fight!" Pine Gazer Ancient God howled, his expression fierce!</p><p></p><p>"Dare to fight!" Stone Heavy Mountain's voice was as heavy as mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to die for the Lord!"</p><p></p><p>This was not just talk, but a promise from the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>If heaven and earth collapsed, if the world perished, if myths were destroyed, the Origin Lord was their only hope.</p><p></p><p>How could these ancient gods give up this only hope!</p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Fight!" </p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p></p><p>Their voices thundered like waves, nearly five thousand great lords roaring, their voices surpassing a million heavenly soldiers and generals, echoing throughout the entire Mortal Heart Realm! Not one of them shrank from battle!</p><p></p><p>Even though they faced a Yang God, a Yang God that could devour the Mortal Heart Realm whole.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not one of Qi Yuan's subjects hesitated. No matter who they were, they all soared into the sky!</p><p></p><p>Nearly five thousand primordial gods, not one with power less than a great lord.</p><p></p><p>They followed closely behind Qi Yuan, fearless, charging towards that rift in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was like the sea. In an instant, he had passed through that gap in the sky, appearing in the vast chaos beyond.</p><p></p><p>Behind Qi Yuan, five thousand great lords emanated terrifying auras. Each of them was ready to die, daring to battle a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>These great lords, each one placed in an ordinary world, would be among the top experts.</p><p></p><p>And each one... given time, had the potential to reach Yang God level.</p><p></p><p>This was the terrifying aspect of primordial beings, and also the terrifying aspect of the gods Qi Yuan had envisioned!</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan looked at the terrifying being in the distance. He couldn't see its end with one glance.</p><p></p><p>Vast and boundless, as huge as a star.</p><p></p><p>And there wasn't just one such being, but two!</p><p></p><p>How could they fight such opponents? However, Qi Yuan's gaze was exceptionally calm. He said coldly: "When I was at the Foundation Establishment stage, I dared to swallow stars! Now at the peak of the Yuan Dan stage, how hard can it be to kill two evil gods!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

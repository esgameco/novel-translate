        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young girl in her teenage years felt her heart skip a beat as she looked at the handsome man, a sense of fear arising in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Among the diners, some scholars who had originally wanted to appeal to righteousness now swallowed back the words they had prepared. </p><p></p><p>If the opponent was a great hero, they would still dare to reason with him and try to pressure him with logic.</p><p></p><p>But if the opponent enjoyed killing, well, they'd better just indulge him.</p><p></p><p>"Waiter, bring me some chicken," Qi Yuan ordered a portion of chicken, feeling hungry after the killing.</p><p></p><p>The previously dazed waiter quickly responded, "Right away, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually found an empty seat and sat down with Huo Mushi.</p><p></p><p>"This spot is downwind, in a good position. If anyone speaks ill of me, the wind will surely carry it to my ears," Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The diners present all showed awkward smiles. </p><p></p><p>The rich merchant had just died, his blood still warm - who would dare speak ill of him? However, since Qi Yuan had just displayed his bloodthirsty side, none of the diners present dared to approach the legendary "Red Stick Demon Butcher" to chat, or perhaps they were waiting for someone bolder to go first.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, hurried footsteps were heard as a young girl in her teens came down from upstairs. She wore a green palace dress and looked adorably charming.</p><p></p><p>"I, County Princess Lüzhu, pay my respects to the great Red Stick Demon Butcher!" </p><p></p><p>The young girl walked up to Qi Yuan's table and gracefully curtsied.</p><p></p><p>The diners stirred slightly. </p><p></p><p>This turned out to be a royal princess! County Princess Lüzhu was the daughter of the Little Empress Zhou, said to be the most beautiful woman in the entire Fengyuan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The diners who had been gossiping about the Little Empress Zhou and the Red Stick Demon Butcher earlier now trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave the girl a cool glance: "What do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord fought across 3,000 li of the northern lands, destroyed eleven demon lairs, and saved millions of common people from disaster. On behalf of the people of the world, I thank you for your great righteousness!"</p><p></p><p>The teenage girl curtsied, looking quite like a little adult.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is there anything else?" Qi Yuan picked up a peanut with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>County Princess Lüzhu looked at Qi Yuan, determination flashing in her beautiful eyes: "I am willing to offer 10,000 taels of gold as a gift to become your disciple, if you would accept me as your student!"</p><p></p><p>"Can 10,000 taels of gold buy this world?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>He needed money urgently to buy star-aligning equipment.</p><p></p><p>At his words, everyone present changed expression slightly.</p><p></p><p>The implication of those words...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Red Stick Demon Butcher was planning to overthrow the dynasty?</p><p></p><p>"Of course not!" County Princess Lüzhu seemed to catch Qi Yuan's hidden meaning as well, biting her lip as she answered.</p><p></p><p>This time, she had come to meet the Red Stick Demon Butcher on a mission from the royal family.</p><p></p><p>Her father the emperor didn't dare meet the Red Stick Demon Butcher himself, so he sent her instead.</p><p></p><p>"If it can't, then I don't want the gold," Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand taels of gold was quite a lot, and he'd have to stuff it into his Blood Martial Space.</p><p></p><p>His Blood Martial Space was small, and couldn't fit that much gold.</p><p></p><p>As for banknotes and such, would they be of any use after leaving this world? Clearly not.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's refusal, County Princess Lüzhu's face turned pale. But she lowered her head and continued, "I am willing to be your slave and servant, to attend to you by your side. I only ask that you accept me as your disciple, teach me martial arts, so that I may protect Fengyuan!"</p><p></p><p>She had already prepared herself to make the sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Among all the princesses and county princesses of the royal family, she was the most beautiful and of the most precious status.</p><p></p><p>"Your words sound familiar, exactly the same as what my little junior sister said," Qi Yuan recalled the scene when Jiang Lingsu first entered the sect. "But after she joined, she immediately turned into a rich lady. Although she helped me a lot, she never actually became a slave or servant."</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through County Princess Lüzhu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Then she heard Qi Yuan continue:</p><p></p><p>"In half a day, I will be leaving here, so I naturally won't be taking on any disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, I'm about to go crush the demons of Xijiang.</p><p></p><p>Watch carefully, and whatever you can learn will be up to your own ability."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his junior sister Jiang Lingsu made Qi Yuan feel a bit more generous towards County Princess Lüzhu.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, County Princess Lüzhu felt both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>Surprised that the Red Stick Demon Butcher was leaving - where to? And delighted - did this mean he was accepting her?</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a loud musical performance began playing, continuing without pause.</p><p></p><p>From outside came a beautiful voice, as if from heaven:</p><p></p><p>"The Fish Girl of Xijiang is willing to offer the 20,000 aquatic tribes of Xijiang as a betrothal gift, inviting His Majesty the Red Stick Demon Butcher to rule the underwater palace of Xijiang!</p><p></p><p>The armies of Xijiang shall all be Your Majesty's right arm.</p><p></p><p>If Your Majesty wishes to conquer the world, the armies of Xijiang are willing to trample the southern lands!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, all the diners present changed expression slightly.</p><p></p><p>County Princess Lüzhu's heart also skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually the Fish Girl of Xijiang!"</p><p></p><p>"The ruler of Xijiang!"</p><p></p><p>"The most powerful demon force in the world, and she's willing to submit to the Red Stick Demon Butcher!"</p><p></p><p>"If the demon armies all become the Red Stick Demon Butcher's to command, wouldn't taking over Fengyuan be as easy as turning his hand?"</p><p></p><p>The diners were shocked, worried, and indignant.</p><p></p><p>If they were in the Red Stick Demon Butcher's position, they were certain they wouldn't be able to resist the temptation of the ruler of Xijiang.</p><p></p><p>County Princess Lüzhu also looked worried, but remained unusually silent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up with a smile: "This is the first time I've seen such a proactive 'moon goddess'."</p><p></p><p>The 'moon goddesses' he had encountered before had all cursed him loudly upon seeing him.</p><p></p><p>Even Princess Jasmine had only tried to use her feminine charms to bewitch him, with ill intent.</p><p></p><p>But when the Fish Girl of Xijiang spoke these words, Qi Yuan's nose didn't grow longer, showing that she was sincere and not lying.</p><p></p><p>"If Your Majesty agrees, this humble one can be a great general by day, campaigning for Your Majesty; and by night, a consort for Your Majesty to ride at will."</p><p></p><p>The Fish Girl of Xijiang's voice was heavenly, with a hint of seductive charm.</p><p></p><p>The inn's doors opened, and a woman in bridal attire appeared outside.</p><p></p><p>Snowflakes fell, red and white mingling.</p><p></p><p>Looking from bottom to top, the first thing to catch the eye was a pair of small, delicate bare feet.</p><p></p><p>Unshod, wearing azure and crystal-clear ankle chains, stepping in the ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>Above that were slender jade legs, hidden beneath the slit of the red bridal gown, shapely and delicate.</p><p></p><p>Higher still was an exaggeratedly slim waist with an extreme waist-to-hip ratio, and full breasts.</p><p></p><p>Just the figure alone was incredibly alluring.</p><p></p><p>At the very top was a red bridal veil, covering her head.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a gust of wind blew by, lifting the Fish Girl of Xijiang's red veil to reveal... a fish head in everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>Yes, that's right, not a face, but a fish head.</p><p></p><p>Protruding fish eyes, seemingly hard fish gills, and an upturned mouth that looked like it loved to be hooked.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this face, many thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's mind, and he couldn't help but ask: "Can't you have a human face on top and a fish body below?"</p><p></p><p>What came to Qi Yuan's mind was the classic choice question:</p><p></p><p>Stranded on a desert island with only a mermaid for company.</p><p></p><p>Would you prefer the mermaid to have a beautiful human face, but a fish tail from the waist down? (Note: No sharp teeth in the mouth.) Or would you prefer her to have an amazing body, but a fish head?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never answered this question before.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing the Fish Girl of Xijiang, he couldn't help but think of it.</p><p></p><p>"If that is what Your Majesty prefers, why not?" A smile flashed in the Fish Girl of Xijiang's fish eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her form began to change.</p><p></p><p>Her lower body became a fish tail, while her original fish head transformed into a face as beautiful as County Princess Lüzhu's.</p><p></p><p>The previously terrified...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The diners at this moment also revealed a hint of greed and obsession in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>They looked at this fish, still charming and attractive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced over indifferently: "Have you ever heard of..."</p><p></p><p>"Is Your Majesty trying to say that humans and demons cannot coexist, or that those not of our kind must have different intentions?" The Xijiang Fish Woman interrupted Qi Yuan's words. She continued, "In this world, the power of speech has always been in the hands of the strong! Rules and rights are only fit for figures like Your Majesty to possess! Your Majesty is powerful, so we are Your Majesty's most loyal and sharpest swords!"</p><p></p><p>"You're wrong," Qi Yuan said, finally able to interject after she finished speaking. "My thoughts may be extreme, but..."</p><p></p><p>"You should let me finish. It feels strange interrupting you," Qi Yuan cut off the Xijiang Fish Woman's words. He brought the topic back on track, "What I wanted to say is that the power of an idealized love lies in living in memory. Even if she herself came, she couldn't defeat herself. But once an idealized love takes the initiative and chooses to be subservient... well, then it's over."</p><p></p><p>"...???" Lady Lvzhu looked confused. </p><p></p><p>The diners present were also bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Red Cudgel Demon Butcher's words - they seemed to understand the meaning of each word individually, but strung together they didn't know what he was trying to express.</p><p></p><p>The Xijiang Fish Woman was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard Qi Yuan continue: "Once an idealized love takes initiative, you've lost. So... you might as well die and become a part of me!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, a murderous intent permeated the air at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huo Mushi familiarly took out a suona horn and began to play earnestly and immersively for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan glanced at Lady Lvzhu: "From here on, how much you can learn depends on your comprehension."</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Qi Yuan went straight into action.</p><p></p><p>This directly confused everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Lady Lvzhu also didn't expect things to develop this way.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly the Xijiang Fish Woman seducing Red Cudgel Demon Butcher, then Red Cudgel Demon Butcher said some inexplicable things, and without even negotiating, he went straight into fighting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bewilderment in the Xijiang Fish Woman's eyes disappeared, and her expression turned cold: "It seems Your Majesty is unwilling to be our emperor and wants to rebel!"</p><p></p><p>Since they were now enemies, the Xijiang Fish Woman didn't hold back at all.</p><p></p><p>The Xijiang Water Tribe was the most powerful demon force in this land.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that the other eleven demon forces combined were no match for them.</p><p></p><p>"How nice it would be to just be content as my idealized love. Yet you want to marry me officially - are you trying to ruin the image of the idealized love in my heart?" Qi Yuan sneered.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura permeated the air at this moment. The blood-red wooden cudgel in his hand grew larger, like a pillar that stabilizes the sea.</p><p></p><p>The entire earth seemed to tremble at the aura emanating from his body.</p><p></p><p>The Xijiang Fish Woman's expression changed slightly: "As expected, you've entered the Martial Spirit realm!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the diners present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cudgel Demon Butcher has actually entered the legendary Martial Spirit realm!"</p><p></p><p>"To think it's Martial Spirit, able to move mountains and seas with a wave of the hand!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Spirit realm was a legendary realm.</p><p></p><p>One person could stand for an entire country! Mountains and rivers were mere toys in the hands of a Martial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"But so what if you're a Martial Spirit!" The Xijiang Fish Woman shouted loudly. "Twenty thousand water tribe soldiers, follow me into battle, slay this villain!"</p><p></p><p>With her voice, cracking sounds arose from the calm river surface ahead.</p><p></p><p>Countless thick ice sheets shattered, and the roars and howls of troops could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who offend our water tribe must be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>Twenty thousand soldiers appeared wearing armor and wielding long spears and lances. A vast sea of black stretched for miles across the river's surface, all demon shadows.</p><p></p><p>The Xijiang Fish Woman had somehow returned to the river's surface, a cold smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>She was also clearly emanating power surpassing that of a demon spirit.</p><p></p><p>She was actually a demon spirit! Comparable to the Divine Infant in the immortal path, an absolute mighty demon! In any world, she would not be considered weak!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, if you repent now, there's still a chance to turn things around!" The Xijiang Fish Woman's voice was cold.</p><p></p><p>With twenty thousand demon soldiers behind her, a vast sea of black, her confidence was stronger than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm: "Watch carefully, Lvzhu. This strike of mine... is super fierce."</p><p></p><p>Domineering power.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving Sword Drawing Technique.</p><p></p><p>Death's Radiant Light.</p><p></p><p>Together with you!</p><p></p><p>The world darkened in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone instinctively looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>It turned out it wasn't that the sky had darkened, but rather... Red Cudgel Demon Butcher's body was blocking out the light in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red terrifying figure, of unknown height and size.</p><p></p><p>A horrifying, ferocious death god of hell, wielding a sky-scraping wooden cudgel, leapt high.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving, Sword Drawing! Kill!</p><p></p><p>One sword strike.</p><p></p><p>No, one cudgel strike.</p><p></p><p>A moment ago, it was still a thousand miles of ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>The next second, all the snowflakes and ice chunks in the world separated from the earth in that instant, thrown into the air.</p><p></p><p>When that terrifying wooden cudgel fell among the twenty thousand demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>All the snowflakes and ice chunks only then returned to their original positions.</p><p></p><p>The world was still that world.</p><p></p><p>But... the people had changed!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the twenty thousand demon soldiers scattered.</p><p></p><p>The Xijiang River was cut off.</p><p></p><p>The river water evaporated.</p><p></p><p>The world shook.</p><p></p><p>The power of one cudgel strike, terrifying to this extent!</p><p></p><p>"Puh!" The Xijiang Fish Woman spat out a mouthful of blood, her eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This strike not only directly killed a third of the twenty thousand demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Even she, at the forefront, was severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible, I'm also a demon spirit... a Martial Spirit can't be this powerful!" The Xijiang Fish Woman's face was pale as she kept shouting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was already scared out of her wits.</p><p></p><p>"You can't even withstand one strike from me, yet you want to marry me. Fish-head woman, you're really delusional. You're only fit for some shrimp-head men!"</p><p></p><p>"Take another strike from me!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, that terrifying, majestic figure swung down his cudgel again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The original Xijiang River and seven thousand more of the twenty thousand demon soldiers perished.</p><p></p><p>The Xijiang Fish Woman with demon spirit strength had her body shattered, the gills in her fish head beaten out.</p><p></p><p>She looked on in disbelief, all her pride vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"One last strike, it's time to end this!"</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving Sword Drawing Technique! Qi Yuan leapt again, a powerful cudgel strike falling on the river surface.</p><p></p><p>The scattered demon soldiers were already terrified, fleeing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>But when Qi Yuan appeared in this world, their fates were already sealed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all twenty thousand demon soldiers died miserably, turned to meat paste.</p><p></p><p>From appearance to annihilation, it took only a dozen breaths for twenty thousand demon soldiers to be gone.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't be moved! Who wouldn't be shocked!</p><p></p><p>Lady Lvzhu's body trembled as she looked at that majestic figure. For some reason, the wariness in her heart completely disappeared, replaced by a hint of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>I recommend a book, "My Wife's Experience Panel", with a link below. Those who like it can bookmark and follow it.</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Good news: Activated the liver experience panel, the cheat ability has finally arrived.</p><p>Bad news: The liver experience panel belongs to the fiancée.</p><p>Good news: After binding, when the fiancée gains liver experience, I get triple the benefits.</p><p></p><p>From now on, Zhu Yang decided to urge his wife to train diligently every day.

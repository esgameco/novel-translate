        <h1>Chapter 294</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those who come here to learn martial arts are mostly wealthy second-generation rich kids.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyue City, they're not the top tier, but can be considered the second tier.</p><p></p><p>Spending hundreds of thousands or millions on hobbies each year is no pressure for them.</p><p></p><p>For them, martial arts is just a hobby.</p><p></p><p>When they get tired, they take a break. Few people are as dedicated and obsessed as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So when they heard Qi Yuan was going to participate in the martial arts competition, no one was surprised.</p><p></p><p>They come to Mingwu Martial Arts School as a hobby, just for fun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan... is different.</p><p></p><p>"Our school also has a few people participating in the martial arts competition. They're different - they're elite seeds," Wang Shiqiao said, looking at Qi Yuan with a wink.</p><p></p><p>"What's their best result?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The best result is top 20 in Tianyue City. Unfortunately, only the top 10 qualify for the national martial arts competition. </p><p>But don't underestimate the top 20 - without using genetic drugs or hot weapons, these top 20 would be considered city heroes in ancient times!"</p><p></p><p>As Wang Shiqiao spoke, a look of envy appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, the natural limits of the human body are always popular.</p><p></p><p>They're even more sought after in certain circles.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the students at our school are a bit weak," Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Don't let those elite members hear you say that, or they'll come looking for trouble.</p><p>There's a tricky character among those elite members who's considered a big shot even in Tianyue City," Wang Shiqiao said, with an expression of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't interested in these things and focused on practicing the Mingwu Resonance Fist.</p><p></p><p>But Wang Shiqiao kept chattering on like a gossip.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest person in our school is named Xu Tiehua. He has already practiced the Mingwu Resonance Fist to the ninth level.</p><p>Even the senior disciple may not be his match.</p><p>Not only is his kung fu formidable, but his family also has connections.</p><p>You know what? Yesterday a big shot in our Tianyue City died - it was... the Black Crystal Earl.</p><p>In a few days, there will be a funeral for the Black Crystal Earl. It will be very low-key, with only a small group of people invited.</p><p>The attendees are all top-level dignitaries of Tianyue.</p><p>And Xu Tiehua... he has the qualifications to attend the Black Crystal Earl's funeral!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who had been training in the Mingwu Resonance Fist, paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Wang Shiqiao say: "Jealous?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding students revealed envious looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were considered to have some money, with no worries about food and clothing, but compared to the real power players of Tianyue, the gap was still very large.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Tiehua is different from us."</p><p></p><p>"If he can make it into the top 10 of the city-level martial arts competition, with his family connections, he can easily get a position in the military."</p><p></p><p>"We're just slackers."</p><p></p><p>These students saw things clearly. For them, there wasn't much to pursue in life, they were just killing time.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they were extremely envious of hardworking geniuses like Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their conversations fell on the ears of the martial arts school staff, seeming somewhat pretentious.</p><p></p><p>These staff members, with monthly salaries of six or seven thousand, would need to save every penny for 20-30 years to buy a decent house in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>The gap between rich and poor in Qin Yuan country was greater than that between humans and dogs.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary person working hard their whole life might not live as well as a rich person's dog.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned a deaf ear to these voices.</p><p></p><p>As he swung the Mingwu Resonance Fist, the blood in his entire body began to simmer slightly.</p><p></p><p>Dense beads of sweat appeared on his back, then disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's Mingwu Resonance Fist entered the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... still a weakling with a battle power of 5."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't notice any obvious improvement in his combat ability.</p><p></p><p>However, for an ordinary person, relying solely on the strength gained from martial arts training would be enough to handle one or two small-time thugs of equal weight.</p><p></p><p>Provided that thug didn't have a knife.</p><p></p><p>"So, I need to reach at least the seventh level to be considered... a certified martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Not everyone who practices martial arts is considered a martial artist. To obtain a martial artist certificate, one needs to meet the requirements set by the state.</p><p></p><p>These requirements vary for different schools or martial arts gyms.</p><p></p><p>These rules are set by the Martial Arts Association.</p><p></p><p>For example, with the Mingwu Resonance Fist, one needs to reach the seventh level to be considered a martial artist and obtain a martial artist certificate.</p><p></p><p>The function of a martial artist certificate is similar to various professional certifications in the previous world of Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>To become a martial arts instructor or open a martial arts gym, one must have a martial artist certificate.</p><p></p><p>Mingwu Martial Arts School has over a hundred students, but only fifteen have martial artist certificates.</p><p></p><p>Although an ordinary person practicing diligently every day could obtain a martial artist certificate in three years,</p><p></p><p>The problem is... many people are too lazy to practice.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, I can get a martial artist certificate in half a month?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After consuming the essence blood of the mutant sea monster, Qi Yuan's martial arts aptitude had improved considerably.</p><p></p><p>His training speed had also become faster.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he was originally a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>What might take an ordinary person one or two years to achieve, he could do in half a month, which was considered normal.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the seventh level and becoming a true martial artist, Qi Yuan would be able to use secret items to make breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I need to find time to contact狂欢 (Kuanghuan) and ask about secret items."</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, this was just a casual game.</p><p></p><p>Why do things yourself when you can have NPCs do them?</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was constantly practicing martial arts, standing out from the other students present.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Wang Shiqiao was sitting on a sofa playing with his phone.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a female voice came: "Xiao Qiao, you didn't really develop feelings for that guy, did you?"</p><p></p><p>The woman looked petite and delicate, but her body contained powerful energy. She was one of the few people in the gym with a martial artist certificate.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao glanced at Qi Yuan, who was training hard, and smiled: "What do you mean developed feelings? Besides just playing around, can't we be friends? Having such a handsome guy as a friend would be impressive to show off."</p><p></p><p>At first, Wang Shiqiao was indeed attracted by Qi Yuan's looks and had some designs on him.</p><p></p><p>Later she found Qi Yuan was different from what she imagined, not like her.</p><p></p><p>So she withdrew her intentions and treated him as an ordinary friend.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they had some drinks one day, she wouldn't mind if something beyond friendship happened.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you think this way. He... doesn't come from a wealthy family, he's the child of a martyr.</p><p>Coming to the martial arts school has probably used up all his savings.</p><p>Look how serious he is, unlike you guys who treat it as a hobby for fun. For him, it's a career." The petite woman spoke with a sense of superiority.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao laughed: "Xing Yu, I didn't realize you had such a strong sense of class?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao and Xing Yu had a good relationship and were dormitory roommates.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao was from a moderately wealthy family, while Xing Yu's family background was ordinary, even considered poor compared to the other girls in the dorm, coming from a small town.</p><p></p><p>Through Wang Shiqiao's connections, Xing Yu had managed to get into the bed of a billionaire and successfully became his official partner.</p><p></p><p>After serving the old man for a few years, Xing Yu's fortunes had finally turned. The old man was about to die.</p><p></p><p>She would inherit a large portion of his estate.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the other classmates back then, Xing Yu was completely a winner in life.</p><p></p><p>However, Wang Shiqiao laughed when she saw how Xing Yu looked down on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu didn't get angry, but said softly: "In the future, I can play with as many men like this as I want."</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you've also taken a liking to Qi Yuan?" Wang Shiqiao was quite speechless, then said, "I always felt his temperament was different, probably can't be bought with money. Otherwise, I would have offered money long ago!"</p><p></p><p>"How could there possibly be people in this world who can't be moved by money? It's just a matter of not having enough," Xing Yu said with certainty. </p><p></p><p>"Maybe the few hundred million in inheritance you received isn't enough to move him?"</p><p></p><p>"Gold-plated?" Xing Yu couldn't help but laugh out loud, "Are you saying he's more expensive than Xu Tiehua?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, isn't it a bit impolite to talk about people behind their backs like this? Also, while I'm not gold-plated, I'm even more expensive than that!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cheerful voice rang out. A middle-aged man with a well-proportioned build walked over.</p><p></p><p>Though middle-aged, his face looked somewhat baby-faced. He wore a dress shirt, but the martial arts school members knew that underneath was an explosion of muscle.</p><p></p><p>This man was Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>The number one among the students of Mingwu Martial Arts School, his prestige even surpassed that of the senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Tiehua appear, a blush spread across Xing Yu's face.</p><p></p><p>The other students also turned their gazes to Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>Some people become the center of attention as soon as they appear.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... eavesdropping on little girls' private chatter, aren't you afraid of ruining your ears?" Xing Yu said coquettishly, no longer with her previous arrogance.</p><p></p><p>The others also greeted Xu Tiehua, but facing him, they unconsciously felt a sense of insecurity.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Tiehua was the true elite, someone who could attend the funeral of the Black Crystal Earl.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua greeted everyone present, then walked towards Qi Yuan with a kind expression: "You're Qi Yuan. I heard from Second Senior Brother that you want to participate in this martial arts tournament?"</p><p></p><p>His purpose for coming here was to meet Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan looked at Xu Tiehua and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect our martial arts school to have one more person sign up this year. Including you, we have four people participating this year. With four people... besides individual competitions, there will also be team competitions. If you're free, the four of us can spend some time training together every day to better prepare for the martial arts tournament!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua extended a sincere invitation.</p><p></p><p>Team competitions rely not only on individual strength but also on tactics.</p><p></p><p>The order in which the four people take turns, as well as the roles each person plays, are all very important.</p><p></p><p>That's why Xu Tiehua came to invite Qi Yuan, to familiarize himself with his other teammates first.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head and directly refused: "There are still three months until the competition, it's too early. We can work on coordination in the last few days. Now... I'm busy improving my strength."</p><p></p><p>He was currently only at the fourth level of Mingwu Resonance Fist, still several levels away from becoming a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he needed to frantically improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>For the first martial arts tournament, he needed to win the championship.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Xu Tiehua was slightly stunned, then smiled and said: "You're right, improving your own strength is most important. How about this, whenever you feel ready, come find me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua was very easy to talk to and very considerate of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else, they might have gotten angry after being rejected by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua didn't say anything more. He said goodbye to Qi Yuan and then left the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao, who was watching from the side, winked at Qi Yuan: "Why did you refuse Young Master Xu? You just joined the martial arts school, in the individual competition... well, you'll probably be eliminated in the first round. Why not prepare well for the team competition with them? Xu Tiehua's strength is not bad, maybe you could last a few more rounds and gain some more experience."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's words also represented the thoughts of most people.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had just entered the martial arts school and wasn't even a martial artist yet. Participating in the martial arts tournament was completely like being sent to be sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>"My goal is to win the martial arts tournament championship. As for the team competition... we'll see," Qi Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Wang Shiqiao rolled her eyes, "With your level, you want to win the championship? If you can win the martial arts tournament championship, I'll eat your shit!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan gave Wang Shiqiao a meaningful look: "Your thoughts are very profound?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Wang Shiqiao was confused.</p><p></p><p>"Where in the world are there such good things? You've come to me to scam food and drinks."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Wang Shiqiao cursed loudly, finally understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and people gradually left the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao said goodbye to Qi Yuan and left with Xing Yu.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked out of the martial arts school, looking quite relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... what a coincidence to meet you here!"</p><p></p><p>By the roadside, a car window rolled down and a pair of fair hands reached out, waving at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the window, a beautiful young face appeared, eyes filled with delight.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you are... Wu Qi?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recognized the person in the car, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, are you heading home? I happen to be going the same way, why don't I give you a ride?" Wu Qi extended an invitation. Even though she tried to remain composed, one could see that she was not entirely at ease.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday on the yacht, Qi Yuan had left a deep impression on her.</p><p></p><p>As a rational person, she understood what she was pursuing.</p><p></p><p>Having encountered such an elite, she naturally didn't want to let go.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, one of her friends said she saw an extremely handsome student at Mingwu Martial Arts School and even sent her a photo.</p><p></p><p>She recognized at a glance that it was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She instantly felt it was heaven's arrangement, her good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, she drove here directly to "coincidentally" encounter him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "You don't even know where I live, how could you be going the same way?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi in the car blushed, feeling panicked.</p><p></p><p>Then she heard Qi Yuan say:</p><p></p><p>"You NPC, just be my driver today."</p><p></p><p>He could save some cab fare, Qi Yuan thought gleefully.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he got into Wu Qi's car.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's face lit up with wild joy, her heart racing even faster.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to tell you now that I'm not interested in you and don't want to engage in any intimate activities with you, would you think I'm being overly confident?" Sitting in the car, Qi Yuan thought of something and said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>After all, his statement did sound quite like an overconfident man, and rather patronizing.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi was stunned for a moment, a strong sense of disappointment welling up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However, she still forced a smile: "Mr. Qi is joking."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why I got into your car?" Qi Yuan spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's eyes revealed a confused look. She hadn't expected Qi Yuan to suddenly ask this.</p><p></p><p>Why? She was a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Because you... are somewhat special."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes seemed to see through Wu Qi's body, falling upon her blood.</p><p></p><p>Being looked at like this, Wu Qi felt uncomfortable all over. She felt as if her protective clothing had been stripped away, leaving her exposed naked before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The red-tinged wood was ignited, crackling and popping.</p><p></p><p>The burning flames were a vivid blood-red!</p><p></p><p>This was the art of cursed killing, the best vessel for it.</p><p></p><p>Wen Zongying's gaze was sharp, one hand holding the imperial scepter, the other holding a feather duster.</p><p></p><p>"Pursue across thousands of miles, the spirit flees in fear of being killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Curse!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the blood-red flames on the red-tinged wood suddenly leapt up nearly half a zhang high.</p><p></p><p>The red glow of the flames was reflected on Wen Zongying and Sima Ting's faces, making them appear particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting stood to the side, his beard trembling, and he looked somewhat expectant: "How is it, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Zongying held the imperial scepter and spoke calmly, "The art of cursed killing has been unleashed, we only need to wait a moment to see the blood."</p><p></p><p>He was already an emperor-level expert, and with the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate's imperial scepter, when unleashing the art of cursed killing, he could even subdue the supreme imperial cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting let out a sigh of relief: "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took up a crimson-purple crane-down robe and draped it over Wen Zongying.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A deafening explosion suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Blood, flesh, and bone fragments were blasted away, Sima Ting was covered in blood, and the deep purple crane-down robe was dyed red, with Sima Ting holding it, his clothes soaked in blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be... how could this be..." Sima Ting looked at the scene before him with disbelief, his face covered in fresh blood, with some shredded flesh still clinging to his beard.</p><p></p><p>Because Wen Zongying had exploded!</p><p></p><p>And Wen Zongying's sudden explosion was due to the backlash of the cursed killing art.</p><p></p><p>Who was the opponent... that could even destroy the imperial scepter?</p><p></p><p>In the distant Heavenly Mandate Sect, deep within the underground palace, the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate had half his body crawl into a coffin.</p><p></p><p>This coffin was something he had built over hundreds of years of accumulation by the Heavenly Mandate Sect, unparalleled in attack and defense.</p><p></p><p>When he was outside the Heavenly Mandate Mountain, he saw a crow fly by and a sense of foreboding arose in his heart, and he didn't make any post-event arrangements, hurriedly rushing to the coffin.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he reached the coffin, he felt a vast, unmatched power, as if it had traversed the ages and was tracking him down.</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes, quite puzzled, and also felt resentful.</p><p></p><p>"Why!"</p><p></p><p>He had painstakingly schemed in the shadows for three thousand years, living longer than a turtle.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought he would soar to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But he was inexplicably struck down.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a great expert had passed by the heavens and casually sneezed, directly killing him.</p><p></p><p>Careful planning had become a joke.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate... had died unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>About an incense stick's worth of time later, the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate's corpse suddenly exploded, shattering into fragments.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, a spider crawled into the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour after that, two figures entered the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>One of them was strikingly identical to the deceased Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate.</p><p></p><p>He was the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate's double, now the public face of the Heavenly Mandate Sect's Holy Lord.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the exploded flesh and blood in front of the coffin, his face filled with excitement: "That old turtle has finally died!"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the man in golden robes said calmly, "My clan's ancestor personally unleashed the life-swapping art, how could he have survived?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the man in golden robes was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>His clan's ancestor was a supreme imperial cultivator, his lifespan reaching its natural end.</p><p></p><p>Before his death, he had unleashed the life-swapping art, perishing together with the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate.</p><p></p><p>So the man in golden robes had collaborated with the Heavenly Mandate Sect's puppet Holy Lord.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought his ancestor's life-swapping art would only severely injure the Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate, but he didn't expect him to die directly.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit surprised, but wanted to take the credit for himself.</p><p></p><p>"That old turtle was always strong on the outside but weak on the inside.</p><p></p><p>Now that he's dead, the Heavenly Mandate Sect will be yours." The man in golden robes looked at the person next to him. "Can our cooperation continue?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, of course!" The Holy Lord of the Heavenly Mandate's double was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Excited.</p><p></p><p>Where in the world can there be anything more thrilling than a substitute becoming the real thing?...</p><p></p><p>In the Forbidden Clothing, Qi Yuan sneezed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, I've caught a cold."</p><p></p><p>Just now, Qi Yuan sneezed and felt a bit cold.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia followed behind Qi Yuan, keeping a distance of one body's length.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have understood Qi Yuan's words, and a "Stick-Stick" wooden plaque slid out from her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Xiao Jia: "No, your material is too silky, I'm afraid I'll get even colder."</p><p></p><p>After coming out of the underground palace, Qi Yuan decided that he would take Xiao Jia and go on a rampage.</p><p></p><p>With Xiao Jia around, even if he encountered the Ugly Clothing Monster King, he would not be at a complete disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided that during this time, he would take down the Forbidden Clothing.</p><p></p><p>With Xiao Jia, his level could directly increase by 5 levels.</p><p></p><p>Ninety levels and eighty-eight levels are two different concepts.</p><p>The gap is a whole level.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, with our male-female combination, grinding monsters won't be tiring at all!"</p><p></p><p>Confident with Xiao Jia by his side, Qi Yuan set out.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was pitch-black, with only a full moon hanging in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his great treasure sword and appeared again at the place where the Ugly Clothing Monsters were sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's loud shout, he charged into the group of monsters like a wolf among sheep, slaughtering without stop.</p><p></p><p>Whatever was wearing pants, whatever was wearing a small mother's skirt, he took them all down.</p><p></p><p>The experience points were also growing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>+200!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>+300!</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan was much bolder than before.</p><p></p><p>As he was killing, nearly half an hour passed, and he quickly reached level 89.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a cold gaze fell upon Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Ugly Clothing Monster King, you've come!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's spirits were lifted.</p><p></p><p>Comrades-in-arms!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he activated the Comrades-in-Arms skill, and a blood-red battle armor covered his body, even turning his great treasure sword red.</p><p></p><p>His figure also grew rapidly, reaching a height of ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan could grow even taller, but there was no need.</p><p></p><p>Ten meters, for the current Qi Yuan, was the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if your health bar will actually decrease!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the Ugly Clothing Monster King, even the now 94th-level Qi Yuan felt a bit of pressure.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique! Qi Yuan unleashed his strongest attack.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the red battle armor, he leaped up, causing the ground to tremble with the force.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Qi Yuan had a full moon on his back, and a blood-red sword energy descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique landed on the Ugly Clothing Monster King.</p><p></p><p>The Ugly Clothing Monster King stretched out its hand, a claw that was a fusion of pale and dark.</p><p></p><p>It caught Qi Yuan's sword with one claw.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique could not make any progress, and the Ugly Clothing Monster King looked at Qi Yuan without any emotional expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Only a tiny bit of blood was lost?"</p><p></p><p>"Time to run away."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the gap was too big, so it would be better to retreat quickly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the difference between level 95 and level 94 is a huge threshold!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan switched the battle form of the Bridal Armor to the defensive mode and directly fled.</p><p></p><p>If it were him without the Bridal Armor, fleeing would be extremely difficult, and he might even be stopped by the Ugly Clothing Monster King.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could just run openly without having to crouch and scurry.</p><p></p><p>After escaping, Qi Yuan's mood was surprisingly good.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he might have felt that the Ugly Clothing Monster King was extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was just a matter of a few days.</p><p></p><p>He used the Bridal Armor to grind himself to level 90, and the Ugly Clothing Monster King could not stop him at all.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it would be a question of whether the Ugly Clothing Monster King's claws were harder, or Qi Yuan's sword was sharper!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

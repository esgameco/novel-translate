        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【The White Day Ascension Gate Guardian will be slain on the White Day Ascension Platform, and the power to control the Heavenly Forbidden will be obtained.】</p><p></p><p>It seems this NPC is not deceiving.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I accept the challenge!" Qi Yuan said firmly, holding Little Bride's hand.</p><p></p><p>He had to take Little Bride with him, otherwise she would stumble and fall again.</p><p></p><p>Last time, when he fought against Zanghua, he didn't bring Little Bride, and when he saw her later, she had probably fallen and stumbled several times, her body covered in dust and dirt, looking pitiful, which made him feel heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Armored Divine General looked at Qi Yuan, his voice booming: "The battle begins, death is endless!"</p><p></p><p>With this voice, Qi Yuan saw a staircase appear on the Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! It was as if the footsteps of a giant beast shaking the ground, the staircase continuously spreading from the sky to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In about a quarter of an hour, those stairs had spread to Qi Yuan's feet.</p><p></p><p>From the sky to the ground, a heavenly staircase appeared.</p><p></p><p>Counting the number, it was exactly 129,600 steps.</p><p></p><p>"Climb the stairs, the battle begins, the victor will ascend one step." The golden-armored man spoke, explaining the rules.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not immediately climb, but asked, "Can I rest in between?"</p><p></p><p>"For each victory, you can descend the stairs, but you cannot stay outside for more than a day, or you will be forcibly summoned back!</p><p></p><p>Note, one year on the stairs is one day in the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's fine then." Qi Yuan's heart was at ease.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Little Bride with a smile: "This time, I will fight alongside you."</p><p></p><p>He added a sentence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Fight alongside the Five Elements Forbidden Land, and the Yin-Yang Forbidden, with everyone.</p><p></p><p>These 129,600 battles will be the perfect opportunity to hone his combat experience, and refine the combat experience and insights of those 84 people.</p><p></p><p>From the battle with Zanghua, Qi Yuan had gained much enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>And this ascent of the White Day Ascension Platform is a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The combat experience he lacks should be able to be trained here, right?</p><p></p><p>And after experiencing so many battles and slaying so many monsters, he should also gain a lot of experience, right?</p><p></p><p>With this mindset, Qi Yuan stepped onto the first step of the stairs.</p><p></p><p>His field of vision instantly changed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was now standing on the Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He found that the place he was in now was like an arena.</p><p></p><p>Around the arena, there were tens of thousands of seats. </p><p></p><p>The seats had different levels, some were high-class, some were ordinary.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in the past, there were people watching the duels in this arena!</p><p></p><p>But now, it was empty, without any audience.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan, who had social anxiety, feel a bit better.</p><p></p><p>"Good, there's no one watching, otherwise it would be embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thunderous heartbeat sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then saw a tall, muscular man, bare-chested like a sumo wrestler from a prosperous country, rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>This was not a living being, but a residual shadow, or perhaps... a monster that could provide experience! "Little Bride!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan merged with Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, he closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was no longer himself, he was Long Pian.</p><p></p><p>Insights must come from the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Long Pian's memories, Long Pian's combat experience, flowed into Qi Yuan's mind like a spring.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had forgotten his own techniques.</p><p></p><p>He treated himself as Long Pian.</p><p></p><p>If he was Long Pian, how would he face this enemy.</p><p></p><p>Then, Qi Yuan moved.</p><p></p><p>He turned his back to the burly man.</p><p></p><p>Then he reached back and grabbed the man's neck.</p><p></p><p>Slam! Boom! The burly man fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered all over the arena, staining it red.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan won this battle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also opened his eyes, reflecting on the gains and losses of this battle.</p><p></p><p>"Why did I attack from behind?"</p><p></p><p>"Turning my back on the world?"</p><p></p><p>"That was quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, no, it's because he blushed!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly discovered the key point.</p><p></p><p>With the first victory, the second battle also began.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lifted his foot, seemingly stepping onto the second step of the stairs.</p><p></p><p>The enemy appeared again, this time a fierce crocodile-like beast.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, Qi Yuan logged out of the game.</p><p></p><p>He went out for a stroll, and when he saw Jiang Lingsu, he couldn't help but blurt out:</p><p></p><p>"Sister-in-law, you've turned green."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Lingsu, in her green robe and ethereal valley, the most eye-catching thing was the "ramen green leaves" on her head.</p><p></p><p>Her hair had become a ramen hairstyle, but those were all green leaves.</p><p></p><p>Lush and thriving.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even saw small birds flying among the dense, lush green leaves.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu glared at Qi Yuan fiercely: "You're the one who's turned green, this is the essence of the Wood attribute, a good thing!"</p><p></p><p>Just today, the Shenguang Sect was shaken again!</p><p></p><p>Because many cultivators' heads and other parts of their bodies had started to sprout green buds and grow green leaves.</p><p></p><p>At first, the sect was in chaos, and some even thought someone had cast a secret technique to harm them.</p><p></p><p>But the sect master came forward and explained that it was likely due to the appearance of a Wood attribute treasure, which was why this was happening.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the people in the sect feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>Many people were searching for the Wood attribute treasure, and some had discovered that the green leaves and grass growing on their heads and other parts of their bodies were the essence of the Wood attribute, which was very beneficial for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As a result, many people were selling the Wood attribute essence, and the beautiful female cultivators with Wood attribute essence growing on their bodies were especially popular, fetching sky-high prices.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan jealous to the point of grinding his teeth.</p><p></p><p>These were the Wood attribute essences he had created, but they were growing on other people's bodies, allowing them to make a fortune.</p><p></p><p>He even thought about secretly knocking those people unconscious and stripping all the hair and Wood attribute essence off their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, he was just jealous.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jealousy, but integrity remains.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't bring himself to do it either.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would create a bunch of green dragons, white tigers, monks, and nuns.</p><p></p><p>Can this sect still be stayed in?" "Sister, would you give me some of your wood-elemental essence?" Qi Yuan looked at his sister and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu immediately blushed: "No."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, I've seen a lot of people selling it outside..." Before Qi Yuan could finish, he was interrupted by Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Scram!"</p><p></p><p>This wood-elemental essence is connected to her body, in a sense an extension of her body. How could she possibly give it to someone else, let alone a man? However, she glanced at Qi Yuan, a deep doubt flashing in her eyes: "Big Brother, the bloody scent around you has become rather strong lately."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan recalled the game, where he had broken through the Ascension Platform, killing countless beings.</p><p></p><p>Because, each step was not just one enemy, but possibly a group of enemies.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the killing intent and bloody scent in the game have also carried over to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that strong?" Qi Yuan asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu nodded: "If you weren't holed up on the Seven-Colored Peak every day, I would even suspect that you secretly went out and wiped out an entire clan one day."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes reddened: "How dare you slander me without any basis! The Black Mountain Sect was not destroyed by me!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu laughed: "Who knows? Maybe you secretly ran out and, with that vegetable knife of yours, chopped all the people of the Black Mountain Sect to death."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze instantly turned cold: "Sister, you know too much!"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Jiang Lingsu inexplicably shuddered inside.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, a sense of fear growing in her heart, but she still said, "Brother, I don't know why you have such a strong killing intent.</p><p></p><p>But you'd better dispel or hide this killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it won't be good for your cultivation, and demonic thoughts will arise.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, if you encounter some eccentric great cultivators, they might take it upon themselves to act righteously and eliminate you."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, a thread of fear and aversion flashed in the depths of Jiang Lingsu's heart.</p><p></p><p>She knew such cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators belonged to the same organization.</p><p></p><p>The people in the organization hated evil with a passion, but their reputation was not very good.</p><p></p><p>They called themselves the Righteous Envoys, but their actions were tyrannical beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>There was once a cultivator who wiped out a bandit stronghold, but then encountered people from that organization, who killed him on the grounds that his bloody scent was too strong.</p><p></p><p>After all, their definition of righteousness was the only righteousness.</p><p></p><p>They said whoever killed too much, regardless of the reason, deserved to die.</p><p></p><p>"What, there are such people who want to subdue demons and eliminate evils?" Qi Yuan heard this and was somewhat unsteady on his feet.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>She really couldn't understand how her brother, with such a problematic mind, could have such a strong bloody scent on him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that playing too many games would also affect reality?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there are such people, and not just one. They are an organization.</p><p></p><p>How, Big Brother, are you going to go and wipe out their entire clan?</p><p></p><p>They are not as weak as the Black Mountain Sect, they have dozens of Nascent Soul cultivators." Jiang Lingsu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan sat on the ground, dejected and powerless: "I'm too useless, too weak and helpless, that I can't immediately kill all these despicable people and wipe out their entire clan."</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, Qi Yuan said, "Such despicable people, I should ally with the righteous faction and have them destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding her brother's eccentric thought process, Jiang Lingsu was already used to it, and she was also happy to chat nonsense with him: "The righteous faction won't work, they represent justice, and they often do evil deeds in the name of justice."</p><p></p><p>"Standing on the moral high ground to act?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's thoughts turned, understanding Qi Yuan's meaning: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, they're actually learning from me. Only I can truly grasp the moral high ground! Hmph, those who imitate me shall live, those who resemble me shall die. This organization, if I'm not the boss, they'll be done for! Even if I become the boss, I'll expel those evil ones, the rebels!"</p><p></p><p>Expel their status? Jiang Lingsu was stunned: "Big Brother, you're really ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what's the name of this organization?"</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of Light."</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of Light? Why don't they call it the Society of Light?" Qi Yuan muttered, then said, "I've remembered them, don't let me encounter them, or they'll get what's coming to them."</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Qi Yuan became a little worried. He lowered his voice and leaned close to Jiang Lingsu's lush ear and said, "Sister, their sect doesn't have any Primordial Saints who can sense what I just mentioned about them, right?"</p><p></p><p>"...No."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>That's good.</p><p></p><p>But he still wasn't at ease: "They won't suddenly come to the Seven-Colored Peak?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Jiang Lingsu felt that she shouldn't have told her big brother, scaring him like this.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's heart was at ease: "Sigh, you're right, I need to get rid of the bloody scent on me."</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Lingsu said softly, "But I heard that someone from the Hall of Light has come to the Great Wilderness, seemingly wanting to get involved in the Dragon Seizing Struggle."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Qi Yuan was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, he's not strong, just at the Foundation Establishment stage."</p><p></p><p>"No one else came?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>At night, Qi Yuan returned to his room, unable to sleep well.</p><p></p><p>However, remembering that the game was not yet completed, he decided to set this matter aside for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, he stayed on the Seven-Colored Peak every day, how could he coincidentally encounter those meddlesome people? Moreover, he had no grievances with the Hall of Light, he hadn't even seen their faces, and he had his pride, he didn't want to stand on the moral high ground.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect was different.</p><p></p><p>I recommend a novel, if you're interested, you can go take a look and collect it. The link is below. "High Martial Arts: My Clone Evolved into an Immortal God".</p><p></p><p>Recommendation: In the High Martial Arts world, obtain a water snake clone, and evolve it from a water snake to an immortal divine dragon.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

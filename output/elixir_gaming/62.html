        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young girl finished her forceful words and turned to leave. She didn't give Qi Yuan any time to react.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes and watched the girl's retreating back. This was the first time he had seen an NPC in this world display such intense emotions.</p><p></p><p>Tong Yan's expression, on the other hand, was without sorrow or joy. He already knew that the Five Patriarchs of Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth were merely remnants of obsession. The five of them had long since perished at the hands of demonic forces from beyond the domain.</p><p></p><p>The usually rational Tong Yan did not have the melancholy sentimentality of Little Green.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan felt a burning sensation. A ball of fiery red flames flew towards him, burning continuously just dozens of centimeters away.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!" With a loud cry, the Fire Patriarch materialized in human form beside Qi Yuan, looking at him with malicious intent. "You may look good, but you don't seem to have anything special. What makes you the complete embodiment of the Five Elements?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Yan quickly introduced, "This is the Fire Patriarch, who has a rather volatile temper."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Fire Patriarch," Qi Yuan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Tong Yan's words, the Fire Patriarch opened his mouth and spewed a ball of flames that ignited Tong Yan's clothes.</p><p></p><p>Tong Yan chuckled gracefully, "Fire Patriarch, you're being mischievous again."</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!" The Fire Patriarch cried out in anger.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan felt the presence of the other energies approaching.</p><p></p><p>The soil on the ground began to flow, as if a mole was moving within. Then, a small girl with a round belly, resembling a roly-poly, materialized.</p><p></p><p>The roly-poly girl did not speak as she looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Earth Patriarch," Tong Yan introduced.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Earth Patriarch," Qi Yuan greeted with a bow.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I just took a little nap, and you've already become the complete embodiment of the Five Elements. I thought I had slept for thousands of years, but when I asked, it's only been three days. Truly, it's beyond my expectations," a voice came from the distance as the Gold Patriarch approached.</p><p></p><p>He was still dressed as meticulously as the first time Qi Yuan had met him, formal and upright.</p><p></p><p>Beside the Gold Patriarch stood two others - the Water Patriarch, a woman in a blue dress with a mature beauty, and the Wood Patriarch, dressed in vibrant colors, barefoot, and with a cheerful, laughing expression.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the three of you," Qi Yuan greeted them solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Yan and the other prodigies quietly left the area.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Little Bride's hand and faced the Five Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Patriarch stepped forward, his expression kind and benevolent. "On that day, I made a pact with the Master of the Clothing Faction. Now, I have come to fulfill that promise."</p><p></p><p>He did not beat around the bush but went straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>The volatile Fire Patriarch wanted to say something, but the roly-poly Earth Patriarch kicked him in the butt, silencing him. The Fire Patriarch remained silent, though he still looked dissatisfied with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Then, the dignified and graceful Water Patriarch spoke, "Master of the Clothing Faction, can you guarantee that you will participate in the Demon Slaying Assembly three hundred years from now and slay the demonic forces from beyond the domain?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan controlled the Five Elements Forbidden Land. If he did so, the Patriarchs would dissipate in this world, and their remaining obsessions would cease to exist.</p><p></p><p>"I will slay the demonic forces from beyond the domain!" Qi Yuan did not mention the Demon Slaying Assembly but directly targeted the demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>He must kill the demonic forces from beyond the domain. They were the final boss of this game, and once Qi Yuan defeated them, he would obtain the complete fragments of the Heavenly Dao and be able to establish the foundation of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The Water Patriarch nodded in satisfaction upon hearing the answer.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Patriarch, Wood Patriarch, and Earth Patriarch also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Only the Fire Patriarch looked unwilling, but after being glared at by the roly-poly Earth Patriarch, he reluctantly nodded as well.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then looked at the Gold Patriarch and slowly asked, "How strong are the demonic forces from beyond the domain, based on your experiences?"</p><p></p><p>He was genuinely curious about the combat power of the demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Patriarch fell silent, then said, "The demonic forces from beyond the domain possess a supreme treasure called the Flesh Hook. It is like a fishing line that descends from the heavens and pierces into the bodies of cultivators. When my predecessor was pierced by the Flesh Hook, even with all his might, he could not sever it, nor leave even a trace behind."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt a sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Patriarch had been a Godly Realm expert in his lifetime, yet he was unable to cut the Flesh Hook or even leave a mark on it.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan encountered this Flesh Hook, it would likely be an immense challenge.</p><p></p><p>"In the Demon Slaying Assembly, if you battle the demonic forces, you must stay away from the Flesh Hook," the Wood Patriarch reminded. "Once it pierces into your body, even Celestial Deities cannot escape unharmed."</p><p></p><p>The volatile Fire Patriarch unexpectedly spoke up as well, "The demonic forces from beyond the domain may not be a single entity, but two, or even more!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took in all this information, his eyes flashing with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Just how strong are the demonic forces from beyond the domain? The Five Elements Forbidden Land has around fifty powerful experts, and the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land has dozens as well. If we all work together and attack them, won't we be able to easily cut them down with our combined strength?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the power of the Four Great Forbidden Lands was formidable. With these ninety-level experts working together, he would likely be no match for them.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic forces from beyond the domain have immortal bodies and cannot be killed! Or even if they are killed, they will revive!" the vibrant and colorful Wood Patriarch said.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal bodies?" Qi Yuan was somewhat surprised, but it was just surprise, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>How could there be a boss in the game that couldn't be killed? At most, he would just have to kill them a few more times.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's assessment of the demonic forces from beyond the domain had risen further.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Hundred Level, going to confront the demonic forces would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>The Gold Patriarch, seeing that Qi Yuan had learned what he wanted to know, smiled benevolently. "Old friends, let us fulfill our promise and empower the Master of the Clothing Faction."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Damn it, fine!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the five of them placed their arms on Qi Yuan's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>The powers of Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth surged into Qi Yuan's body, more vibrant than the Five Elemental Essences.</p><p></p><p>They spread through Qi Yuan's body, making his blood seem to change color. Markings of the five colors appeared on his skin, like tattoos.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched as the Five Patriarchs' bodies gradually faded away. Except for the reluctant Fire Patriarch, the others seemed calm, even with a sense of liberation.</p><p></p><p>The four Patriarchs did not speak, but Qi Yuan could read their expressions, seeing them slowly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>In the final moments, the Fire Patriarch suddenly let out a loud roar, "Kid, I hate you! It's because of you that I'm reminded of the fact that I'm already dead!"</p><p></p><p>With this final shout, as if using up all his strength, the Fire Patriarch's form disappeared from this world.</p><p></p><p>The other four Patriarchs also vanished from Qi Yuan's sight, as if they had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>They're gone.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the Five Element tattoos on his body, which would likely take a day to fully settle and integrate.</p><p></p><p>He tightened his grip on Little Bride's hand a bit more. "Log out, I'll come back tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>He felt that today's expenditure had been somewhat excessive.</p><p></p><p>He took Little Bride to an empty area and dug a hole, as he usually did, and they crawled into it together.</p><p></p><p>He embraced Little Bride's waist and opened his contact list.</p><p></p><p>Lonely, with only Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, I've become a killer of old men."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, five old fellows died in front of me, fulfilling my wish."</p><p></p><p>"Although they were NPCs, I still feel a bit strange about it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sent the message and waited for a reply, but there was none.</p><p></p><p>He knew that recently Jinli had been leading the Imperial Guards on a rapid conquest, completing her missions. She was very busy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xiaojia tightly grasped Qi Yuan's hand, and a wooden plaque with a sticker pattern slid out of her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "Having a wife is not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>He embraced Xiaojia, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements?"</p><p></p><p>"If one day, I can re-establish the Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire, I must refine the false into the real, transform the illusory into the substantial, and bring the Five Elements back to the world!"</p><p></p><p>After this grand declaration, Qi Yuan awkwardly smiled again.</p><p></p><p>"That's too chuunibyou, haha, I'm not the Chosen One."</p><p></p><p>"What makes me think I can do anything I say?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would an NPC believe a player so much?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I'm so sleepy."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the game, Qi Yuan felt his body becoming increasingly drowsy.</p><p></p><p>The game jade slips entered his body, and without a second thought, he directly lay down on the bed.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, the Qi of the Five Elements was constantly circulating, seemingly replacing his previous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Qi of the Five Elements permeated Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>The entire room underwent special changes.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the knife tied with a rope seemed to sense something and shivered.</p><p></p><p>However, it crouched down, as if it had also developed a greedy desire, greedily absorbing the air.</p><p></p><p>In the air, there seemed to be a dense metallic force.</p><p></p><p>The entire Seven-Colored Peak... no, the Shenguang Sect, had all undergone special changes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Dongxian stood in front of the Sect Master of the Shenguang Sect, Kumu Zhenjun, his entire body tense.</p><p></p><p>The Artifact Elder within him had also completely concealed its aura, afraid of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>After all, the old man before him was a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>To the previous Artifact Elders, he was not much of a threat.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was merely a wisp of a remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>If the Nascent Soul Grandmaster discovered his existence, any Nascent Soul Grandmaster would not let go of this opportunity to search his soul.</p><p></p><p>After all, his memories were a great treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, the Artifact Elder would be completely dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Dongxian, not bad, your cultivation has been destroyed, yet you remain unperturbed." Kumu Zhenjun praised, "How have you been doing at the Wanfa Peak?"</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was puzzled, not knowing why Kumu Zhenjun would be concerned about him.</p><p></p><p>He still answered firmly, "The senior brothers and sisters have treated me very well."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Kumu Zhenjun continued, "In half a year, the Struggle for the Dragon will begin. Do you have any thoughts on this?"</p><p></p><p>In the current Great Xia Empire, the aging Emperor was nearing the end of his life, and it was the Empress Dowager who was primarily in charge.</p><p></p><p>The Empress Dowager had no heir, and the position of Crown Prince had not been determined.</p><p></p><p>Several princes harbored ambitious desires and coveted the position of the Son of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Court of the Great Xia had deliberated and initiated the Struggle for the Dragon.</p><p></p><p>The several princes, leading their subordinates, would compete in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, and the victor would become the Crown Prince of the Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>At first, when this news was announced, the princes were all dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Because the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm had limitations.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators above the age of thirty could not enter.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the strongest participants would only be at the Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>While those princes were at their peak, their subordinates were mostly Elixir Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly severed their main forces.</p><p></p><p>However, the Empress Dowager's attitude was firm, and the three major Immortal Cultivation Sects of the Great Xia also supported this decision.</p><p></p><p>Those princes could only reluctantly agree.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the Struggle for the Dragon that Dongxian was forced to leave the capital and join the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have survived until then.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was opposed to the Struggle for the Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Sect's question, he quickly shook his head, "I dare not!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's eyes flashed with a sharp light. "Now that you are a disciple of our Shenguang Sect, you must dare."</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was surprised and then felt a surge of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Was the Shenguang Sect supporting him to become the Crown Prince of the Great Xia?</p><p></p><p>After all, Dongxian was still a young man who had been forced to leave the capital and even break off his engagement.</p><p></p><p>For such a young man, this was a kind of humiliation.</p><p></p><p>He had once thought of using the Artifact Elder's help to cultivate to the Nascent Soul realm and then return home in glory.</p><p></p><p>However, that might be an event hundreds or even thousands of years in the future.</p><p></p><p>Would his beloved still be the same then?</p><p></p><p>Now, hearing that the Shenguang Sect wanted to support him, to become a disciple of the Great Xia, even if he remained calm on the surface, his heart was somewhat stirred.</p><p></p><p>"In half a year, the Struggle for the Dragon will begin.</p><p></p><p>Our Shenguang Sect will dispatch two Qi Condensation disciples and one Elixir Realm Elder to assist you." The Shenguang Sect Master said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dongxian's breathing became a bit rapid.</p><p></p><p>Although the strength of the disciples and Elder dispatched by the Shenguang Sect was average, it represented the Shenguang Sect's stance.</p><p></p><p>This was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sect Master!" Dongxian, being a young man, had gambled. "For the battle in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, we need Qi Condensation combat strength.</p><p></p><p>You can either send two of your own, or you can choose them yourself.</p><p></p><p>But if you choose them yourself, you'll have to provide something to win them over, I won't be involved."</p><p></p><p>"I'll choose them myself!" Dongxian said.</p><p></p><p>He was ambitious.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sect Master's dispatched Qi Condensation disciples would certainly not be bad, they might not be the absolute top ones.</p><p></p><p>With the Artifact Elder's help, he was confident he could select more suitable ones.</p><p></p><p>The Artifact Elder had previously mentioned in secret that this Shenguang Sect was not as simple as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>There were a few ordinary disciples who were deeply hidden.</p><p></p><p>With the Artifact Elder's help, he felt he could select suitable Qi Condensation disciples and provide something to win them over.</p><p></p><p>The Shenguang Sect Master heard this and a smile appeared on his face. "Good."</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and then said, "I've heard that you have been cultivating the Forging Dao at the Wanfa Peak and have achieved some success.</p><p></p><p>Let me take a look at the magical tools you have forged.</p><p></p><p>Although I'm not an expert in Forging, I have some knowledge and can provide some guidance."</p><p></p><p>After the discussion was over, it was time to start building rapport.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was adept at imperial affairs and knew this principle.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and took out a Mysterious Heaven Measuring Ruler from his person.</p><p></p><p>This Mysterious Heaven Measuring Ruler was forged with the Artifact Elder's assistance and was Dongxian's proud creation.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Mysterious Heaven Measuring Ruler, forged from thirty-seven types of metals, unbreakable, and can even withstand a strike from a Qi Condensation magical tool without shattering."</p><p></p><p>Dongxian held the Mysterious Heaven Measuring Ruler with both hands, his face filled with pride.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Dongxian was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Shenguang Sect Master was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the straight Mysterious Heaven Measuring Ruler inexplicably broke into three pieces.</p><p></p><p>Even more surprisingly, these three pieces of the Mysterious Heaven Measuring Ruler formed a matchstick figure that directly ran out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian was dumbfounded: "My magical tool has awakened intelligence?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I this powerful? Was the Artifact Elder holding back?"</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 484</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was unclear what was happening at the Gate of Absolute Principles.</p><p></p><p>Only by relying on the projection of the stars could the outcome of the battle be known.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable True Primal stood in the void, guarded by a group of celestial gods. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and coldly said, "This Tenth Day Venerable has been too arrogant, not knowing the terribleness of the Supreme Lord. This time... the first divine treasure of the Immortal Realm shall become the possession of my Brilliant Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding powerful experts had various reactions to this voice.</p><p></p><p>Some were filled with worry, while others had complex thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In the Absolute Principles Assembly:</p><p></p><p>"If we had known he had the Gate of Absolute Principles, we should have gone to assist him. Now... the Gate of Absolute Principles has fallen into the hands of the Great Day."</p><p></p><p>"With the Great Day's strength, combined with the Gate of Absolute Principles, this Six Realms Heavens... Ah, this Tenth Day Venerable is quite unwise, attempting to gain the great with the small, unaware that any schemes are useless before the might of the Supreme Lord."</p><p></p><p>As Supreme Lords themselves, they naturally knew the immense power and terror of the Supreme Lord. It could be said that the Supreme Lord was even stronger than the common imagination of the Great Absolute Principles.</p><p></p><p>The two Supreme Lords had deep thoughts, pondering the matters after the Great Day's emergence.</p><p></p><p>In the Vast Heavens:</p><p></p><p>The old man in a straw coat looked like a little old man. "It seems the victor this time will be the Unique One."</p><p></p><p>In the White Dragon Abyss:</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Master had a complex expression: "No wonder he was unwilling to give birth to my offspring, it turns out... he had the Gate of Absolute Principles."</p><p></p><p>She said this while looking towards the stars in the starry sky, her eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>These celestial god venerable ones all inwardly determined that a great battle would occur within the Gate of Absolute Principles, and the victor would be the Great Day.</p><p></p><p>But they were mistaken in their judgment.</p><p></p><p>Within the Gate of Absolute Principles, it was silent and still, without any great battle.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps... the king was not there.</p><p></p><p>The vast and boundless starry sky was magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Gazing into the distance, the stars were like pearls, intertwined on the colorful array. Seen from afar, it was as if the Milky Way was hanging upside down.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling and boundless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in this boundless universe, his expression complex. He shouted towards the vast cosmos, "Great Day, your father is calling you back home for a meal!"</p><p></p><p>Even in the vacuum, Qi Yuan's voice could still spread, instantly reaching millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>But the voice did not echo, not even a ripple in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged, "As expected, the universe is too big, I don't know where I've sent Great Day to."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew there was a gap in strength between him and Great Day.</p><p></p><p>In a direct confrontation, he would most likely lose.</p><p></p><p>So he utilized his clever mind to scheme.</p><p></p><p>He did not intend to clash head-on with Great Day. Instead, he set up a trap, as if he was being oppressed by the Brilliant Palace and could no longer endure, so he brought out the Gate of Absolute Principles and forcibly exchanged places with Great Day.</p><p></p><p>But after Great Day entered the Gate of Absolute Principles, Qi Yuan directly sent the Gate to the universe where the Stellar Cinnabar Elixir was located, and then quickly retrieved it.</p><p></p><p>So when Great Day pushed open the door, the place he entered was not the Gate of Absolute Principles, but a vast and desolate universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe was boundless, much larger than the Six Realms Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Great Day was exiled there, separated from the Six Realms Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"The powerful beings of the Six Realms Heavens, upon entering other universes, will immediately perish."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself. This was information he had obtained in the Six Realms Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The beings of the Six Realms Heavens could not travel to other universes through extraordinary means, or they would immediately die.</p><p></p><p>And the beings of other universes, if they entered the Six Realms Heavens through extraordinary means, could not return to their original universe either, and would also face life and death.</p><p></p><p>"However, I vaguely feel that Great Day will not die so easily."</p><p></p><p>In the arrangements of the Six Realms Heavens, the divine infant of the Buddha Realm had also sent a message, and Great Day's stellar projection was still there.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this universe is fake, or is there another reason?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps... this universe is without a master?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because it was without a master that Great Day, as a Supreme Lord, could step in without immediately perishing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the space flickered.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Ning Tao and the orange-yellow long-robed Canary appeared, petite and charming, alluring and cute.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, a delicate figure instantly crashed into Qi Yuan's embrace, clinging to him like a koala.</p><p></p><p>Kisses rained down, the young girl's tender lips shamelessly seeking.</p><p></p><p>"I missed you so much!"</p><p></p><p>The Canary's eyes were filled with dense yearning and affection, boldly expressing her emotions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand swept across the girl's thigh, and the other hand dragged her perky buttocks, a touch of tenderness flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the Canary's bold passion, Ning Tao was much more aloof and reserved.</p><p></p><p>The black dress accentuated Ning Tao's sickly pale skin, as white as jade. Her slightly thin figure stood there, and a smile appeared on her detached and distant face.</p><p></p><p>"The area illuminated by the Stellar Cinnabar Elixir has not detected Great Day's presence, he should be in another void location."</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has been transported to another area."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The universe was so vast that even the celestial god venerable ones might find it difficult to traverse it in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"If only I could send him into a black hole, I wonder if the black hole could kill him!" Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he reached out and grasped Ning Tao's icy cold little hand.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao did not struggle, her expression somewhat grave. "Husband, after you return, a day here is a century. If he remains here... his strength may increase rapidly, and without the restriction of the Immortal Dao will, he may thrive like a fish in water."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was not worried. "Strength cannot be so easily increased. This universe may even be unsuitable for the cultivation of Six Realms Heavens cultivators."</p><p></p><p>When he devised his grand plan, he had considered unexpected situations.</p><p></p><p>This universe was very strange and almost devoid of immortal spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>It was even less than the lower realm of the Six Realms Heavens.</p><p></p><p>If Great Day were to have a fortuitous encounter in this universe, finding a supreme treasure and suddenly increasing in strength, that would be too much to hope for.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to directly imagine that Great Day had an encounter in the Six Realms Heavens, found a supreme treasure, and suddenly awakened, becoming a reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"However, you must be careful. Although the universe is vast, there is still a chance of one in a million of encountering Great Day. If you do, quickly return to the Six Realms Heavens," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although the chance was one in a million, it still needed to be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, husband, you underestimate me too much. I have also been working hard to become stronger," Ning Tao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, a terrifying power instantly swept across the surroundings, causing the stars to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the space-time around them was briefly constrained.</p><p></p><p>"Great Absolute Principles?" Qi Yuan blinked, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The power Ning Tao had just displayed was close to, if not at, the level of the Great Absolute Principles.</p><p></p><p>She said proudly, "Every day refining the Stellar Cinnabar Elixir, my strength may not have increased as much as yours, husband, but it is still terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If that Great Day dares to appear here, with my Stellar Cinnabar Elixir lending a hand to you, husband, he will have no chance of returning!"</p><p></p><p>Each time Ning Tao refined a Stellar Cinnabar Elixir for Qi Yuan, his strength would increase. As the refiner, Ning Tao's strength would also rise accordingly.</p><p></p><p>And in this universe, Qi Yuan's cinnabar elixir was a true stellar one, not just a stellar projection like in the Six Realms Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Stellar Cinnabar Elixir was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao spoke boldly, while the Canary clung to Qi Yuan like a little bird, not wanting to miss a single moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao's brows furrowed. "Husband, you have the scent of another woman on you."</p><p></p><p>The Canary stopped her movements, curling up in Qi Yuan's embrace, her little nose twitching. "It's quite fragrant."</p><p></p><p>"It's Jing Li," Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao and the Canary on the Orb Star already knew of Jing Li's existence.</p><p></p><p>"So it's sister Jing Li."</p><p>"So it's sister Jing Li."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao and the Canary spoke at the same time, using different forms of address.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao gripped her clothes and glanced at the distant stars. There was a hint of reluctance in her eyes, but she said firmly, "Husband, you should go back quickly. Although Great Day is not seen, the threat of the Brilliant Palace still remains."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and gathered Ning Tao in his arms as well.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's face immediately showed a flicker of panic. After all, the persona she maintained had a touch of the elegant and aloof older sister.</p><p></p><p>How could an elegant older sister be carried like a doll?</p><p></p><p>After the husband leaves, the Canary will surely mock her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan planted a kiss on the cheeks of both Ning Tao and the Canary, without any pretense. "I'll be going now."</p><p></p><p>His figure then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the lonely universe, only the two petite figures of Ning Tao and the Canary remained.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, being so reserved, you really lost out. Today, I kissed my husband a hundred and thirty thousand more times than you!" the Canary said arrogantly, as if boasting.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if your cinnabar elixir refining was as fast as your kissing, my husband would already be unrivaled in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"You're jealous, your possessiveness is too strong, it might make you sick!</p><p></p><p>So aloof normally, but in bed you're even more......"</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Six Realms Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Many eyes were fixed on the Heavenly Firmament Extraordinary Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jing Li's mind was tense, and there was a hint of worry in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Moon Imprint did not indicate that Qi Yuan had suffered a heavy blow, which could be considered a good thing.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable True Primal had his eyes closed, but his inner calm was not as tranquil as his outward appearance.</p><p></p><p>Although Great Day's stellar projection was still there, the stellar projection of the Tenth Day Venerable was also present, which meant that Great Day the Supreme Lord had not yet slain the Tenth Day Venerable.</p><p></p><p>This made him inevitably puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Lords and celestial god venerable ones also had similar thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Logically, this kind of battle should have been resolved quickly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, the space rippled, and a lazy voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, where did Great Day Venerable go? How did I lose track of him?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure appeared, standing in the void, his hands spread out, with an innocent expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Great Day has gone missing, it's not that I've kidnapped him!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the celestial god venerable ones in the Six Realms Heavens who were watching this scene couldn't help but rub their eyes, finding it hard to believe what they were seeing.</p><p></p><p>"You... you actually came out!" The Venerable True Primal also couldn't believe his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Great Day the Supreme Lord and the Tenth Day Venerable had both disappeared, and the one who appeared was the Tenth Day Venerable.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>A sense of absurdity accompanied by a sense of crisis swept over them.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The White Dragon Abyss Master's expression was particularly complex.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, her emotional fluctuations had been greater than all her previous lifetimes combined.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe was the Tenth Heavenly Venerable, who had comprehended two supreme principles, and even the Gate of Principles, to the extent of saying... he had made the Great Sun disappear.</p><p></p><p>Which of these events alone would not shake the Heavens? Yet, they all happened to one person, and in a very short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Now in the White Dragon Abyss, the temperature has risen without any coolness left, all of it having been absorbed by her.</p><p></p><p>In the Principles Assembly, the two Supreme Venerables were also shaken in their divine spirits.</p><p></p><p>The peerlessly powerful Great Sun Venerable... had actually entered the Gate of Principles and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze towards Qi Yuan had changed from previous regret to current apprehension.</p><p></p><p>This time, they truly began to take Qi Yuan seriously, no longer treating him as a junior.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you hide the Venerable?" The True Origin Venerable raged, more fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, maybe he got senile dementia and got lost, don't blame me, I'm not taking the blame!" Qi Yuan frantically deflected.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The True Origin Venerable's expression became even more embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's expression also became cold: "You previously said to let me go to the Taihuang Palace and kneel to confess. To the Taihuang Palace I shall go, but not to confess, but to demand justice!"</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Venerable's face turned pale, and the Yin Divinities and Yang Divinities behind him finally realized the seriousness of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Because if the Great Sun was gone, the Taihuang Palace... might truly be in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Venerable was somewhat apprehensive, but then thought of something, and his expression became resolute again.</p><p></p><p>"My Taihuang Palace is not something you can just come and go as you please."</p><p></p><p>Although he spoke harshly, he now had the intention to retreat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's expression slightly changed, as if he had sensed something.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the True Origin Venerable with a murderous intent: "In one day, I will flatten the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure disappeared as he finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>This ruthless statement also shook many Yang Divinities.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Great Sun Venerable had truly been trapped by the Tenth Heavenly Venerable and was temporarily unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the foundation of the Taihuang Palace was terrifyingly frightening, how dare this Tenth Heavenly Venerable...? Could it be that he still had some trump card?</p><p></p><p>But in the face of absolute strength, would those trump cards be of any use? After all, as long as he did not enter the unknown Gate of Principles, in this main battlefield of the Six Realms, there was no one with the attainment of a Great Principle Moment, so how could he contend with the Taihuang Palace? All were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Shocked and then numb, accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Purple Origin Heavens was in complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the battle between the Purple Origin Ancestor and Saint Wuming was still at a disadvantage, but not life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that just now, Saint Wuming had suddenly used the Demonic Blood, instantly triggering the Purple Origin Ancestor's Demonic Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribulation was the thing most feared by the cultivators of this world, especially the Yang Divinities of the Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yang Divinities at the Principle Realm, if they did not encounter the Rinai Molting, would almost never die.</p><p></p><p>And among the fallen Yang Divinities of the Principle Realm, nearly two-thirds had died under the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>So it can be said that the Yang Venerable Heavenly Venerables of the Six Realms, except for a few who bravely advanced, many who knew their own limits would stagnate.</p><p></p><p>Like the Purple Origin Ancestor, his cultivation realm had not progressed for many years, just to delay the arrival of the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that when the Demonic Tribulation descended, he would die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that except for the Yang Divinities who had mastered the supreme principles, the rest of the Great Principles, including the White Dragon Abyss Lord who was in the second echelon of the Great Principles, all viewed the Demonic Tribulation as a poisonous scorpion.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribulation, like a sword hanging over their heads, made these Great Principles dare not advance.</p><p></p><p>If they could pass through the Demonic Tribulation unharmed, the strength of these Great Principles could also continue to grow, and they might even approach the Venerables.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Purple Origin Ancestor was trapped in the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Saint Wuming, seeing that the Tenth Heavenly Venerable had actually emerged from the Heavenly Chasm, did not hesitate at all and directly fled.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Tan paced back and forth, his expression tense: "The Ancestor... is trapped in the Demonic Tribulation..."</p><p></p><p>As one of the few Principles in the Purple Origin Heavens, he naturally knew that the Ancestor could not withstand the Demonic Tribulation again.</p><p></p><p>If the Ancestor was gone, the Purple Origin Heavens... would fall to the Fifth Realm, even facing the crisis of destruction.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Divinities and Purple Origin Snow, etc., also had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor was the anchor of the Purple Origin Heavens.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the void, half of the Purple Origin Ancestor's body was withered and the other half was ruddy.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribulation was devouring his body and consuming his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had also become hazy, only occasionally becoming clear.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this is my tribulation, no need to grieve."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor spoke, his voice infinitely desolate.</p><p></p><p>He had already felt that his death was near.</p><p></p><p>He would not last much longer.</p><p></p><p>"The only lucky thing is that the Blood Robe actually walked out of the Gate of Principles."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, a faint smile appeared on the Purple Origin Ancestor's lips, "Being able to see this scene before my death, this life is enough!"</p><p></p><p>However, the Purple Origin Ancestor was also a little helpless, letting that guy the Blood Robe see him in such a pitiful state, perhaps he would mock him.</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Origin Heavens, the Yang Divinities and Heavenly Prodigies heard this and could not help but feel gloomy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a calm voice suddenly sounded: "Why so sad? I thought you were going to have a feast?</p><p></p><p>I almost brought the sound system over to play music for you! If you don't like the sound system and prefer natural sounds, I'll bring my divine baby music ensemble."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, the Yang Divinities and Heavenly Prodigies in the audience were shaken in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor also looked at the Blood Robe, squeezing out a trace of desolate smile: "You, still as chatty as ever, can't even have peace before death."</p><p></p><p>"Death? What death?" Qi Yuan looked at the Purple Origin Ancestor with a puzzled expression, "You're fine, how could you die? With me protecting you, how could you possibly die!"</p><p></p><p>These words made the Purple Origin Ancestor pause.</p><p></p><p>Then he sighed: "This Demonic Tribulation, I'm afraid I can't continue."</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribulation, the Rinai Molting, were the two great tribulations of the cultivators in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Small problem, I have medical skills, I can cure you." Qi Yuan said lazily, unlike the others' anxious sadness, he seemed very calm, "This is... because of kidney deficiency, so you can't withstand the Demonic Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the originally sorrowful crowd had much of their grief dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor glared at Qi Yuan: "You, don't you even leave a little face for me to die?</p><p></p><p>I have a thousand strong kidneys, I'm very strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you have to serve your age, if your kidneys don't work, they just don't work." Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>He naturally had no medical skills.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was treating someone, just saying their kidneys don't work would do.</p><p></p><p>"Come, I'll enter your Demonic Tribulation and help you treat your kidneys."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, heading towards the Purple Origin Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor's eyes revealed a trace of relief: "Child, my Demonic Tribulation cannot be helped by anyone."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he said solemnly: "Before you have consolidated the Great Principle Moment, do not go to the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Sun is unknown where you tricked him to, the star realm's Great Sun is still there, still able to display its terrifying power."</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Tribulation is nothing, I've even seen the Demonic Sea.</p><p></p><p>Old man, open your eyes wide and see how I'm going to protect you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not waste any more words, and under the gaze of the Yang Divinities and Heavenly Prodigies, he abruptly plunged into the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Senior Brother!"</p><p>"Blood Robe!"</p><p>"He actually entered the Demonic Tribulation!"</p><p>"Seeking death, isn't he?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor was also stunned, not expecting Qi Yuan to be so decisive in entering the Demonic Tribulation without any preparation.</p><p></p><p>"Child, quickly come out, the Demonic Tribulation is not a child's play, this involves..."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor spoke, pausing his words, and his eyes truly widened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Demonic Tribulation, countless colors and lines intertwined.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was like a ball of fluff.</p><p></p><p>The lines that stretched out from the fluff, like tentacles, were wrapped with an aura of evil, greed, and killing, constantly devouring the Purple Origin Ancestor's body and divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribulation, strangers should not enter.</p><p></p><p>Once entered, one would also be subjected to the erosion of the Demonic Qi, and then go mad.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan stepped into the Demonic Tribulation, and those terrifying Demonic Qi, at this moment, no longer had the ferocious posture as before.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, they seemed as docile as soft yarn, and did not even bother to trouble Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This scene truly shocked the Purple Origin Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Child, how did you do this, are these Demonic Qi... your relatives?"</p><p></p><p>He was particularly puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe was clearly the source of the bloodline of the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline of the Black Abyss had nothing to do with the Demonic Qi at all.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have endured the torment of the Demonic Tribulation?</p><p></p><p>"They are not my relatives, it's just... they look a bit like my original divine technique." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sovereign Heart Demon was suddenly activated.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the aura around Qi Yuan also became demonic.</p><p></p><p>Greed, lust, gluttony... various negative auras.</p><p></p><p>This was so similar to the aura on the Palace Emissary outside the Heavenly Chasm before.</p><p></p><p>But now, in the Demonic Tribulation, the Purple Origin Ancestor suddenly found that this aura... seemed to have some resemblance to the Demonic Qi as well.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the original divine technique?" The Purple Origin Ancestor heard this, somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>This was such an obscure term.</p><p></p><p>The original divine technique of the Qi Mansion cultivators? "Give me... devour!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored long sword swung.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Primal Body that Qi Yuan obtained from the Hungry Saint Mother also came into play at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a blood-red maw suddenly grew on the blood-colored long sword.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red maw, ominous and sinister, terrifyingly horrifying, was now... rapidly devouring the Demonic Qi.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Demonic Qi, faced with this blood-red maw, did not even have the intention to dodge, but rather... seemed to be willing to be swallowed.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Demonic Tribulation, the dense Demonic Qi, under this sword, no, under this blood-red maw, was quickly devoured like rice noodles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Purple Origin Ancestor dared not believe his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>But the disappearance of the Demonic Qi was real.</p><p></p><p>His aura was also constantly improving.</p><p></p><p>The original withered and dilapidated state had also recovered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his expression shocked: "Now you say... you are the father of the Daoist Intention, I would believe it!"</p><p></p><p>The things happening to the Blood Robe, not a single one was normal.</p><p></p><p>As a Great Principle, he had experienced countless years, what strange things had he not seen? But Qi Yuan's strangeness, he had truly never seen before.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Demonic Qi had been eliminated, Qi Yuan sheathed his sword, the blood-red sword becoming even more demonic, and there were even more lines on it, just like the Demonic Qi.</p><p></p><p>"See, my medical skills are superb, I've cured your kidney deficiency!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said proudly, and the blood-colored long sword also merged into his body at this moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 232</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi kept looking ahead, wanting to see the man's appearance.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, she couldn't see him.</p><p></p><p>She stopped looking and shifted her gaze to the charred fish meat.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the scalding heat, she grabbed it with her hands and ate the fish meat greedily, savoring it like a delicacy.</p><p></p><p>As a primordial being, she rejected all the filth of the world. Even specially made nutrient solutions were difficult for her to swallow.</p><p></p><p>Yet the fish before her was like the most delicious food in the world.</p><p></p><p>It was a taste she had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>"Do you... want some?" Wu Shi paused, holding out the half-eaten fish in her hand towards where the man was.</p><p></p><p>Then, she heard the man's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Across time and space, I can't touch anything, how could I eat fish?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was a bit confused by the thoughts she heard.</p><p></p><p>However, she also believed in her heart that the man before her had come from the future.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not hungry, I won't eat. You eat more," the man said.</p><p></p><p>He naturally hoped the No Food Holy Mother would eat more and grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still needed to go to the Celestial Pillar to practice visualization techniques.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi felt a bit disappointed. The first time she ate something so delicious, she had to eat alone.</p><p></p><p>"I said earlier, you give me a fish, I'll grant you a wish. What do you want?" Wu Shi looked up.</p><p></p><p>She didn't like owing others.</p><p></p><p>So even when her parents sold her off like merchandise, she never harbored any resentment in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"A wish?" The man looked at the No Food Holy Mother with a hint of surprise in his eyes. "Do you see that mountain that reaches into the clouds?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi turned her head and seemed to see a celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Celestial Pillar. Help me keep an eye on it, don't let it collapse," the man said casually.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, after saying this, he had a sense of destiny.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi seemed a bit dazed, but nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>The man smiled: "Go pick up some more fish, don't starve to death."</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was stunned for a moment, then her eyes lit up: "I can eat them all?"</p><p></p><p>"If I leave and you starve to death early, that wouldn't be interesting," the man said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the No Food Holy Mother's appearance, if she hadn't met him, she really would have starved to death.</p><p></p><p>Then in the future... what would happen with the Celestial Pillar? Moreover, he was originally very kind and law-abiding.</p><p></p><p>Seeing such a situation, casually showing some kindness would have no impact.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he and the No Food Holy Mother had met before, this being their third and final meeting.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the man's words, Wu Shi looked very excited. She sat on a wooden stick, flying back and forth here, picking up fish from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Soon, like a hamster with a hoarding habit, she had collected a large pile of fish.</p><p></p><p>The man looked at all these fish with a pained expression: "You really don't hold back."</p><p></p><p>However, he always kept his word. What he had promised, he would do even with tears in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>So he stepped forward, his flawless glassy blood dripping.</p><p></p><p>His face gradually turned pale, and his form became somewhat weak, though not significantly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi couldn't see the man's appearance. She looked at all the fish with delight.</p><p></p><p>"I will help you keep the Celestial Pillar safe," Wu Shi said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The man thought of something and then said: "Do you have any cultivation techniques now?"</p><p></p><p>The little girl before him was still too weak, and might perish at any time.</p><p></p><p>"No," Wu Shi hesitated, "If I cultivate, I won't be worth anything."</p><p></p><p>"How can you not cultivate? You need to learn to protect yourself," the man said this way.</p><p></p><p>Protecting the No Food Holy Mother was also protecting the Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>"I'll teach you to cultivate," the man thought, "First cook the fish, wait for me for a day, I'll create a 'Wu Shi Scripture' for you!"</p><p></p><p>The visualization technique was special, and he, formed from the Celestial Pillar, couldn't show it to Wu Shi.</p><p></p><p>So he could only create his own technique.</p><p></p><p>The man looked at the little Wu Shi and couldn't help but think:</p><p></p><p>If the No Food Holy Mother cultivated the "Wu Shi Scripture" and became powerful enough to destroy the evil gods, wouldn't that mean...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he came to this world, would he just need to lie flat and cling to someone powerful?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Wu Shi with anticipation. He turned around and began seriously writing the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Creating the "Wu Shi Scripture" was naturally not as complex as the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Wu Shi watched the silent man as she happily started roasting all the fish.</p><p></p><p>"So hungry."</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the firelight reflected on Wu Shi's face. Having just washed up simply, she was no longer disheveled, her snow-white skin delicate, appearing otherworldly like an immortal.</p><p></p><p>She stared blankly at where the man was, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"Why... is it so delicious?"</p><p></p><p>"How... did he do it?"</p><p></p><p>A seed of doubt was planted in the little girl's heart.</p><p></p><p>At daybreak, the man opened his eyes and looked towards the little girl not far away. He couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>The little girl was hugging a huge cooked fish, seemingly fast asleep.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the little girl opened her eyes. Her eyes were still a bit hazy, as if she had just woken up, but she said expectantly: "Are you ready to teach me to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in the man's eyes: "How did you know I finished writing the technique?"</p><p></p><p>A sly look flashed in the little girl's eyes: "A woman's third sense."</p><p></p><p>Of course, she wouldn't say that she had been hearing his inner thoughts all along.</p><p></p><p>His inner voice had woken her up.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, now even a woman's third sense has come out." Qi Yuan didn't pursue the matter further. "The technique I created for you is called the 'Wu Shi Scripture'. Try cultivating with it and see."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he recited the contents of the "Wu Shi Scripture" for Wu Shi to hear.</p><p></p><p>There was a lot of content. It took him a full three to four hours to finish explaining it once.</p><p></p><p>However, Wu Shi also demonstrated an ability to memorize things after seeing them once, which saved him from having to repeat himself.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the "Wu Shi Scripture", Wu Shi quickly continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Her talent was very good, even to the point of being described as exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>The man asked himself, if placed in the Cang Lan Realm, Wu Shi's talent would surpass all the geniuses on the Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Even he himself couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>A day later, the man looked at Wu Shi's thin frame and slowly said: "Since... you now barely have the ability to protect yourself, I should be going."</p><p></p><p>He really should go. He needed to enter the Mountain of Contemplation to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Then, bring back his improved subordinates and return for the final battle.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Wu Shi, he couldn't help but sigh softly.</p><p></p><p>He recalled his later meeting with the No Food Holy Mother, and also saw her blood spilling on the heavenly pillar.</p><p></p><p>She... was someone who had already died long ago, a person from the past buried in the dust of history.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi's heart tightened, her eyes seeming to show some disappointment. After a moment of silence, she slowly asked: "Will we have a chance to meet again?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the man also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The three chances to use the Lost Fluorescent Stick had all been used up, so he naturally couldn't return to the past again.</p><p></p><p>As for the No Food Holy Mother...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the No Food Holy Mother he met later, she didn't seem to recognize him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the three No Food Holy Mothers he met... were not the same person?</p><p></p><p>"If fate allows, we'll meet again."</p><p></p><p>After the man finished speaking, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>By the dilapidated pond, a pile of burnt fish lay beside the young girl.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many emotions flickered in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Her hands were tightly clenched, her nails digging into her flesh, drawing blood.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes revealed a strong look of desire: "I really want to... eat him."</p><p></p><p>This desire was a bodily instinct.</p><p></p><p>As one who could devour the original body... she felt that if she wanted to, she could fiercely bite into the void and perhaps tear off a piece of flesh.</p><p></p><p>But... she didn't dare. She was too timid.</p><p></p><p>That person was too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>He could even make food pure, so that even she could eat it.</p><p></p><p>This was...</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand why he would do this.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

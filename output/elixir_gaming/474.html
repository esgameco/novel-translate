        <h1>Chapter 474</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This earth-shaking great battle is worthy of being recorded in the annals of the Six Realms, but what a pity, you are the only audience."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>These years of fighting have been heart-pounding.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, it has been a bit of a dead end.</p><p></p><p>Some of the brilliant and magnificent moments, Qi Yuan wanted to film and make into a compilation, accompanied by the grand or somewhat tragic and solemn "Desolation" BGM, and turn it into a video reviewing the Six Realms, playing it for all the cultivators of the Six Realms every day.</p><p></p><p>It would definitely shock many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But when Stone Plate heard this, he was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>This battle... is it really that significant?</p><p></p><p>"You go back first, I need to review the situation, where I didn't perform well today, so I won't repeat the same mistakes tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand casually, and Stone Plate's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the empty building, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>"When he was cursing me indirectly, I did feel a bit embarrassed, but fortunately the black robe covered it up, so he didn't notice my abnormality."</p><p></p><p>"Like this... starting tomorrow, I'll add a BGM, to boost my courage, in the BGM, I'll be invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"Boost my courage, save this socially anxious person!"</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, the warm sunlight shone.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe was sleeping on a recliner, looking cozy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gentle breeze stirred.</p><p></p><p>From the ground, there came the rumbling sound of footsteps, as if the palace was about to be shaken.</p><p></p><p>A man with the appearance of a double-door refrigerator appeared, his eyes carrying a profound look.</p><p></p><p>He seemed like a mighty divine general descending upon the world, slaying demons and evil.</p><p></p><p>"You've come." The man in the black robe on the recliner spoke, his voice calm, the black robe obscuring his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa is here!" Dao Buer said in a muffled voice.</p><p></p><p>"Your grandpa is lying here."</p><p></p><p>The voice was very calm, and when Dao Buer heard it, it was as if thunder had resounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Thunder God in the Nine Heavens was roaring.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was in turmoil, and a trace of doubt flashed across his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this man in the black robe is truly my grandfather? Otherwise, how could he be immune to my holy light words?"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as this thought arose, he immediately extinguished it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm older than you, so I'm your grandfather!" Dao Buer said lightly, his expression smug.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had already gained the upper hand in his confrontation with the mysterious man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>"This... is this the reason you don't take a bath?" Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>With a casual slap, sixty-seven ghostly figures entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>These ghostly figures were holding small red flowers and various musical instruments, with exaggerated makeup on their faces, red and white, quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"BGM, start!" Qi Yuan snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, these sixty-seven ghostly figures began to dance the shaoling dance, and at the same time, they let out cheerful voices.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Buer doesn't take a bath!"</p><p>"Dao Buer doesn't take a bath!"</p><p></p><p>The cheerful voices, the graceful dance, accompanied by the lively sound of gongs and drums, created a very magical scene.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer's expression changed slightly, feeling embarrassed, but he then coldly said, "Now you can only use such methods? It seems... you've made up your mind about this grandson!"</p><p></p><p>"Dao Buer doesn't take a bath," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>"Is this all you can do? Dare you not to fight me head-on?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you take a bath last night?"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and soon half a month had flowed by.</p><p></p><p>Around the palace, or even within a radius of several hundred miles, there were few cultivators who came.</p><p></p><p>Only the ghostly army remained, still loyal and devoted, practicing their drills every day, forging a solid force.</p><p></p><p>Stone Plate stayed in his cave dwelling, looking at the messages in the jade slip, his eyes flashing with a cold color: "Aqin, if you keep saying this, we won't even be able to be friends. Everything I have is bestowed by the elder, how could I betray him?"</p><p></p><p>The one he was communicating with was a female cultivator he knew, who had a cute appearance, as well as the ancestral grandmother of an yin deity.</p><p></p><p>That female cultivator had a secret affection for him, and now she was persuading him to flee.</p><p></p><p>How could he betray Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Everything he had was given by the elder.</p><p></p><p>What else did Aqin's... emotional value have for him? Stone Plate said, putting the jade slip back into his storage bag, no longer paying attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"If the Holy Light Sect comes... how should the elder deal with them?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Stone Plate was also secretly worried for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, all cultivators say that the Holy Light Sect is powerful, and the Sect Master is unmatched, impossible to defeat.</p><p></p><p>Even Stone Plate, after hearing so much, also felt a sense of dread in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In a distant place, cultivators gathered, their expressions anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight is the Purest Yin Ghost Night, according to... the usual practice, the Holy Light Sect Master must appear.</p><p>That... Celestial Lord is in danger."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that Celestial Lord has been a bit too self-destructive, that's the Holy Light Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Liu Xi, fortunately you didn't do anything for him, otherwise, you might also have a hard time escaping death!"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Liu Xi was drinking some wine, his thoughts complex, not responding.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Celestial Lord... seems to have suffered a serious injury, injured his divine soul, and has a problem with his brain. It is said that in recent years, he has been cursing with a wandering cultivator every day."</p><p></p><p>"If his brain wasn't problematic, why would he still remain here?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Xi couldn't help but say, "No matter what, if it weren't for that elder, we would still need to hide in the wind caves during the Yin Ghost Night, which would be quite inconvenient. That elder has done us a favor, so it's best not to slander him."</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators heard this and shrugged their shoulders, no longer mentioning Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that every Purest Yin Ghost Night, there will be an appearance of an ancient departed spirit, ruling the world. This time, I wonder if we will have the opportunity to see the figure of that ancient great being!"</p><p></p><p>A great venerable spoke, his eyes filled with deep curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Originally, on Yin Ghost Nights, there were yin ghosts patrolling the sky, and they did not dare to go out.</p><p></p><p>Now, the entire yin ghost army has been detained by that Celestial Lord, so even on Yin Ghost Night, they dare to go out.</p><p></p><p>On the Purest Yin Ghost Night, that ancient departed spirit would not indiscriminately attack cultivators like the yin ghost army.</p><p></p><p>So they said, they were safe.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what realm of existence that ancient departed spirit is, can it compare to the Great Dao Realm?" a cultivator said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao, in their understanding, already belonged to the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"This heaven and earth are so strange, the ancient civilization should have been brilliant, what a pity."</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Six Realms, after countless years, will also be like this?"</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, we may not even be as good as the small soldiers in the yin ghost army!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi drank his wine, listening to the sighs of the crowd, also feeling a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The night slowly descended.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators gathered together, and no one went to the wind caves.</p><p></p><p>Tonight's night was unusually quiet, and the wind blew, it was eerie and strange.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, suddenly, a mournful and grand bugle call sounded.</p><p></p><p>As if in that moment, all the cultivators felt as if they were on an ancient battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Broken, desolate, raging fires, blood...</p><p></p><p>Flashing blades, shattered flying ships, the inverted vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Countless flickering images, countless howls.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed steel flowing and colliding.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Turning into a dead silence!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the ultimate romance of men.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing, yet I feel... endless sorrow."</p><p></p><p>"This great battle must have been extremely cruel, right?"</p><p></p><p>"After the battle line, there was not a single hero left!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was being emotionally overwhelmed, suddenly, the heavens and earth turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>A broken, faint shadow abruptly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient departed spirit has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"Look!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd focused their eyes, but they really couldn't see that shadow clearly, or rather... what they saw was only a tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>The body was already shattered, but the robe still fought! The robe was stained with blood, not knowing if it was the enemy's or the robe owner's.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast voice suddenly came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Your origin, return to your origin!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, the crowd looked up at the sky, and only saw a bright holy light in the blood-red sky.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present immediately held their breath.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Holy Light Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>The entire heaven and earth was blood-red.</p><p></p><p>But everyone could see that bright holy light.</p><p></p><p>Who else could it be but the Holy Light Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>These cultivators shivered in fear.</p><p></p><p>But it was also just a deep reverence from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, that kind of powerful being saw them as mere insects, not caring about them at all.</p><p></p><p>Outside the palace, Stone Plate heard this voice and widened his eyes: "This voice... how familiar it is!"</p><p></p><p>This Holy Light Sect Master's voice was exactly the same as the one who came to curse at the elder every day.</p><p></p><p>A coincidence? Or... Stone Plate had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Dao Buer stood in the sky, looking at that tattered robe, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he is immune to my holy light words!"</p><p></p><p>His sole purpose in coming here was that tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>So, he had resorted to various means to control the army of yin ghosts, hoping to achieve his goal through them.</p><p></p><p>However, the army of yin ghosts was never under his control.</p><p></p><p>This tattered robe, he could not control it either.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that to seize the opportunities here, I need to..." Dao Buer's gaze was deep and profound.</p><p></p><p>He needs to control that mysterious black-robed figure.</p><p></p><p>Although that mysterious black-robed figure is difficult to deal with, it is still much easier to subdue compared to the tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he has not given up yet, and he is still roaring at the tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>"You and I are of the same origin, return quickly!"</p><p></p><p>This voice was like a demonic sound, which all the cultivators in the Qiandi Realm could hear.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators like Liu Xi watched this scene, their hearts filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"If they were outside the Qiandi Realm, they could even swallow the entire Qiandi Realm in one gulp!"</p><p></p><p>"This holy light word, perhaps no one within the Six Realms can be immune to it, except the Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, since this Holy Light Sect has appeared, that great man's fate will be tragic!"</p><p></p><p>The discussions and whispers continued.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a slightly lazy voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder why you didn't come to scold me today, turns out you were conserving your energy to deal with this big guy!"</p><p></p><p>A man in a black robe appeared, his entire body shrouded in darkness, making his face indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present heard this and their expressions changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... that Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"How dare he, this is the Holy Light Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The holy light word, even the Great Dao cannot be immune to it, he..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, scolding... could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the cultivators thought of something, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators, upon hearing this, also had their expressions change.</p><p></p><p>There had always been rumors that the Venerable had a poor mind and had been scolding a mysterious cultivator for several years.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the mysterious cultivator was the Sect Master of the Holy Light Sect?</p><p></p><p>They thought about this, and their hearts were filled with shock waves, some even feeling like fools.</p><p></p><p>However, they were more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The holy light word is unparalleled, so how could the Venerable be immune to it? At this moment, Dao Buer looked at Qi Yuan, and a murderous intent surged in his eyes: "Indeed, your act of weakness towards me these days was just an act!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer looked at Qi Yuan, and Qi Yuan's appearance no longer showed any signs of being affected by his holy light word.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you've discovered it." Qi Yuan admitted straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>Because Dao Buer's electricity had almost been fully charged, so... his acting had also become more and more careless.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer's expression did not change: "I'll give you a chance, help me control this tattered robe of the dead, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>Even without the holy light word, Dao Buer's combat power was still terrifying, and he was confident that he could kill Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan had been to the Six Realms, and his future path was already cut off.</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the confidence to spare my life? I'm afraid your brain has gone bad from not washing yourself every day?" Qi Yuan said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Under the Great Dao, I am invincible. You have no Great Dao imprint on you, and it's just the Dao, not the Great Dao... What can you use to fight me?" Dao Buer said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>These years of scolding with Qi Yuan, he had always been paying attention to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The other party's use of abilities similar to the holy light word, it would be difficult to hide the aura at this time, but the other party did not reveal the aura of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>The other party should be at the Dao level like him, with a good ancestor, otherwise, upon entering the Qiandi Realm, they should have fallen to the Great Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Since he is at the Dao level, he is not afraid.</p><p></p><p>"I'm indeed not the Great Dao." Qi Yuan did not hide it, "But don't underestimate me, as a small Purple Palace, I dare to defy the unfairness of fate!"</p><p></p><p>The weak wield their blades against the weaker.</p><p></p><p>Only the strong dare to wield their blades against the stronger.</p><p></p><p>He, with the body of the Purple Palace, challenges the Dao, which can be considered a true hero!</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer's brows furrowed slightly: "Is it still interesting to pretend in front of me now? I've long seen through that you're just an ordinary Dao cultivator."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have the victory in his grasp, full of self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very interested in your bloodline, since I can't get you, I'll just destroy you!" Dao Buer's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted most was to gradually control Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And then through Qi Yuan, control the army of yin ghosts.</p><p></p><p>But the holy light word was ineffective.</p><p></p><p>He also dared not delay any longer, lest Qi Yuan step into the Great Dao in a few hundred million years, and he would be done for.</p><p></p><p>As for the tattered robe of the dead, he would think of other ways, at most wasting a few hundred million years, there would still be opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"To not get something and then destroy it, your character is too dangerous. No wonder that tattered robe of the dead doesn't listen to you at all. When dealing with them, you need to treat them sincerely." Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>As he interacted with Dao Buer, Dao Buer, this charging treasure, had already exhausted all his electricity for Qi Yuan, and it was time to win the physical battle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, waving his hand towards the tattered robe of the dead: "Old dead person, do you want to come to my house for dinner? Your brothers and sisters are all at my house!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer's gaze turned to the tattered robe of the dead, and a look of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because, under his holy light word, the tattered robe of the dead was unmoved, as if it had not heard anything.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's words made the tattered robe of the dead pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>So, if given enough time, Qi Yuan could indeed influence and control that tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>A look of regret flashed in Dao Buer's eyes: "Disobedient dog, it's better to just kill it!"</p><p></p><p>"Are we going to start fighting now?" Qi Yuan asked Dao Buer casually.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer did not respond, only looking coldly at Qi Yuan with his small head.</p><p></p><p>"Before we start fighting, I have to make it clear that I'm not attacking you out of sore loser because I couldn't win our scolding matches these past few years!</p><p></p><p>It's because your quality is too low, and you often kill people recklessly, so I have to represent justice to judge you!" Qi Yuan felt the need to explain.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the cultivators in the Qiandi Realm would not know that he was not a short-tempered person who started fighting after losing in scolding.</p><p></p><p>This would damage his majestic and towering image.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Liu Xi blinked his eyes and secretly transmitted a message: "Are you sure these two Venerables are really Venerables? Their behavior is..."</p><p></p><p>He dared not say the harsh words.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who heard the transmission also nodded, very much in agreement.</p><p></p><p>These two Celestial Venerables are a bit eccentric.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual techniques are useless, why say so much?" Dao Buer said coldly, "Die!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he did not use the holy light word again, but attacked directly.</p><p></p><p>The world believed that the greatest reliance of the Holy Light Sect was the holy light word.</p><p></p><p>But Dao Buer was different.</p><p></p><p>He was called Dao Buer, and he was one of the top ten geniuses in the Holy Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>His combat power was particularly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Although he was at the Dao level, relying on his combat power alone, he could even clash head-on with the Great Dao Venerable for a while before fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are not the Great Dao, today you have only one path - death!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer let out a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura swept across.</p><p></p><p>In the Qiandi Realm, countless auras were in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators who saw this, their previous contempt turned into shock.</p><p></p><p>Because, at this moment, the spiritual energy in this Qiandi Realm was suddenly drained.</p><p></p><p>Even their own spiritual energy within their bodies was depleted, making them feel like ordinary mortals.</p><p></p><p>The strike of the Celestial Venerable was so terrifying, who could withstand it?</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, a slight change appeared on Dao Buer's face.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the black-robed man move: "So what if I'm not the Great Dao? I'm the Purple Palace, can you bully me? Don't you know the value of the No. 1 Purple Palace in the Six Realms?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the black robe on his body suddenly fell apart.</p><p></p><p>A man in a blood-red armor suddenly appeared, holding a blood-colored long sword, his aura deep and unfathomable like the sea, making it difficult for others to fathom.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with a charging treasure like you without any electricity, I only need one sword!"</p><p></p><p>One sword struck out!</p><p></p><p>The wind and clouds did not move!</p><p></p><p>Even the heavens and earth did not undergo any changes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's sword strike was plain and simple, just like an ordinary general in the mundane world thrusting his sword.</p><p></p><p>But this one sword, Dao Buer could not resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Because standing before him was the terrifying warrior who had reached the 13th layer of the "Ancestral Blood Technique", whose Myriad Dao Warrior Realm was comparable to the Great Dao Venerable, and was in a state of fusion with the Small Bride - the fearsome Qi Yuan of the No. 1 Purple Palace in the Six Realms!</p><p></p><p>The more prefixes, the stronger Qi Yuan became.</p><p></p><p>"Now, to kill you... it's an instant kill!" </p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a sword without any technique descended.</p><p></p><p>Dao Buer's body shattered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the disbelief on Dao Buer's face, but he still had one more thing to say.</p><p></p><p>"Child, you appear in front of me every day, did you really think I couldn't see your weakness?"</p><p></p><p>He had been looking at the Myriad Ghost Banners every day, and he had even seen through the loopholes of the Myriad Ghost Banners.</p><p></p><p>This Dao Buer had been coming to scold him every day, and Qi Yuan even knew the color of Dao Buer's underwear.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, the Dao is extinguished!</p><p></p><p>This was the power of Qi Yuan's mighty sword!

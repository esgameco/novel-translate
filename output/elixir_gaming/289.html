        <h1>Chapter 289</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wuqi followed the elegantly dressed crowd, straightening her back and walking in high heels, with a self-satisfied expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, her phone had also been confiscated.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, attending such a private gathering with some nobles, taking a photo to share with her circle of friends, showing off and hearing some flattery, would surely be very satisfying?</p><p></p><p>The doors to the reception hall opened. Kuanghuan, with his arm around Erbin's waist, said softly:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, to celebrate the completion of our deal, I've specially organized a small banquet for you."</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, Kuanghuan resumed his polite and modest demeanor, completely different from how he was outside.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wuqi quickly scanned the layout of the reception hall. </p><p></p><p>When she saw the various guns and weapons on the gold-threaded pure wood table, her eyes suddenly narrowed. After all, for celebrities like them, they rarely came into contact with such real weapons.</p><p></p><p>Following Kuanghuan's voice, she also looked towards the back of the reception hall.</p><p></p><p>There she saw a person sitting there, seemingly fishing.</p><p></p><p>Wuqi's eyes suddenly focused, because she felt that back view looked somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young man turned his head, revealing a bright and handsome face.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that face, Wuqi's heart skipped a beat involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Because that person... was none other than her junior schoolmate, Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>She doubted if she had seen wrong, or if the two people just looked very similar. But with such a high-value face, how could she have mistaken it?</p><p></p><p>But then thinking that the junior schoolmate she had once somewhat "looked down upon" had suddenly become a big shot who could toy with her at will.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable sense of shame and anger spread, making Wuqi's pretty face feel a bit hot.</p><p></p><p>Then a strange sense of excitement spread, making Wuqi's heart feel like it was on a roller coaster.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a smile appeared on Kuanghuan's face: "I wonder if you're satisfied with these...?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was now looking seriously at Kuanghuan, with a somewhat awkward expression: "You're throwing a party... and you invited me?"</p><p></p><p>The normal process should be, damn it, throwing a party and not inviting me? Now that he was invited, he didn't know how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's reaction, Kuanghuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was just afraid that Qi Yuan would be indifferent to everything.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Qi Yuan's previous response, he clearly approved of him.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan then introduced to Qi Yuan: "These few are all quite good celebrities.</p><p></p><p>This one..." </p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan pointed to Wuqi.</p><p></p><p>"She's from Tianyue City, and can be considered a high school classmate of yours, Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>He had specifically called Wuqi over because Wuqi and Qi Yuan might have had interactions in the past, being old classmates.</p><p></p><p>Such an identity could stimulate one's senses even more.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, a female star of Wuqi's level would not have qualified to attend their private gathering.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what a coincidence?" Qi Yuan glanced at Wuqi, memories from the innate seed in his mind flooding back, "I remember now, the senior who ate three sweet potatoes in one meal, you've actually become a celebrity?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's memory was very good. As long as he recalled, past memories would reappear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wuqi's face blushed. Looking at Qi Yuan, she boldly said: "Junior still remembers his senior."</p><p></p><p>To be remembered by a big shot like Qi Yuan, even though what he remembered was her eating three sweet potatoes that one time, it already made Wuqi very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"My memory has always been good, photographic even." Qi Yuan looked at Kuanghuan and said softly, "Did you bring the goods?"</p><p></p><p>The goods were naturally some unique cultivation materials from the Yuelang country.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan nodded: "Because time was tight, in order to get this batch of goods, I asked General Mu for help, and only managed to gather them before coming back."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wuqi immediately felt that Qi Yuan was even more unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't expected that the ordinary, just very handsome junior schoolmate actually had such an identity and background.</p><p></p><p>Wuqi stretched her neck, wanting to see what precious things these goods that required a general's help to collect were.</p><p></p><p>Those black-clothed mercenaries opened these boxes, and immediately, a pile of various strange plants appeared.</p><p></p><p>All these plants were enclosed in sealed bags. Through the transparent sealed bags, a strange look appeared in Wuqi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because some of these things, Wuqi could recognize, were just... ordinary weeds.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this much is enough to use for a while." Qi Yuan looked at the wooden boxes with a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>A humble smile appeared on Kuanghuan's face: "As long as Mr. Qi is satisfied."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we cooperate? You help me collect some materials, and I... will pay you a certain amount of money, or... I'll give you some finished products, but giving finished products will depend on my mood." Qi Yuan now looked back at the sea, seemingly still focused on fishing, with his back to everyone.</p><p></p><p>But his voice transmitted very clearly to everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>These female celebrities didn't notice anything unusual, but Kuanghuan did.</p><p></p><p>His evaluation of Qi Yuan went up another level in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I want finished products!"</p><p></p><p>Did he even need to think about it!</p><p></p><p>Money, Kuanghuan didn't lack.</p><p></p><p>As for finished products, according to his guess, they must be things similar to immortal pills.</p><p></p><p>The women around looked curiously at Kuanghuan's somewhat excited expression.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what this transaction was all about, or what it represented.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, move these things to my house.</p><p></p><p>I'll send you information about other materials I need. If you don't have enough money, or encounter any dangers, come find me."</p><p></p><p>The materials Qi Yuan needed were numerous and varied.</p><p></p><p>Some were very niche, rare and uncommon.</p><p></p><p>Collecting them would require a lot of manpower and resources.</p><p></p><p>Some things couldn't even be bought in markets.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan thought about cooperating with someone with some power like Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was delighted inside, and said in a deep voice: "It's my honor to be able to work for Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>After all, if the cultivation method was real, Mr. Qi must be a legendary immortal.</p><p></p><p>Being able to work for an immortal was his honor.</p><p></p><p>"You few, go over and accompany Mr. Qi!" Kuanghuan quickly signaled to the female celebrities with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wuqi and the others immediately walked gracefully towards Qi Yuan, especially Wuqi, whose exaggerated posture seemed to want to display all her frontal charms.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>On the Starfish Gorge, soft voices of conversation arose at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know? Viscount Kuanghuan actually reveres a scammer as an immortal, and is willing to spend huge sums to buy cultivation methods. Isn't that ridiculous?"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation? Has Kuanghuan's head gone bad from being a mercenary?"</p><p></p><p>"The funniest thing is, this seller he found was someone he encountered while scrolling through videos online.</p><p></p><p>It's said that the seller is mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>These days even the mentally ill can scam people, and there are still people who believe it. It really brings shame to us nobles."</p><p></p><p>"Now he's revering that guy as an immortal, inviting a bunch of celebrities to hold a private party. Should we go in and expose that guy's lies?"</p><p></p><p>"Is something wrong with your head? If it's fake, you expose it, but it's Kuanghuan who loses face. Apart from offending Kuanghuan, what benefit is there?"</p><p></p><p>"It's better if it's fake, you'd only offend Kuanghuan. If it's real, you'd be offending an immortal!"</p><p></p><p>These men and women laughed as they spoke, seemingly treating it as after-dinner entertainment, and soon the topic shifted.</p><p></p><p>As for going to Kuanghuan's private party to provoke and expose Qi Yuan's true identity... probably only fools or those with too much free time would do that.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only those who have experienced it would do this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the midst of the private party celebration, the anticipated chaotic scene did not occur. </p><p></p><p>Although Wuqi and others were arranged to sit next to Qi Yuan, Qi Yuan said he was a man with a marriage engagement and needed to keep himself pure.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not send these female celebrities away, but instead used them for fishing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wuqi was fishing, feeling uneasy in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She somewhat regretted only meeting Qi Yuan now. </p><p></p><p>If she had known Qi Yuan's identity in high school, with her methods, capturing a high school underclassman as an upperclassman would have been effortless.</p><p></p><p>But now facing Qi Yuan, she always felt inferior, treading carefully in her words and actions.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference in status and position.</p><p></p><p>Power, money, and strength can indeed give people confidence.</p><p></p><p>When facing stronger beings, law-abiding creatures always feel inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Don't overthink it, just focus on fishing," Qi Yuan glanced sideways at Wuqi beside him.</p><p></p><p>Wuqi hurriedly smiled awkwardly and said, "I'm watching!"</p><p></p><p>She wasn't very good at fishing, and now she was fumbling about trying to fish.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Kuanghuan lightly laughed and said, "I didn't expect Mr. Qi to uphold the ways of a gentleman."</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were one of those fraudsters, he would probably be eagerly groping by now.</p><p></p><p>But even if he's not a fraudster, immortals have some hobbies, and indulging in pleasure is normal.</p><p></p><p>"Unlike you who doesn't have a wife, my wife is a peerless beauty," Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, Qi Yuan frowned and asked, "Does Qinyuan Country have laws against bigamy?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it does," Kuanghuan answered truthfully. He seemed to understand Qi Yuan's meaning and glanced at Wuqi, "But you can keep them outside, it's not illegal or criminal, and illegitimate children also have inheritance rights."</p><p></p><p>"But how can it be considered marriage without a certificate?" Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to give each of his wives a home.</p><p></p><p>"In a while, my wife will probably come down. At that time, I plan to marry two wives at once. Can you help me get the certificates?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>When he reaches the Yuandan realm, he will be able to bring the projection of the Stellar Golden Core to this universe.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Ning Tao can also be summoned down by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan's main body has already stepped into the Divine Infant realm, with sufficient spiritual energy, he can summon Ning Tao down, and Ning Tao's projection can stay permanently without worrying about returning to the Golden Core projection.</p><p></p><p>The other wife is naturally Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>When the two appear together, they can get married at the same time, saving some money.</p><p></p><p>"This... can be done," Kuanghuan hesitated for a moment, then immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, my two wives don't have ID cards... is that a problem?" </p><p></p><p>"No problem..." Kuanghuan's expression was strange as he tentatively asked, "Where are your wives now?"</p><p></p><p>"In the sky," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Wuqi, listening to this conversation beside them, was very confused.</p><p></p><p>In the sky...? What does that mean? She recognized all the words these two important people were saying, but she didn't understand the meaning when they were strung together.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's heart suddenly jumped: "When will they come?"</p><p></p><p>"In about a few months?" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>As long as there are sufficient resources and not strict requirements for Foundation Establishment and Core Formation spirit objects, Qi Yuan only needs a few months to step into the Yuandan realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yin Spirit realm, it might take longer.</p><p></p><p>That is measured in years.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, Qi Yuan hasn't yet discovered a way to gain experience by killing monsters.</p><p></p><p>In Wangyue Continent, there were game monsters to kill for experience, and in the Mortal Heart Realm, there were new gods to kill.</p><p></p><p>This world currently has no villain bosses.</p><p></p><p>Such a world is suitable for him to honeymoon with his wives.</p><p></p><p>"When you look up at the sky and find several more suns in the sky, my wives will probably have arrived," Qi Yuan looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, apart from one sun, there were some stars dotting it.</p><p></p><p>The female celebrities present were stunned by Qi Yuan's words, then laughed.</p><p></p><p>Wuqi still boldly asked, "Will there be several more suns in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was a bit dazed at this point, Qi Yuan's words were too shocking.</p><p></p><p>Several more suns in the sky, what kind of concept is that? Probably... even the Arched Star would be gone.</p><p></p><p>Although today's technology is advanced, with powerful weapons available,</p><p></p><p>Facing a sun, even the nations on the Brilliant Star would have no way to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to notice Kuanghuan's concern, Qi Yuan smiled lightly and said, "It's just a sun projection, it won't affect the ecology of the Arched Star, just think of it as several more paintings in the sky."</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's heart was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was more frightening than if Qi Yuan were a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had obtained some fortuitous encounter and gained a cultivation method, he could understand that.</p><p></p><p>But now even the sun is involved... this is beyond a cultivator, right?</p><p></p><p>"Haha..." Kuanghuan laughed, treating Qi Yuan's words as a joke.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were such an existence, how could he be fishing with him? And still trading? This doesn't make sense.</p><p></p><p>"When your wives descend, I will personally go to the civil affairs bureau to process your marriage certificates!" Kuanghuan patted his chest in guarantee.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's just a few months, you won't have to wait long," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was quite looking forward to Ning Tao's descent.</p><p></p><p>In the Liufeng Realm, Ning Tao had worn black stockings, but never white ones, which was truly regrettable.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan smiled, it's just a few months, we'll know then if it's a joke or not.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Wuqi's face lit up with joy, she stood up excitedly saying, "I caught a fish!"</p><p></p><p>Wuqi fumbled with the fishing rod, but due to her poor technique, she struggled for a while unable to bring the fish up.</p><p></p><p>With the help of a female celebrity beside her, she finally managed to reel in the fish and put it in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's eyes showed approval: "Not bad, this is a golden-edged fish, worth two thousand yuan, not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>Wuqi was delighted, she especially looked at Qi Yuan, like a kitten seeking praise.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan didn't look at her at all, but instead looked at the fish: "What a pity, it's not the little cutie."</p><p></p><p>"Little cutie?" Wuqi was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The fish she caught was white with a golden sheen, how was it not cute?</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was stunned for a moment, then said, "Does Mr. Qi have a target?"</p><p></p><p>He guessed that there might be cultivation materials Qi Yuan needed among the sea fish.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, there's a little cutie, but I don't know what it's called.</p><p></p><p>Never mind, if we fish a bit longer, we'll eventually catch it," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Earlier when he was fishing here, he had seen that little cutie.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had noticed something unique about that little cutie.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan's current strength was too weak, and he was burdened with a curse. Jumping into the sea mouth for just one little cutie would be too costly.</p><p></p><p>So, he borrowed these female celebrities to help him fish.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a rare cute sea fish?" Kuanghuan pondered, "I'll try too, let's see who can catch it today."</p><p></p><p>"A fish cuter than the golden-edged one?" The other female celebrities were also eager to try.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

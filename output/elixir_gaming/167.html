        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the six fallen Yin Gods before them, feeling as if they were still in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Six Yin Gods, without any ability to resist, were easily slaughtered. </p><p></p><p>That kind of overwhelming suppressive force, the ability that made the Yin Gods unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>Aside from a Divine Realm, the woman in white felt there was no other explanation.</p><p></p><p>Only a Great Venerable could deploy a Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>How did the Blood-Robed Sword God suddenly become a Great Venerable? The woman in white was very confused.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord revealed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen found it unsurprising. </p><p></p><p>What was this compared to? Back then, the falling sun had caused him a truly shocking impact.</p><p></p><p>"Daddy is so amazing." Qi Jianjun clenched her little pink fists, very proud, without a trace of the arrogance of a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>The people in the suona band behind them had fanatical gazes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, and seven or eight storage bags immediately fell into his grasp.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept into the storage bags, and his eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The stolen goods have been confiscated."</p><p></p><p>He was very happy.</p><p></p><p>This is what you call a windfall!</p><p></p><p>These storage bags contained six Heavenly-grade secret techniques. Most importantly, two of them were mid-grade Heavenly techniques - one was worth ten low-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing as you've been so sensible, I specially approve and allow you to settle down in the Wangyue Continent and become part of it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at those few Yin God corpses.</p><p></p><p>Under his gaze, the corpses turned into something like fertilizer, merging into the dust.</p><p></p><p>"'Yin Gods' are not unfeeling things, turning to spring soil to better nurture flowers." Qi Yuan couldn't help but recite a poem.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods were truly good people.</p><p></p><p>Originally the Wangyue Continent was in tatters, unable to produce even a single Purple Palace cultivator besides the High Priest.</p><p></p><p>Now, with this added fertilizer, it was a good thing for the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white watched this scene, speechless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan closed his eyes. Everyone looked at him, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>After a breath passed, he opened his eyes again: "There are still 13 million Moluo troops that haven't been dealt with."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman in white hurriedly said: "I will personally lead people to deal with the remaining Moluo army."</p><p></p><p>The power of the Wangyue Continent was unable to cope with the Moluo army.</p><p></p><p>Only she, as a Yin God, running around and killing everywhere, could completely eliminate the tens of millions of Moluo.</p><p></p><p>"Why go to such trouble?" Qi Yuan smiled lightly. "Since they dared to come to my home, let them all stay as flower fertilizer."</p><p></p><p>The woman in white heard this and was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God was strong, with Great Venerable strength, but to kill these Moluo troops without harming the Wangyue Continent would certainly be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Unless he used brute force to kill.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan rose into the air again, his blood-colored robe rustling in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The light of the sun and moon froze at this moment, concentrating on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>A vast voice rang out in this instant.</p><p></p><p>"All living beings on earth, all things in the world, are under my control."</p><p></p><p>The ancient Qichui wood trembled, snowflakes danced wildly.</p><p></p><p>Rivers flowed backwards, deserts surged.</p><p></p><p>All living beings on the Wangyue Continent involuntarily looked towards Qi Yuan's direction at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Whether human, animal, or monster, their eyes were fanatical, their expressions reverent.</p><p></p><p>The vast voice spread throughout the entire Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>All the Moluo troops looked up at the sky, their faces bewildered.</p><p></p><p>In the Canglang Realm's stronghold on the Wangyue Continent, the Heavenly Foundation cultivator Gu Xiaoyao looked up, his eyes confused: "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Those Divine Embryo cultivators also had puzzled faces, not knowing at all what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Blood-Robed Sword God's voice!" A genius gritted his teeth and said, his voice trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what was about to happen, but they could sense that something terrifying was definitely going to occur.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the woman in white widened her eyes. She looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>She clearly saw that the world's origin was trembling, becoming active.</p><p></p><p>How could the Blood-Robed Sword God make even the world's origin boil? This was something even a Great Venerable couldn't do.</p><p></p><p>The vast voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"With my words, condense the laws of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder God and Lightning Mother, the Five Sacred Mountains, the creation of heaven and earth, all heed my command!"</p><p></p><p>"Exterminate the Moluo!"</p><p></p><p>As the vast voice rang out, the entire Wangyue Continent instantly transformed into a divine prison.</p><p></p><p>The entire sky darkened, the sun and moon lost their light, and all the stars were obscured by black clouds.</p><p></p><p>Among the black clouds, thunder rolled, as if a terrifying giant beast was roaring, ferocious deities howling.</p><p></p><p>In the clouds, two primordial deities appeared out of thin air, formed from the will of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Thunder God obeys!"</p><p></p><p>"The Lightning Mother obeys!"</p><p></p><p>From the mountains and Five Sacred Peaks, rumbling sounds arose, like ancient gods awakening and crying out.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Peaks obey!"</p><p></p><p>All things in heaven and earth, all created beings, at this moment received the decree of the Heavenly Dao and were all activated.</p><p></p><p>"The Wei River obeys!"</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanyuan Forbidden Land obeys!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Extinction obeys!"</p><p></p><p>All living things seemed to have gained souls at this moment, awakening from slumber, all responding to the will of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>'Snap', a finger snap sounded, "Play music!"</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord's eyes flashed with a gleam, and desolate, joyous, heroic suona music rang out.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white was stunned for a moment, then hurriedly played music as well.</p><p></p><p>Only to see terrifying figures appear one by one across the entire Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>They were like primordial deities that had been sleeping since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"By decree of the Heavens, exterminate the Moluo!"</p><p></p><p>Lightning tore through the sky, and the dark world finally welcomed light.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, dense lightning pierced through space.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, that terrifying scene was a thousand times, ten thousand times more shocking than a planetary war.</p><p></p><p>Countless lightning bolts, accompanied by terrifying figures, fell among the Moluo army.</p><p></p><p>All over the world, tens of millions of Moluo troops had no idea what was happening before they were baptized by lightning and suppressed by mountains and peaks.</p><p></p><p>No matter how they resisted, no matter how they fled, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>Because they were fighting against the entire world!</p><p></p><p>How could they defeat the entire world?</p><p></p><p>"Lightning?"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavens are angry!"</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu... so many gods!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the will of the world manifesting!"</p><p></p><p>"Heaven is blind!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's all over, the Heavenly Dao of this world... has been devoured by a terrifying expert!"</p><p></p><p>"How can we oppose the power of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>In just three breaths of time, tens of millions of Moluo troops spread across the world all perished.</p><p></p><p>The world was still in turmoil, the origin rejoicing, as if boiling for their supreme lord.</p><p></p><p>"Those who trespass in my Wangyue Continent shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The voice spread to the four seas and eight wastelands, to the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>In the Canglang Realm's stronghold, those geniuses who saw the primordial deities revive and the sky full of divine lightning all turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, run!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God is not human!"</p><p></p><p>These geniuses, along with some Divine Embryo cultivators, no longer cared about any great calamity or stronghold at this moment, all fleeing back to the Canglang Realm.</p><p></p><p>What happened here was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>They simply couldn't comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>But they knew it was definitely horrifying.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the valley, Qi Yuan looked back at the people behind him: "The people have been killed, it's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes smiling like crescent moons: "Hehe, it turns out I'm Daddy's own child."</p><p></p><p>Behind her, Jiang Ya remained silent. She had only seen glimpses of the scene before her in ancient texts.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao... only the Heavenly Dao could explain this.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God... was he a powerful expert who had devoured the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent? The woman in white trembled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she completely understood.</p><p></p><p>She also understood why the Blood-Robed Sword God had asked her those questions by the lake back then.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God before her was not human at all.</p><p></p><p>But a fierce god who dared to devour the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>He was hiding in the Wangyue Continent, and the great calamity of the Canglang Realm probably didn't dare to extend here.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Meishan's face was clouded with worry.</p><p></p><p>Now in the main hall, dozens of Purple Palace cultivators had gathered, their expressions not looking very good.</p><p></p><p>This meeting was to deal with the Water Cloud Palace, to deal with the conflict between the Blood-Robed Sword God and Venerable Yiqiong.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, only two-thirds of those invited had come, with one-third of the Purple Palace cultivators not showing up. The implications were very clear.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Venerable Yunju to stop the Water Cloud Palace. We must remember this favor." Old Man Meishan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Water Cloud Palace came with great momentum. With the foundation of Yin Gods, the Water Cloud Palace was not something the newly created Blood Robe Alliance could deal with.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Yunju can stop the Water Cloud Palace for a while, but not forever. Once the outcome between Venerable Yiqiong and our Alliance Leader is decided, I'm afraid the Water Cloud Palace..." an old man said with a worried face.</p><p></p><p>They had finally found an Alliance Leader to resist the great calamity together, but unexpectedly, the Alliance Leader's fate was immediately uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"It's all my fault, I should have advised the Alliance Leader not to offend Venerable Yiqiong. This time, with Venerable Yiqiong and Venerable Youqing joining forces, the Alliance Leader's life is in grave danger." The Yunzhongting Palace Master lamented regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The feeling of self-reproach, "It's a pity we can't enter the virtual realm, and we don't know what the result is now."</p><p></p><p>"Those two old bastards, Yiqiong Elder and Youqing Elder, bullying the weak with their strength, cutting off the roots of our Cuiyun Island, it's really despicable!" An old man was so angry his nose was crooked.</p><p></p><p>"Now is not the time for self-reproach, we should think about how to deal with this calamity," said Meishan. He looked at Xu Yeli as he spoke, "Old Xu, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli raised an eyebrow: "Who wins and who loses is still unknown. I think the Blood Robe Sword God will win."</p><p></p><p>When these words were spoken, the whole hall was shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Blood Robe Sword God had been ambushed by two Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>The two Yin Gods dared to ambush, they must have made thorough preparations.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a Divine Infant cultivator rushed in in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, a Yin God is here!"</p><p></p><p>Meishan was stunned for a moment, and asked instinctively, "Which one?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Huxiao!" The Divine Infant announced the name of that Yin God.</p><p></p><p>Meishan's heart suddenly jolted, as if he had lost his parents: "Has the Elder come to kill us?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Huxiao was the father of the wife of the master of Water Cloud Palace, a big shot among Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Why did he suddenly appear if not to kill them?</p><p></p><p>However, he was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>A Yin God had come... why wasn't he taking action?</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?" They definitely couldn't run away, so Meishan asked sorrowfully.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Huxiao is waiting outside the main hall, he told me to come in and report," said the Divine Infant cultivator, who had never seen such a big shot Yin God before and was already scared out of his wits.</p><p></p><p>Meishan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Yin God was waiting outside the hall?</p><p></p><p>How could this be so absurd?</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go see what's going on!"</p><p></p><p>Meishan hurried out, and the Purple Mansion cultivators in the room quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>That was a Yin God, if they kept him waiting too long and he got angry and killed them all, what would they do? Dozens of Purple Mansion cultivators hurried towards the outside of the hall.</p><p></p><p>They immediately saw an old man with white hair but a youthful face, standing respectfully outside the main hall.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for sensing the terrifying aura on his body, they would never have dared to believe that he was actually a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to Elder Huxiao!"</p><p></p><p>A group of Purple Mansion cultivators hurried out, their expressions respectful.</p><p></p><p>They had vaguely heard that Elder Huxiao had a very bad temper.</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities, you are all fellow Daoists, I cannot accept such courtesy," Elder Huxiao said with a smile, his smile very kindly.</p><p></p><p>Meishan and the other Purple Mansion cultivators were puzzled in their hearts, not knowing what Elder Huxiao was up to, his attitude was too strange.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Elder Huxiao's face showed a pained expression: "It's the father's fault for not teaching the child, this girl Ling Jiao was arrogant and overbearing, offending the senior Blood Robe Sword God, and was killed by the senior. It was good that she was killed, it was wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he waved his hand, and two Purple Mansion cultivators fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>One was a man, and one was a woman.</p><p></p><p>Both were bound with ropes, and their bodies were covered in wounds, looking extremely miserable.</p><p></p><p>When Meishan saw the two, his pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>These two were none other than the master and mistress of Water Cloud Palace, both at the late stage of Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>They had actually been tied up by Elder Huxiao and brought here, which was really puzzling.</p><p></p><p>"I have been in seclusion for three hundred years, not asking about worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>I never expected that as soon as I came out of seclusion, I would hear that these two had colluded with Elder Yiqiong to ambush the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>I have already stripped them of their cultivation and brought them to the Blood Robe Alliance, to be dealt with as the Blood Robe Sword God sees fit!" As Elder Huxiao spoke, he lashed out at the master of Water Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying bloody mark appeared, this strike contained a soul attack that ordinary people could not withstand at all, yet the master of Water Cloud Palace was like a dead pig, unable to make any sound at all.</p><p></p><p>In front of a Yin God, the life and death of a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator was completely under control.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Meishan was silent, his heart churning, not knowing at all what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the Blood Robe Sword God had defeated Elder Yiqiong? But even so, how could an old-school elder like Elder Huxiao submit?</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the confusion, the spiritual energy in heaven and earth gathered.</p><p></p><p>All the Purple Mansion cultivators felt the spiritual energy in heaven and earth churning, as if great figures were descending.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, one terrifying figure after another appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qingmei requests an audience with senior Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Leichen requests an audience with senior Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yunju requests an audience with senior Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"So many Yin Gods... heavens, what exactly happened!" All the Purple Mansion cultivators were shocked, not knowing what had happened at all.</p><p></p><p>These elders who existed only in legends had actually gathered at the Blood Robe Alliance, requesting an audience with the Blood Robe Sword God, how could they not be shocked!...</p><p></p><p>"Shocking news, four gods descend, gathering at the Blood Robe Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, four Yin Gods gathered at the Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The specific reason is unknown, stay tuned to find out what happens next!"</p><p></p><p>"??"</p><p></p><p>"Four Yin Gods gathered at the Blood Robe Alliance, what happened, quickly tell us what happened next!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why did you stop there!"</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, if this old man finds out where you live, I'll definitely destroy you with a Dao spell!"</p><p></p><p>A single post attracted the attention of countless people.</p><p></p><p>After all, four Yin Gods gathering at the Blood Robe Alliance was definitely a major event among major events.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, Yin Gods do not show themselves, and 99% of cultivators have never seen the lofty Yin Gods in their lifetime, only having heard rumors about them.</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Flower Association forum, a post by a Divine Infant could attract countless praises.</p><p></p><p>Now, four Yin Gods gathering at the Blood Robe Alliance, how could it not spark imagination.</p><p></p><p>Especially since earlier, there had been a conflict between Water Cloud Palace and the Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was suspected that Elder Yiqiong and Elder Youqing had joined forces to attack the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there had been a turn of events? All cultivators were like ants on a hot pan, not even wanting to cultivate, constantly refreshing the posts.</p><p></p><p>In the posts, there was all kinds of information.</p><p></p><p>Some people analyzed that there was a powerful Yin God artifact in the Blood Robe Alliance, which attracted several Yin Gods to come and fight over it.</p><p></p><p>Others said they saw Elder Huxiao hanging his son-in-law, the master of Water Cloud Palace, outside the Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In short, there was all kinds of information, but all different.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Divine Flower Four Emperors group chat.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Master was extremely anxious: "Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, do you know what's going on, is Origin Venerable alright, he should be fine, right?"</p><p></p><p>After all, ever since Water Cloud Palace announced war on the Blood Robe Alliance, Rogue Immortal Master had been as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to his weak strength, he had no way to get involved in such major events.</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said in the group: "Do you remember, Origin Venerable said he had a Heavenly Dao Foundation?"</p><p></p><p>"It's normal for such a powerful person to have a Heavenly Dao Foundation, isn't it?" Rogue Immortal Master was surprised, not understanding what Ice Mountain Domineering Woman meant.</p><p></p><p>"What I mean is, Origin Venerable's Heavenly Dao Foundation is a real Heavenly Dao Foundation!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Rogue Immortal Master was confused, not understanding what this meant at all.</p><p></p><p>Isn't a Heavenly Dao Foundation just a Heavenly Dao Foundation, what else could it be? "He... swallowed the Heavenly Dao of an entire world to build his foundation!" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said quietly.</p><p></p><p>"What, he actually swallowed the old heavens?" Rogue Immortal Master was shocked, "Swallowing a Heavenly Dao, is he even human anymore!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't imagine it.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who built their foundation with heavenly veins were already beyond his reach in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Let alone swallowing an entire Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>What kind of concept was this? Well, Rogue Immortal Master had no concept.</p><p></p><p>But swallowing the Heavenly Dao of an entire realm, such a terrifying existence must be far stronger than Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable doesn't eat people, does he?" Rogue Immortal Master trembled.</p><p></p><p>If he could eat the Heavenly Dao, eating a person should be nothing, right?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ice Mountain Domineering Woman's expression was profound: "Do you remember what realm Origin Venerable said he was at?"</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Dan!" said Rogue Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Origin Venerable had pretended to be a small fry at Yuan Dan realm when meeting him face to face.</p><p></p><p>Who knew he would suddenly transform into a Purple Mansion powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>This was already terrifying enough.</p><p></p><p>Later, hearing that the Blood Robe Sword God had slaughtered the Palace of Light, Rogue Immortal Master had become somewhat numb.</p><p></p><p>This already demonstrated strength at the Yin God level.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had even swallowed a Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Master, as a small fry, deeply believed the words of Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember what kind of Golden Core Origin Venerable said he formed?"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable mentioned on the forum, it seemed to be a... star Golden Core." Rogue Immortal Master typed out these words, his throat feeling a bit painful.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think... is it possible that Origin Venerable's Golden Core is actually that sun in the sky?" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Master was completely lost.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, he would definitely say it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>But Origin Venerable had broken through his understanding again and again.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that someone really condensed the sun into a Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>This... how could it be possible.</p><p></p><p>He blinked his eyes, looking at the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't comprehend how powerful one would have to be to turn the sun into a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"When there was an extra sun in the sky, wasn't that when Origin Venerable said he had broken through to Yuan Dan?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

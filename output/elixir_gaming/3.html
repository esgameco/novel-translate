        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's agreement, Jiang Lingsu's anxious heart was put at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining six people also looked at Jiang Lingsu with some admiration.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu let out a sigh of relief, as Qi Yuan did not choose the person he had his eye on.</p><p></p><p>"The selection is complete, everyone. I shall take my leave," Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The senior disciples from the other peaks all nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan seemed a bit simple-minded, he was still very polite.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother Qi Yuan, farewell!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother Qi Yuan, see you tonight!"</p><p></p><p>These people all enthusiastically greeted Qi Yuan, filled with warmth.</p><p></p><p>In areas where interests were not involved, they were very respectful towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhugeliu from the Divine Medicine Peak hesitated for a moment before speaking: "Senior brother Qi Yuan, I have some doubts regarding the formula for the Nourishing Elixir. I wonder if senior brother Qi Yuan could find the time to enlighten me? If senior brother Qi Yuan can resolve my doubts, I would be willing to offer a Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item as a token of gratitude."</p><p></p><p>Zhugeliu's attitude was sincere.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had reminded Qi Yuan to select the disciples first, just so he could strike up a conversation with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His words caused the few Shenguang Sect disciples present to display different expressions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zhugeliu: "I will go down the mountain to walk my pet this evening, and I can take a look at it for you then."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhugeliu was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yiyi from the Myriad Laws Peak, upon hearing Qi Yuan mention a pet, she thought of something and a faint smile appeared on her previously cold face.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, let's go," Qi Yuan called out to Jiang Lingsu, and the two of them left the group.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Kong Fulu spoke: "Senior brother Zhugeliu, are you sure you want to ask Qi Yuan for advice on the elixir formula?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining few people also had puzzled or slightly amused expressions on their faces. They did not believe that Qi Yuan would be able to help Zhugeliu.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother Qi Yuan has extraordinary natural talent, and he must have some unconventional ideas regarding the Dao of Alchemy. Perhaps he also has his own thoughts on the matter," Zhugeliu said.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, he had encountered Qi Yuan walking his pet and discussed the elixir formula with him, and was unexpectedly enlightened by Qi Yuan's perspective.</p><p></p><p>"If he is so capable, then why has he not been able to gather a Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item?" the straightforward senior brother Kuang from the Striving Peak said bluntly, "Senior brother Zhugeliu, you may end up losing a Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item."</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment Spiritual Items were highly valuable, and were necessary for cultivators who had reached the Qi Condensation realm to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm. The higher the grade of the Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item, the more suitable it would be for the cultivator, and the better the results of the Foundation Establishment would be.</p><p></p><p>Except for Qi Yuan, the senior disciples from the five peaks had all already reached the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Qi Yuan's inability to reach the Foundation Establishment realm must be because he had offended his sect master and was not granted a Foundation Establishment Spiritual Item.</p><p></p><p>The senior disciple Xu Yiyi from the Myriad Laws Peak said, "A genius in one step, a madman in the next. Qi Yuan may very well have unique insights."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we can discuss these matters later. We still have important matters to attend to," Kong Fulu spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The others did not continue the conversation, and Kong Fulu turned to the remaining five people.</p><p></p><p>"They don't need further introduction." </p><p></p><p>"And I, Kong Fulu, am from the Five Radiances Peak..." The others present rolled their eyes. Clearly, the showy one had started his lengthy self-introduction again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu followed obediently behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She was full of curiosity about the Seven Colors Peak.</p><p></p><p>Especially about the peak lord, Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>Even her family's influence had not been able to uncover Ruan Yixi's true origins.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was related to the fact that her family was too far from the Shenguang Sect and the time was too rushed.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it proved that Ruan Yixi was definitely no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps she was the reason the Shenguang Sect could escape calamity.</p><p></p><p>She had traveled a great distance to come to the Shenguang Sect, all for the sake of Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>As for this senior brother?</p><p></p><p>He was just a passing acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what kind of person is our sect master?" Jiang Lingsu asked cautiously, hoping to learn more about the Seven Colors Peak's lord, Ruan Yixi, through Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The sect master is an... extremely beautiful person," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Qiyuan said without hesitation, "She's a person."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was momentarily taken aback. </p><p></p><p>Where has a disciple ever described their master in such a way? It's too rebellious and disrespectful! It's almost like he's disgracing his teacher and ancestors!</p><p></p><p>However, realizing that her senior brother Qiyuan was a cultivator of the Sect of the Foolish, she accepted it. Cultivators of the Sect of the Foolish are quite strange and speak very directly, so it's nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu continued to ask, "Besides being pretty, what else?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan stopped in his tracks and thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu waited expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Good figure," Qiyuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu: "..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu regretted asking her senior brother. The cultivators of the Sect of the Foolish are just too outrageous! What is even in their heads? She decided she wouldn't ask her senior brother anymore, since she would soon be able to see the Sect Master after entering the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>The two walked in silence as they ascended towards the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>After about two hours, Qiyuan stopped.</p><p></p><p>"This is my residence," he said, pointing to a small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu didn't understand what Qiyuan meant.</p><p></p><p>She asked, "Where is the Sect Master? Should I go pay my respects to the Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked up towards the peak's summit. "The Sect Master resides in the palace atop the mountain."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked up and saw a pavilion and jade tower amidst the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Qiyuan's thatched hut, it was much grander.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go pay our respects to the Sect Master now!" Jiang Lingsu said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan shook his head. "We can't see her."</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master is not here?"</p><p></p><p>"No, there are restrictions from the waist of the mountain up to the summit, so we cannot go up."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Lingsu was confused.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master once said that unless one has reached the Nascent Soul Realm, they are not permitted to ascend to the summit to see her."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation path has seven realms: Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Nascent Soul, Spirit Embryo, Purple Palace, Yin Spirit, and Yang Spirit. </p><p></p><p>The Shenguang Sect is one of the three major Daoist sects in the Great Xia Kingdom, with over a thousand disciples.</p><p></p><p>Most of these disciples are in the Qi Condensation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Above Qi Condensation is Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Foundation Establishment Realm are already considered mid-level in the sect, with high status. They can serve as executives or even elders.</p><p></p><p>But once one steps into the Nascent Soul Realm, they become the true upper echelons of the sect.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Xia Kingdom, aside from encountering those ancient Spirit Embryo cultivators, they can basically walk all over everyone.</p><p></p><p>As for the even higher Yin Spirit and Yang Spirit Realms, it's rumored that there are none in the Great Xia Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators are not weak anywhere. </p><p></p><p>Even for her, with her family's resources, it would take at least a decade or more of cultivation to reach the Nascent Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for her senior brother Qiyuan, a cultivator of the Sect of the Foolish, although his talent is decent, in her eyes he is still average. </p><p></p><p>He may not even be able to reach the Nascent Soul Realm in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>And even if he did, the quality of the Nascent Soul he refines might not be high.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, why has the Sect Master set such a strict requirement?" Jiang Lingsu asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She didn't have that much time to wait.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at Jiang Lingsu and slowly said, "The Sect Master might be afraid... to see me."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jiang Lingsu paused, recalling Qiyuan's previous opinion of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master probably just doesn't want to see you.</p><p></p><p>"I see, senior brother," Jiang Lingsu said, realizing she was powerless against the cultivators of the Sect of the Foolish.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qiyuan. "Senior brother, where am I to stay then?"</p><p></p><p>She can't go to the summit, and there are no other houses here.</p><p></p><p>"There's some straw and wood in the courtyard. You can build yourself a thatched hut and live there," Qiyuan said, yawning again.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had an ominous feeling about this.</p><p>Her senior brother couldn't be asking her to build a thatched hut, could he? She's never even lived in one before.</p><p></p><p>"You can move the stuff and build a thatched hut yourself. Just make do with that," Qiyuan said.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 227</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every bolt of lightning transformed into a celestial soldier, general, or thunder god of the Thunder Department.</p><p></p><p>This was not simply the Thunder God and Lightning Goddess coming to assist!</p><p></p><p>Rather, all thunder deities were obeying his command! In the divine realm, countless thunder gods descended, sweeping through the blood-colored divine realm. It could be described as retribution for countless eons, evil spirits being vanquished.</p><p></p><p>The two mythical figures - the commander of the Liyang Army and the deputy commander Taizhong - joined forces. One even had the power of stars to assist him.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with the divine might of the thunder prison, they were utterly suppressed!</p><p></p><p>With just one collision, cracks of blood appeared on the face of the Liyang Army commander. From deep within the cracks, blood-red light continuously seeped out.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"The god you observed... who exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>He could not understand, and great fear arose in his heart! He did not even dare to look at the illusory figure of the Thunder Ancestor seated in the azure sky.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the master of the divine realm, just those terrifying deities formed from thunder - mere illusions - were enough to make him unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>And these were not just one or two illusions, but dozens or even hundreds.</p><p></p><p>If mere illusions were like this, what would happen if their true forms descended?</p><p></p><p>He could not imagine.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was this enemy?</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Grand Venerable stood in the void, his long robes fluttering, ten thousand bolts of lightning flashing.</p><p></p><p>He did not waste words, his voice like a million thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>"Great sage, great mercy, supreme emperor, supreme dao!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, all the divine generals formed from lightning suddenly grew ten times, a hundred times larger at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The aura on their bodies also became terrifyingly extraordinary! Heavenly gods descended, obeying the Thunder Ancestor's command to sweep away all evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The divine realm of the Liyang Army commander began to break apart continuously.</p><p></p><p>If not for the assistance of the stars, he likely would have perished already.</p><p></p><p>But even so, with just a brief contact, a third of his divine realm had already collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The two sides were simply not on the same level, not opponents of the same class!</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The flames of war were no weaker than inside the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Qingheng Continent, nine illusory stars suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the Qingheng Continent could look up and see those terrifying illusory stars.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that if one just flew up to the sky, they could touch the edges of these nine stars with their hands.</p><p></p><p>Each star emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Nine stars guarding, slaughter filling the heavens! As the saying goes, when the Nine Luminaries cross the sky, the fortunes of all gods are no longer in their own hands,</p><p></p><p>But in the hands of the Nine Luminary Star Lords!</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Taiji, Nine Luminaries attack the azure sky!"</p><p></p><p>The twin sisters were the sun and moon.</p><p></p><p>Yin and yang, combining to form taiji!</p><p></p><p>With the shout of the Nine Luminary Star Officials, a taiji pattern like a heavenly canopy smashed down towards the earth.</p><p></p><p>Seven stars shone within it!</p><p></p><p>Countless evil gods rose up like fireflies.</p><p></p><p>However, within the great formation of the Nine Luminary Star Officials, there was nowhere to escape.</p><p></p><p>It was like primitives wearing animal skins and holding wooden spears charging towards a modern army of steel - death was their only outcome.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"All Grand Venerables, hear my command, let's break through together!"</p><p></p><p>The evil god headquarters was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic evil god army gradually formed battle formations to counterattack the Nine Luminary Star Officials.</p><p></p><p>However, a thousand ordinary Supreme Venerables could kill one Grand Supreme Venerable with one strike.</p><p></p><p>But a thousand Venerables could not even injure a Grand Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The gap between divine realms could not be made up for by numbers!</p><p></p><p>The Nine Luminary Star Officials united could even defeat mythical figures!</p><p></p><p>How could these Venerables and ordinary Grand Venerables compare?</p><p></p><p>The god-observing method bestowed by Qi Yuan allowed him to observe all the orthodox gods of the Heavenly Court.</p><p></p><p>Presiding over the thirty-three heavens, each had boundless divine power.</p><p></p><p>Their divine realms had even condensed divine duties.</p><p></p><p>Their power exceeded others of the same level by more than tenfold.</p><p></p><p>Nine Grand Venerables who had taken five steps to heaven attacking together - the power was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, besides the Nine Luminary Star Officials, the other true gods also charged into the evil god army, as if entering undefended territory!</p><p></p><p>The war was one-sided!</p><p></p><p>There were many Grand Venerables in the evil god headquarters, hundreds in total, even exceeding the southern lands.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the Nine Luminary Star Officials and other Grand Venerables, the divine realms of these Grand Venerables were as fragile as a child's paper airplane.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many paper airplanes, could they overwhelm a fighter jet?</p><p></p><p>The slaughter was one-sided!</p><p></p><p>The evil god headquarters was in ruins.</p><p></p><p>Divine realms had collapsed everywhere. Ordinary Venerables on such a battlefield could be killed by the shockwaves of battle if they weren't careful.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand miles away, all cultivators and ancient gods involuntarily flew into the sky, watching that massacre from afar.</p><p></p><p>They could not see the specific details, but they could see that on one side was an endless sea of thunder hanging upside down, seeming to want to swallow the world; on the other side were the Nine Luminaries in the sky, with countless evil gods rising up like moths to a flame, then falling.</p><p></p><p>"A great battle has broken out in the evil god headquarters!"</p><p></p><p>"Mythical figures, these must be mythical figures!"</p><p></p><p>"Mythical figures are besieging the evil god headquarters! What's going on, where did these mythical figures in our Mortal Heart Realm come from?"</p><p></p><p>Countless eyes watched that earth-shaking battle, their expressions either shocked or delighted.</p><p></p><p>Some knelt and wept, some had tears in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators and ancient gods watched this scene from afar, shock and astonishment arising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand miles away, a headless terrifying ancient god stood atop a high mountain. As he watched the distant flames of war, blood tears flowed from his neck.</p><p></p><p>"Ha... haha..." Grand Venerable Lingzhong laughed wildly, "A sea of thunder like a heavenly canopy, Nine Luminaries suspended in the sky, I... I've seen it!"</p><p></p><p>He recalled that half a month before the Hongtang Battle, the Holy Mother of No Food had found him and given him something.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she wore a red dress and her eyes had a rare glimmer of radiance. She said: "The Mortal Heart Realm will not perish like this, hope has always existed. </p><p></p><p>In the distant future, someone will surely stand up, punch through the stars, and tear apart the Sun God with their bare hands!"</p><p></p><p>"He really exists... No Food." Grand Venerable Lingzhong's expression was crazed.</p><p></p><p>Hope had always existed, but the Holy Mother of No Food and those mythical figures who had died in battle would never be able to see it again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan stood in the void wearing cyan robes.</p><p></p><p>His expression was calm as his experience bar rapidly increased and evil god spirit power frantically accumulated.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten breaths, his accumulation had exceeded that of the Battle of Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>He glanced sideways at Grand Venerable Lishan and said calmly: "Your music playing technique still needs work. The sound you're blowing is too quiet, those ancient gods fighting below can't hear you at all."</p><p></p><p>Grand Venerable Lishan's face turned red.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was blowing too quietly, it was that the sound below was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The two sides fighting had over ten thousand in total! And the weakest among them were all true gods!</p><p></p><p>Grand Venerable Lishan even expanded his divine realm, transforming countless divine spirit powers into avatars to blow the suona together.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the sound simply could not reach the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Because his divine realm was too weak, while the divine realms below seemed to have cheats enabled - each had a divine duty, which was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Because divine duties... had always been the symbol of truly peerless geniuses.</p><p></p><p>For example, among the evil gods in the evil god headquarters below, numbering close to ten thousand,</p><p></p><p>Only a few dozen possessed divine duties.</p><p></p><p>On their side... everyone had one!</p><p></p><p>Even the most ordinary Venerable had a divine duty of guarding the gates of heaven!</p><p></p><p>It was absurd!</p><p></p><p>Grand Venerable Lishan felt moved.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Thunder Grand Venerable, whose terrifying divine realm made even Grand Venerable Lishan envious when he saw it.</p><p></p><p>That rolling thunder, endless lightning, the momentum was too magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Grand Venerable Lishan even thought that if it weren't for the need to end this quickly, the Thunder Grand Venerable alone could kill all the enemies here.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that might take quite some time.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to shatter your divine realm, I can get you a god-observing method with a louder voice. That way you won't have to worry about the suona sound being too quiet," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Grand Venerable Lishan...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One was stunned for a moment, then said: "Heavenly Lord, this old man also doesn't want to keep playing the suona. This old man wants to personally slay these evil gods with his own hands!" As he said this, there was a deep murderous intent in the eyes of the Great Venerable One of Pear Mountain.</p><p></p><p>His parents and relatives had all died at the hands of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>"You'll have the chance," Qi Yuan said calmly as he swept his gaze over the Thunder Prison.</p><p></p><p>The Deputy Commander of the Taizhong Army had already been killed, with only the Commander of the Liyang Army still struggling to hold on.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens above, the star belonging to the Liyang Army Commander had become dim and lightless at this moment, as if swallowed by an endless sea of thunder.</p><p></p><p>In the evil gods' main base, Qi Yuan's people were like true heavenly soldiers and generals, frantically slaughtering some of the miscellaneous troops.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, two-thirds of the evil gods had fallen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's eyes narrowed: "Since you've come, you might as well stay."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, a blood-red long sword suddenly unsheathed and slashed towards a tall mountain a thousand miles away! At this time, Qi Yuan's experience bar was skyrocketing, and he had clearly stepped into the realm of Myth.</p><p></p><p>In this game, it took Qi Yuan a very long time to go from Yuandan to True God.</p><p></p><p>But stepping from Tianjie to Myth happened very quickly.</p><p></p><p>On the tall mountain a thousand miles away, the eyes of two evil god commanders flickered with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Myth!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with Qi Yuan's sword strike, the two divine realm commanders did not hesitate at all and immediately turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>Because they sensed an intense feeling of threat.</p><p></p><p>This sense of threat was even stronger than what the Thunder God Venerable One had given them.</p><p></p><p>"This sword strike of mine is called Conferring Godhood.</p><p></p><p>No one has been able to refuse the god I wish to confer.</p><p></p><p>I'll confer upon you the title of... Death God, but... a dead god."</p><p></p><p>The divine power on the sword light surged violently, and a special divine realm unfolded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, these two evil god commanders fell into the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine realm is this!"</p><p></p><p>These two evil god commanders were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Because this... didn't seem like a Yin God divine realm at all, but rather like a garbage dump.</p><p></p><p>The divine realm contained all sorts of random things.</p><p></p><p>Stars rolled around like footballs on a field, huge bolts of lightning constantly struck the ocean, endless magma flowed from water taps, a deep black hole in an iron pot sneezed...</p><p></p><p>Everything in the divine realm was chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder, water, wood, growth, death... it has everything, what exactly is this!"</p><p></p><p>The two evil god commanders were horrified.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had encountered such a divine realm.</p><p></p><p>All divine realms are supposed to be pure and refined, only then can they exert the strongest power of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if there are other attributes, they usually occupy a very small portion.</p><p></p><p>How could it be like this, a hodgepodge of everything.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so stupid that you could still cultivate to the Myth realm? Didn't I say you were going to die? In context, it's obvious that this is your burial ground.</p><p></p><p>Haven't you studied middle school Chinese and reading comprehension?</p><p></p><p>If you can't even answer this kind of question, yet still cultivated to Myth, this world is too unfair.</p><p></p><p>I, Qi Yuan, might as well do a good deed for heaven and kill you to make this world a little fairer."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the long sword transformed into countless blood-red bullets! "Namo Gatling Bodhisattva, da da da!"</p><p></p><p>The countless bullets then transformed into terrifying giant snakes, opening their bloody mouths and devouring the two evil god commanders.</p><p></p><p>The two evil god commanders screamed in agony. Under Qi Yuan's attack, their divine realms were as pale as white paper.</p><p></p><p>Their spirits and thoughts also became chaotic at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Don't kill us... Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"With such a chaotic divine realm, you'll never have the chance to enter the Yang God realm in your lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>"When our lord makes his move, you will surely die... spare us!"</p><p></p><p>The two evil god commanders begged desperately.</p><p></p><p>They had cultivated for most of their lives and even gained the opportunity to reflect in the heavens. How could they imagine dying like this?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked up at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Two stars were extremely dim, with blood-red shadows chewing on them.</p><p></p><p>"You have such large stars, so much land, yet you leave them uninhabited. What a waste!</p><p></p><p>With housing prices so high, you've certainly contributed to that!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you... saying!"</p><p></p><p>"Yang Gods are invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm saying... why don't people live on the sun?</p><p></p><p>These Yang Gods are all black-hearted landlords and rich misers!"</p><p></p><p>As the sword light flashed past, the divine realms of the two evil god commanders shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Two imperceptible specks of dust were added to Qi Yuan's divine realm.</p><p></p><p>A massive amount of evil god spiritual power poured in, and Qi Yuan's experience bar skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>"Myth realm... is so weak?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that I'm too strong?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the battle at the evil gods' main base in Qingheng Continent had reached its end.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Army Commander had been killed by the Thunder God Venerable One. His eyes now flickered with purple lightning, clearly showing that he was not fully satisfied with the previous battle.</p><p></p><p>He charged into the battlefield again, continuously slaughtering evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of killing and thunder continued unabated.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the blood-soaked ancient gods stood below Qi Yuan, their eyes filled with passionate fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>All the evil gods in the main base had been killed.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable One stood beside Qi Yuan, his gaze looking down on the world, but when he looked at Qi Yuan, it turned completely to reverence.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan, who had been silent, spoke: "Everyone, I suddenly realized that I'm actually quite strong too. I just casually killed two Myth realm beings earlier."</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan said this, the ancient gods present remained calm, showing no shock.</p><p></p><p>After all, isn't it normal for the Origin Heavenly Lord to kill Myth realm beings?</p><p></p><p>"Since we're so strong, why don't we take this opportunity to... wipe out all the other evil god bases!" Qi Yuan changed his plan after careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The Thunder God Venerable One immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't wait to continue the great battle and kill more Myth realm beings.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, this old lady wants to kill more!" The Fire Lotus Venerable One now showed no ladylike demeanor, very different from her usual self.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods nodded in agreement, their hearts accumulating surging killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Sweep away the northern lands, restore our realm!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their morale was high.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..." Qi Yuan was about to announce the new battle plan when suddenly his eyes narrowed, "They're running away!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the ancient gods involuntarily looked towards the sky! They saw that in the northern lands, a sudden burst of light appeared, forming passages leading to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of evil gods squeezed into these passages, seemingly trying to escape from the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>"They're running away?"</p><p></p><p>"They actually ran away!"</p><p></p><p>"How can they run away!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were stunned, feeling a sense of unreality.</p><p></p><p>The evil gods who had ravaged the Mortal Heart Realm for hundreds of thousands of years... had actually all run away.</p><p></p><p>Without looking back, without any hesitation, they all ran.</p><p></p><p>"They actually ran away... how boring, I wanted to kill more." Qi Yuan complained helplessly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Thunder God Venerable One's voice rumbled: "Heavenly Lord, I just came up with a plan following your example!"</p><p></p><p>"What plan?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Lord, didn't you say you lacked opponents? My plan has two steps. First, we now send troops to the Heavenly Pillar to capture the Yang Gods alive. Second, after capturing the Yang Gods, we immediately mobilize the entire realm's forces to counterattack the evil god realm!" The Thunder God Venerable One said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment. He looked at the Thunder God Venerable One and said meaningfully: "Are you brainless or do you think I'm an idiot? If we go fight the Yang Gods now... are we going to our deaths?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite arrogant, but he hadn't become arrogant to that extent.</p><p></p><p>"Also... plagiarism is shameful! You split up and modified my plan, then claim it as your own. Have you no shame?</p><p></p><p>I never plagiarize, and I don't want my people to plagiarize either!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He wished he could find Qi Yuan and send him to the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Elder stood to the side, his eyes filled with emotion: "The Origin Heavenly Venerable has always done things differently. Nothing he does would be surprising."</p><p></p><p>At the Hundred Flowers Gathering, the Twilight Elder had witnessed Qi Yuan's uniqueness firsthand. </p><p></p><p>This uniqueness - daring to take action against evil gods, daring to be the first in the world - filled the Twilight Elder with admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Elder also looked curious: "I'd like to meet this extraordinary person too."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who could visualize twenty-one legends and eight myths - just what kind of divine being was he?</p><p></p><p>Such a legendary ancient god would likely be on par with the Mortal Realm's number one, the Holy Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Elder was also transformed from an ancient heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>Her previous incarnation had never met the Holy Mother of No Food, but had heard tales of her deeds.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Elder held the utmost reverence for the Holy Mother of No Food. </p><p></p><p>In some ways, she was also half a follower of the Holy Mother of No Food's teachings.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Old Thunder God, you're back?" Just then, a voice came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light stopped, and two figures appeared before everyone present.</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned to look at Qi Yuan, with surprise and awe in their gazes.</p><p></p><p>So this was that peerless genius?</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, you know to come back?" The Great Thunder Venerable looked at Qi Yuan and said angrily, "Hurry up and get ready, we're going to the North Sea God's Eye!"</p><p></p><p>"The North Sea God's Eye? What for?" Qi Yuan was confused. "Old Thunder God, stop being so flustered. Just tell me what's going on!"</p><p></p><p>"What else could it be for? To escape with our lives, look at the mess you've made!" The Great Thunder Venerable seemed to explode with rage. "You sent your subordinates to kill the evil gods of the Maple and Forest countries. Sure, it felt good, but what about the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Venerable pointed at the Twilight Elder and the others, saying: "These people left the Ancient God Alliance to come support you in Green Water Village, risking their lives!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Qi Yuan look towards the Twilight Elder and the others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was also introducing these people in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Qi's introduction, Qi Yuan's gaze softened.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Ancient God Alliance and traveling thousands of miles to Green Water Village - this kind of favor was something Qi Yuan would remember.</p><p></p><p>When it came to friends, Qi Yuan was never stingy.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to become my subjects?" he asked the Twilight Elder and the others.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the ancient gods of the Ancient God Alliance were all a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>They had come to support Green Water Village prepared to die.</p><p></p><p>But now the Origin Heavenly Venerable was asking them to be his subjects? They were confused.</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Venerable glared at Qi Yuan: "Now you're still thinking about your damn subjects! Hurry to the North Sea God's Eye, otherwise when the evil god army camps attack, you'll die here!"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>The urgent matter at hand was to leave here and go to the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan shook his head: "The people from the evil god army camps won't be coming."</p><p></p><p>"What?" The Great Thunder Venerable didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, Zhu Zhuangshi and I took a casual stroll and blew up four nearby evil god army camps."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually, taking out a bottle of fish-blasting thunderbolt bombs.</p><p></p><p>"The quality of these firecrackers is really good, and they can even limit the blast range.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity, there were only eight large ones in total, and four have already been used.</p><p></p><p>In the future we can only blast some small fish and shrimp." Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Thunder Pearls!" The Great Thunder Venerable's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>As one who wielded thunder techniques, the Great Thunder Venerable knew these objects better than anyone.</p><p></p><p>This pile of small beads were actually all Yin Thunder Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the four that were the size of fists - even the Great Thunder Venerable could sense the intense threat they posed.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also looked at the Yin Thunder Pearls in Qi Yuan's hand with trepidation. The divine power in their spirit apertures involuntarily circulated to protect their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Used four of these big ones to blow up four evil god army camps." Qi Yuan put away the Yin Thunder Pearls. "So for now, I estimate no evil god army camps will be coming.</p><p></p><p>Everyone can eat in peace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was lazy.</p><p></p><p>Since killing the evil gods of the Maple and Forest countries would bring the evil god army camps to encircle and kill them,</p><p></p><p>To avoid this situation, it was simple - just destroy the evil god army camps in advance.</p><p></p><p>Without evil god army camps, wouldn't Green Water Village be worry-free?</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Venerable fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods of the Ancient God Alliance present also couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was always breaking through their understanding.</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Venerable took a deep breath and cursed: "In the future, whoever calls me reckless, I'll fight them!"</p><p></p><p>Reckless?</p><p></p><p>How could he compare? The Origin Heavenly Venerable was truly reckless!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Origin Heavenly Venerable, he was just a cowardly turtle.</p><p></p><p>"So why go to the North Sea God's Eye?" Qi Yuan looked at everyone again, extending an invitation.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to become my subjects? I'll have some small benefits to give you."</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Elder was helpless. Qi Yuan was really fixated on having subjects.</p><p></p><p>The first time they met, he had heard Qi Yuan's invitation.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Elder looked surprised, but didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were also a bit confused, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>But the ancient gods who had followed Qi Yuan from the ancestral land looked at him expectantly: "My lord, do we also get small benefits?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at these people, the Pine Gazing Ancient God couldn't help saying: "The lord has already given you all divine realm nectar, what more do you want?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Pine Gazing Ancient God had osteoporosis and was always considering things for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Twilight Elder and other ancient gods were surprised.</p><p></p><p>This benefit was divine realm nectar?</p><p></p><p>Divine realm nectar could condense the embryonic form of a divine realm.</p><p></p><p>For Venerables, it was a priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient gods' breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>"We came here prepared to die anyway. If becoming subjects means becoming subjects, getting divine realm nectar isn't a bad deal." The Twilight Elder said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In other circumstances, if someone tried to tempt him with divine realm nectar to become a subject, he definitely wouldn't choose it.</p><p></p><p>But now, everyone was in the same boat, sharing life and death.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to quibble over these things.</p><p></p><p>They were all going to die anyway.</p><p></p><p>And the Origin Heavenly Venerable's actions had earned their admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Then we shall serve the Origin Heavenly Venerable as our lord!" the Fire Lotus Elder said gently.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also spoke up. Some hesitated, but were still willing to serve the Origin Heavenly Venerable as their lord.</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Realm, this kind of acknowledgment of a lord, even if just verbal, would take effect.</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Venerable looked at Qi Yuan and snorted coldly: "I'm not interested in your divine realm nectar. I won't be your subject."</p><p></p><p>He was already a Great Venerable, and wouldn't bow down just for divine realm nectar.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan seemed a bit disappointed: "What a pity. I had originally prepared a great gift for you, Old Thunder God. Since you're unwilling to be my subject, this great gift... I'll have to reconsider."</p><p></p><p>"What great gift? Do you think I care?" The Great Thunder Venerable sneered disdainfully. But looking at Qi Yuan, he then said, "Fine, you've begged me three or four times to become a villager of Green Water Village.</p><p></p><p>Since you've lowered yourself so much, I'm kindhearted and will reluctantly agree to be your subject.</p><p></p><p>Don't think it's because I'm interested in that damn great gift of yours!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Venerable looked quite tsundere.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he still chose to become Qi Yuan's subject.</p><p></p><p>"There is much to celebrate today." Qi Yuan was also very excited.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few Venerable Ones among the villagers of Qingshui Village, but only one Great Venerable - the Jade Flower Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the North Sea God, the Jade Flower Great Venerable was already there, and now there was an additional Divine Thunder Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Stop celebrating, if you keep smiling you'll jinx it!" Divine Thunder Great Venerable commemorated becoming a subject of Qi Yuan, still speaking bluntly, "You're quite fierce, kid, directly wiping out four evil god camps. This time, the new gods won't be able to delay the divine war even if they want to!"</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, the power of the new gods far exceeded that of the ancient gods. </p><p></p><p>If a divine war on the scale of the Great Flood were to break out between the two sides, the ancient gods of the Mortal Heart Realm would have long since been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>The reason there were still so many ancient gods was actually because the new gods took no action and did not sweep away the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>Because within the Pillar of Heaven, there was a Yang God lying dormant, devouring the Heavenly Dao of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>This also led to deficiencies in the Heavenly Dao of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, even divine embryo cultivators and true gods would experience feelings of hunger.</p><p></p><p>The Yang God had been continuously devouring the Heavenly Dao of the Mortal Heart Realm, and perhaps before long, the Heavenly Dao would be completely consumed.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the life and death of all the ancient gods in the Mortal Heart Realm would be at the whim of that Yang God.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many of these new gods couldn't be bothered to risk their lives killing ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>After all, they only needed to wait a few decades or a hundred years for the Yang God to completely devour the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods would die then.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan first killed the hundred gods of the Feng and Lin countries, then killed the four great evil god camps.</p><p></p><p>The evil gods in other fallen areas of the Northern Lands probably wouldn't care about the fate of these evil god camps, and might even treat it as after-dinner gossip.</p><p></p><p>There were five continents in the Northern Lands, and while the other four continents would sit idly by, the evil god army commander of the Qingheng Continent definitely wouldn't be able to sit still.</p><p></p><p>The camp leaders of the four great camps were all his capable subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had been wiped out by Qi Yuan, he would definitely take action against Qi Yuan to get revenge, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"In less than ten days or half a month, the great generals under the Qingheng Continent army commander will definitely come. You'd better be prepared!</p><p></p><p>At that time, this old man estimates there will be at least ten Great Venerables!</p><p></p><p>Even if you flee to the North Sea God's Eye, it will be of no use." Divine Thunder Great Venerable had already given up hope.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled and said: "Is the game setting that when you beat the small fry, the big shots come?</p><p></p><p>My setting is, beat the small fry and then beat the big shots!"</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly let the enemy come at him wave after wave.</p><p></p><p>His style was to strike first! To wipe out the enemy before they noticed.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is just waiting to see you perform!" Divine Thunder Great Venerable rolled his eyes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said with great spirit: "I've already found the bug in the game, I can sweep across the Mortal Heart Realm immediately!"</p><p></p><p>In the past, there were many limitations on creating powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Now there were almost no limitations, he just needed to mass produce them.</p><p></p><p>This game was simply a matter of churning out troops and sweeping across.</p><p></p><p>It was even simpler than the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the only problem was that there was a powerful Yang God as an opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Venerables of Qingheng Continent are just small fry, my experience packages are nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>Come, come, since you've all become my subjects, let's first take a count so I can give you some benefits.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi, come here." Qi Yuan's train of thought shifted quickly, he had just been talking about the crisis in Qingheng Continent, and now he was calling Qi Qi over.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather!" Qi Qi appeared with a helpless expression, she was busy.</p><p></p><p>"How's the basic information registration form coming along?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>When he left Feiwu City with Zhu Zhuangshi to go blow up fish, Qi Yuan had already given deep thought to how to develop and expand.</p><p></p><p>One of the most important points was to find a suitable path for his loyal subjects, especially the Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan lacked now was high-end combat power.</p><p></p><p>For example, even though Zhu Zhuangshi had obtained a mythical level visualization method and gained various resources to increase his strength, he was still far behind Jade Flower Great Venerable who had obtained the legendary level Hundred Flowers Immortal visualization method.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of potential, Tianpeng Marshal's was still higher.</p><p></p><p>The path of a Venerable One was already set, unlike ordinary subjects who could cultivate any visualization method.</p><p></p><p>Only when the path of the visualization method was the same as the path of the true god could it be used.</p><p></p><p>Just like Jade Flower Great Venerable and the Hundred Flowers Immortal.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan's idea was to write down the cultivation direction and desired divine duties of his true god subjects.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could match a suitable visualization method for each person.</p><p></p><p>This would allow their combat power to increase faster.</p><p></p><p>"The forms are here!" Qi Qi waved her hand, and a stack of papers with a rather modern feel appeared, with many words written on them.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at them, gently grasped the forms, and pushed them outward.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the ancient gods had a form in their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Fill out the forms, I'm going to eat. When I finish eating, hand them all to me together.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and fill them out seriously, don't make things up!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan bid farewell to these ancient gods and went off to eat.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Great Venerable was also holding a form, he looked at it: "What's all this? This kid, he's not going to embezzle the divine realm immortal liquid he's supposed to give us, is he?"</p><p></p><p>Twilight Venerable also looked at the form, somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"Age? Name? Personality?</p><p></p><p>Skills mastered? Cultivation methods practiced? Desired divine duties?"</p><p></p><p>The things on this form were strange, Twilight Venerable found it both funny and frustrating.</p><p></p><p>If Twilight Venerable had lived on Blue Star, he would have found that the contents of this form were somewhat similar to a resume used for job interviews.</p><p></p><p>"Twilight Venerable, what does Origin Celestial Lord mean by this?" Fire Lotus Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also looked confused.</p><p></p><p>What was the point of filling this out?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Twilight Venerable shook his head, he thought of something and suddenly had a terrifying guess, but immediately suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Lord wants to tailor visualization methods for each of us?" At this time, Pine View Ancient God said in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods all looked at Pine View Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>Actually, they had all had this guess in their hearts, but felt it was too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord does indeed know many ancient gods we have never seen before.</p><p></p><p>But how could he possibly tailor methods for each of us?</p><p></p><p>I guess after we fill these out, he'll select one or two suitable people to visualize." The twin sister analyzed.</p><p></p><p>Her words gained the approval of most of those present.</p><p></p><p>This seemed more possible.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Pine View Ancient God immediately looked at one of the ancient gods: "Li Xiao, don't you want to walk the path of the physical body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xiao looked confused: "I walk the wood path, I only mentioned the physical body path in passing!"</p><p></p><p>"No, you have to walk the physical body path, you can't walk the wood path with me!" Pine View Ancient God became anxious.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the same path, there might only be one powerful ancient god.</p><p></p><p>Only visualization methods at the Great Venerable level would be of great use to the Venerable Ones present.</p><p></p><p>So if they walked the same path, they might not receive the visualization method bestowed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiao looked at Pine View Ancient God with disdain: "You're getting so worked up over something that hasn't even happened? Sigh, why do I have to be neighbors with you, it's too embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>Pine View Ancient God and Li Xiao started arguing, and the atmosphere on the scene became more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The previously oppressive environment lightened considerably.</p><p></p><p>P.S. Work was a bit busy today, there will be one more chapter in two hours, sorry!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

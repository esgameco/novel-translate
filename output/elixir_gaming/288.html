        <h1>Chapter 288</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When meeting someone in person offline, you can see much more.</p><p></p><p>"Your aptitude is rather poor..." Qi Yuan evaluated honestly.</p><p></p><p>With狂欢's aptitude, he wouldn't even be able to enter the Great Shang Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, 狂欢's heart tightened and he asked solemnly, "How poor is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Very poor. Without some special immortal destiny, in this lifetime... you'll probably only be able to spin your wheels at the Qi Refinement stage."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Refinement?" 狂欢 had never heard this term before. He pondered carefully, "This is... a realm of immortal cultivation, I wonder if Mr. Qi could explain further."</p><p></p><p>"There are seven realms in immortal cultivation, namely Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Purple Palace, Yin Spirit and Yang Spirit. </p><p></p><p>Qi Refinement is the weakest, and Yang Spirit is the strongest." Qi Yuan gave a simple introduction.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was a big customer, so Qi Yuan was quite accommodating.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, 狂欢's eyes lit up, especially when he heard about Core Formation. His body trembled almost imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, if one cultivates to a profound realm, can one... resist firearms?" 狂欢 asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"You're really lacking ambition. Of course it's possible." At the Yang Spirit realm, destroying the world with a punch was no joke.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Yang Spirit, even a Nascent Soul or Core Formation cultivator could turn the Qin Yuan country upside down.</p><p></p><p>"Even against photon guns?" 狂欢 asked, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Photon guns were a special type of firearm. The technology came from Canxing, and could be considered a second-tier high-tech weapon from there.</p><p></p><p>This type of gun was somewhat similar to the concept of electromagnetic guns from Qi Yuan's previous life on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>What it fired was not bullets, but a beam of photons. This photon beam had special penetrating power and only affected living organisms, causing radiation damage to cells.</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen a photon gun, but it should be fine," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The speed of photon gun bullets was very fast, almost the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yin Spirit cultivators naturally didn't have that kind of speed, but even if hit by one of these guns, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, guns relied on people to operate them. Immortal cultivators just needed to be faster than the person.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the various guns placed on the table and couldn't help asking, "Are you in the arms business?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, making some hard-earned money.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Qi likes any of these guns, I can give it to you as a gift.</p><p></p><p>I can also help you get the gun permit." 狂欢 said quickly.</p><p></p><p>In front of Qi Yuan, he didn't have the arrogant demeanor of an arms dealer at all, but was refined and courteous.</p><p></p><p>But in those small countries, even when facing generals or other big shots, he would often look down his nose at people, extremely domineering.</p><p></p><p>"These little toys can be quite useful sometimes." Qi Yuan casually picked up a small handgun.</p><p></p><p>When out and about, the deterrent effect of a gun sometimes surpassed other things.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Qi Yuan had never touched a gun. This time, holding a gun gave him a feeling like a child getting a new toy.</p><p></p><p>"I've never handled one before, this is my first time. Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"I'm glad you like it, sir." 狂欢 revealed a fawning smile.</p><p></p><p>"Did you bring the money? Shall we make the deal?" Qi Yuan pocketed the gun and got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>He had only two purposes in meeting 狂欢. The first was to sell the "Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique".</p><p></p><p>"I have the funds ready and can transfer them to your account at any time, it's just... the cultivation technique..." 狂欢 said haltingly.</p><p></p><p>"Once the money arrives, I'll give it to you." Qi Yuan sat down casually.</p><p></p><p>Various guns were laid out on the table, along with all sorts of colorful precious drinks.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up a bottle of red drink and poured it directly into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>A spicy yet sweet sensation filled Qi Yuan's taste buds.</p><p></p><p>He put down the bottle of red drink.</p><p></p><p>"The taste isn't very good."</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, after drinking so much immortal elixir in the immortal cultivation world, drinking these expensive beverages always felt like they had a taste of cheap disinfectant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan casually drinking the beverages on the table, completely at ease as if he were in his own home.</p><p></p><p>Watching Qi Yuan drink a bottle of wine worth tens of thousands, 狂欢 finally gritted his teeth and said, "Azhi, transfer the money to Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>"My account number is 47..." Qi Yuan recited his account number.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 sat down next to Qi Yuan and said carefully, "Mr. Qi, there's a small issue with your account level. There are some restrictions on large fund transfers. I can help you upgrade it... if that's alright with you?"</p><p></p><p>狂欢 was an arms dealer, but he also had considerable connections and influence in the Qin Yuan country.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had very deep ties with some military forces in Qin Yuan country.</p><p></p><p>Nominally smuggling, it was actually helping the Qin Yuan military clear inventory and sell off old stock.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine." Qi Yuan had no objections to this, and even found it convenient.</p><p></p><p>In Qin Yuan country, ordinary people's bank accounts were actually subject to many restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there daily transfer limits, but accounts could be frozen at any time.</p><p></p><p>Once an account was upgraded to a certain level, these issues would no longer exist.</p><p></p><p>After all, high-level accounts not only represented high assets, but also high social status.</p><p></p><p>Even if the bank's AI system detected anomalies in such accounts, it couldn't automatically block them and would need to consult superiors.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan received a text message on his phone.</p><p></p><p>His bank card level had been upgraded.</p><p></p><p>And on his real-name authenticated chat software, there was a new friend request from a bank employee.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clicked to accept, and the other party immediately sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, I'm from Wei Qin Bank... Bachelor's degree in Finance from Jingdu University, Master's degree from... I'll be Mr. Qi's personal wealth advisor from now on..."</p><p></p><p>Below the greeting message was a lightly made-up ID photo.</p><p></p><p>At this time, another text message appeared on Qi Yuan's phone.</p><p></p><p>Over 90 million Qin Yuan currency had been credited to the account.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, the money has been credited, please check!" 狂欢's heart was full of anticipation, and also some nervousness.</p><p></p><p>The money had been paid, so the cultivation technique should be given to him now, right? But Qi Yuan was dressed quite simply, his clothes obviously mass-produced and ordinary. It wasn't clear where he might be keeping the technique.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, open your phone's voice recorder, I'll recite the technique for you to listen to."</p><p></p><p>"Recite?" 狂欢 was slightly stunned. "There's no... secret manual, or electronic version?"</p><p></p><p>"I made this up on the spot, where would I have time to make an electronic version?" Qi Yuan glanced sideways at 狂欢.</p><p></p><p>"Made up on the spot?" 狂欢 was stunned.</p><p></p><p>You're not even pretending?</p><p></p><p>"This is something I made up on the spot, the gold content... selling it to you for just 90 million, you're getting a great deal.</p><p></p><p>What, are you worried there's a problem with the technique? Don't worry, I cultivate with techniques I make up myself, there's no issue."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a big customer, so Qi Yuan was very thoughtful and emotionally intelligent.</p><p></p><p>狂欢's mind was in a bit of a mess, but he finally said, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>"'Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique', the full text is about 1,300 characters, along with the method for circulating the technique. Listen carefully, if there's anything you don't understand, ask me anytime."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly recited the contents of the technique.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 listened attentively, feeling it was over too soon.</p><p></p><p>"Did you get all that? Anything you don't understand?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 shook his head vigorously. He looked at Qi Yuan and said softly, "Didn't Mr. Qi ask me to collect some materials? The herbs are on the yacht now, I'll go organize them and bring them up in about half an hour."</p><p></p><p>狂欢 wanted to leave temporarily, giving himself half an hour to go find someone to verify the authenticity of this technique.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, be quick about it. I'll go fishing for a bit."</p><p></p><p>The reception room was very large and even had a fishing platform.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." 狂欢 hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>About a few minutes later...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Later, in a spacious private room.</p><p></p><p>An elderly man dressed in fine clothes appeared, along with several men and women wearing researcher uniforms.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan showed these people excerpts of the cultivation method, letting them conduct a brief study and analysis.</p><p></p><p>The elderly man spoke at this time, his eyes filled with reverence: "This... just a few sentences seem to contain profound truths. It's clearly extraordinary at first glance!"</p><p></p><p>The elderly man was a professor who specialized in studying folklore and the like. </p><p></p><p>He was most skilled at those mystical things.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen many ritual texts, as well as quite a few ancient mythological writings, but none of them... have given me this kind of inexplicable feeling. It's really strange... Could there be some special incense in this room?" the old professor muttered.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know that the immortal technique Qi Yuan had composed contained principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Such an immortal technique, when heard, contemplated, and recited, could make one feel relaxed and carefree.</p><p></p><p>The young researchers also showed curious expressions: "This... is similar to martial arts, equally mystical."</p><p></p><p>With the development of technology, martial arts had also been researched.</p><p></p><p>Many researchers stated that martial arts had no future, being limited by the human body.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts was not as good as getting a gene therapy injection.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't a martial arts technique, is it?" Kuanghuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The young researcher shook his head: "It's not martial arts, but it's... similar to martial arts in some ways."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this similarity was like that between a squid and a mountain bandit.</p><p></p><p>"If you're willing to give us the complete version, we might be able to get more useful information," the male researcher said eagerly. </p><p></p><p>He seemed very interested in this cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"No need," Kuanghuan refused directly.</p><p></p><p>Even these researchers and the old professor here hadn't discovered any issues with this cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>He also felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had a certificate of mental illness.</p><p></p><p>What if it was a made-up technique? If these experts couldn't see any problems and said it was very mystical, then there shouldn't be any major issues.</p><p></p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts became active again, and Qi Yuan's image in his mind became mysterious once more.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a dressing room not far from the cruise ship, Wu Qi looked at herself in the mirror, her eyes showing satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"This makeup is decent. How can those old women who get beauty injections compare to me!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, she deliberately pushed out her chest.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, she gritted her teeth and reached into her dress. A pure white lace-edged underpants was pulled down, stopping at her fair ankles. Her gaze suddenly became determined, and she completely removed it.</p><p></p><p>"Little Qi, come quickly! The big boss!" </p><p></p><p>The manager's voice came, and Wu Qi hurriedly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Coming."</p><p></p><p>She quickly tidied up and hurried out.</p><p></p><p>In the wide corridor outside, there were four tall and beautiful women. Looking at those women, Wu Qi felt a sense of inferiority.</p><p></p><p>Because these women were very familiar to her, most of them were her seniors, and among these four, two were even international stars.</p><p></p><p>These stars had much higher status than her.</p><p></p><p>Her pride and confidence collapsed a bit at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But she still raised her head, her gaze determined. Although these people had better conditions than her, she... had thick skin and could lower herself.</p><p></p><p>The five of them stood together, talking carefully.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, on the upper deck of the cruise ship, a man wearing a uniform showed an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"So many celebrities, did you see... that's Erbin, the female lead in 'Gene Crisis', those long legs, big chest, tsk tsk!" A man stretched his neck to look into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu also opened his eyes wide to look: "Oh, there's even Wu Qi, she's from our school!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu and Qi Yuan were considered high school classmates, and also university classmates.</p><p></p><p>However, in high school, they weren't in the same class.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu also knew about Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>In the office, he had boasted that a senior from their school had become a celebrity, and that he often ran into that senior when riding the school bus.</p><p></p><p>"I really envy these celebrities. The dress they casually wear, I couldn't afford even if I worked half my life," Wang Xu said enviously.</p><p></p><p>Although his job was very decent, and old classmates like Li Yan were very envious, compared to celebrities like Wu Qi, he was far behind.</p><p></p><p>Their living standards and social status were not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi could meet some important people, even the powerful and wealthy, but Wang Xu... couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at their appearance, they should be attending a private party. Damn capitalists, damn second generation!" The man next to Wang Xu had slightly red eyes.</p><p></p><p>The dirty dealings of high society were no secret to the lower classes.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were still people who fanatically chased stars. People always need to find some spiritual sustenance.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu smiled: "Don't be jealous, let's just focus on our work."</p><p></p><p>They came here because there was a batch of sea monsters to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Some of the smuggled sea monsters from last time had entered the Star Sea Gorge.</p><p></p><p>He represented the Maritime Affairs Bureau to come and reclaim them.</p><p></p><p>The contact person on the Star Sea Gorge was also very responsible and gave him some of the sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, more were still left on the Star Sea Gorge.</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Xu knew about this, he didn't have any objections.</p><p></p><p>If the leaders had no objections, what use was there in him having objections?</p><p></p><p>The two of them stole some time from their busy schedule to occasionally peek at the distant celebrities.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their phones had been confiscated on the cruise ship, otherwise they could have taken some photos of the celebrities.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wu Qi naturally didn't know she had been seen by a schoolmate. Now, she wore a coy smile on her face, chatting with these seniors.</p><p></p><p>"The boss who invited us this time is a viscount of the empire, a viscount, um, hereditary."</p><p></p><p>From the words of a senior, Wu Qi also learned about the big boss they were going to accompany.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a nobleman, and hereditary!" Wu Qi's eyes showed admiration.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone could get a title in the Qin Yuan Kingdom, and a hereditary viscount was even more of a noble among nobles. In ancient times, they would have had their own fief.</p><p></p><p>But even in modern times, such hereditary viscounts who went into business would have tax reductions.</p><p></p><p>So, many entrepreneurs or bosses would rely on a nobleman to do business.</p><p></p><p>A hereditary viscount was someone Wu Qi needed to look up to.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a low voice came: "Viscount Kuanghuan has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi and the others quickly looked over. They saw a burly man wearing a black jacket come out. There was a very faint scar on his face, but in the eyes of these celebrities, it looked very flavorful.</p><p></p><p>Behind the viscount were eleven burly men, carrying black wooden boxes in their hands, which attracted the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan walked over, and the busty Erbin quickly went forward to hold his arm.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's eyes hid a trace of delight as he scanned these women dressed up like flowers. His tone was very rough: "I have an esteemed guest. If you serve him well, you won't be short of cash."</p><p></p><p>In front of these people, he didn't bother to hide at all, like an unrestrained nouveau riche, without the connotation and style of nobility.</p><p></p><p>But when facing Qi Yuan, Kuanghuan was particularly cautious and reserved.</p><p></p><p>The female celebrities present lit up, especially Wu Qi. She wanted to know, the esteemed guest of a hereditary viscount, could it be... also a nobleman.</p><p></p><p>That was a nobleman. If she could get close to him, her status and position could change in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qin Yuan Kingdom... was a country ruled by old nobility, and also one of the most powerful countries on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

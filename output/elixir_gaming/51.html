        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lord Yuguogong and Kong Qi leave, Jinli felt a sense of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>She still did not feel suited to be the Empress.</p><p></p><p>If... the Southern Qian matter was resolved, she wanted to leave this place and go to the ancient Qichu tree to see Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>If only...</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty," Qin Niang whispered in Jinli's ear, "is the construction of the Sacrificial Platform in accordance with that person's wishes?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jinli hesitated a bit: "Qin Niang, you just need to follow what I've told you."</p><p></p><p>Qin Niang did not speak further, but a trace of worry flashed in her eyes, for she had seen the design of the Sacrificial Platform.</p><p></p><p>And Lord Yuguogong had seen it too.</p><p></p><p>Qin Niang withdrew and left the palace. She saw Lord Yuguogong standing not far away, leaning on the gray railing.</p><p></p><p>Lord Yuguogong saw Qin Niang and said loudly, "Lady Qin, you must have recognized the content depicted on that drawing."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qin Niang nodded, "This is a Sacrificial Platform. It is rumored that in ancient times, when the Wangxiang Continent was unified, there was a Divine Courtyard that shook the world.</p><p></p><p>Building the Sacrificial Platform can summon the Divine Army to descend.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately... these have now become legends.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Courtyard has long been overthrown, where would the Divine Army come from? Twenty years ago, when Jingzhou Prefecture was besieged by demonic beasts, the Jingzhou Prefect obtained the drawing of the Sacrificial Platform and built it... but the result?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lord Yuguogong could only sigh: "I don't know where Her Majesty obtained this drawing.</p><p></p><p>But... just as hoping for the Sacrificial Platform, hoping that Her Majesty can safely leave the Imperial City, are they not equally hopeless?"</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Lord Yuguogong did not believe that this Sacrificial Platform could truly summon the Divine Army.</p><p></p><p>Qin Niang's expression darkened: "Do our best, and leave the rest to fate!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Build the Sacrificial Platform? Ridiculous!" </p><p></p><p>When Sima Ting heard this news, a mocking expression appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Monarch of the Demon Tribe was holding a drawing in his hand, with a smile in his eyes: "Using the sword of the ancient Divine Courtyard to slay the modern demons, this Empress Jinli is truly adorable."</p><p></p><p>As a member of the Demon Tribe, he was the most familiar with the Divine Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Demon Tribe and the Human Tribe were in fierce competition. Among the Human Tribe, a supreme expert emerged, revered as the Heavenly God, who established the Divine Courtyard and commanded the Four Divisions.</p><p></p><p>By building the Sacrificial Platform, one could summon the Divine Army.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Divine Courtyard had driven the Demon Tribe to the icy and snowy wilderness.</p><p></p><p>These things were all recorded in the ancestral archives of the Demon Tribe.</p><p></p><p>This Demon Monarch knew this best.</p><p></p><p>"Let her build it, it's just a dying struggle," the Monarch of the Heavenly Dao Holy Gate said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarch narrowed his eyes: "The most important thing now is to forge the Supreme Imperial Scepter, other matters can be postponed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, don't forget to help DingtiƒÅn keep an eye on Empress Jinli, don't let her escape!" the thin Monarch of the Heavenly Dao Holy Gate said.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting hurriedly said, "Don't worry, the Imperial Palace has been completely surrounded, Empress Jinli won't be able to escape!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, outside the city, there are seven Demon Monarchs of my Demon Tribe, she won't be able to escape," the Demon Monarch said confidently, holding the winning hand.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Demon Tribe had brought a lot of strength, for the purpose of forging that Supreme Imperial Scepter.</p><p></p><p>Seven Monarchs, plus some Kings, would be enough to refine the entire Imperial City.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the civil and military officials following Sima Ting in the city are still celebrating, thinking they can legitimately usurp the throne.</p><p></p><p>Little do they know, they and the common people in the city are just livestock to be slaughtered by the Demon Tribe.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So tired."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan woke up, feeling exhausted all over.</p><p></p><p>Although he had suppressed the fight against the Ugly Robe Demon Emperor, the toll on his mind and spirit was considerable.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a water mirror appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the reflection in the mirror, his face a little pale, seeming to have consumed a lot.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of being emptied out."</p><p></p><p>"I really want to drink a bottle of Shenbaojiu!"</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, some Liuwei Dihuang Pills?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The consumption in the game was huge, but for Qi Yuan, the improvement was also extremely great.</p><p></p><p>Especially after reaching level 90 in the game, the feedback to the real world made him feel that his cultivation had improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he did not use knives, but relying on the combat skills and various techniques he had honed in the game, he already possessed the battle power of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his improved cultivation, even without using any techniques or skills, Qi Yuan could suppress ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators with just his own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This kind of improvement was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the consumption of spiritual awareness is still too great. Is it because my spiritual soul is too weak?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, cultivators in the Qi Refining stage cannot even sense their own spiritual souls, and it is only after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage that they can perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"After I reach the Foundation Establishment stage, I must cultivate some secret techniques to strengthen my spiritual soul, so that I can stay longer in the game."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan took out the books from his storage bag to read.</p><p></p><p>He was quite diligent.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he looked at the books in the storage bag, he felt a sharp pain in his head.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this was a side effect of staying up late playing games.</p><p></p><p>"I can't read the books anymore, I need to rest well and get a massage." Qi Yuan felt that he really needed to go out and recuperate.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be too ridiculous if he suddenly died.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan slowly left the thatched hut, he saw Jiang Lingsu flipping through something.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu, in a long ice-blue dress, glanced at Qi Yuan and frowned, "Senior brother, have you encountered a problem in your cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I just stayed up late playing games, and my body can't take it.</p><p></p><p>I'm going out to get a massage, and it should be fine. Junior sister, do you want to give me a massage? I'll give you... three spirit stones as a reward."</p><p></p><p>"...Get lost!" Seeing Qi Yuan's flowery words, the concern Jiang Lingsu had just shown was immediately extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chuckled and slowly went down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing his junior sister didn't agree, or else he would have wasted three spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain, a proper massage only cost one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that his junior sister was a wealthy lady, he wouldn't have endured the pain of adding three spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan walked on, Jiang Lingsu looked at her senior brother's retreating figure and felt a little self-reproachful. Was her tone just now a bit too harsh?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan went down the mountain and had a proper, all-natural massage.</p><p></p><p>He also spent one spirit stone to buy a rather rich and nourishing spiritual soup to drink.</p><p></p><p>After a day of relaxation, Qi Yuan finally felt his body getting better.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual soul is still too weak. Unfortunately, the cultivation techniques and spiritual medicines related to the spiritual soul are extremely rare."</p><p></p><p>In the vast library of the Black Mountain Sect, Qi Yuan had not yet found any cultivation techniques related to the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>As for spiritual medicines, there were even fewer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that any spiritual medicines or treasures related to the spiritual soul were highly precious.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that from the Spirit Infant stage to the Purple Palace realm, the requirements for the spiritual soul were very high.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, almost all spiritual medicines or cultivation techniques related to the spiritual soul were monopolized by those ancient Spirit Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Qi Yuan was only in the Qi Refining stage, even Foundation Establishment or Elixir cultivators would find it very difficult to obtain spiritual medicines that could enhance their spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not a big problem. Once I succeed in Foundation Establishment, I'll consider the matter of strengthening my spiritual soul."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could see hidden information. This was the ability he had obtained after entering the game and reaching the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, he would gain some new abilities.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the Seven-Color Peak, ready to continue resting, and once he had recovered, he would re-enter the game.</p><p></p><p>When passing by the large tree halfway up the mountain, Qi Yuan stopped again.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the ground.</p><p></p><p>[This is a somewhat unusual small grass, it has once again sensed the aura of the moon.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sky: "The aura of the moon, what is that?"</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head and looked at the small grass, then said to it, "When I see you tomorrow, will you be able to sense Qi Yuan's aura as well?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to find someone without diabetes and revive this unusual small grass.</p><p></p><p>Then ask it how it went from ordinary to unusual. He also wanted to become unusual.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

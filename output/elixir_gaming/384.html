        <h1>Chapter 384</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun's eyes revealed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand or figure out why... the person before him would cut off his arm.</p><p></p><p>"How could you be so cruel, Ah Qiao!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun was deeply saddened, a tear rolling down his cheek. </p><p></p><p>He felt that his Holy Light Eyes hadn't fully activated yet.</p><p></p><p>"It's because I wasn't trying hard enough, that's why you treat me this way."</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat sobbing, a bit like Daiyu from Dream of the Red Chamber.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was completely speechless: "Bro, give me a break. I'll be honest, I didn't believe a single word you said. Look at how long my nose is? Please, stop talking, my nose is getting too long!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was like a child trapped in an elevator, looking at the burly man next to him who kept having diarrhea, helplessly saying: "Uncle, please stop, I'm scared."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt just as powerless.</p><p></p><p>The boss's prestige in this game had been completely ruined by him.</p><p></p><p>Look at the bosses in other games, each with their own characteristics. The old man who doesn't like bathing in the Wangyue Continent. </p><p></p><p>The enchantress of the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>The father and daughter of the Yang God in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the boss in this game turned out to be a man...</p><p></p><p>And his words were disgustingly creepy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dong Jun's eyes truly changed. He looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "Could it be that my words didn't move you? My story didn't touch you?"</p><p></p><p>For every task in the Shanhai Scroll, for every story, Dong Jun had added many core elements for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Things like filial piety, sacrificing oneself to save the world while losing loved ones, the difficulty of balancing loyalty and righteousness.</p><p></p><p>All these tasks were part of the Ten Thousand Dao Martial God.</p><p></p><p>"What bullshit stories, don't you know that when I play games, I always skip the plot summaries? Just kill, kill, kill, get equipment and level up, that's all!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said rudely.</p><p></p><p>It was the same when he did tasks in the Shanhai Scroll.</p><p></p><p>Moving story backgrounds, the implications of the tasks? That was bullshit!</p><p></p><p>Every time he would just grab the task target and go kill monsters to increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>After killing the demons and monsters and feeling satisfied, he would then find the task target at night to watch some drama, listen to some short videos, and get a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun's eyes changed again, filled with disbelief: "You're clearly at the Heavenly Realm, why don't you believe my words?"</p><p></p><p>The innate divine ability of the Holy Light Clan could not possibly be wrong.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this divine ability that the Holy Light Clan dominated across realms, though of course they were also universally hated, viewed as venomous scorpions.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had actually encountered someone with a lower realm who wouldn't listen to him.</p><p></p><p>His eyes welled up with disbelief: "The innate divine ability of the Holy Light Clan comes from the Ancestor, it absolutely cannot be wrong!"</p><p></p><p>This innate divine ability originated from the powerful Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor was at an unknowable realm.</p><p></p><p>His innate divine ability was an existence even more terrifying than the Great Principle.</p><p></p><p>Throughout all the universes known to the Ancestor, it could be used.</p><p></p><p>The other party was clearly at the Heavenly Realm, a lower realm than his own.</p><p></p><p>How could his innate divine ability not take effect!</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "Is 1+1 equal to 3?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you not finish compulsory education?" Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to respond, and swung his sword fiercely towards Dong Jun's right hand.</p><p></p><p>This time, Dong Jun fled directly, his eyes still filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you? Why are you immune to my innate divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>"I am... your father!" At this moment, a smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes as the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra activated, "But I don't have such a disgusting son!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan never discriminated against sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>But being disgusted like this, he couldn't stand it anymore.</p><p></p><p>A hint of hesitation flashed through Dong Jun's eyes: "Father?"</p><p></p><p>If it was his father, everything would make sense.</p><p></p><p>Being of the same Holy Light Clan, he naturally wouldn't be affected.</p><p></p><p>But in an instant, he reacted and looked at Qi Yuan with surprise: "Your innate divine ability is quite good, with the potential to advance to the Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>I'll give you a chance to follow me.</p><p></p><p>I, Sheng Kongming, am a once-in-a-million-years genius of the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>I'm about to enter the second stage of the Yang God Realm, the Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once I enter it, I can roam freely across all universes, and no living being will be able to stop me.</p><p></p><p>If you follow me, you can enjoy the Great Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Sheng Kongming changed his strategy.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party was immune to his innate divine ability, it meant they might also have some strange and rare bloodline.</p><p></p><p>It certainly couldn't compare to his Holy Light Clan, but it was still rare and uncommon.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "You finally have the appearance of a villain, saying what a villain should say, you scared me to death."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of villains being too strong, he was afraid of villains...</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun wasn't surprised by Qi Yuan's reaction.</p><p></p><p>He said softly: "The world you're in has reached its end.</p><p></p><p>Your talent is very good, top-notch in this world, but being born in such a world is your misfortune.</p><p></p><p>The world has confined you, and in this life, you have no future path.</p><p></p><p>If you follow me, I would even bestow a drop of my bloodline upon you.</p><p></p><p>With the Holy Light Clan's bloodline, plus my bestowment, you might even have a chance to break free from this cage in your lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun said.</p><p></p><p>He had developed an appreciation for talent.</p><p></p><p>If he could recruit Qi Yuan, it would be very beneficial for him.</p><p></p><p>Not only would he gain a subordinate, but if he could analyze the bloodline in Qi Yuan's body, and why he was immune to the "Holy Light Words", he would be able to sweep through his own clan.</p><p></p><p>He might even be able to unify the Holy Light Clan and become the number one person under the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"If your blood is so powerful, why don't I just take it myself?" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you don't know how terrifying the Holy Light Clan is, nor do you know... exactly where the gap between you and me lies?"</p><p></p><p>Divine light surged on Dong Jun's tattered white robe.</p><p></p><p>He was just one step away from the Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, he was merely at the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly fight against him?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... have you finished saying the key information?" Qi Yuan looked at Dong Jun, his expression calm, "If so, then it's time to discuss a real matter.</p><p></p><p>Your Holy Light Clan has plagiarized the name of our Divine Light Sect!</p><p></p><p>So now, on behalf of the Divine Light Sect, I shall execute the plagiarist!"</p><p></p><p>The reason he hadn't directly attacked until now was simple.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary small levels, it's fine to skip the plot summaries.</p><p></p><p>But for big bosses, there's a lot of key information in there.</p><p></p><p>For example, Dong Jun's words about this world's path being cut off, and about the world's confinement.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, very familiar settings, which is normal.</p><p></p><p>Just like how a tailor shop can't produce an aircraft carrier.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had heard the settings, it was time for a big killing spree.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you don't understand at all..."</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk, plagiarist, go to hell!"</p><p></p><p>Powerful blood martial energy spread out.</p><p></p><p>This entire area was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Dao Martial God Realm combined the ten thousand Daos of this world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when Qi Yuan threw a punch at Dong Jun, it was actually the fusion of the ten thousand Daos from the Origin Land, the End Land, and all the worlds in the Shanhai Scroll, transforming into Qi Yuan's Dao, launching a supreme attack against Dong Jun.</p><p></p><p>Such an attack contained the rules of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to shatter worlds.</p><p></p><p>"In the Yang God Realm, the gap between each small realm is like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>I have already glimpsed the Principle Realm, you absolutely cannot harm me!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun reached out his hand, and his form seemed to merge with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He easily dodged Qi Yuan's terrifying attack.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Dong Jun and attacked again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't use the power of the Ten Thousand Dao Martial God, but the power of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>His Immortal Dao path was stronger than the Ten Thousand Dao Martial God!</p><p></p><p>"I've seen you swallow stars whole, standing at the peak of the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>But without glimpsing the Principle, that's not worth mentioning!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was some concealment in Dong Jun's words.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan's four thousand divine infants all came out and surrounded Dong Jun to attack.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun was strong, but he couldn't withstand being surrounded.</p><p></p><p>But what Dong Jun feared least was being surrounded.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would just move his lips, and all the divine infants would become his own assistance.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on just yourself, you cannot defeat me, unless... you let them gang up on me!" Dong Jun said leisurely, full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>He was already in an invincible position.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan called out those helpers, he had the Holy Light Words.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't call them out, he would win completely.</p><p></p><p>The powerful attacks collided.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun's form only staggered slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a member of the Holy Light Clan who had glimpsed the Principle Realm, he could almost sweep through this world.</p><p></p><p>Even facing the Great Principle Realm, he was confident he could slowly wear them down.</p><p></p><p>So, facing Qi Yuan, a small Heavenly Realm Yang God whose divine power far surpassed a "Great Heavenly Realm", he stood in an invincible position.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I really need to use my ultimate move!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Dong Jun, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"A boss is a boss, can't be killed without using ultimate moves!"</p><p></p><p>"What other tricks do you have? Those helpers? Do they dare to come out?" Dong Jun couldn't wait for Qi Yuan to call out those helpers.</p><p></p><p>"They don't need to come out, they are already one with me." Qi Yuan's expression became solemn, he stood in the void wearing a blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, an ominous premonition flashed through Dong Jun's heart.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, since he had already glimpsed the Principle Realm, it was impossible for him to lose.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, he</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened. Behind Qi Yuan, suddenly a mysterious aura began to flow.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like chaos, or primordial qi, or the purple qi of immortality. </p><p></p><p>That energy was nameless, formless, inaudible, and unobservable.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious energy instantly transformed into three indescribable, unseeable, unthinkable things.</p><p></p><p>"This... an aura even more terrifying than the Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun gritted his teeth. He was truly anxious and afraid now.</p><p></p><p>For him, a member of the Holy Light Clan, the Ancestor was the most powerful being in all the worlds.</p><p></p><p>But now, the indescribable things formed from the energy behind Qi Yuan were each more mysterious and unknown than his Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"One energy transforms into Three Pure Ones, the Three Pure Ones transform into me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The three divine Pure Ones behind him also spoke simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The gap in realms was like that between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Is all power illusory? No, it's just that the power is too small! As the saying goes, one force can overcome ten skills.</p><p></p><p>If one punch could shatter the stars and galaxies, destroy the universe, pierce the known, erase the unknown, cut through the unknowable, suppress all things in the myriad worlds, and crush even the void into nonexistence!</p><p></p><p>Then what use would higher realms be?</p><p></p><p>His Yang Spirit power alone was not enough, so... what about one thousand, three thousand, four thousand?</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to transform all his divine infants into human form and summon them.</p><p></p><p>Because they were already him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was simply using his own power!</p><p></p><p>"Glorious Yang, infants suppressing divine treasures, heed my command, execute Dong Jun!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, four thousand divine infants resonated together, like the true sound of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Jade Emperor of Qinghua receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>"Southern Emperor of Longevity receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>"True Lord of Wondrous Dao and Pure Origin receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>"Gatling Bodhisattva receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>"Sun Star Lord receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>Vast voices rang out in Qi Yuan's divine repository.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they held nothing back, pouring all their power into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan felt himself become powerful to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Ethics, rules, morality - it seemed he could shatter them all with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>This was true power!</p><p></p><p>"So, my myriad Daos were never myriad Daos, but killing!"</p><p></p><p>Four thousand divine infants resonated together. Behind Qi Yuan, terrifying phantom figures appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>These phantoms all threw punches! All their fists merged into Qi Yuan's single punch at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fire, fate, fortune, the starry sky... countless rules all transformed into Qi Yuan's one punch in this instant.</p><p></p><p>"Can such a punch suppress and kill you!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>An unmatched, unstoppable punch that was the myriad Daos yet not Dao came striking.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun's face twisted in rage, endless regret welling up in his heart: "How can such a monster exist? Three million years... Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>Three million years of scheming, now all for nothing.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>But against that tyrannical, overbearing punch, he had no ability to resist whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>That punch could shatter all worldly things within the Mountain and Sea Scroll.</p><p></p><p>This punch could destroy schemes and plots, crush human calculations.</p><p></p><p>This punch could also break the myriad Daos and overturn the rules.</p><p></p><p>Not ultimate truth, yet surpassing ultimate truth.</p><p></p><p>"Like this... you can never enter the Realm of Ultimate Truth!" Dong Jun let out a final howl.</p><p></p><p>His power that had just glimpsed ultimate truth was utterly unable to withstand this kind of punch.</p><p></p><p>Scheming for a million years, plotting with the Brush of Mountains and Rivers, hiding in dark corners - Dong Jun finally fell in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the empty space before him, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, real men should throw punches!"</p><p></p><p>With his words, the countless phantom images on his body vanished.</p><p></p><p>He transformed back into a man wearing a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he inexplicably felt a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Killing Dong Jun meant little to him.</p><p></p><p>It only made him more certain of his own Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he looked ahead, his gaze surging: "Root demons?"</p><p></p><p>The colors ahead were root demons, the same ones that had entangled Dong Jun for a million years.</p><p></p><p>Even Dong Jun had been cautious when facing these root demons.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan stepped into this sea of root demons.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that something was still waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>He entered the sea of root demons.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan had expected, those terrifying root demons did not attack him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew this was related to his innate divine ability, the Heart Demon Attraction of the Void Realm Ruler.</p><p></p><p>He went deeper into the sea of root demons.</p><p></p><p>All the root demons treated Qi Yuan as one of their own and did not attack him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wandered safely through the sea.</p><p></p><p>Countless root demons stirred his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Joy, killing intent, pain...</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, suddenly an unfamiliar voice abruptly sounded by his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan whirled around to see a mass of black.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, black silk.</p><p></p><p>More precisely, a woman with her head covered by black silk.</p><p></p><p>"Wang... Yuanyu." Qi Yuan was surprised, yet not surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Startled you, didn't I?" A look of pride appeared in the woman's eyes as the black silk covering her head vanished, revealing a face... that was hard to describe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to see Doctor Zhong Niao, and also Wang Yuanyu, and also Lu Zhu, and many other women.</p><p></p><p>"As expected." Qi Yuan stretched lazily. "You're that featherless bird from the game's opening, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>The game icon for this world was a bloody bird.</p><p></p><p>That bird had no feathers at all, just bloody flesh.</p><p></p><p>The fall of the Primordial Seed was related to this bird.</p><p></p><p>"They are my feathers." The woman spoke, her voice indescribable.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, a medical record appeared in her hand out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan and said softly: "Your mental illness isn't fake."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless: "Your kidney deficiency is the real thing."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have kidney deficiency, this is just a tribulation for breaking through above Ultimate Truth." A complex look appeared in the woman's eyes. "And Dong Jun was just one part of the tribulation.</p><p></p><p>In your words, he was a game setting, and I am both the designer and a player.</p><p></p><p>The world itself is a game."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan looked at the woman.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that you would be the biggest gain this time.</p><p></p><p>Originally, I wanted to use Dong Jun's words of Holy Light to comprehend the true myriad Daos, to experience what I had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>When I finished undergoing tribulation here, I could raise this realm and return home."</p><p></p><p>When mentioning home, an intense longing appeared in the woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>For such a powerful being to show this emotion was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"But you gave me a small inspiration." The woman looked at Qi Yuan. "The myriad Daos... are all illusory."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't say that, don't practice yourself out of existence." Qi Yuan looked at the woman, thinking she was the one with mental illness.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't steal your... storyline." The woman smiled gently, longing appearing in her expression again. "This realm originally fell from my homeland. I once wanted to raise the entire realm to return.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems this realm... is no longer my native land. I should find the way home alone."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the woman and politely said: "Have a safe journey."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the woman suddenly smiled mysteriously: "Isn't it interesting how the game setting changed from a romance drama to schemes and plots?"</p><p></p><p>The romance drama was the love story between Dong Jun and his dao partner.</p><p></p><p>The schemes and plots were Dong Jun's machinations against the woman who was breaking through and undergoing tribulation as root demons proliferated.</p><p></p><p>"But in reality, who can know if it's really a romance drama or not?</p><p></p><p>What Dong Jun said may not necessarily be false.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it happened in the past, or is happening now, or will happen in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Stop with the riddles." Qi Yuan was exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Why did all these powerful beings have to act so mysterious, always speaking in riddles?</p><p></p><p>He preferred directness - if you want to eat a steamed bun, just eat it.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, I'll be waiting for you above Ultimate Truth." The woman finished speaking and her form vanished.</p><p></p><p>The sea of root demons and the countless root demons also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a game prompt sounded:</p><p></p><p>[Quest Complete: Obtained one Brush of Mountains and Rivers.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flowed on, years passed.</p><p></p><p>In a towering skyscraper, a slender robot entered the ruins via elevator.</p><p></p><p>Within the ruins were broken spaceships, fallen metal objects, scattered rules and data.</p><p></p><p>It clutched a marriage certificate tightly in its hand, its face expressionless.</p><p></p><p>But then, as if thinking of something, a hint of human emotion finally welled up in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the myriad Daos are zeros and ones..."</p><p></p><p>Its voice carried endless thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Recommending a book, the author is a tall domineering beauty, the kind Han Xianyun likes, Meng Jin Chunqiu!</p><p></p><p>Book title: "Past Life Comes True, I Have Countless Mysterious Identities!"</p><p></p><p>Monster hunter, demon catcher, immortal...</p><p></p><p>Creating countless glorious identities through repeated reincarnations, and all of these are real!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 277</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A spacious palace, shrouded in dense formations, with a very strong concealed aura.</p><p></p><p>Even the Yin Spirit Great Venerable did not know what was happening inside the palace, nor could they detect the aura within.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's expression was solemn as he waved the jade slip in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He murmured:</p><p></p><p>"Glorious yang, infants emerge from divine storage, heed my command, assist the spirit girl!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, terrifying auras began to spread one by one.</p><p></p><p>"We obey!"</p><p></p><p>"We heed our master's command!"</p><p></p><p>4,750 divine infants emerged at this moment.</p><p></p><p>If these terrifying auras were to leak out, it would likely shock the entire Cang Lan Realm. </p><p></p><p>Even the Tai Huang Palace behind the great calamity would probably immediately dispatch Yang Spirits to descend and execute Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, revealing a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go register an account and give my junior sister some support."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually ordered.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, these divine infants followed Qi Yuan's instructions and supported Jiang Lingsu's spirit flower gathering.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the divine infants before him, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, the Tiankun Ancient Mirror is still somewhat useful, their condition is a bit better.</p><p></p><p>But it's likely still far from fully awakening and regaining all their memories," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when they'll be able to fully awaken, recover their past memories, and even cultivate on their own."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>These divine infants had great potential.</p><p></p><p>Each one could directly point to becoming a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>But for now they were still in deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully the next world will be more powerful, where I can find some treasures to awaken them all.</p><p></p><p>If so, in the face of the great calamity, will he be the only one to call for help? With 4,000 Yang Spirits taking action, they won't be able to kill them."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan had the divine infants finish liking Jiang Lingsu's posts before returning to his body.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the terrifying auras disappear.</p><p></p><p>About half an incense stick of time passed before a familiar figure entered the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"Great Wisdom True Lord, long time no see." Seeing the arrival, Qi Yuan was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord was his good friend and had helped him considerably.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, Great Wisdom True Lord's eyes also revealed joy as he casually sat down: "You've become a divine infant?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm quite perplexed about the path of the Purple Palace, so I wanted to borrow your brain for a bit," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the teachings Qi Yuan had encountered from those Yin Spirit powerhouses were not as enlightening as hearing a few words from Great Wisdom True Lord, a divine infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"The path of the Purple Palace... is indeed difficult to walk." Great Wisdom's gaze became wise. "Do you remember what I once told you, that the divine infant is the foundation of the Yin Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "What you said was very correct, both realms have the word 'spirit' in them, clearly showing these two realms are related."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Great Wisdom True Lord had speculated that the Primordial Spirit was the metamorphosis of the divine infant, so the divine infant was the foundation of the Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Since the divine infant is the foundation of the Yin Spirit, according to normal people's understanding, isn't the Purple Palace the foundation of the Yang Spirit?" Great Wisdom True Lord said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This logic made sense.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit was one level higher than the Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace was one level higher than the divine infant.</p><p></p><p>No problem.</p><p></p><p>"But according to your theory, shouldn't the divine infant and Yang Spirit also be related?" Qi Yuan asked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, this is just my bold speculation," Great Wisdom True Lord coughed a bit awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Isn't cultivation like this?</p><p></p><p>Make bold speculations, then bravely go do it.</p><p></p><p>If successful, you're amazing.</p><p></p><p>If you fail, try again in the next life!</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense, I was being too conservative," Qi Yuan felt he had learned something again.</p><p></p><p>His wisdom was inferior to Great Wisdom True Lord's, as he didn't dare to make wild speculations and preferred to act based on reality.</p><p></p><p>He was still far from Great Wisdom True Lord's level!</p><p></p><p>"So to understand the Purple Palace, you must first understand the Yang Spirit!" Great Wisdom True Lord said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>These words made Qi Yuan pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord's words had a sense of the son resembling the father.</p><p></p><p>"You know about the Yang Spirit realm?" Qi Yuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Among all the powerful figures he knew, except for Blood Yang Great Saint and his daughter whom he had killed, no one else was clear about the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>How did Great Wisdom True Lord, a divine infant, know? Indeed, divine infants who make bold speculations are impressive.</p><p></p><p>"I once saw a book in a dream that recorded the path of the Yang Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me quickly!" Qi Yuan was also very curious about the path of the Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"The Yang Spirit realm has five levels in total, but I only saw two of them.</p><p></p><p>These two levels are the Heavenly Position realm and the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>My personal understanding of the Heavenly Position realm is mastering one rule.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, mastering fire, or mastering water, or mastering fate.</p><p></p><p>And based on the level of understanding of the rules, the Heavenly Position realm is further divided into Lesser Heavenly Position and Greater Heavenly Position."</p><p></p><p>"This is somewhat similar to divine duties," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerables possessed divine domains.</p><p></p><p>The things within divine domains were actually somewhat similar to the embryonic form of rules.</p><p></p><p>And most of the deities in the deity visualization method Qi Yuan had contemplated possessed divine duties.</p><p></p><p>Were these divine duties... rules?</p><p></p><p>"Above the Heavenly Position realm is the Ultimate Principle realm, which is the second level of the Yang Spirit," Great Wisdom True Lord continued. "Remember when you and I once went to the Wangyue Continent together, weren't the rules of the Wangyue Continent different from the Cang Lan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"With different world rules, even if a Yang Spirit enters, their power will drop by a major level."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"For example, if a minor celestial realm Yang Spirit enters an unfamiliar world, their power may only be at the mythical level," said Qi Yuan with a nod.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this was a protective mechanism of the world.</p><p></p><p>"However, Yang Spirits who have reached the Ultimate Principle realm are not restricted in this way. </p><p></p><p>Because their rules have become ultimate principles, applicable across all realms.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Principle realm is further divided into minor and major levels.</p><p></p><p>If a Yang Spirit of the minor Ultimate Principle realm rashly enters another world, their power would only decrease by one small level, becoming a major celestial realm Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>A Yang Spirit of the major Ultimate Principle realm can fully retain their power."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many of Qi Yuan's doubts were resolved.</p><p></p><p>He had a genuine sense that the rules of each world were different.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether it was the techniques of the Wangyue Continent, the Mortal Heart Realm, or the Flowing Wind Realm, none were of use to him.</p><p></p><p>This was because his realm was too low.</p><p></p><p>If he were to master the Ultimate Principle, his rules would be applicable in any world.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean he could freely use techniques from other worlds to perfect his "Qi Yuan Scripture"?</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, another doubt arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If I master the Ultimate Principle, would it be universally applicable in other universes?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Principle only applied to worlds.</p><p></p><p>For instance, all the worlds under the same stars.</p><p></p><p>But what about other universes? Like the universe where his Golden Core of the Fixed Star was located, which was clearly different from the universe of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Universe... what's that?" Grand Wisdom True Lord looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>He had no concept of universes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan understood the answer.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Ultimate Principle realm was only applicable to worlds within the same universe.</p><p></p><p>If one changed universes, the Ultimate Principle would likely be ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Just as the rules differed between worlds, they also differed between universes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan didn't respond, Grand Wisdom True Lord continued: "I believe the rules and principles of the Yang Spirit realm are extensions of the Origin Divine Ability!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to progress to the Purple Palace realm, one must first conceive of a suitable Origin Divine Ability."</p><p></p><p>"What if I already have an Origin Divine Ability?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He had two Origin Divine Abilities: one was the Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Attraction; the other was the Great Forgetting Heart Scripture.</p><p></p><p>"You already have one?" Grand Wisdom True Lord's eyes lit up. "Then use your Origin Divine Ability to create your own cave dwelling! The Purple Palace is just a cultivator's cave dwelling, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"...What you're saying seems to make some sense," Qi Yuan said uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was also hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, Qi Yuan's eyes changed subtly.</p><p></p><p>In the previously quiet hall, the shadowy outline of a door suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that door, a look of surprise flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "The Door of Myriad Differences!"</p><p></p><p>The door before him was very similar to the Door of Myriad Differences he had seen in the Flowing Wind Realm, yet somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sharp bird cry rang out.</p><p></p><p>This bird cry was extremely piercing, like metal scraping across a blackboard. Anyone who heard it would feel a sense of madness.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Stone Rulan's eyes were full of joy, her body extremely weak: "The Chaos Filth Bird has appeared, haha! Even if the Blood-Robed Sword God is at the mythical level, he will fall into madness! The Azure Waves Realm is saved!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Rushan looked at his sister with pity, his face also extremely pale.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God will soon fall into madness, we need to leave quickly," Stone Rushan sighed lightly. "Now that we've completed our mission, with only ten years of lifespan left, we should live for ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Stone Rulan nodded, her eyes filled with fanaticism and satisfaction: "We are the saviors of the world!"</p><p></p><p>This sense of satisfaction gave her a feeling a thousand, ten thousand times more intense than any climax.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see him fall into madness with my own eyes!" Stone Rulan said seriously, her legs tightening.</p><p></p><p>Stone Rushan nodded, his expression reverent: "The trajectory of fate cannot be changed!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the Chaos Filth Bird flapped its wings. Any living being who heard its cry or saw its appearance would go mad and become confused.</p><p></p><p>Grand Wisdom True Lord looked at the strange-looking bird with an odd expression: "Are you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rubbed his stomach: "A little bit."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't have an owner, right?" Grand Wisdom True Lord asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt a bit strange today.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had been particular about his food, demanding color, aroma, and taste.</p><p></p><p>But looking at this messy, scrawny bird before him, he actually felt an appetite.</p><p></p><p>This was very strange.</p><p></p><p>"You want to eat it?" Qi Yuan looked at the Chaos Filth Bird and gave it a slap.</p><p></p><p>The skinny bird made a mad sound, its face contorted.</p><p></p><p>It struggled constantly, but Qi Yuan didn't give it a chance to struggle, directly plucking off all its feathers.</p><p></p><p>A flame appeared between Qi Yuan's fingers.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Chaos Filth Bird became a roasted bird.</p><p></p><p>The smell it gave off was enough to drive people mad just by smelling it.</p><p></p><p>However, both Grand Wisdom True Lord and Qi Yuan inexplicably felt an appetite.</p><p></p><p>"There's so little meat, not even enough to fill a tooth gap. How about I give you a spirit stone, and I'll eat this bird?" Qi Yuan said tentatively.</p><p></p><p>After all, it wasn't good for one person to eat alone when two people discovered the bird together.</p><p></p><p>Grand Wisdom True Lord hesitated for a moment, his face full of uneasiness and reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he had quite an appetite and was very hungry.</p><p></p><p>But he was a particular person.</p><p></p><p>This bird was overcooked!</p><p></p><p>"You eat it, I won't. It's not good when it's overcooked," Grand Wisdom True Lord turned his head away, forcing himself not to look at the bird.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

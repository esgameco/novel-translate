        <h1>Chapter 292</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This shot will kill even a god."</p><p></p><p>As a sniper employed by the Black Crystal Earl's family, the man in the black coat was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>His marksmanship was beyond doubt, and most importantly, the distance wasn't very far.</p><p></p><p>This sniper shot was enough to end the target's life.</p><p></p><p>Next to the man in the black coat stood a young woman with an ordinary appearance. Her face bore an arrogant and domineering confidence.</p><p></p><p>"It's good if he dies. Such trash doesn't even qualify to be my partner. It's better to kill him."</p><p></p><p>The ordinary-looking woman was named Wang Wei, just a regular company employee. </p><p></p><p>In the future, without any special skills, she would become unemployed and eventually have no choice but to become a nanny.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in online loans, with an irritable personality, she would become a nanny for a moderately wealthy family, specifically to take care of an infant. Annoyed by the baby's crying, she would often drug the baby and abuse it, eventually causing its death due to careless handling.</p><p></p><p>She would then be arrested and imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>Originally, her life was incredibly dark and hopeless, but fate played a joke on her - the world restarted, and she returned to ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>Back ten years, she considered herself the darling of the world.</p><p></p><p>With her memories of the past, instead of first cooperating with the Seven Star Martial families, she chose to cooperate with a local power.</p><p></p><p>The family she partnered with was the Black Crystal Earl's family.</p><p></p><p>Through her memories of her past life, she successfully gained the trust of the Black Crystal Earl's family.</p><p></p><p>She also knew that there was another restarter in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>Since they were both from Tianyue City, she knew quite a lot about this other restarter.</p><p></p><p>She knew that person would die a year later in the future.</p><p></p><p>So, she thought, perhaps that person didn't have memories of the world restarting at all.</p><p></p><p>Being selfish as always, she felt that Tianyue City should only have one restarter, and only she was truly destined.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, she developed murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>In her opinion, the fewer special people like her, the better.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan would die a year later, without ten years of memories, which Wang Wei found contemptible.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, and you might qualify to enter the Seven Star Martial in the future," Wang Wei made grand promises to the sniper.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the black-clad sniper's expression suddenly tightened: "What's going on? He's not dead!"</p><p></p><p>Through his scope, he clearly saw Qi Yuan getting out of the car.</p><p></p><p>This was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>That was the king of snipers, he had seen the bullet pierce through the car window with his own eyes. Even if Qi Yuan was wearing a bulletproof vest, he should have died for sure.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wei was also stunned for a moment, then squeezed out a smile: "It seems he's about to have a stroke of luck."</p><p></p><p>The unexpected turn of events didn't mean much to her.</p><p></p><p>She had prepared many plans to hunt down Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the stroke of luck... it was truly a stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, on the highway, a large Dayun brand truck suddenly accelerated, making a screeching sound as it charged madly towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Dayun heavy truck seemed to lose control, its speed suddenly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful impact could even flatten a small car, let alone an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>On the road, the ordinarily dressed driver had a crazed look in his eyes, with a hint of pitying smile as he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In a nearby car, a male driver slammed on the brakes, his eyes filled with terror: "Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>He saw the large truck heading straight for Qi Yuan and couldn't help but close his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, when he opened his eyes, the scene he had imagined didn't occur.</p><p></p><p>The large truck seemed to have hit an invisible wall, flipping over once in the air before crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The young man who had been in front of it had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Call the police quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, the male driver called the police.</p><p></p><p>He also quickly got out of his car to see what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Kuanghan stared at the overturned truck with wide eyes: "This... is like a human tank!"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't see clearly how Qi Yuan acted, the fact that the accelerating heavy truck flipped over on the spot defied science.</p><p></p><p>If this was caused by Qi Yuan, then Qi Yuan was like a human tank in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Such strength, even at the border, would be enough to destroy a squad of gene soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that's assuming they don't encounter high-precision weapons.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the smile on Wang Wei's face on the rooftop froze: "What's going on? The truck flipped?"</p><p></p><p>The distance was too far, and she couldn't see clearly what had happened.</p><p></p><p>She tried to contact the truck driver through the communicator, but there was only silence on the other end.</p><p></p><p>"Did he flip it over? Has he taken high-quality gene enhancement drugs?" Wang Wei's face showed a hint of panic.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible. High-grade gene drugs are strictly monitored, he wouldn't have access to them. It must have been an accident, the truck must have tipped over!" The black-clad sniper made his judgment.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Wei felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she was reflecting on her behavior. As a chosen one, she should have maintained composure even if mountains crumbled before her.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?" Wang Wei looked through binoculars at the overturned truck, but couldn't find any trace of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"He... must have escaped in the chaos. Don't worry, I'll report to the higher-ups. He won't be able to escape from Tianyue City!" </p><p></p><p>The black-clad sniper picked up his communicator to contact the other members of the Black Crystal family.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wei looked at the truck, a smile appearing in her eyes: "He's lucky."</p><p></p><p>In her heart, she vaguely felt that the other person might be a restarter like her, favored by the world's destiny, and thus difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she felt both smug and troubled.</p><p></p><p>"He's only half a restarter at best, how could he escape from my grasp?" With this thought, Wang Wei regained her confidence.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed, and the black-clad sniper spoke, his face showing a trace of annoyance: "Miss Wang Wei, Zhao Shiqi has ordered us to return immediately and give him an explanation."</p><p></p><p>The Black Crystal Earl's family was not a monolith, and not everyone supported cooperating with Wang Wei.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shiqi represented another faction, always remaining wary of Wang Wei.</p><p></p><p>This assassination attempt was carried out behind Zhao Shiqi's back.</p><p></p><p>Now that the operation had begun, Zhao Shiqi found out and was berating the black-clad sniper over the phone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it seems he's become senile," Wang Wei's eyes flashed with murderous intent. "Don't mind him. The Black Crystal family is no longer under his control now."</p><p></p><p>She had long been dissatisfied with Zhao Shiqi.</p><p></p><p>She had been planning to deal with Zhao Shiqi once she achieved her goals using the Black Crystal family's power.</p><p></p><p>Receiving Wang Wei's order, the black-clad sniper nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give orders now for the police to summon Qi Yuan for questioning."</p><p></p><p>The law is a tool of the ruling class, and those who maintain order are just the lapdogs of the nobility.</p><p></p><p>This world hasn't become more civilized or eliminated class differences with technological advancement; instead, it has become more restrictive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the black-clad sniper's words, Wang Wei's self-satisfied expression grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The nobles she once feared like tigers and scorpions, as well as the police, were now mere pawns in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This feeling of controlling others' fates was exhilarating.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we should head back now, just wait for..." Wang Wei's voice cut off abruptly, because right in front of her, a familiar figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Her heart skipped a beat involuntarily, but she quickly regained her composure. She started clapping, as if applauding the newcomer: "Interesting, you actually managed to find this place. Could it be that I have a mole here who leaked the information to Zhao Shiqi, and Zhao Shiqi then told you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many thoughts were racing through Wang Wei's mind, and she quickly deduced the most likely possibility. </p><p></p><p>If not for this, how could a useless ordinary person like Qi Yuan, only half a Restarter, find this place and have such confidence? "It seems you've been in contact with Zhao Shiqi for a while, and even obtained advanced gene drugs."</p><p></p><p>Wang Wei looked at Qi Yuan, her heart calm, as if everything was under control.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Wang Wei, his eyes revealing a strange expression: "Are you sick? Sending people to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"Do I need a reason to kill you?" Wang Wei faced Qi Yuan with confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, trying to act tough?" Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This woman before him was not only overconfident, but also pretentious.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wei didn't show much emotional fluctuation due to Qi Yuan's words, but said: "As half my kind, I'll let you die knowing why. I'm killing you... because I am... a Restarter!"</p><p></p><p>"So Restarters can just kill people now? Restarters are above the law?" Qi Yuan was furious.</p><p></p><p>Why were there always such chaotic and evil people in this world?</p><p></p><p>If the world was full of law-abiding and kind people like him, it would surely be a better place.</p><p></p><p>Shootings like this certainly wouldn't exist.</p><p></p><p>Even if people had grudges, at most they would just kill the whole family, not involving innocent bystanders.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you only have a year's worth of memories, you have no idea... what the future is like!" Wang Wei's eyes revealed a look of longing and anticipation, along with a hint of ferocity.</p><p></p><p>"What the future is like has nothing to do with you, because... you have no future." Qi Yuan decided to crack down on evil.</p><p></p><p>This trend of killing people on the streets couldn't be allowed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, killing an innocent, naive, law-abiding citizen like him was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Just because you've taken advanced gene drugs, you've become overconfident sitting in your well? You have no idea what you're really facing!" Wang Wei's expression became somewhat ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Then do you know... what you're facing?" Qi Yuan's expression became solemn at this moment, his whole demeanor suddenly appearing extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wei was stunned for a moment, and asked instinctively: "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, it's me - someone with a mental illness certificate, pretending to be mentally ill!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan took out his mental illness certificate, showing it off to Wang Wei.</p><p></p><p>"With this certificate, even if I kill you, I won't bear any legal responsibility." Qi Yuan puffed out his chest, full of confidence, his eyes carrying killing intent, "Now... I can kill you at will."</p><p></p><p>"You... haha, you really are sick." Wang Wei looked at Qi Yuan, unable to hold back her laughter, "You have no idea what kind of world the future will be! Dying by my hand will be the greatest honor of your life!"</p><p></p><p>In Wang Wei's hand, a blood-red pearl suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>When she took out the pearl, Wang Wei's eyes were filled with fascination.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad sniper beside her also revealed a hint of fear in his eyes, seemingly terrified of this pearl.</p><p></p><p>"It will be your nightmare!" Wang Wei laughed triumphantly.</p><p></p><p>In the next ten years, Arch Star would undergo great changes.</p><p></p><p>The biggest change would be that five years later, several spatial rifts would appear on Arch Star.</p><p></p><p>These spatial rifts were connected to the legendary Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that those immortals were incredibly powerful, able to cut through tanks with a single sword strike. Even the strongest gene warriors couldn't last more than a few rounds against those immortals.</p><p></p><p>The immortals' strongest techniques were various magical treasures, mysterious and unpredictable!</p><p></p><p>This red pearl was a remnant immortal treasure.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wei used her memories to gain an advantage, obtaining this immortal treasure and activating it.</p><p></p><p>This was her greatest asset besides her memories from ten years in the future.</p><p></p><p>Holding the red pearl, she seemed to have transformed into an immortal herself, looking down on everyone from above.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, a frog in a well has no idea what it's facing!"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her face full of disdain and pity.</p><p></p><p>"Is this all you're relying on?" Qi Yuan looked at Wang Wei, quite helplessly, "A... mid-level Qi Condensation stage artifact, and you treat it like a treasure?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Wang Wei and casually waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, that supposedly indestructible red pearl shattered into mist.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of spiritual energy dispersed in the air, and Qi Yuan took a deep breath: "It contains less spiritual energy than I release in a burp, no, I don't burp!"</p><p></p><p>The expression on Wang Wei's face froze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't believe that the Xunluo Curse Pearl... had just shattered like that!</p><p></p><p>"You... how do you know about spiritual energy? Weren't you supposed to die a year later?" Wang Wei was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rifts would appear five years later, and the legends of the immortal way would gradually descend upon this world.</p><p></p><p>Due to Canxing's obstruction, the descent of the immortal way was particularly difficult and slow.</p><p></p><p>But Wang Wei clearly remembered that there was no immortal way in this world a year later!</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan know about spiritual energy, and how could he have shattered her artifact?</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that her artifact... even ten years later, those world-class geniuses on Arch Star who had accepted the immortal way couldn't easily deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"Want to know? Too bad I have a mental illness certificate, I won't tell a dead person!" Qi Yuan looked at Wang Wei and attacked directly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, gunshots also rang out from the side.</p><p></p><p>The silent black-clad sniper finally found an opportunity to fire.</p><p></p><p>However, unfortunately, his efforts were destined to be in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, your gun misfired and blew off this overconfident woman's head."</p><p></p><p>The previously arrogant and overconfident Wang Wei couldn't laugh anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because her head had exploded, just like a shattered watermelon.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene would make ordinary people feel physically uncomfortable and then vomit.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a bright smile, his gaze falling on the black-clad sniper.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad sniper's eyes widened, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>He had clearly... aimed at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could he miss at such a close range? He felt like his compulsory education had all gone to waste.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of a finger snap was heard.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad sniper's consciousness became blurry, and his body went limp as he died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I have a mental illness certificate, otherwise killing three people would be against the law," Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Wang Wei's corpse, his gaze becoming profound.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that after killing Wang Wei, there seemed to be an imperceptible change deep inside his body.</p><p></p><p>His connection with this world seemed to have deepened again.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... raising poison insects?" </p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan imagined a scenario of raising poison insects.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a group of Restarters, having them kill each other, and the sole survivor would receive a huge reward.</p><p></p><p>After killing Wang Wei, Qi Yuan felt that his "luck" had strengthened a bit in some mysterious way.</p><p></p><p>"Is this intentional... or coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is a Demonic Tribulation!" </p><p></p><p>The terrifying Demonic Tribulation was easily resolved by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The profound meaning contained within this is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Does this not mean...</p><p></p><p>Among the Six Heavens, aside from the Supremes, who does not fear the Demonic Tribulation and view it as a venomous scorpion?</p><p></p><p>And if they were to find out that Qi Yuan could resolve the Demonic Tribulation, one can hardly imagine what would happen.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly did you resolve it?" Zi Yuan Zu asked, his heart secretly worried for Qi Yuan. </p><p></p><p>He feared that Qi Yuan had paid a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>Especially... had he consumed the Demonic Tribulation?</p><p></p><p>This was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>According to ancient records, the Demonic Tribulation is an exceptionally terrifying entity. </p><p></p><p>It exists not only in this world, but in other universes as well.</p><p></p><p>Even the Supremes appear insignificant in the eyes of the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"I just drew my sword, used my primal divine abilities, and directly consumed it," Qi Yuan shrugged. "Don't worry, there was no danger."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan would never do anything he wasn't confident about.</p><p></p><p>His brow can discern auspiciousness and avoid calamity.</p><p></p><p>When he consumed the Demonic Tribulation, his right eyebrow did not twitch, and based on other considerations, that's why he consumed it.</p><p></p><p>In formulating his grand plan to exile the Great Day to a universe without a master, Qi Yuan naturally utilized his own supernormal abilities, concluding that it would not bring any disaster.</p><p></p><p>He certainly would not place the Golden Canary and Ning Tao in danger.</p><p></p><p>As for what extraordinary encounters the Great Day may have in that universe... that's just wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu looked deeply at Qi Yuan, thought of something, and said, "Revealing the existence of the Door of Profundity, you must be careful of those Supremes."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu's concern was not without reason.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Profundity is enough to captivate the Supremes.</p><p></p><p>The Supremes are still alive, and since they are alive, they have desires.</p><p></p><p>If the Supremes were to make a move, would Qi Yuan be able to resist?</p><p></p><p>"However, they should not dare to attack you now, because they do not know what happened to the Great Day. </p><p></p><p>Do not tell anyone, not even me, what you did to the Great Day.</p><p></p><p>The abilities of the Supremes are too mysterious and unpredictable. Any information that leaks out in this world may be captured by them."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu warned.</p><p></p><p>After weathering this Demonic Tribulation, his strength had risen to a new level.</p><p></p><p>But the stronger one becomes, the more one knows the terror of the Supremes.</p><p></p><p>The Six Heavens have no future.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial God Second Layer is the limit of the Six Heavens, but not the limit of the Supremes.</p><p></p><p>The Supremes only have the Celestial God Second Layer because the Six Heavens can only produce the Celestial God Second Layer.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Six Heavens expand to Seven Heavens, or even Nine Heavens, the Supremes may have the chance to break through the confinement and step into the Celestial God Third Layer.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there is no other way.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan not know that the Supremes of the Six Heavens may be silently observing him now?</p><p></p><p>If they have the chance, they would not hesitate to strike him with a thunderous blow.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the fate of the Great Day has made them hesitant and wary.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said calmly, "The Abyss Master actually dared to use the Demonic Tribulation Blood on you, even daring to provoke the one I'm protecting. It seems... he hasn't positioned himself properly."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu sighed, "He went to the Tai Huang Palace."</p><p></p><p>Sheng Wu Ming knew that Qi Yuan had emerged from the Door of Profundity without any hesitation and immediately went to the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he even said that the Black Abyss had not been relocated.</p><p></p><p>To Sheng Wu Ming, the entire Black Abyss was no more important than a fingernail.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Huang Palace?" Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, a gleam of sharpness flashing across his eyes, "Good, it's time to pay a visit to the Tai Huang Palace and settle the accounts of these many years!"</p><p></p><p>"You... go to the Tai Huang Palace?" Zi Yuan Zu fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If it had been before, he might have tried to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>After all, even though the main body of the Great Day had disappeared, the star projection of the Star Realm was still there, and the Tai Huang Palace still had very strong combat power, enough to make the Supremes wary.</p><p></p><p>But today, seeing Qi Yuan's various miraculous abilities, he knew that his level was not enough to provide Qi Yuan with advice.</p><p></p><p>It's like, on the Blue Star, a genius high school student being admitted to the Chinese Academy of Sciences' genius class, the parents who have been facing the earth all their lives giving him advice to continue high school.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has their own strengths, and in terms of learning, the parents are certainly not as good as the child, and their advice may not be satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu would not give this kind of advice.</p><p></p><p>He would present the combat power information of the Tai Huang Palace to Qi Yuan, and let Qi Yuan be careful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Hall of Profundity.</p><p></p><p>Two mysterious figures lurked, their faces indistinct.</p><p></p><p>On their bodies, there were vague, indescribable distorted lines, as if they were huge, strange monsters.</p><p></p><p>"He... went to the Tai Huang Palace," one of the Supremes spoke, and the hands behind his back stretched out, tearing the distorted lines on his body into fragments.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, how did Zi Yuan Zu overcome the Demonic Tribulation?" another Supreme spoke, and behind him was the Immeasurable Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This mountain was so majestic and heavy that it had once buried the Great Profundity, and had also caused the true stars to fall, their remnants falling into the ravine. "He has too many mysteries, could he really be an outsider?" the elder murmured, as if in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Countless information factors entered his mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"If he is an outsider, going to the Tai Huang Palace will be troublesome, he will surely die.</p><p></p><p>His enemy is not the Tai Huang Palace, but... the Dao Will!" the Supreme's voice was distant, as if transcending the ages.</p><p></p><p>In this world, if the Great Profundity is still a pawn, then the Supremes who have mastered the Profound Dao are the chess players.</p><p></p><p>They have long been deeply integrated with the Dao Will.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Day Celestial Lord without the Great Profundity is an outsider being.</p><p></p><p>"The clouds are too many, the outcome of this battle is unclear, unclear."</p><p></p><p>"What are his trump cards, his backup plans, what are they exactly?"</p><p></p><p>On this day, countless eyes in the Six Heavens were fixed on the figure of Zi Yuan Tian.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to see the outcome of this battle.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to see how powerful the Ten Day Celestial Lord was.</p><p></p><p>If he was weak...</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of countless eyes, a towering figure in blood-red armor swept across the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he stopped outside the magnificent and majestic Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>He held the Human Emperor Banner in one hand, and countless heroic souls reappeared.</p><p></p><p>This banner was too ancient and dilapidated, stained with ominous blood, as if it had witnessed the eras and experienced the annihilation of the world.</p><p></p><p>He held a demonic blood sword in one hand, the blood color was so strange, as if it had gathered the darkest sins of all living beings from ancient times to the future.</p><p></p><p>The demonic blood sword stretched across the void, its sword light reflecting the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The golden luster of the Tai Huang Palace seemed to be stained with blood, sinister and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>An unparalleled aura made the Tai Huang Palace, an ancient and eternal holy land, tremble, and the Celestial Gods shuddered.</p><p></p><p>"He... has come!" an elder's gums trembled.</p><p></p><p>"He has finally come!" some vigorous cultivators were excited.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Huang Palace, the lurking beings awakened one by one.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad realms, countless eyes were fixed on this battle.</p><p></p><p>The figure in blood-red armor took a step forward, the heavens and earth shook, the clouds scattered, as if he had traversed the ages.</p><p></p><p>"Today's battle, I will flatten the Tai Huang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was sharp and exposed, without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>As if he had come from hell, summoning the endless souls of the dead.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Day Celestial Lord, if you retreat today, you may still have a chance to survive," the one who spoke was a weathered elder, the Banner Master.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand trembled, the unparalleled Human Emperor Banner roared with the voices of countless beings: "Banner Master, you still haven't returned to your position."</p><p></p><p>These words carried deep-rooted killing intent, and were also blatant humiliation.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Master's eyes flashed with a look of humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Sheng Wu Ming also had a deep expression as he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that the Demonic Tribulation would actually be resolved by the Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Tribulation... seems to be even more terrifying than the Dao Will.</p><p></p><p>It not only exists in the Six Heavens, but there are also legends of it in other universes.</p><p></p><p>"Why bother?" </p><p></p><p>A sigh came, desolate and regretful.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Huang Palace, the second echelon Great Profundity Celestial Emperor Tong Tian appeared, his figure ethereal, as if he did not belong to this world.</p><p></p><p>"Three Profundity Artifact-wielding Great Profundities? No, two, is this all the Tai Huang Palace has?" Qi Yuan's voice was cold and indifferent, with a hint of disdain.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Huang Palace, all the Celestial Gods and cultivators who heard this voice were enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens, many Celestial Gods were perplexed.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know where Qi Yuan's confidence came from at all.</p><p></p><p>In the Moon God Palace, the Moon Flower Celestial Lord's expression was gloomy: "Whether he wins or loses... it is all calamity."</p><p></p><p>In the White Dragon Abyss, the White Dragon Abyss Master's gaze was greedy: "I really want to give him a child, and then grow old."</p><p></p><p>The figure in blood-red armor, holding the banner in one hand and the sword in the other, stood tall and majestic, blocking the ancient and eternal Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>This scene was enough to be recorded in history.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this battle cannot be avoided."</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Huang Palace, the two who had mastered the Profound Dao, the Tai Day Celestial Lord, walked out.</p><p></p><p>His aura was not yet strong, only at the peak of Profundity.</p><p></p><p>But as he took each step, his aura suddenly surged, rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>"With my power, I will forge the Great Day!" the Celestial Emperor Tong Tian roared.</p><p></p><p>Multicolored light flowed from his body, pouring into the Tai Day Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Master, the Abyss Master, and the True Element Celestial Lord, the Great Profundities, all roared, frantically pouring their immortal spiritual power into the Tai Day Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Are they trying to artificially create an Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, far from enough, but this... power, below the Supremes, is almost invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"These are four Great Profundities, and not ordinary Great Profundities!"</p><p></p><p>Streams of immortal spiritual power fell from the sky, like dazzling rainbows, pouring into the Tai Day Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The originally burly figure of Tai Day became even more majestic.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have transcended the mortal realm, and the expression on his face also became cold, representing his color, which had also changed to a great sun.</p><p></p><p>The aura of Tai Day rose to a terrifying level, his every move enough to make the second echelon Great Profundities tremble.</p><p></p><p>This power is enough to make the Supremes take notice.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan felt a tremendous threat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tai Day seemed to have become a different person.</p><p></p><p>From his bones to his soul, he had completely changed, as if a strange new life had been rekindled in his body.</p><p></p><p>This scene surprised some Celestial Gods, and also made the Supremes ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Majestic Great Day, forge my true body!" </p><p></p><p>The brand new Tai Day Celestial Lord roared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Star Realm shook, a terrifying Great Day phantom descended from the sky, falling into the Tai Huang Palace and pouring into the body of the Tai Day Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Tai Day Celestial Lord suddenly surged.</p><p></p><p>This surge was even greater than the immortal spiritual power poured in by the four Great Profundities!</p><p></p><p>"The Great Day is being cast, he... is a vessel!" some Great Profundities were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"He is actually a vessel cultivated by the Great Day Supreme!" some Great Profundities were terrified.</p><p></p><p>The star projection of the Star Realm can only be cast by the original owner.</p><p></p><p>Yet Tai Day could perfectly accept the star projection of the Great Day Supreme.</p><p></p><p>This means what? This means he is a vessel created by the Great Day Supreme with his own body.</p><p></p><p>A vessel that can comprehend the Profound Dao, how can it not shock people.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Day Celestial Lord is doomed, the current Tai Day Celestial Lord is infinitely close to the Supreme, or even comparable to the Supreme, without the Great Profundity, he will surely die!" some Great Profundities made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is the Supreme, he has many backup plans, this time... the Ten Day Celestial Lord must lose!" </p><p></p><p>However, more Great Profundities and Supremes did not make any comments, waiting for the outcome of this battle.</p><p></p><p>The casting of the Great Day star, the aura of Tai Day rose to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he walked out of the Tai Huang Palace, like a true deity.</p><p></p><p>The brilliance of the Great Day illuminated the heavens, and all the beings in the Six Heavens could see that scorching and dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Day Celestial Lord, how will you fight me!" </p><p></p><p>The Tai Day Celestial Lord struck, his expression cold.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura tore everything apart, the void shattered, and one after another beams of light fell, each of which seemed capable of annihilating the Celestial Gods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was cold, he felt an overwhelming pressure.</p><p></p><p>He slashed out with his sword, and the offensive Profundity Artifact, the Human Emperor Banner, also stretched out violently.</p><p></p><p>He faced Tai Day's strike with his strongest posture.</p><p></p><p>But that terrifying aura was so overwhelming and domineering.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never faced such a powerful opponent, with such a tyrannical attack.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the only thing left in the world was that great sun.</p><p></p><p>The Human Emperor Banner trembled, the blood-red long sword let out a long cry.</p><p></p><p>Even with Qi Yuan at full strength, he felt his body about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Supreme?" Qi Yuan's eyes were calm, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He had not been injured for a long time.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when he collided with the Great Sun Celestial Venerable, he was wounded on the first strike.</p><p></p><p>If he were to directly face the Great Sun, how great would the difference in their strengths be?</p><p></p><p>When facing a Vane Lord-level powerhouse, he could easily contend with them, forcing the Vane Lord to retreat step by step.</p><p></p><p>But when facing the Great Sun, he was wounded with just one strike.</p><p></p><p>"Fireflies, how dare you vie with the sun and moon?" The Great Sun's expression was cold, "Do you know what kind of existence stands before you?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun's soul had been renewed, and his voice had become even more biting and icy.</p><p></p><p>"You are facing not just a Great Dao Venerable, but... the will of the Immortal Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators, how can you reverse the great tide and battle the will of the Immortal Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, your defeat is certain!"</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that an ordinary Great Dao Venerable is an unconscious being with the Immortal Dao will combined, then the Venerable is a conscious being with the Immortal Dao will fused, able to borrow a portion of the Immortal Dao will's power.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Sun Celestial Venerable's might was towering, the Great Sun's radiance illuminating the past, present, and future, as if it had existed since ancient times, the sole Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>All the Solar Deities were moved, their spirits shaken.</p><p></p><p>They had witnessed the battle between the Vane Lord and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had pressed the Vane Lord.</p><p></p><p>But now, this powerful Qi Yuan seemed no match for the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>Is this the strength of the Venerable? "Who gave you the confidence to provoke the Great Brilliance Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Was it the four thousand Solar Deities at the peak of the Three Thousand Realms?"</p><p></p><p>"Or the ten stellar projections of the Ten Suns soaring through the sky?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Suns soaring through the sky, the Myriad Realms in turmoil, what a commotion!"</p><p></p><p>"Little did you know, there is only one sun in the sky, and those measly Ten Suns also dare to dream of usurping the position of the Great Sun?"</p><p></p><p>"The sole Great Sun is the true Great Sun, quantity... is useless!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Celestial Venerable spoke indifferently, his voice biting.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan as if he were looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>If it were against a second-tier Great Dao Venerable, Qi Yuan could teleport and hide in the Heavenly Profound Lands at any time.</p><p></p><p>But when facing this kind of existence, Qi Yuan had no chance of teleporting away.</p><p></p><p>So, the outcome was already decided.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Great Dao Venerables shared the same thought.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor's face also carried a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Qi Yuan could create miracles.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of an absolute difference in strength, could miracles still exist?</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xue's expression was complex as she looked at the shattered image presented by Zi Yuan Ancestor in the sky, extremely worried.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Da Xue's expression was complicated as she looked at that lone figure: "If you kill the Great Sun, sister will be your concubine!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, though he was losing, his expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Great Sun Celestial Venerable, a sense of satisfaction flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, the power that is infinitely close to the Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is terrifying, and I, a humble Purple Palace cultivator, would have a hard time defeating it!"</p><p></p><p>"But... I am not just a Purple Palace cultivator, I am also a Primordial Cinnabar Cultivator, a Constant Star Golden Core!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten Suns not enough?"</p><p></p><p>"Then what about a hundred days, a thousand days, ten thousand days?"</p><p></p><p>His voice was cold, echoing throughout the four directions.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, all the cultivators who heard Qi Yuan's voice involuntarily trembled at that moment.</p><p></p><p>As if something great was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Venerable Assembly, the two hidden Venerables also had their expressions change involuntarily, as if they had sensed something.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor narrowed his eyes, his expression profound, involuntarily looking towards the Stellar Realm, towards those Ten Suns.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword squatted on the ground, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes: "Why... do I feel a bit warm?"</p><p></p><p>Was it because the ice egg had more, and the cold air had escaped? At this moment, following Qi Yuan's words, countless gazes involuntarily turned towards the Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Realm was vast and profound, with stars shining throughout.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Realm was the highest place in the Six Realms, even higher than the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>There was a rumor that when the Nine Realms were opened, cultivators standing on the Nine Realms could grasp the stellar projections in the Stellar Realm with their hands, and then turn the illusory into the real, witnessing the future.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the solemn and profound Stellar Realm suddenly... became turbulent.</p><p></p><p>All the Solar Deities felt a sense of something, and even the Yin Deities who borrowed the reflection of the Solar Deities to perceive the Myriad Realms also felt their spirits shaken.</p><p></p><p>Because the stellar projections that belonged to them were trembling at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the vast and profound Stellar Realm, it was as if a great terror was brewing.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Celestial Venerable's originally indifferent expression also revealed a sense of surprise.</p><p></p><p>This scene was so familiar.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Ten Suns soaring through the sky, raising the Divine Throne, the Stellar Realm had become turbulent, and all the Solar Deities had felt something.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Stellar Realm was turbulent again.</p><p></p><p>And the degree of this turbulence, how many times more than the previous one? Not just ten times, but a hundred times?</p><p></p><p>"This... I seem to see a great sun rising!" A Great Dao Venerable trembled.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have stellar projections, but I feel a sense of insignificance!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Ten Suns Venerable has other stellar projections?"</p><p></p><p>"Ten Suns is not his limit, could it be twelve suns... twenty suns?" Some Solar Deities boldly speculated.</p><p></p><p>The more stellar projections the Ten Suns Venerable had, the stronger he would become! If the Ten Suns Venerable had ten more, this battle...</p><p></p><p>However, before they could speculate further, a scene that shocked all the living beings in the Myriad Realms occurred at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Light! Endless light!</p><p></p><p>Red light!</p><p></p><p>Only to see the dark Stellar Realm, the light of countless stellar projections being dyed red at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the vast and boundless Stellar Realm, a stellar projection that was indescribably huge and massive appeared.</p><p></p><p>Magnificent and splendid!</p><p></p><p>Causing all the Solar Deities to shudder.</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a massive stellar projection?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this still a star?"</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators were stunned, or rather unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>This abruptly appearing blood-red stellar projection was too enormous.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary stellar projections, in the face of it, were like grains of fireflies.</p><p></p><p>Not even in the same league.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Great Dao Venerables, who could easily devour a realm, also revealed a terrified expression when facing this terrifying stellar projection.</p><p></p><p>The Venerables could hold stars in one hand and scatter dozens of stars with a palm.</p><p></p><p>But those were ordinary stars.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red star, was simply too big, too frightening.</p><p></p><p>"This is my largest Primordial Cinnabar Core!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light illuminated Qi Yuan's body, making him appear even more ominous.</p><p></p><p>"It's called the Supergiant!"</p><p></p><p>This Supergiant, its mass might only be a few dozen times that of the blue sun, but its volume... was a hundred billion times larger! This star had consumed over a thousand divine techniques before Ning Tao and Jin Siji were able to capture it.</p><p></p><p>Big is strong, big is beautiful! The first star to descend into the Stellar Realm was this massive Supergiant.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Celestial Venerable's expression was cold: "Size does not represent everything!"</p><p></p><p>This stellar projection was indeed terrifying, but it was still within his acceptance range? "You think... this is the only one this big?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, his voice calm.</p><p></p><p>In the ears of the Solar Deities, it was like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... could it be...? All the Solar Deities's teeth chattered.</p><p></p><p>Such a stellar projection had already exceeded their imagination, and yet there were more?</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, you thought right, this big one is indeed the only one!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The red Supergiant was rare and hard to come by, and Qi Yuan had only managed to condense one into a Primordial Cinnabar Core.</p><p></p><p>The other Solar Deities Venerables heard this and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>One was already terrifying enough, if there were more... unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan did not perish in this battle, and this massive stellar projection hung in the Stellar Realm, the other Solar Deities would all be afraid.</p><p></p><p>It was too big.</p><p></p><p>However, they had relaxed too soon.</p><p></p><p>"Although this big one is the only one I have at the moment, but... the small ones, I have many!"</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Cinnabar Cores, manifest!"</p><p></p><p>"Illuminate the Myriad Realms!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the vast Stellar Realm suddenly went dark for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As if all the starlight had been stolen.</p><p></p><p>Many Solar Deities trembled again, terrified.</p><p></p><p>Because this familiar feeling was even more terrifying and intense than the previous appearance of the Supergiant.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked towards the dark Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Dark, boundless, not a single light!</p><p></p><p>In an instant! It brightened. Countless stars rose successively.</p><p></p><p>Majestic and grand!</p><p></p><p>It was not one sun, nor two, nor even a hundred, a thousand!</p><p></p><p>Myriads of golden radiant wheels rose, the Stellar Realm darkening as the sun and moon sank.</p><p></p><p>The gods bowed their heads towards the red sun, the Milky Way rippling and lifting the Kunlun!</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was no end to them! This was tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of stellar projections spanning the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Is this enough?"</p><p></p><p>"There is only one sun in the sky, then what about the ten thousand suns?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, in his blood-colored armor, seemed to carry the Stellar Realm, the tens of thousands of stellar projections shimmering with radiance illuminating the sky.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be the true celestial deity, with the stars merely decorations on his armor.</p><p></p><p>The other stellar projections, in the face of these tens of thousands of Primordial Cinnabar Cores, became dim and insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Countless eyes looked at Qi Yuan, their pupils trembling.</p><p></p><p>"What Ten Suns Venerable... this is... the Ten Thousand Suns... the Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Ten Suns could still be described as a Venerable, but this was Ten Thousand Suns! Among the stars and realms in the Myriad Realms, those tens of thousands of shimmering stellar projections made everyone moved.</p><p></p><p>Even the Venerables could not have imagined that these stellar projections would belong to one person. This was simply unimaginable, even more shocking than the appearance of the Dao Venerable Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Countless stars, all join me!"</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant radiance, shine eternally in the Nine Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, countless stellar projections descended from the Stellar Realm, falling upon Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's aura grew madly.</p><p></p><p>Vast, unparalleled, profound... indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"Now, do I have the qualifications to covet the position of the Great Sun?"</p><p></p><p>Big is beautiful, more is stronger! "Look at my Primordial Cinnabar Cores, let me... seize it!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's roar, the terrifying and unparalleled giant hands fell towards the Great Sun's stellar projection.</p><p></p><p>In the Stellar Realm, tens of thousands of Primordial Cinnabar Cores, like a host of stellar lords, plummeted towards the Great Sun's stellar projection.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>This strike was not about the Dao!</p><p></p><p>This strike displayed the beauty of power!</p><p></p><p>Even the terrifying rules, the horrifying Dao Venerables, were all torn apart under this unparalleled power.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun's terrifying physique, comparable to the Venerable's combat power, appeared insignificant in the face of this strike.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>In the Stellar Realm, cracks appeared on the Great Sun's stellar projection.</p><p></p><p>Countless rays of light burst forth from the Great Sun's body.</p><p></p><p>"In this Six Realms, I am the only Great Sun!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun's stellar projection shattered!</p><p></p><p>The position of the sole Great Sun extinguished and reignited.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun's body crumbled, his originally cold expression disappearing.</p><p></p><p>He had reverted to the original Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible..." He was somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Qi Yuan struck again, this time directly at the Vane Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Vane Lord's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, his expression tense as he gritted his teeth and said, "I have the Dao Venerable's Moment, I will not die!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that strike was completely unreasonable, with unparalleled momentum. Even the Dao Venerable's Moment combined with the Immortal Dao will could not withstand this strike, and cracks appeared.</p><p></p><p>One strike, and the Vane Lord perished.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Realms were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was a second-tier Dao Venerable, with the Dao Venerable's Moment protecting him.</p><p></p><p>Under the operation of the Immortal Dao will, even the Venerable could not slay him.</p><p></p><p>Yet... he was easily slaughtered by Qi Yuan? Those Dao Venerables looked at Qi Yuan with fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even the Venerables, at this moment, had a sense of dread in their gazes.</p><p></p><p>This was a second-tier Dao Venerable, although the offensive Spiritual Treasures had already been seized by Qi Yuan, but he was still the overlord of this Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan did not give them time to think, his gaze falling on Sheng Wuming.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, Zi Yuan Ancestor pleaded with you three times for me, today, I will slay you in three strikes!"</p><p></p><p>The vast figure, carrying unparalleled radiance, struck.</p><p></p><p>"The first strike, annihilate the physical body!"</p><p></p><p>One palm strike, the Black Demon Abyss Sovereign's body shattered.</p><p></p><p>"The second strike, extinguish the divine soul!"</p><p></p><p>The second palm strike, the Black Demon Abyss Sovereign's divine soul dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"The third strike, sever the Dao Venerable's Moment!"</p><p></p><p>Three strikes, the Dao Venerable's Moment engraved on the Immortal Dao will... shattered.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Realms... were all shocked!

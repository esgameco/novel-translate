        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He held the knife and continued to stroll.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he heard many whispers, all about the condemnation of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect is truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"They actually injured Brother Zheng, not even considering our Shenguang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"It's because their sect master has a good adoptive father!"</p><p></p><p>"Even more hateful is that the Black Mountain Sect will also attend the Foundation Establishment Assembly in half a month!"</p><p></p><p>"What, the Black Mountain Sect is also coming!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard the chief disciples of several peaks are discussing yesterday's events, but that one... why is he still strolling with a knife?"</p><p></p><p>"Keep it down, that one hasn't even reached Foundation Establishment yet, what's the use of discussing it?"</p><p></p><p>"He probably can't even defeat Lu Tianxiong."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say that, it's not that Brother Xu doesn't want to reach Foundation Establishment, he certainly doesn't want to be stuck at the Qi Refinement realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened to these, seemingly without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>A trace of joy appeared on the face of Empress Jinli: "Aunt Qin, your injury has healed?"</p><p></p><p>Aunt Qin nodded: "Thank you, Your Majesty, for the imperial medicine. My injury has finally healed, and my cultivation has even improved."</p><p></p><p>"That's good." Jinli felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>After her father and mother passed away, it was Aunt Qin who raised her.</p><p></p><p>She was particularly reliant on Aunt Qin.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, she asked, "Aunt Qin, do we have a chance in the battle with the National Teacher of South Feng in six days?"</p><p></p><p>The upcoming battle in six days was a matter of life and death for Jinli and the others.</p><p></p><p>If they failed, Sima Ting would certainly seize the opportunity to make a move.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Jinli would have no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Even if she forcibly resisted, it would only lead to the premature death of the people following her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a trace of worry appeared on Aunt Qin's face: "Yesterday, the Crown Prince of South Feng visited Sima Ting. Sima Ting gave him a precious pill, called the Chaos Locking Blood Pill."</p><p></p><p>"What!" Jinli gritted her teeth, "Sima Ting's intentions are known to all!"</p><p></p><p>The National Teacher of South Feng was a late-stage King-level expert.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation he practiced was the Dragon Elephant Purgatory Technique.</p><p></p><p>The stronger his qi and blood, the stronger his cultivation. At the highest realm, he would have the power of a hundred dragon elephants.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Aunt Qin who had taken the Nine Flowers Brocade would be slightly stronger than the National Teacher of South Feng.</p><p></p><p>However, the precious pill given by Sima Ting was a supreme qi and blood nourishing pill.</p><p></p><p>After the National Teacher of South Feng takes this pill, it will be like a tiger gaining wings, and his strength will definitely increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>From the late-stage King realm to the Perfection realm, it would be no problem, and he might even catch a glimpse of the Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, the National Teacher of South Feng is no longer Aunt Qin's opponent.</p><p></p><p>And the one who caused all this was the Prime Minister of South Qian, Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't Sima Ting afraid of being condemned by all?" The commander of the Imperial Guards, Hua Xian, was also extremely angry.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting's actions were becoming increasingly unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Jinli frowned and took out the remaining imperial medicine: "Aunt Qin, if you take these imperial medicines, can your strength be enhanced?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the imperial medicines, Aunt Qin's eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know where Her Majesty had obtained so many precious imperial medicines.</p><p></p><p>"If I take these imperial medicines, I would have a chance to break through to the Emperor realm within three years.</p><p>But... time is running out." Aunt Qin's words were filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>Jinli's brow was tightly knitted as she pondered a way to break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>Hiring an Emperor-level expert with the imperial medicines? Excluded.</p><p>Find some quick-acting strengthening pills? No good!</p><p></p><p>Jinli couldn't come up with a good solution at the moment.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but think of what Qi Yuan had said, about recruiting some minor demons from the Yiguan Sect to help her.</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through her mind.</p><p></p><p>Subduing Yiguan demons, how could it be that simple?</p><p>Just talking about it wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know where there was a method to quickly improve her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at Aunt Qin: "Aunt Qin, keep your recovery a secret for now, don't let Sima Ting know about it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"As for improving my strength, I will find a way to do it."</p><p></p><p>"As you command."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I pay my respects to the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>The main hall was empty and spacious, with Qi Yuan standing in the center, his attitude respectful.</p><p></p><p>The Withered Wood True Lord looked at Qi Yuan, a hint of mockery in his expression: "You still recognize me as your Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, this senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak had suddenly revealed that the Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect, which was him, was actually a spy from the Demonic Desire Gate.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he was greatly alarmed, thinking that his cover had been blown and that the one from the Seven-Color Peak had colluded with the other Peak Masters to attack him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it was just a false alarm, completely Qi Yuan's nonsense.</p><p></p><p>He did indeed have deep connections with the Demonic Desire Gate, having been personally sent to the Divine Light Sect by an elder of the Demonic Desire Gate.</p><p></p><p>From a lowly disciple, he had risen to become an outer disciple, and then a core disciple.</p><p></p><p>Day after day, he was filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>He frequently contacted that elder.</p><p></p><p>Each time, the elder would say, "Just wait a little longer."</p><p></p><p>Day after day, year after year, he carefully transformed from a spy to the Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>When that elder saw him again, the Withered Wood True Lord directly changed his tone: "A person of the demonic path, you also dare to try to sow discord between this Venerable One and the Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>That elder of the Demonic Desire Gate was already on the verge of death, and upon hearing this, he immediately passed away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Withered Wood True Lord, lazily saying, "You haven't done anything to betray the Divine Light Sect, so why can't I call you Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>The Withered Wood True Lord looked at Qi Yuan, his heart filled with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>This senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak was acting strangely. How did he know that he was a spy from the Demonic Desire Gate? Or was he just making it up?</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, I have a task for you here."</p><p>The Withered Wood True Lord returned to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attitude also became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"In half a month, it will be the Foundation Building Assembly." Mentioning this, a flash of sharpness appeared in the Withered Wood True Lord's eyes, "This Foundation Building Assembly will be hosted by our Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Great Merchant Kingdom, the Floating Mountain, the Demonic Desire Gate, and other sects will send some disciples to participate and compete for the first-grade Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit... the Golden Flower Fruit."</p><p></p><p>The first-grade Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit is the best among the top three grades of Foundation Building Spiritual Fruits.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Merchant Kingdom, it is extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that the mysterious and powerful experts of the Great Merchant Kingdom can only be counted on one hand, and they use the top three grades of Foundation Building Spiritual Fruits for their foundation building.</p><p></p><p>But they are not even first-grade.</p><p></p><p>This shows how precious the first-grade Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit is.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was stunned: "Why don't the senior brothers and sisters wait for this Golden Flower Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>"We didn't expect that this time, the secret realm would only produce a few Foundation Building Spiritual Fruits, and one of them would be the Golden Flower Fruit." The Withered Wood True Lord sighed regretfully.</p><p></p><p>If they had known that a first-grade Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit would be produced, he definitely would not have let the peak disciples of the various peaks build their foundations in advance.</p><p></p><p>Now, among the peak disciples, only Qi Yuan has not yet built his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Withered Wood True Lord felt that this might be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>But it could also be the work of the one from the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p>She deliberately left a high-grade Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit for her disciple.</p><p></p><p>"So, this time, you will lead our Divine Light Sect to participate in the Foundation Building Assembly.</p><p>Qi Yuan, I hope you can showcase the might of our sect and obtain the Golden Flower Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was quite helpless: "Can I not participate?"</p><p></p><p>"No!" The Divine Light Sect Master firmly refused, and thinking of Qi Yuan's personality, he added, "You only need to take the stage once at the end, and it won't take more than an hour."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan finally agreed: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, I'll take my leave." Qi Yuan was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's demeanor, the Divine Light Sect Master sighed helplessly.</p><p>He didn't know whether it was reliable to pin his hopes on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If the Golden Flower Fruit was snatched away by other sects, and it ended up creating a powerful expert like the Black Chicken Old Demon, that would not be good.</p><p></p><p>But he hadn't thought much about it when Qi Yuan suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, is the Great Merchant Kingdom's Empress... beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

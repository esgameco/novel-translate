        <h1>Chapter 256</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's no misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes laughed.</p><p></p><p>His smile seemed very kind, but to Elder Xiang Yun, it felt particularly chilling. </p><p></p><p>It seemed that if the Blood-Robed Sword God wanted, he could perish in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear female voice like celestial music rang out:</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God has come to Qinghong City, why didn't you notify this servant in advance? I could have prepared a warm welcome at Phoenix Palace."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over to see a woman appear, wearing a veil, like a fairy from the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>The morning glow scattered into colorful clothes, a beauty in pink moving gracefully like a heavenly immortal.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the woman appeared, she became the focus of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Great Venerable Jasmine!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Palace Master!"</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators bowed.</p><p></p><p>After all, Great Venerable Jasmine was the most precious woman in Phoenix Heaven Realm, and also the leader of the top power, Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat broke out on Elder Xiang Yun's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Even Great Venerable Jasmine had come, so the man before him... must undoubtedly be the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan glanced at Great Venerable Jasmine and said lazily: "These people falsely accused me of stealing the Exquisite Pot from Wangxian Tower, and even told me to commit suicide to atone for my crime. </p><p></p><p>Originally, given my temperament, I would have just killed them with one sword strike and be done with it.</p><p></p><p>But... after all, you and I have an ambiguous relationship, so I should give you some face, shouldn't I?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder Xiang Yun felt joy in his heart, thinking the matter was resolved. However, Qi Yuan's next words made his heart sink.</p><p></p><p>"So, I had to call you over to kill him in front of you."</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood light, in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The previously domineering Elder Xiang Yun, as well as the second shopkeeper of Wangxian Tower, were instantly cut in half by Qi Yuan's blood-qi sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clapped his hands and looked at Great Venerable Jasmine: "You love me so much, you shouldn't mind me cleaning house for you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's sudden action shocked all the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>After all, Great Venerable Jasmine had arrived, yet he directly killed people from Phoenix Palace in front of her.</p><p></p><p>This showed no respect for Great Venerable Jasmine at all.</p><p></p><p>However, Great Venerable Jasmine's eyes showed no anger. Instead, she smiled coquettishly, full of charm: "They insulted you. If you didn't kill them, this servant would have done it for you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Great Venerable Jasmine's words, everyone present looked at the Blood-Robed Sword God with envy.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God killed her subordinates in front of Great Venerable Jasmine, yet she didn't get angry, and her words were full of coquetry.</p><p></p><p>This was true love for the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God was truly a winner in life.</p><p></p><p>Powerful strength, and a Great Venerable who liked him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I misunderstood you. The rumors are all true. I didn't expect you to like me so much," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Jasmine smiled gently: "The young master's appearance is unparalleled, his strength extraordinary. It's only natural for this servant to be smitten."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Great Venerable Jasmine reached out to touch Qi Yuan's arm: "Why doesn't the young master return to Phoenix Palace with me?"</p><p></p><p>"No thanks." Qi Yuan shook his hand, preventing Great Venerable Jasmine's hand from landing on his arm. "Men and women should keep their distance. I haven't agreed to date you yet, so... don't touch me."</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Jasmine's eyes flashed with surprise, then she smiled and said: "Why has the young master suddenly come to Qinghong City?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard there was a beauty in Qinghong City who secretly loved me. Unable to see me, she cried every day. </p><p></p><p>I couldn't bear it, so I came to see if that beauty had fallen lovesick," Qi Yuan said, completely making things up.</p><p></p><p>After all, Great Venerable Jasmine had spread rumors about liking him.</p><p></p><p>So he might as well add some spice to those rumors.</p><p></p><p>"Jasmine baby, I didn't expect you to like me so much. I'm... very touched." Qi Yuan deliberately added a husky tone to the word "baby".</p><p></p><p>Presumably, Great Venerable Jasmine would be captivated by him.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators present, hearing Qi Yuan's words, couldn't help but hold back their laughter.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood-Robed Sword God's reputation preceded him as a true god of killing, so they naturally didn't dare to actually laugh.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was Great Venerable Jasmine who let out a silvery laugh: "As expected of the man I've set my eyes on, truly interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Jasmine baby, since you like me so much, and now that I've come to Qinghong City in person, when are you going to confess your love to me?" Qi Yuan's words were shocking.</p><p></p><p>With one sentence, he stunned everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Confess?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Jasmine confessing to the Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>These cultivators' minds couldn't quite keep up.</p><p></p><p>How did it become Great Venerable Jasmine proposing to the Blood-Robed Sword God? The smile on Great Venerable Jasmine's face also became strained: "Is the young master joking with this servant?"</p><p></p><p>"I never joke. Since you like me so much, you wouldn't be unwilling to confess, would you?" Qi Yuan continued to morally bind her.</p><p></p><p>If you love me so much, but aren't even willing to confess, isn't that fake?</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Jasmine smiled without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to morally bind her: "But, you only have some looks. In our village, you'd be considered the type who can't find a husband.</p><p></p><p>If you confess to me, you need to show some sincerity. For example, give me some mythical secret treasure as a gift, free of charge. Then maybe... I'll accept your confession."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words had too many points to criticize.</p><p></p><p>This caused all the onlooking cultivators to hold their breath.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to say, Blood-Robed Sword God, are you blind? Great Venerable Jasmine is the number one beauty in Phoenix Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet he said she couldn't find... a husband.</p><p></p><p>And... using a mythical secret treasure as a gift, this Blood-Robed Sword God really dared to imagine, his calculations could be heard throughout Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Jasmine looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze profound: "The mythical secret treasure was left to me by my father. Only my husband can share the secret treasure with me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan sighed deeply: "It seems you still don't love me enough.</p><p></p><p>Alas, I didn't expect that I, the great Blood-Robed Sword God, can't even compare to those delinquents riding ghost fire motorcycles.</p><p></p><p>Those delinquents can bewitch other people's daughters to the point of losing their minds.</p><p></p><p>But you... won't even give me the old man's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"The young master jests." Jasmine's eyes held laughter, her voice becoming somewhat weaker, "Although this servant has admired the young master for a long time, unfortunately... this servant's marriage is not her own to decide.</p><p></p><p>Before my father passed away, he said that only someone willing to die for me could marry me and jointly control the mythical secret treasure with me."</p><p></p><p>"Your dad is an old stubborn fool, don't listen to him," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>What era is this now, even the Qing Dynasty has fallen.</p><p></p><p>To date someone, still demanding life and death?</p><p></p><p>"It is my parents' command, I dare not disobey. It seems the young master and I are destined to be star-crossed lovers," Great Venerable Jasmine said pitifully, like the girl next door.</p><p></p><p>"It shows you still don't love me enough," Qi Yuan continued to use this tactic, saying coldly, "In that case, you may leave."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Great Venerable Jasmine's face broke into a smile: "When the young master has time, come play with this servant at Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>I cannot give you the mythical secret treasure, but other things... I can give."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Great Venerable Jasmine's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present, witnessing today's events, were extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Especially since they got to watch the drama unfold, they were very excited.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan glanced at the corpses on the ground, lightly kicking them out of the room.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ye He and said softly: "This brother spoke up for justice, many thanks."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye He was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The legendary Blood-Robed Sword God was actually speaking to him, he felt somewhat overwhelmed by the favor.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Great Sun Flame Emperor also spoke: "Brother Ye, thank you."</p><p></p><p>He knew how much courage it took for Ye He to stand up at that time.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye He looked at the crowd in the arena and finally transmitted softly: "Be careful of Great Venerable Jasmine, she is not so simple."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? Thank you for letting me know."</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, Ye He withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The door was closed again, leaving only the Four Emperors of Divine Flowers in the room.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman couldn't help but laugh: "Origin Venerable, I've never admired anyone in my life, but now I admire you!"</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman felt that she could never speak as eloquently as Qi Yuan did in his dialogue with Great Venerable Jasmine. </p><p></p><p>She wouldn't even dare to breathe in front of Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan directly made Great Venerable Jasmine confess her feelings.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Venerable flattered: "Venerable is strong, I surrender!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor's expression was solemn as he repeated Ye He's transmission: "Origin Venerable, you need to be careful, Great Venerable Jasmine is not simple."</p><p></p><p>"If even your Purple Mansion can know she's not simple, it means... she's really not simple." Qi Yuan's gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>After all, which Great Venerable would be simple? If a Great Venerable secretly told Qi Yuan that Great Venerable Jasmine wasn't simple, that would be normal.</p><p></p><p>But for even a Purple Mansion to say Great Venerable Jasmine wasn't simple.</p><p></p><p>This was interesting.</p><p></p><p>"We need to act cautiously," the Great Sun Flame Emperor repeated.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Origin Venerable had the combat power of a Yin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>From his grandfather Wind Lord, he learned that Origin Venerable had devoured the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent and could exert Great Venerable level combat power.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Canglang Realm, and the Heavenly Dao that Origin Venerable had devoured didn't match with Canglang Realm. At most, he could exert the combat power of the fourth step of Ascending to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This was at the bottom among Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had the Solar Golden Core, the Canglang Realm was extremely special, and the Solar Golden Core couldn't be fully utilized or converted into combat power.</p><p></p><p>So in the Great Sun Flame Emperor's view, the current Blood Robe Sword Immortal was still somewhat inferior to Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would be different on the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Great Venerable Jasmine... truly likes me, how could she bear to harm me? If she does try to harm me, I'll have to cut open her chest and ask her heart why it's treating me this way," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"She really likes you?" The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Although when communicating with Great Venerable Jasmine, his nose kept growing longer.</p><p></p><p>Indicating that beautiful women love to lie the most.</p><p></p><p>But... her liking him was probably true.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this kind of liking was different from ordinary people's liking.</p><p></p><p>The people Great Venerable Jasmine liked... were probably quite numerous.</p><p></p><p>"She's just lusting after my body," Qi Yuan said, suddenly annoyed, "She sexually harassed me!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The other three were confused.</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem like Great Venerable Jasmine had made any physical advances on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How was that sexual harassment?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you two did something in front of us just now? But you were so fast that we thought you were standing still?" the Rogue Immortal Venerable couldn't help but guess.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't slander me, I'm not fast at all.</p><p></p><p>Besides, who says sexual harassment requires physical contact? She was thinking impure thoughts about me earlier!"</p><p></p><p>While communicating with Great Venerable Jasmine, Qi Yuan occasionally heard her inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Those thoughts were quite vulgar.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had a system, he would have found that the system was constantly prompting:</p><p></p><p>Lust +1.</p><p></p><p>Lust +1.</p><p></p><p>That's right, that lust came from Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan was fearless.</p><p></p><p>"She sexually harassed you in her mind?" The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman couldn't hold back anymore, "Can that even be considered sexual harassment?"</p><p></p><p>"How is mental sexual harassment not sexual harassment?</p><p></p><p>I really missed out, I should have caught her red-handed at the time, then her Mythical Secret Treasury would have been mine." Qi Yuan looked disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He had missed the best opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were no short videos in this world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have exposed Great Venerable Jasmine, this despicable woman, on the internet.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, there are many powerful cultivators in the Phoenix Sky Domain plotting for the Mythical Secret Treasury," the Great Sun Flame Emperor reminded at this time, "That's the legacy of a Mythical being."</p><p></p><p>A Mythical being was someone who had reached the seventh step of Ascending to Heaven, standing at the peak of Yin Immortals.</p><p></p><p>One step further would be Yang Immortal!</p><p></p><p>The legacy of a Mythical being would not only attract the attention of Yin Immortals in the Phoenix Sky Domain, but even Yin Immortals from the Demon Domain would covet it.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Great Venerable Jasmine was pursued by many Yin Immortals was partly due to her beauty, but more so because of the Mythical Secret Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to obtain the Mythical Secret Treasury and step into the seventh step of Ascending to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't Great Venerable Martial Lord pursue Great Venerable Jasmine before? Origin Venerable, with how you treated Great Venerable Jasmine today, Great Venerable Martial Lord might challenge you," the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"They're all getting on in years, they're all Great Venerables now, are they still acting like hooligans fighting over women?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Martial Lord isn't fighting over a woman, he's fighting for the Mythical Secret Treasury and the opportunity to enter the Mythical realm!" said the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor also nodded: "Because of the Mythical Secret Treasury, in the past few thousand years, five Yin Immortals have died across the three domains, three of whom were from the Eastern Land."</p><p></p><p>The fall of these Yin Immortals was rumored to be related to Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>Other Yin Immortals also knew about this.</p><p></p><p>But what could they do even if they knew?</p><p></p><p>The Mythical Secret Treasury was in Great Venerable Jasmine's hands. To obtain it, how could one not pay a price?</p><p></p><p>Rather than fighting over love, it was more about fighting for the Mythical Secret Treasury.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many pure love warriors from the Eastern Land, coming to the Phoenix Sky Domain to throw their lives away?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>No wonder that among the three domains, the Eastern Land had so few Yin Immortals.</p><p></p><p>It turns out they all died in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>No, some also died at Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Eastern Land only had a handful of powerful Yin Immortals left.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I should team up with these people to steal Great Venerable Jasmine's Mythical Secret Treasury?" Qi Yuan pondered, then shook his head, "But she only sexually harassed me, the crime doesn't warrant death. Sigh, it's so difficult to stand on the moral high ground."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Palace of Light, Great Venerable Jasmine was clearly on a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Palace of Light, he could easily stand on the moral high ground and enumerate their seven deadly sins.</p><p></p><p>This method wouldn't work with Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Qi Yuan considered himself a law-abiding good person who couldn't bring himself to kill innocents indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"If Great Venerable Jasmine dies, the Mythical Secret Treasury truly can't be opened, so..." the Great Sun Flame Emperor added at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Jasmine, my pure love, since you like me so much, we can barely be considered mutually in love, what's wrong with giving me the Mythical Secret Treasury?" Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>There were many techniques in the Mythical Secret Treasury.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Sun Flame Emperor said: "Origin Venerable, I have an idea. We can establish a force specifically to help you collect techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan heard this, "But... I'm very poor, I can't afford to buy techniques."</p><p></p><p>Collecting techniques requires enormous manpower, resources, and wealth.</p><p></p><p>For example, the reason Ascending Heaven Pavilion could collect so many techniques was because it had Soaring Heaven Pavilion helping it make money.</p><p></p><p>"This is simple, we don't collect by paying, but by... sharing," said the Great Sun Flame Emperor, clearly having thought this through.</p><p></p><p>P.S. There will be two more updates between midnight and 1 AM.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

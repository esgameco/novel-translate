        <h1>Chapter 395</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the big guy hurriedly said, "Of course there's no need for Lady Jade to personally take action. We can kill him ourselves!"</p><p></p><p>He felt that suggesting Lady Jade take action herself had angered her. </p><p></p><p>After all, Her Highness was high above, a myth reflecting all the heavens. How could she lower herself to deal with a mere Blood Robed Sword God?</p><p></p><p>"Take action personally?" Lady Jade sneered, "Why shouldn't I take action personally? I must take action personally!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the burly man felt delighted inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, a strong sense of threat assailed him, as if there were thorns at his back.</p><p></p><p>He was instantly on alert, but before he could gather his divine power, an immense pressure fell directly upon his body.</p><p></p><p>The other great lords who had been clamoring earlier also felt the same pressure.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>They couldn't understand or comprehend why Lady Jade was attacking them.</p><p></p><p>They were merely alternative myths, far too inferior compared to the myths reflecting all the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, eight great lords perished, turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>Lady Jade had come from the upper realm, and her control over power had reached an astonishing level.</p><p></p><p>This kind of annihilation wouldn't trigger the Heavenly Dao's pull into the void realm either.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the scene was breathing rapidly, looking at Lady Jade with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Lady Jade clapped her hands and said, "He is the light of the world, the only one with hope of breaking you all free from the great calamity, yet you want me to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the Blood Robed Sword God could resist the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Even the feat of ten suns in the sky, she seemed unable to deal with.</p><p></p><p>That was someone capable of contending with the great sun.</p><p></p><p>If he truly was the person her master had followed and admired, then she definitely couldn't make a move against him.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators watching this scene were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"He can resist the great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the great calamity unstoppable?"</p><p></p><p>"The marks on our bodies?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining cultivators were both excited and confused.</p><p></p><p>How could this Blood Robed Sword God resist the great calamity? They knew that Lady Jade had said even the Yang Gods of the upper realm couldn't deal with the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>But now... what was this? Yang Gods couldn't do it, but the Blood Robed Sword God could?</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me to pay respects to the Blood Robed Sword God!" A sharp glint flashed in Lady Jade's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Robed Sword God truly was that Ten Suns Celestial Lord, the situation in the Cang Lan Realm would change drastically.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, a trace of melancholy flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the Ten Suns Celestial Lord formally rebelled against the great sun, the great calamity of the Cang Lan Realm would be no problem, but... all living beings in the Cang Lan Realm might face utter destruction.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the sixth level of the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>In a branch palace of the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Kun Xia packed up all his belongings and, taking advantage of the night, transformed into a streak of light and left.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Kun Xia, where are you going in the middle of the night?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice, Daoist Kun Xia's heart skipped a beat, but upon seeing who it was, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I've been in closed-door cultivation for too long and got bored. I'm planning to wander around and experience the mortal world," Daoist Kun Xia said with a serious expression, his eyes also showing a timely hint of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the new rising star on this term's merit ranking. Daoist Kun Xia has struck it rich, making people envious.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, the flesh grounds I've been guarding all these years haven't produced any good seeds of destiny.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Daoist Kun Xia, who first produced a Yang God, and now I hear there's another powerful figure with great Dao fortune.</p><p></p><p>This is top-grade nourishment. Once harvested, the rewards from above won't be small!" The elder in blue robes had an envious look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The realm he guarded had quite a few rebels, but they were all small fry.</p><p></p><p>As for rebels who could condense destiny and great trends, there wasn't a single one.</p><p></p><p>Among the three thousand realms, the world he guarded ranked near the bottom.</p><p></p><p>So, he was thinking of coming to learn some tricks from his good friend Daoist Kun Xia.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, it's just luck," Daoist Kun Xia said with an odd expression, feeling anxious inside.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, he was indeed very happy, even joyful.</p><p></p><p>Because the Dark Sun had been destroyed! Within the Dark Sun were many nourishing corpse puppets.</p><p></p><p>In terms of battle power, the Dark Sun was enough to suppress the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the Dark Sun destroyed, a person called the Blood Robed Sword God appeared in his field of vision.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, for such an impressive person to appear in the Cang Lan Realm, he must be a cultivator who had condensed destiny and great Dao fortune.</p><p></p><p>In the three thousand "pig farms", only such pigs were considered good pigs.</p><p></p><p>He leaked a bit of news about this "good pig", and immediately received a lot of flattery. Even those above praised him.</p><p></p><p>He had been riding high for a year or two, just waiting for the harvest.</p><p></p><p>"How could it be luck? Sigh, I came here hoping to enter the realm Daoist Kun Xia guards and take a look, learn some tricks.</p><p></p><p>After so many years without any achievements, I'm getting a bit frustrated too." As the blue-robed elder spoke, he handed a storage bag to Daoist Kun Xia.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Kun Xia accepted it without showing any reaction, then said, "There are only a few hundred years left until the harvest. There's not much to learn by going in now.</p><p></p><p>How about this: after the harvest is complete, I'll personally take you to see the realm I guard."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Daoist Kun Xia did indeed have experience.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity couldn't become common knowledge, but treasures had to be left behind, leaking information about the great calamity, making some people feel they could save the world.</p><p></p><p>Destiny could snowball.</p><p></p><p>"That works too. Then I'll trouble Daoist Kun Xia!" The blue-robed elder bowed solemnly, then sighed, "I wonder when the realm I guard will produce such destined geniuses like the one in Daoist Kun Xia's realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Daoist Kun Xia's mouth twitched: "I'm going out for a while and will be back in three hundred years. We can discuss the harvest then. Fellow Daoist... farewell!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Daoist Kun Xia transformed into a streak of light and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As for... farewell? Farewell my ass, never see you again! This old man has to run!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, his pig-raising skills were not bad, allowing those above to harvest quite a bit of good nourishment.</p><p></p><p>But damn it... being too good was also a crime.</p><p></p><p>Especially the ten suns in the sky...</p><p></p><p>Why did it seem so familiar? He suddenly remembered that some time ago, a disciple had reported to him that ten suns had appeared in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he thought it was just an illusion or some strange phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>He was at a crucial point in refining pills, so he planned to check it out in a few years.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed there was no need to look.</p><p></p><p>He directly killed that disciple and after searching his soul, discovered that only he knew about the ten suns appearing in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Raising pigs was one thing, but he had raised a dragon that could swallow its master! Shouldn't he run away quickly? If that person from Tai Huang Palace found out that the currently hottest Ten Suns Celestial Lord in the upper realm came from the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could he survive? He had to run away with a lantern!</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, sometimes being too capable isn't a good thing. Running away is more important."</p><p></p><p>As for the news about the Ten Suns Celestial Lord, of course he would conceal it for as long as possible.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in the upper realm anymore. I'll go to the lower realm... The Buddhist countries are in constant dispute now, many powerful figures have gone down. If I slip in among the chaos, I should be fine.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, my homeland, there will no longer be the glorious Daoist Kun Xia, only the... Nameless Daoist living in the gutter."</p><p></p><p>For someone used to living in the upper realm, especially the sixth level, going to the lower realm felt awful.</p><p></p><p>It was no different than someone living in a villa on Earth being forced to survive in the sewers.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Kun Xia felt bitter, but he had no choice. Who told him to be so capable? He could only pack up and run away to hide in the lower realm for a while.</p><p></p><p>As for returning to the upper realm, that was impossible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Daoist Kun Xia was running away.</p><p></p><p>Lady Jade finally met Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sized up this woman who had come from the upper realm, with disappointment in his eyes: "I thought you had come to cause trouble for me. That would have saved me some time, as I could have killed you all."</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been busy reflecting all the heavens, searching for the Flowing Wind Realm, with no time to deal with that hidden organization.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought about going to meet those old first loves someday.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the first loves to be so enthusiastic as to come find him on their own.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan, Lady Jade actually felt a bit scared inside.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was her first time encountering such a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>"Those who offended you, sir, I have already killed them all!" Lady Jade hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh... you came from the upper realm?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>His eyes could smell the unusual aura on Lady Jade's body.</p><p></p><p>"In response to the great one, yes!" Lady Jade quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Your strength is not bad, much stronger than that guy Shen Wushen... How about we engage in some inter-realm trade, smuggle together?</p><p></p><p>Whatever resources from the lower realm you're interested in, tell me and I'll collect them for you.</p><p></p><p>In return, whatever techniques you have from the upper realm, send them all down to me!"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, smuggling could make big money.</p><p></p><p>When he was on Earth, Qi Yuan watched TV and especially envied those who traveled between ancient and modern times, smuggling "antiques".</p><p></p><p>Using common salt, glass, and mirrors from the present to exchange for gold and silver treasures from ancient people, even getting ancient masters to personally write calligraphy for you.</p><p></p><p>These were antiques, originals!</p><p></p><p>Although why artifacts brought out through time portals with ink not yet dry could still be authenticated as genuine by appraisal masters - it was simple, with time portals everything became reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Now</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The opportunity for trade between two realms was right before Qi Yuan's eyes, and he naturally didn't want to miss it.</p><p></p><p>"If the senior needs anything, this junior will certainly do my utmost!" Jade Maiden quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Cang Lan Realm had fallen from the upper realm, it had been separated for so long that it had already become a lower realm. </p><p></p><p>To a mythical powerhouse like her, the lower realm was like a garbage dump - what good things could it possibly have?</p><p></p><p>However, since the Ten Suns Celestial Lord needed it, she would oblige.</p><p></p><p>"Now give me some cultivation techniques, preferably divine methods. I'm short on divine methods!" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. "The more the better, I'm also short on ordinary techniques!"</p><p></p><p>As his strength grew, it became increasingly difficult to advance the Qi Yuan Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Even though he used the power of Pinduoduo to scour techniques from all over the world, he was still severely lacking.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had someone from the upper realm, and a mythical figure at that.</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity... to be fully taken advantage of.</p><p></p><p>Even Shen Wushen could produce several divine methods, so this mythical figure would certainly be able to as well.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jade Maiden handed a jade slip to Qi Yuan without any hesitation: "Senior, this contains 7 divine methods and numerous techniques of other levels recorded on it. If senior needs more, this junior can return to the upper realm to collect more for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. What should I give in exchange?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Jade Maiden looked at Qi Yuan with a smile on her face: "Everything is up to senior's orders!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, she was leaving the choice up to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She was taking a gamble.</p><p></p><p>If the Ten Suns Celestial Lord was generous, she would profit.</p><p></p><p>If he was stingy, then she would lose out.</p><p></p><p>But establishing a connection with such a big shot was ultimately not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, then said: "I'm flat broke right now, I don't have any money. I can't even afford to buy a plot of land. How about this - you collect divine methods for me, and when I have money someday, I'll pay you back?"</p><p></p><p>Money... Qi Yuan was reluctant to part with.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he'd just... grab some dirt from the underworld to settle the account.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's calculations were quite loud.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jade Maiden smiled and said: "This junior is in no hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Being able to connect with such a big shot was already lucky for her, how could she expect more? It's worth noting that in the upper realm, she as a ordinary mythical figure of the Second Heaven didn't even have the qualifications to meet big shots of this level.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jade Maiden approvingly, then thought of something and couldn't help but ask: "Do you have any melons?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Jade Maiden was confused, not understanding what Qi Yuan meant.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't there a saying that jade maidens have no melons? I was just asking randomly," Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary standing to the side covered her mouth and laughed: "She's a jade maiden, not a rain maiden!"</p><p></p><p>Evidently, she had heard this joke from Qi Yuan before.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I remembered wrong," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This inexplicable conversation left Jade Maiden very confused.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Great Wisdom True Lord spoke up from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Her clothes are bulging, probably hiding two melons."</p><p></p><p>Jade Maiden: "..."</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to slap this divine infant boy to death!</p><p></p><p>Was that something a human would say? Did she need to hide two melons to look bigger?</p><p></p><p>However, just then, a look of excitement suddenly appeared in the golden canary's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She lightly hopped over and whispered in Qi Yuan's ear: "The Wind Flow Realm has been found!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes also lit up: "Good!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jade Maiden looked at Qi Yuan and said softly: "If senior is dealing with the great calamity, you must be careful of... the marks on the bodies of your close friends. That Celestial Lord only needs one thought, and all living beings in the Cang Lan Realm will perish."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded: "I'm well aware of this matter. I absolutely will not let them die at the hands of the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>This time, he had become smarter.</p><p></p><p>With the help of Great Wisdom True Lord, he had even made a breakthrough improvement.</p><p></p><p>In the perfect plan of "Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity", he added a backup plan.</p><p></p><p>This kind of progress was leaping, rare, once in ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>In the backup plan, if he didn't obtain the Gate of Ultimate Principles and the great calamity destroyed the Cang Lan beings through the marks, then sorry, Qi Yuan would act first to destroy Cang Lan, waiting for all beings to be reborn in the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough talk. I have urgent business, bye bye."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Flow Realm had been found. This time he would revisit old grounds and find the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>However... Qi Yuan felt some worries in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time and great changes, he didn't know if those old acquaintances were still around.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wind Flow Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a tavern.</p><p></p><p>The storyteller's expression was animated as he spoke, spitting saliva.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that on that day, the Blood Palace Lord led 100,000 supreme beings to charge into the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons. </p><p></p><p>When the blood-colored demon sword came out, all the demons immediately knelt and begged for mercy, with corpses strewn for a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>Even that demoness who had plagued the world could only kneel and beg for mercy.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this Blood Palace Lord had an extraordinary bearing, and his sword-bearing disciple Ling Yayi by his side was even more extraordinary..." The elderly man spoke, his eyes seeming to carry reminiscence of the past.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were few people in the tavern interested in this story.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Nangong, what era is it now? You're still telling these stories?"</p><p></p><p>"Who wants to hear about this Blood Palace Lord? The Blood Palace is ancient history!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, we want to hear about the Buddhist Heir competition!"</p><p></p><p>"We want to hear about the Buddhist Nation's great war!"</p><p></p><p>The diners below all spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the Blood Palace were from tens of thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace had also been like a fleeting blossom, unable to last even a hundred years without the Blood Palace Lord.</p><p></p><p>As for the old affairs of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and the Blood Palace Lord saving the world, they were not spoken of by outsiders.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of today at most treated the events of the past as casual legends.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world was too vast, and time was too cheap.</p><p></p><p>In tens of thousands of years, many exciting stories could occur.</p><p></p><p>No myth, no figure, could remain immortal forever.</p><p></p><p>The storytelling old man sighed with emotion. He was about to say something when suddenly a domineering voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What Blood Palace Lord, he just had some good luck.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, he led a great army into the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>This lord happened to be there! Unfortunately, at that time this lord was only at the Great Supreme realm and was alone.</p><p></p><p>When this Blood Palace Lord entered this lord's territory, this lord naturally didn't want to be humiliated, so I directly peed to declare to the Blood Palace Lord that this was... this lord's territory!</p><p></p><p>Even though he had superior numbers, I was not afraid!"</p><p></p><p>An old man and a young man entered the tavern.</p><p></p><p>The old man was the one who had spoken in the domineering voice, emanating a strong demonic aura.</p><p></p><p>He was a survivor from the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons tens of thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was too far from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Seeing countless supreme beings appear in the sky, he was so scared he wet himself and ran back to the demon realm.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he broke through to the Yin God realm and ascended to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a dog demon.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had broken through to the Yin God realm and recalled the past, he certainly had to rewrite history a bit.</p><p></p><p>How could he have wet himself in fear!</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he was brave. Even facing the overbearing Blood Palace Lord, he still bravely peed to tell the Blood Palace Lord this was his territory.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, all the diners present looked over.</p><p></p><p>However, their gazes all fell on the young figure beside the old man.</p><p></p><p>They saw that young figure wearing Buddhist robes, with a head as smooth and glossy as jade, without a single hair.</p><p></p><p>"Buddhist Heir!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Lightless Buddhist Heir!"</p><p></p><p>All the cultivator diners stood up respectfully, their eyes showing reverence.</p><p></p><p>In today's Wind Flow Realm, who could not be offended? It was the monks! Among the monks, who was the most precious? Naturally it was the Buddhist Heirs.</p><p></p><p>These Buddhist Heirs all came from the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The immortals who came from the upper realm each possessed world-destroying power.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Lightless Buddhist Heir raised his head, his gaze falling on the storytelling old man.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was profound, with a hint of something strange in the depths of his eyes: "Ling Yayi, former member of the Northern Demon Thirteen Demons, disciple of the Blood Palace Lord. This poor monk is quite interested in you. Come with me."</p><p></p><p>His tone brooked no argument, carrying a hint of dominance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the storytelling old man's expression changed slightly, a glimmer of memory flashing through his dejected eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the diners present all changed expression dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Disciple of the Blood Palace Lord? A legendary figure... actually existed!</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking for this old man for?" Ling Yayi patted his clothes, his expression calm, still carrying the arrogance of being the Blood Palace Lord's disciple.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Blood Palace Lord lectured, he was also one of the listeners, and in the front row.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Ling Yayi, people in the Blood Palace might be unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>But speaking of Nangong Big Dog, that was a famous name.</p><p></p><p>"This little monk is quite interested in the Blood Palace Lord." The Lightless Buddhist Heir's gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he wanted to capture the Blood Palace Lord. He very much wanted to research... the power of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>In the Buddhist Nation, the power of reincarnation was a legendary supreme principle that even the Great Sun Radiant Buddha had not been able to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>But... when he looked through ancient texts of the Wind Flow Realm, he discovered that... the Northern Demon Thirteen Demons seemed to have experienced reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The storytelling old man Ling Yayi waved his sleeve dismissively, like a dead pig unafraid of boiling water: "I haven't seen my master in tens of thousands of years. Even if you kill me, my master won't appear. I'm afraid your calculations will come to nothing."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

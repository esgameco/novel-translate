        <h1>Chapter 352</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the middle of the great hall, his expression calm and his voice enchanting, looking like a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>This sentence sounded like that of a compassionate holy father.</p><p></p><p>The others present heard this and all sorts of question marks popped up in their minds.</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince maintained a respectful expression and humbly said: "Mr. Qi is right, this world is too chaotic, there is killing and oppression everywhere. </p><p></p><p>From now on, the royal family will advocate for an end to war.</p><p></p><p>As for Mr. Qi sending grandfathers and grandmothers to people all over the world, the royal family also fully supports this and is willing to serve!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan's words, the Seventh Prince's first sentence was often "Mr. Qi is right."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, your royal family has good judgment." Qi Yuan praised, then laid out his entire plan, "My robot Zero One will be working full-time to create a website during this period.</p><p></p><p>This website will be called 'Grandpa Delivery Network'. Why call it 'Grandpa Delivery Network' instead of 'Grandma Delivery Network'? It's not about gender equality, but because 'Grandma Delivery' could easily be misunderstood as something else.</p><p></p><p>I need this website to be publicized to subjects all over the country.</p><p></p><p>This requires your royal family to help me advertise, try to put it in prime time, oh and it must be shown during the weather forecast."</p><p></p><p>"No problem at all, the royal family can accomplish all of this!" The Seventh Prince answered without any hesitation. </p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan's purpose, he didn't ask about it.</p><p></p><p>How could he ask? Such a powerful person, whatever he says goes.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more issue. After the website is pushed out to people all over the world, they need to send a drop of their blood to me.</p><p></p><p>I will screen them, and if suitable I will send them some grandfathers and grandmothers. If not suitable, I'll still show my great love and take a loss by calling them grandchildren.</p><p></p><p>This is called... fairness. We can't neglect anyone, there must be a response for everything!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>For those whose blood is suitable for inhabitation, directly send grandparents. </p><p></p><p>For those whose blood is not suitable, sorry, can only make an exception and call them grandson or granddaughter, filling the void with simple words.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Seventh Prince instantly understood that this would be an extremely large project.</p><p></p><p>The potential harm could be tens or hundreds of times greater than when the Tianyuan Sect established the Heaven Reversing Formation.</p><p></p><p>After all, giving one's blood to a mysterious cultivator is inherently dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi is right, but... this way, won't some people be unwilling to offer their blood to you?" The Seventh Prince was now completely on Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>"I have no money. If they're unwilling, then we have no fate." Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>He really had no money to give.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't even have money to buy Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, how could there be such a good thing in the world as giving both grandparents and money?</p><p></p><p>"The royal family is willing to provide some funds to assist Mr. Qi." The Seventh Prince gritted his teeth and said seriously, "The national treasury will also set aside some funds to help Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>If we're going to do this, we might as well do it right.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Qi offers to send grandmothers but no one signs up, wouldn't that be very awkward?</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince had already thought about using money to motivate people.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who sends their blood through official channels would receive a 500 subsidy.</p><p></p><p>500 isn't much for rich people.</p><p></p><p>But for ordinary people and the poor, it's still very attractive.</p><p></p><p>So this move would definitely attract many poor people to participate.</p><p></p><p>As for the wealthy, they might not care about this 500 subsidy and not bother with it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean... mostly those who lack money will participate?</p><p>By the way, are there more rich people or poor people in the Qinyuan Kingdom?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't too concerned about the specific process, as long as the result was right.</p><p></p><p>"According to statistics, those with fewer assets are more numerous."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are many people, proceed according to your plan.</p><p>Sigh, I'm such a good person, not only giving people grandfathers, but also giving money." Qi Yuan said smugly, feeling he was a great person.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood beside Qi Yuan, looking at him adoringly.</p><p></p><p>As if whatever he did made her happy.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan looked at the Seventh Prince: "If the blood is compatible, the grandfather or grandmother I send will be a celestial fate."</p><p></p><p>"Celestial fate?" The Seventh Prince's heart stirred, his heartbeat quickening.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the side hall, Wang Kaixiang's expression was rather strange.</p><p></p><p>"The champion of the last Martial Arts Tournament... Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had secretly walked out of the side hall to take a look at the visitor.</p><p></p><p>Using powerful search tools, he was surprised to discover that this person was actually a local from Gongxing, the champion of the last Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p></p><p>This made him quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>How could a mere local, even the champion of the Martial Arts Tournament, be given such importance by the royal family?</p><p></p><p>"His strength... is also very ordinary." He watched the video of the Martial Arts Tournament finals.</p><p></p><p>In the video, Qi Yuan defeated his opponent with one punch, turning him into a bloody mist in the Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p></p><p>Such a punch could be said to transcend the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts indeed has its merits, but at this level, it doesn't even reach Foundation Establishment..." </p><p></p><p>Wang Kaixiang found it very strange.</p><p></p><p>If the celestial way had not descended, perhaps such a powerful martial artist as Qi Yuan would attract the royal family's attention.</p><p></p><p>But now, with celestial cultivators as common as fish in a river, what did Qi Yuan have to offer?</p><p></p><p>"However, judging by the Seventh Prince's attitude towards him, it might be worth making contact. Perhaps he can be used to persuade the royal family about the Heaven Reversing Formation!"</p><p></p><p>Unable to convince the royal family for now, he decided to try other channels.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the main hall, Qi Yuan and the Seventh Prince were discussing the details of the plan.</p><p></p><p>"The plan is perfect, now we just need to implement it." Qi Yuan looked at the Seventh Prince, his eyes filled with approval.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince was talented, supplementing his plan and filling in the gaps.</p><p></p><p>"The royal family will support it with all our strength."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll wait for your good news. I have to go now, bye."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan glanced at Ning Tao, who immediately understood and embraced Qi Yuan. Their figures disappeared in that moment.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>In a private room of a restaurant in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>The deep red wooden table emitted a faint exotic fragrance. In the transparent wine glasses, pale yellow liquid resembled celestial nectar.</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Immortal drank his wine, his expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao held his wine glass, looking at the black-robed figure before him with wariness in his eyes. He chose his words carefully and said softly, "Your plan is indeed tempting, but the Doushen Sect has finally gained a foothold in Qinyuan. We don't want to stir up more conflict."</p><p></p><p>Sitting opposite Jiang Qingjiao was a man with double pupils.</p><p></p><p>This man with double pupils was a demon who had come from Canxing.</p><p></p><p>"You are so cautious simply because you fear the Eye in the Sky.</p><p>Without the Eye in the Sky, what is there to fear in Qinyuan?</p><p>I'm sure you cultivator friends also don't want a group of mortals lording it over us."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Eye in the Sky, the Carefree Immortal was stunned, and Jiang Qingjiao's expression also froze.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely wary of the Eye in the Sky.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that friend has a way to deal with the Eye in the Sky?" Jiang Qingjiao couldn't help but ask as he looked at the double-pupiled man.</p><p></p><p>Based on the double-pupiled man's tone, it seemed he could resolve the issue of the Eye in the Sky.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the double-pupiled man's words,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao somewhat agreed in his heart. They were cultivators, yet they were being suppressed by mortals. </p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable in the Fire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Mortals were nothing but slaves there, to be killed at will.</p><p></p><p>But here, they had to lower themselves and communicate as equals with mortals.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Eye of the Sky is powerful, it's not only the Qinyuan Kingdom that has it on Gongxing," said the man with double pupils, his eyes filled with amusement.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Wu Kingdom!" Jiang Qingjiao looked at the double-pupiled man, instantly understanding where he was from.</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing, there were two major kingdoms - Qinyuan and Ancient Wu.</p><p></p><p>The people of Qinyuan were similar to those in the cultivation world, while those of Ancient Wu were more like a different race.</p><p></p><p>The spatial nodes of the three major cultivation worlds were also in the Qinyuan Kingdom, so they currently only dealt with Qinyuan. As for Ancient Wu, they were still in the process of making contact.</p><p></p><p>"I can barely be considered a member of the Ancient Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>If you're willing to help me, Ancient Wu will go to war with Qinyuan.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Ancient Wu will deal with Qinyuan's Eye of the Sky.</p><p></p><p>We'll also need you fellow Daoists to cooperate in containing them," the double-pupiled man explained his plan.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Qinyuan Kingdom had always been an obstacle to Canxing's ambitions.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Qinyuan had experienced internal turmoil, with thirteen Eyes of the Sky falling. This reignited the ambitions of the war hawks on Canxing.</p><p></p><p>"Is Canxing behind you?" Jiang Qingjiao asked.</p><p></p><p>It was no secret that Canxing was behind the Ancient Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The double-pupiled man nodded.</p><p></p><p>His backing could be considered Canxing, but it wasn't exactly - it was actually the Myriad Beasts Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't tell Jiang Qingjiao this.</p><p></p><p>How could an outsider cultivator who had just arrived on Gongxing know these things?</p><p></p><p>A light flashed in Jiang Qingjiao's eyes: "I need to report this to the Patriarch before I can give you an answer."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a smile flashed across the double-pupiled man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>With these words, he knew that today's plan was secure.</p><p></p><p>"I await your good news," the double-pupiled man said with a smile. "To celebrate the success of our plan, I have a small gift for you all."</p><p></p><p>The double-pupiled man waved his hand, and two drops of golden liquid fell.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sanren and Jiang Qingjiao's breathing suddenly became rapid.</p><p></p><p>"This is Tianfang Beast Blood!"</p><p></p><p>"It's considered a treasure even for Divine Infant realm cultivators, only producible by powerful beasts!" Xiaoyao Sanren's eyes surged with excitement, his breathing quickened, as if he wanted to swallow the Tianfang Beast Blood immediately.</p><p></p><p>Tianfang Beast Blood was refined from the essence blood of powerful beasts.</p><p></p><p>This blood could not only enhance a cultivator's physical strength but also boost their soul power.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, if lucky, even Yuan Dan realm cultivators could awaken supernatural abilities with it.</p><p></p><p>This blood was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>"Just a small gift, not worth mentioning," the double-pupiled man said generously.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to the Ancestral Blood, this cost was negligible.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sanren and Jiang Qingjiao accepted the Tianfang Beast Blood, suppressing the joy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They exchanged a glance, understanding each other without words.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Qingjiao moved closer to the double-pupiled man and said softly, "Since you've given us such a great gift, we're willing to return the favor!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The double-pupiled man responded.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Jiang Qingjiao say, "A few days ago, Elder Xiaoyao Sanren discovered a young boy and girl in this area. He took a liking to them and wanted to take them as disciples.</p><p></p><p>Who knew these two were short-sighted and didn't recognize an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Elder Xiaoyao Sanren was just playing around, acting on a whim.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, in the past few days, we've discovered that this pair has had some strange encounters.</p><p></p><p>Not only do they have spiritual energy and fluctuations of magical power, but it seems they also have..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qingjiao told the double-pupiled man about the recent events surrounding Yaji.</p><p></p><p>"We suspect that there's... a mysterious cultivator's remnant soul in this boy.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious cultivator must have been extraordinary, at least at the Divine Infant realm, possibly even Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>If we... were to search their souls, we would surely gain a rich harvest! Although not as valuable as the Tianfang Beast Blood, it would still be a rare gain."</p><p></p><p>They had been observing the abnormalities in Yaji and his sister for several days.</p><p></p><p>They were almost certain that a great cultivator's remnant soul was residing in the bodies of Yaji and his sister.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sanren and Jiang Qingjiao had become greedy, but they didn't dare to act rashly. They wanted to investigate the identity of the remnant soul's original owner before making a move.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the double-pupiled man here, they decided to offer this opportunity as a gift in return.</p><p></p><p>With the double-pupiled man joining them, they had much more confidence.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was just a remnant soul. Even if it was from a Purple Palace realm cultivator in life, what could it do?</p><p></p><p>How could it resist if the three of them attacked simultaneously?</p><p></p><p>"I'm quite interested in this gift," the double-pupiled man's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a mysterious cultivator's remnant soul on Gongxing was very strange.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gongxing had only been connected to the Three Realms for less than a year.</p><p></p><p>If this mysterious remnant soul was native to Gongxing, it might be related to the Ancestral Blood.</p><p></p><p>If they could search its soul and gain information about the Ancestral Blood, he would hit the jackpot.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, why don't the three of us join forces and divide the remnant soul?" Jiang Qingjiao suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Good," the double-pupiled man nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sanren didn't hesitate at all and quickly nodded as well.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had pursued a carefree lifestyle, willing to waste time on Yaji and his sister, which indeed aligned with the way of being carefree.</p><p></p><p>But when the benefits were too high, sometimes it was better not to be so carefree.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he frowned: "I've heard that the master of Yaji and his sister has some connection with the nobility in the military. If we act rashly, won't we..."</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sanren was, after all, an independent cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The fate of that Divine Infant realm demon cultivator was still fresh in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This world did have the Eye of the Sky.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter. Just an ordinary noble, not even one of the Seven Star Warriors, won't care about us.</p><p></p><p>Besides, if we act quickly, kill Yaji and his sister, and then kill that person named Qi Yuan, we can create some accidents. Wouldn't that solve everything?" Jiang Qingjiao had already planned it out.</p><p></p><p>With a little skill, they could make it look like Qi Yuan died of a sudden heart attack. Those nobles wouldn't be able to detect anything.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Seven Star Warrior families, other nobles were no different from ordinary mortals in the eyes of these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, in the Military Security Residential Area, Ning Tao, who had been eating watermelon, raised her eyebrows slightly. She looked at Qi Yuan in the distance, a hint of an ambiguous smile appearing in her eyes: "Husband, I just heard that someone is plotting to kill you."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Qi Yuan's eyes widened, "Who has such audacity to break the law like this!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very innocent.</p><p></p><p>He had always been kind.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had been busy bringing warmth to the world.</p><p></p><p>As a result, someone wanted to kill him! He felt so wronged.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see who has such evil intentions," Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Ning Tao, who had been wearing a spaghetti strap dress, suddenly had an exquisite black dress covering her body completely.</p><p></p><p>She embraced Qi Yuan, and their figures flashed away.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

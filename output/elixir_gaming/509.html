        <h1>Chapter 509</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Riding on the well-fed Chen Kang, the two of them headed towards Kunling Ford.</p><p></p><p>The mountain path was rugged, climbing upwards, with many ferns seen along the cliffs.</p><p></p><p>However, the Kunling Ford side was too remote and dangerous, and no farm women came to collect wild vegetables.</p><p></p><p>Soon, with Chen Kang in a "blessed" state, he strode swiftly, bringing Qi Yuan to Kunling Ford.</p><p></p><p>Kunling Ford, eerily quiet, only the chirping of grasshoppers could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, it seems there has been a big battle here, is it from the previous commotion?" Chen Kang thought, looking fearfully at the ruins-like Kunling Ford ahead.</p><p></p><p>The entire Kunling Ford seemed to have been split open by a giant's sword.</p><p></p><p>Muddy, swampy, the undergrowth was severely damaged, and in the distance, a foul stench wafted over.</p><p></p><p>"Put on my gas mask, and take our equipment, carry me in!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was still quite weak now.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even defeat an ordinary adult.</p><p></p><p>Crossing such a Kunling Ford would be like seeking death.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Chen Kang put on the gas mask.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also put one on himself, suddenly, he glanced at Chen Kang, with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like we're going to a rave party?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it to the mountain over there?"</p><p></p><p>Ah, on the Blue Star, some groups of people often go to the mountains for wild parties, he didn't know if they wore masks or not.</p><p></p><p>"What is a 'rave party'?" Chen Kang couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask about things that don't concern you, let's go, let's take a look inside Kunling Ford."</p><p></p><p>Before coming here, Qi Yuan had prepared many props and talismans.</p><p>All were self-made.</p><p></p><p>Fully equipped with these talismans and props, Chen Kang carried Qi Yuan and entered Kunling Ford with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two stopped in front of a pool.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a pool, a pool of traces.</p><p></p><p>These traces were left by Elder Black Crow, his body had been melted by that beam of light sword, leaving almost nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>A perfectly fine person, suddenly disappeared, leaving almost no trace in this world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan was deeply saddened: "You died so miserably! I can't even properly take care of your legacy, wuwu!"</p><p></p><p>The legacy was all gone, Qi Yuan was very sad.</p><p>He was always happy to help others.</p><p></p><p>White Moonlight died, he was also willing to be the old ox to take care of their legacy.</p><p>He wouldn't let their legacy suffer the slightest injustice.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the bad news came, the enemy was too ruthless, not leaving a single coin.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, don't be sad, there are good things over there!" Chen Kang pointed to the place where the winged snake had died.</p><p></p><p>The winged snake was ultimately much stronger, and there were many good things on its body.</p><p>Even though it died, there were still some legacies left.</p><p></p><p>"What good things, am I that kind of person? I'm just worried that their belongings haven't been properly taken care of!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Some people, after killing someone, are concerned about the widows of the deceased.</p><p>Qi Yuan was different, he was concerned about the deceased's belongings.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and let me take a look, it's so hot, we can't let them get spoiled."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang carried Qi Yuan and ran towards the remaining body of the winged snake.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Black Crow, the winged snake left behind more things.</p><p></p><p>A smooth bone.</p><p>A fragment of a mid-grade talisman.</p><p>A broken storage talisman.</p><p>A wooden box.</p><p></p><p>The bone was the inverted scale bone of the winged snake, which was the hardest part of its entire body.</p><p>Slashed by the giant sword, its entire body melted, leaving only this fist-sized bone.</p><p></p><p>The fragment of the mid-grade talisman, now useless, Qi Yuan picked it up, it could only be used as material.</p><p></p><p>As for the storage talisman, he was quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully there are some good things."</p><p></p><p>As a result, when Qi Yuan opened the storage talisman, his face was full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Empty, nothing?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Such a large storage talisman, and it has nothing in it?"</p><p></p><p>This storage talisman was very large, big enough to hold several large trucks.</p><p></p><p>But it was completely empty.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the winged snake was carrying this storage bag for.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's not a total loss, this kind of storage talisman is worth as much as a mid-grade talisman, worth a few to tens of thousands taels."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry down there, I'll take care of your belongings."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up the storage talisman, his gaze falling on the last wooden box.</p><p></p><p>The box was made of an unknown material, only the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>Under that powerful sword strike, it was still intact.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan quite expectant.</p><p></p><p>"This must be a treasure, I hit the jackpot."</p><p></p><p>[The strange box, given to you by Guan Zhu, was finally tricked away by Black Crow.]</p><p></p><p>"Wait... this is my box?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes, full of surprise.</p><p></p><p>He immediately thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>The Light Glory Sect's Method Thirteen's scheme to harm the son-in-law Qi Yuan was because Qi Yuan had given something to others.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, the son-in-law Qi Yuan did give it away, giving the thing to Black Crow.</p><p></p><p>"My thing..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no interest in regaining it, but rather felt a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>"The winged snake came from afar, probably to escort this wooden box, it seems the thing is not ordinary."</p><p></p><p>As I descended from the divine, Qi Yuan had some understanding of the identities of the winged snake and Black Crow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the wooden box and easily opened it, which surprised him quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>After all, this wooden box withstood that powerful strike without being destroyed, it should not be that easy to open.</p><p></p><p>Inside the wooden box, a wooden tablet lay quietly, like a bookmark.</p><p></p><p>On the front of the wooden tablet, a special pattern was carved, with the faint words "Wooden" on it, and the words "Xuanmix" were written on the back.</p><p></p><p>It looked quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Wooden... Xuanmix... What does it mean?" Qi Yuan pondered, but couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>[The Divine Wood Token, take it to the Divine Wood Abyss, collect three items, and you can open the Divine Wood Abyss.]</p><p></p><p>"A game special prop, collect to unlock a dungeon?"</p><p></p><p>This should be a precious item.</p><p></p><p>He held the Divine Wood Token and looked at it carefully.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an urgent and mournful female voice came from the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>Just one word, appearing and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes: "Who's talking?"</p><p></p><p>He used his own superpower to communicate with the voice he heard.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that voice was like an auditory hallucination, it didn't really exist.</p><p></p><p>"Was it my illusion?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what are you saying, can you say it again, flee what?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself, but still didn't get an answer.</p><p></p><p>His attention returned to the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness also delved into the Divine Wood Token again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a string of text appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? Hurry and flee, the Thorns of Blood is recklessly hunting down the holders of the Divine Wood Token!"</p><p></p><p>Chat group? QQ?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan was very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Wood Token also has a messaging function.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a kitchen knife, was it you who told me to flee just now? What is this Divine Wood Token, do you know where the Divine Wood Abyss is?</p><p>Do you also have a Divine Wood Token?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked four questions in one go.</p><p></p><p>The other side was silent for a while, seeming a bit wary.</p><p></p><p>"You're not one of the Thorns of Blood?" The other side seemed a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>If it was someone from the Thorns of Blood, they shouldn't need to ask these questions.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better flee, the Thorns of Blood is hunting down the holders of the Divine Wood Token all over the Blue Mountain Realm, there are probably only a few Divine Wood Token holders still alive, hiding here and there.</p><p></p><p>Hurry and leave the Blue Mountain Realm, the Thorns of Blood's tentacles are too deep here...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Too dangerous! It's not safe at all!"</p><p></p><p>The other party seemed anxious and a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>"Where can I run? I'm still playing the game right now! </p><p></p><p>This token, I just killed two old men from the Thorny Blood to get it. What is its use? Tell me about it." Qi Yuan began to inquire the plot NPC.</p><p></p><p>The other party remained silent, as if somewhat unbelieving.</p><p></p><p>"You killed the people of Thorny Blood and obtained the Sacred Wood Token?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"In the Qingshan Realm, there is a forbidden land called the Sacred Wood Abyss, which is the only sacred place in the hearts of all Artifact Masters.</p><p></p><p>In the Sacred Wood Abyss, there is a sacred tree, whose branches and leaves are the most precious forging materials in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Many legendary divine weapons in the world are forged from the sacred tree.</p><p></p><p>The materials of the sacred tree can even forge existences that surpass divine weapons!"</p><p></p><p>The person across seemed very fanatical, full of expectations for the sacred tree.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so it's a treasure vault." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"You are powerful, quickly leave the Qingshan Realm, don't let the Thorny Blood get your Sacred Wood Token, otherwise... Once they collect three, the Thorny Blood will be able to enter the Sacred Wood Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"The Thorny Blood has ambitions, they don't want to take the sacred tree materials, but to turn the sacred tree into a Devilish Spirit! Once the sacred tree becomes a Devilish Spirit, a terrifying Devilish Spirit that surpasses the divine level will be born, and the entire Qingshan Realm will be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." Qi Yuan was very calm.</p><p></p><p>For the other party, this might be a world-destroying event.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, he had heard too much and was unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Thorny Blood also have the Sacred Wood Token?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean they can see our conversation?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a new message appeared in Qi Yuan's vision.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've been watching you... how you plan to resist me." A Thorny Blood staff member spoke.</p><p></p><p>"..." Ji Wuyun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>It's like talking behind someone's back in a group, only to find the person is in the group.</p><p></p><p>But his skin was thick: "How about we cooperate and go into the Sacred Wood Abyss together?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly made the invitation.</p><p></p><p>This statement made Ji Wuyun stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood staff member also had an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>"No, the Thorny Blood is powerful, they even have the legendary Divine Armament Master. If we cooperate and enter the Sacred Wood Abyss, and they turn against us, we will surely die!" Ji Wuyun hurriedly persuaded, very anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Knife Brother, you're quite interesting, this cooperation... I agree." The Thorny Blood staff member spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Minority obeys the majority, do you want to join us?" Qi Yuan issued the invitation.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun remained silent and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he suspected that Qi Yuan was also from the Thorny Blood, fishing for information.</p><p></p><p>"Knife Brother, since he doesn't want to, we can go to the Sacred Wood Abyss first. Maybe by the time it opens, there will be other Sacred Wood Token holders who will go, and we can enter the Sacred Wood Abyss together." The Thorny Blood staff member invited, "It's estimated that there are less than two years until the next opening of the Sacred Wood Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, this... I want to go, but I don't have travel expenses, can you give me some silver as travel expenses?" Qi Yuan wanted to freeload.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood staff member paused, then said, "Where are you now?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you already know?" Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>It won't be long before the Thorny Blood gets the news that the Winged Snake Elder died here.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Knife Brother, wait a moment, I'll look up the members of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>Then you can take the token and go find these members.</p><p></p><p>As long as you mention the token, they will give you all their savings and silver." The Thorny Blood staff member said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that he didn't care about the lives of those members at all.</p><p>Or perhaps he was more interested in the Sacred Wood Token on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Great, I have travel expenses now." Qi Yuan was very happy, "Finally, can I ask one more question, do you Thorny Blood have a lot of unwashed old men and old women?"</p><p></p><p>"Knife Brother, what are you asking this for?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm lacking some high-quality white moonlight, sigh." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Knife Brother, you're joking."</p><p></p><p>The other party didn't respond anymore.</p><p></p><p>The group was deathly silent, no one responded to Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"The silent ones are dogs!"</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Profound Realm, he had cursed with the Holy Light Clan for a long time, and now Qi Yuan's cursing skills were terrifying, enough to break through their defenses.</p><p></p><p>"Don't lurk, I know an old man whose urine is very yellow, it's about to overflow!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, looking at Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cry rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu... old servant..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao, the old man, was bent over, biting the bone left by the Winged Snake.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't the sound of the bone breaking, but the sound of his teeth shattering.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw that Chen Kangbao's lips were closed, dark and black, as if he had eaten hundreds of mulberries.</p><p></p><p>"Young master... I'm poisoned!" Chen Kangbao's mouth could not open, he could only speak through his throat, sounding like a toad. He looked terrified, afraid to death.</p><p></p><p>"You really eat anything, aren't you the Desolate Heavenly Emperor?" Qi Yuan looked at Chen Kangbao speechlessly, "Don't worry, this poison won't kill you, it's just that your mouth... won't be able to open or close for seven or eight days, and you won't be able to speak."</p><p></p><p>"No!" Chen Kangbao looked utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>In this state, how could he eat!</p><p></p><p>Grandpa's belly is hungry!" Quickly carry me back, in case the Thorny Blood people come, we won't be able to run!" Qi Yuan was too lazy to listen to Chen Kangbao's nonsense.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing now is to escape.</p><p></p><p>Now that his strength has not recovered, he needs to hide in the Shen Mansion first, and after his strength recovers, he will dare to wander around.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in front of a pile of forging materials, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>"I'm weak, I can't forge as well as before, old man, come help me hammer the materials." Qi Yuan called Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, wait a moment, old servant is eating, it'll be done soon!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Kangbao had several bowls of porridge and a few large meat buns on the table.</p><p></p><p>There were two straws inserted into his nose, and he was frantically sucking.</p><p></p><p>The cold porridge and bun filling were going through the straws, down his throat.</p><p></p><p>That's right, since his mouth was poisoned and couldn't open, he was eating through his nose.</p><p></p><p>(Purely fictional, do not imitate!) But the efficiency of eating through the nose was really too low, and Chen Kangbao was a big glutton, spending half the day eating.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want me to drill two holes in your face?" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a message came in the silent group.</p><p></p><p>"Knife Brother, in Ningguo, we Thorny Blood have not many members, a total of 372.</p><p></p><p>This is their personal information and token. According to this information, you find them, say the token, and they will give you all the silver they have on them." The Thorny Blood staff member sent the message.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks." Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the lurking Ji Wuyun finally appeared, sending a few question marks.</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid he'll kill your Thorny Blood members and steal their silver?"</p><p></p><p>"Death is also a destination, their corpses will become a Devilish Spirit in dozens or hundreds of years." The Thorny Blood staff member replied.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun saw this and felt that these two were both lunatics, unable to understand their mindset.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I'll go see who's closest to me now, I'll go borrow some silver." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

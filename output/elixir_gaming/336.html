        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The red "double happiness" character looked especially festive.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow..."</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu shook her body vigorously, seemingly very displeased with the "double happiness" character on her back.</p><p></p><p>She felt very wronged inside.</p><p></p><p>During the time Qi Yuan was away, she had been badly mistreated by the robot Zero One. </p><p></p><p>She really wanted to report Zero One for abusing cats.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it not let her film videos every day, it also restricted her access to catnip.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how much she meowed, Qi Yuan couldn't understand her.</p><p></p><p>As she kept meowing, she felt a chill in her womb.</p><p></p><p>If she could regain her true form, how could she be so miserable? Would she still need to bow and scrape before Qi Yuan? It's more likely the dog owner would have to bow and scrape before her, an immortal master.</p><p></p><p>"What an adorable cat!" Goldfinch looked at Xie Xinsu, her eyes revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>She lightly tapped with her finger.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu's body seemed to lose control and fell into Goldfinch's hands.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu felt a bit dizzy. Immortal magic? </p><p></p><p>Why didn't she sense any spiritual energy fluctuations? This move must be at least late stage Qi Refinement, right? Her body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>An immortal cultivator had appeared here? From which world?</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu became alert and started to carefully examine Goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>After just one look, she was stunned.</p><p></p><p>This woman's beauty alone was otherworldly.</p><p></p><p>And she could use immortal magic.</p><p></p><p>How on earth did this dog owner manage to marry such an immortal maiden?</p><p></p><p>But then she thought of how handsome the owner was, and understood.</p><p></p><p>Alas, those who have just embarked on the immortal path are easily dazzled by worldly things, unlike herself who had long transcended the mortal realm as a great Yuan Dan cultivator! Xie Xinsu couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>However, the other being a cultivator was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>When she regained some of her powers later, she would be able to communicate.</p><p></p><p>If she leaked just a little from her fingertips, it would surely make this couple worship her as an enlightened master.</p><p></p><p>At that time, would the robot Zero One still dare to boss her around?</p><p></p><p>Catnip - she could sniff as much as she wanted for as long as she wanted! Filming videos? She'd go on strike and become the supervisor instead.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu happily fantasized.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch petted the cat for a while, looking quite delighted.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Goldfinch followed Qi Yuan back to his room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan called out softly: "Xiao Jia."</p><p></p><p>With his voice, a bridal gown suddenly appeared in the room.</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in Goldfinch's eyes, then she smiled and blinked: "Is this big sister Xiao Jia?"</p><p></p><p>She had heard Qi Yuan mention Xiao Jia before, and knew the story between Qi Yuan and Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>"She's very special," Goldfinch said, an unusual gleam flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is special," Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"The special you, the special her, the special me... why don't we go get our marriage certificate tomorrow?" Qi Yuan looked at Goldfinch and Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>A wooden sign with a happy face slid out from Xiao Jia's cold sleeve.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that no matter what Qi Yuan said, she was always happy.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch leaned her body against Qi Yuan and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But... the three of us getting a marriage certificate together... isn't that illegal?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked worried.</p><p></p><p>As for morality and such, Qi Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>The bottom line needed to be flexible.</p><p></p><p>The important thing was whether it was illegal.</p><p></p><p>"How about this - I'll wear big sister Xiao Jia, and then we'll get the certificate together?" Goldfinch had a clever idea.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, looking at Goldfinch: "I didn't expect you to be so smart."</p><p></p><p>But then he shook his head: "That's not good. For this kind of thing, it's better to be open and aboveboard.</p><p></p><p>We can't have Xiao Jia without a place at the wedding ceremony, can we?"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan had always been law-abiding,</p><p></p><p>For the sake of family, it was okay to be a little willful.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to pull some strings and talk to狂欢," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 was a nobleman.</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Yuan country, nobles had very high social status and enjoyed privileges.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 also had extensive connections. Helping him get a marriage certificate would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan dialed 狂欢's number.</p><p></p><p>At this time in the hotel, 狂欢 was absentmindedly watching TV.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally he looked at the sun in the sky through the window, grinning foolishly.</p><p></p><p>The gentle young woman looked at her husband, her eyes revealing a helpless expression: "The experts said not to look too much at the extra sun in the sky, or you'll become forgetful!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you know, who cares about being forgetful!" 狂欢 looked at the sun in the sky again, grinning as if it were a peerless beauty.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had been trapped in an iron fortress.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the sun appear in the sky, he was both surprised and excited.</p><p></p><p>Although under house arrest, he ate heartily.</p><p></p><p>Not long after being confined, he was personally invited out.</p><p></p><p>The person who invited him out had come from the capital, not someone comparable to the one from the military camp.</p><p></p><p>Coming in person to apologize, with all kinds of soft words.</p><p></p><p>This was something 狂欢 had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>Later, he learned about the referendum, and heard about the fall of the Mu family's thirteen Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>He laughed, and felt even more admiration for Mr. Qi in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Stars? Mere insects in Mr. Qi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sky Eyes? Terrifying weapons capable of slaying gods? Mere toys!</p><p></p><p>Someone like Mr. Qi... was truly a figure standing at the pinnacle of the world.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the world was just... a game.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Mr. Qi often mentioned games, NPCs, settings, and plots.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, for someone like that, wasn't this world just a large-scale game?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, 狂欢 was both delighted and anxious.</p><p></p><p>To use an inappropriate analogy, it was like a young wife suddenly discovering her husband was the supreme ruler, delighted but realizing the husband hadn't favored her in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the "Special Care" ringtone sounded, and 狂欢's eyebrows twitched.</p><p></p><p>On the soft chair not far away, the gentle woman saw her husband's expression and felt sour: "Aiya, you haven't even set me as 'Special Care'."</p><p></p><p>"How can it be the same? Be quiet!" 狂欢 glared at his wife and carefully answered the phone.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the gentle woman smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi." 狂欢 held the phone as if cradling a thousand-year-old cultural relic, his back unconsciously bending.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Qi Yuan on the other end of the phone was right beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Why is your voice trembling, you're not exercising, are you? Don't tell me... I've interrupted something?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>狂欢's face changed slightly: "No, no!"</p><p></p><p>He was very anxious, afraid Qi Yuan would misunderstand.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, otherwise if I ruined your mood, I'd feel bad about asking for your help with something," Qi Yuan said unhurriedly on the other end.</p><p></p><p>These words didn't sound like they came from the mouth of a supreme expert at all.</p><p></p><p>But 狂欢 had dealt with Qi Yuan before, and he knew this person had an attitude of playing with the world.</p><p></p><p>"Please instruct me, Mr. Qi!" His attitude became even more humble.</p><p></p><p>Working for Mr. Qi was his honor, enough to bring glory to his ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I say before that when the sun appeared in the sky, I would get married?" </p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Mr. Qi!" 狂欢's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>So everything Mr. Qi said was true.</p><p></p><p>His wife really did come down from the sun.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>His wife must be extraordinarily charming and peerlessly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"We plan to go get our marriage certificate tomorrow, but... there's a small problem," Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even someone so powerful needed a marriage certificate? But then he thought, don't try to guess the thoughts of the powerful.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted a certificate, so be it.</p><p></p><p>"How may I be of service?"</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, I want to marry two wives this time, and get the certificate together," Qi Yuan stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, 狂欢 was stunned, shocked.</p><p></p><p>Two wives?</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Marrying two wives sounded strange, but... it wasn't that unusual.</p><p></p><p>How many wealthy and powerful people openly married two, or even more.</p><p></p><p>Buying several buildings in a neighborhood, with all their wives living in them.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing wasn't uncommon.</p><p></p><p>The key was, Mr. Qi was different.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi's wife was a super powerful being! A woman who came down from the sun, just hearing about it was impressive.</p><p></p><p>This kind of powerful person...</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, does she know you want to marry two?" 狂欢 asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he helped, he would be killed by Mr. Qi's wife.</p><p></p><p>"She knows," Qi Yuan said puzzledly, "What, do you suspect I'm deceiving young girls, committing marriage fraud?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no!" 狂欢 hurriedly explained, "I'll go take care of it for Mr. Qi right away."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right, neither of my wives have ID cards or ID photos, can you help me take care of that too!"</p><p></p><p>"Certainly!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot, taking ID photos requires the person to be present. Let me know when, and I'll go with my wives.</p><p></p><p>Oh... that won't work, we're getting the certificate tomorrow, there's not enough time. Ah... it's so troublesome, getting ID cards, getting the marriage certificate, having to go twice.</p><p></p><p>Can't we do it all together?!" Qi Yuan was very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 was also a bit speechless inside.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to say, you don't need to come out, I'll just send the ID cards and marriage certificates over, you don't even need ID photos.</p><p></p><p>But after all, this was Mr. Qi, with his unusual way of thinking, so he didn't dare to contradict.</p><p></p><p>"We can do both certificates together.</p><p></p><p>I'll give the staff a red envelope.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi and his wives just need to come out near the neighborhood!"</p><p></p><p>狂欢 decided to move the civil affairs bureau and police station to outside Qi Yuan's neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>"Really? As expected of a nobleman, you really have connections.</p><p></p><p>By the way, how much are you planning to put in the red envelope? I can't let you pay for this, tell me an amount and I'll cover it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, 狂欢 felt a toothache, but finally said: "999?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare say too high or too low an amount.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, my savings have decreased by 999 again, I'm a bit further from buying Gong Xing," Qi Yuan said with some heartache.</p><p></p><p>It's not easy to make money in this era.</p><p></p><p>Job postings say the salary is 5000 to 9000, no mistake, it's 5000 for sure.</p><p></p><p>But look online, no mistake, the average salary is 9000.</p><p></p><p>狂欢 smiled wryly, not daring to respond to Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The early morning sunlight was warm.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong drove the car, looking content: "Sigh, with an extra sun in the sky, it feels like the temperature has risen."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou sat in the passenger seat, seriously reading a newspaper.</p><p></p><p>"I heard spiritual energy has been reviving recently. Do you think this sun that appeared in the sky might be some mythical great power?" Wang Tong looked at the sky thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou, who had been seriously reading the newspaper, paused: "You young people have such shallow experience, you're too easily fooled by marketing accounts. How could there be any spiritual energy revival in this world? It's all fake. Demons, ghosts, immortals, they're all fake. We must believe in science."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, then how do you explain the extra sun in the sky?" Wang Tong said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"This shows the importance of reading more. </p><p></p><p>Look, the newspaper says the extra sun in the sky isn't a real sun, it's some kind of sunspot phenomenon, some kind of reflection." Zhao Longshou handed the newspaper to Wang Tong.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong pouted: "What bullshit experts, speaking ambiguously, obviously just fooling people.</p><p></p><p>Didn't an expert mistake a cat for a rabbit last time?"</p><p></p><p>"It's no use explaining to you young people." Zhao Longshou couldn't be bothered to say more.</p><p></p><p>There was no point arguing about this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Tong also didn't want to make the relationship with her colleague too tense.</p><p></p><p>She asked: "Which powerful family do you think is keeping a mistress today? Making us come process documents?"</p><p></p><p>"These things are not for us to question, just follow the procedures," Zhao Longshou said, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, the leader had repeatedly instructed that they must serve that person well.</p><p></p><p>Talk less, do more, don't ask what shouldn't be asked.</p><p></p><p>The leader also said that if they offended that person, they should prepare their coffins.</p><p></p><p>You should know that once you become a civil servant, you're basically set for life, unless you make a big mistake, you can't be fired.</p><p></p><p>But now coffins were being mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou also realized that this powerful person must be very special, belonging to the kind with overwhelming power and influence.</p><p></p><p>"I heard they want to process two marriage certificates. Another day of envying the powerful.</p><p></p><p>When will I be able to have two husbands?" Wang Tong thought randomly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou smiled without saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>At around 9 AM, Zhao Longshou and Wang Tong arrived at the new office address.</p><p></p><p>This would be their workplace for today.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived, they found staff from other departments as well.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging greetings and chatting briefly, Wang Tong ran back to the room and whispered to Zhao Longshou: "The powerful person is the wife, and she doesn't even have an ID card. Could she be some fugitive, or maybe some heiress who faked her death?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong had watched many TV shows and immediately imagined many scenarios.</p><p></p><p>For example, powerful person A falls in love with heiress B, but heiress B is engaged to powerful person C.</p><p></p><p>So she fakes her death to escape the marriage.</p><p></p><p>"Your guesses are a bit far-fetched. You might as well say she's... an alien!" Zhao Longshou said casually.</p><p></p><p>"An alien?" Wang Tong's eyes lit up, "You've given me a new idea. Could this person... not be human? Like some kind of demon, ghost, or even a fairy.</p><p></p><p>With the spiritual energy revival coming, anything is possible."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong rambled on.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou held his head: "Enough about spiritual energy revival. When we're out, I don't even dare say you're my colleague."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't say that. I really think it's possible!" Wang Tong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Get to work, tidy up a bit. That person will be here this afternoon, and you'll be able to see... the demons and monsters you want to see." Zhao Longshou laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you old fossil, you old stubborn mule. No wonder they say online that once people reach 35, they can't accept new things."</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. When you reach a certain age, you'll understand. You'll realize how naive your younger self was." Zhao Longshou said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Is this Li Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Qi Yuan, what's up?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wang Xu, I'm getting married... the wedding ceremony..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Tomorrow, I'll definitely take time off to come!"</p><p></p><p>"Wuqi, will you come to my wedding ceremony..."</p><p></p><p>"Dr. Zhong Niao, my wedding ceremony is tomorrow..."</p><p></p><p>In the hospital, a woman wearing a doctor's uniform received a call from a patient, and her mind went blank for a moment.</p><p></p><p>An handsome face instantly appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"You're... getting married?" Zhong Niao asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!"</p><p></p><p>"Does she know you have some mental issues? Qi Yuan, you can't... harm other girls, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao's mind was in turmoil, jumping to conclusions. </p><p></p><p>"There's nothing wrong with my mental state," Qi Yuan said unhappily on the other end of the phone.</p><p></p><p>For a wedding ceremony, you need to invite some people to make it lively.</p><p></p><p>But he had no relatives.</p><p></p><p>The canary and Little Bride also had no relatives besides him.</p><p></p><p>So this banquet... couldn't even fill one table, quite meager.</p><p></p><p>That's why he thought of inviting more people.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Zhong Niao asked a few questions, feeling quite conflicted.</p><p></p><p>After hanging up, she sat in her office with a melancholy expression: "How can someone with mental illness get married? </p><p></p><p>This is clearly harming a girl!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao felt somewhat indignant.</p><p></p><p>She had seen this kind of thing many times before.</p><p></p><p>If she encountered it, she would feel quite upset.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a bold idea emerged in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than harming others, why not harm me!"</p><p></p><p>When this thought appeared, Zhong Niao was startled, her face turning a bit red.</p><p></p><p>But then she covered her head with a pained expression: "Maybe I should change jobs. After spending too much time with mental patients, I'm starting to show symptoms too.</p><p></p><p>Plus that dream... I haven't slept well in a long time."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao in her red dress, his eyes revealing a trace of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Used to seeing Ning Tao in black dresses, seeing her in a red dress for the first time had a different kind of charm.</p><p></p><p>If Ning Tao in a black dress was coldly alluring, and the canary was coquettishly charming, then she in a red dress had a hint of cold beauty.</p><p></p><p>Different attributes appearing in one person at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Finished making the calls?" Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan, sitting quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I notified everyone. We should be able to fill one table, right?" There should still be some sense of ceremony.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go get the marriage certificate with Little Bride." Ning Tao's breath was fragrant.</p><p></p><p>"Mm... how did she become 'little sister'?"</p><p></p><p>Before, when she was the canary, didn't she call Little Bride "big sister"?</p><p></p><p>"This servant... likes it." Ning Tao gave Qi Yuan a flirtatious glance, full of charm.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect you have multiple personality disorder, but I have no proof." Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he knew that the canary and Ning Tao were the same person.</p><p></p><p>Such behavior was not two people coexisting in one body.</p><p></p><p>A more apt description would be acting, or rather, two forms.</p><p></p><p>If the canary wanted to be bolder, she would let Ning Tao come out.</p><p></p><p>The canary character then acted as a little follower.</p><p></p><p>"This servant does not have multiple personality disorder." Ning Tao smiled, "Husband... let me test you."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"Today, my left leg and right leg have different decorations.</p><p></p><p>The left leg was decorated by the canary; the right leg was decorated by this servant.</p><p></p><p>Husband, guess what decorations are on the left and right legs."</p><p></p><p>As Ning Tao spoke, she sat upright, her legs pressed together, completely covered by the red long dress.</p><p></p><p>"The left... the canary? Hmm... white stockings?" Qi Yuan guessed.</p><p></p><p>White stockings would suit the canary's style better.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... you guessed wrong."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ning Tao pulled up the hem of her skirt. Under the tightly covered skirt, the girl's long slender legs were revealed.</p><p></p><p>Black stockings tightly wrapped her legs, with the edges of the stockings pulled up to the roots of her thighs. Perhaps the stockings were a bit tight, as shallow marks were left on her thighs where the flesh was squeezed.</p><p></p><p>"The canary said husband likes it."</p><p></p><p>As Ning Tao spoke, she also rested her long jade legs on Qi Yuan's lap.</p><p></p><p>Five delicate white jade toes curled inside the black stockings, pink and adorable, like white jade.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's left foot pressed against Qi Yuan's lower abdomen, revealing a playful expression.</p><p></p><p>"I won't guess wrong about the right side, it must be white stockings!"</p><p></p><p>Since the canary chose black stockings, Ning Tao must have chosen white stockings.</p><p></p><p>"Husband guessed half right." Ning Tao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be flesh-colored stockings?"</p><p></p><p>"No..." Ning Tao said, pulling up the skirt on the right side.</p><p></p><p>"...You really did guess half right."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, she wasn't wearing stockings.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's legs were excessively snow-white, with a kind of sickly beauty. Her toes were pressed together like young lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>Not wearing white stockings, it was even better than white stockings.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... do you like it?" Ning Tao was still bold.</p><p></p><p>If it were the canary, she could never say such words.</p><p></p><p>As Ning Tao spoke, her bare foot explored towards Qi Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instinctively grasped it.</p><p></p><p>The petite and delicate Ning Tao naturally had small and dainty feet, like a work of art. Qi Yuan could hold them in one hand, gently caressing them.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's face turned slightly red, a layer of mist welling up in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... would it be too rushed if we did everything after getting the marriage certificate?"</p><p></p><p>She moved closer to Qi Yuan, sitting her whole body on top of him, her red dress draping over his thighs.</p><p></p><p>Her coquettish eyes examined Qi Yuan. She lightly bit her vermilion lips - even without makeup, she was as beautiful as snow and coldly alluring.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's thighs - one side smooth as jade, like the finest silk in the world; the other side with the texture of black stockings.</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat expectant, and also a bit shy, but she still boldly said: "What the canary doesn't dare to do, I will!"</p><p></p><p>As she finished speaking, the young woman's moist red lips drew closer.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm..." At this moment, Qi Yuan was exceptionally calm, or rather... not calm at all.</p><p></p><p>His hand involuntarily reached past the hem of her dress, gently lifting Ning Tao up.</p><p></p><p>A sly look flashed in Ning Tao's eyes: "Why don't we... go get the marriage certificate a bit later."</p><p></p><p>"What you say... makes some sense." Qi Yuan didn't hesitate at all, savoring, depriving, making up for what hadn't been done with the canary before.</p><p></p><p>In the illusion of Jiupan Mountain, the past pain had all turned to clouds and mist.</p><p></p><p>Now was what was most worth cherishing.</p><p></p><p>Clothes slipped off, the long dress tore, and in an instant there was boundless charm.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, you're not doing so well, why don't this servant... change into a black dress?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood droplets... be gentler..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's almost dark, when is this person coming?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong sat in the new office, feeling extremely bored.</p><p></p><p>They said afternoon, but now it was almost dark.</p><p></p><p>"Stop complaining, I asked the leader. The leader said if that person doesn't come, we'll just keep working here until he comes to get the marriage certificate." Zhao Longshou put down his newspaper, not at all anxious.</p><p></p><p>What's the difference where they work?</p><p></p><p>It's more leisurely here anyway.</p><p></p><p>After all, there's no chance for promotion anywhere, right?</p><p></p><p>"Then he'd better never come, this place is good for slacking off." Wang Tong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she was just joking around. That was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly a message came through.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong's expression changed slightly: "They're here!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou quickly stood up, his expression also becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, follow the simplified procedure. Take a photo, then just make the certificate!" Zhao Longshou instructed again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll take the photo!" Wang Tong waved happily.</p><p></p><p>Today she might get to eat some juicy gossip about powerful people again.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong would take the photo, he was responsible for pasting the photo onto the marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>It was that simple.</p><p></p><p>As for the seal, it had already been stamped.</p><p></p><p>The other procedures were also waived.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, bye bye!" Wang Tong waved as she walked out of the office.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she stepped out of the office, she saw a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was dressed exquisitely, with a strong military aura about him. He clearly came from an extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>Is it him?</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong squinted her eyes, just about to greet him, when she heard the man say:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi has already entered the photo room. Go take their photo, and remember... don't say much!" This man was naturally Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Wang Tong nodded, actually feeling quite surprised inside.</p><p></p><p>This man already looked quite extraordinary, yet he referred to the person inside as "Mr. Qi". It seems that person... truly has immense power and influence.</p><p></p><p>With anticipation and nervousness in her heart, Wang Tong entered the photo room.</p><p></p><p>"Comrade, thank you for your trouble."</p><p></p><p>A young and pleasant voice came.</p><p></p><p>When Wang Tong saw the person, she immediately lowered her head, not daring to look much, her emotions in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He's too handsome.</p><p></p><p>This must be the face of a domineering CEO from TV dramas, right?</p><p></p><p>"I and Canary, and Little Bride are all ready, just waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>"Coming right away." Wang Tong kept her head down, not daring to look up.</p><p></p><p>However, she vaguely saw that on Mr. Qi's left and right were two women with graceful figures.</p><p></p><p>One wore a black dress, the other should be in a red wedding dress.</p><p></p><p>This made Wang Tong puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Why was there such a big difference in how these two wives were dressed?</p><p></p><p>Puzzled as she was, she didn't ask out loud.</p><p></p><p>She kept her head down as she entered, then walked to the camera that had been set up.</p><p></p><p>Only then did she dare to carefully examine the three people before her.</p><p></p><p>She saw the three of them sitting in a row.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the woman in the black dress, a look of amazement flashed in Wang Tong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Another day of envying the powerful and wealthy.</p><p></p><p>She's just too beautiful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Canary was tightly holding Qi Yuan's arm, her beautiful eyes seeming to contain a pool of spring.</p><p></p><p>A blush crept up to her ears, as if she was somewhat shy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to before, this blush was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tong shifted her gaze, letting it fall on the face of the woman in the red wedding dress.</p><p></p><p>She blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then she took off her glasses and wiped them.</p><p></p><p>She... stood there dumbfounded, her mind a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead, she inexplicably asked a question: "Mr. Qi, where is the other wife?"</p><p></p><p>"They're both here, the others... hmm are in heaven."</p><p></p><p>"???" Wang Tong was a bit confused, but still carefully asked, "I mean the one who was just wearing the red wedding dress."</p><p></p><p>"That's her." Qi Yuan held Little Bride's cold hand.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Wang Tong was completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>Wedding dress... what the heck?</p><p></p><p>Is this person marrying a wedding dress?</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, something even more shocking happened to Wang Tong.</p><p></p><p>That wedding dress seemed to lean closer to Mr. Qi, and its sleeve even adjusted its own collar.</p><p></p><p>This... wedding dress... is it... a spirit?</p><p></p><p>Her heart trembled, her heart about to jump out of her throat.</p><p></p><p>Damn... spiritual energy really has returned! Even wedding dresses have become spirits, and now want to get married!</p><p></p><p>Folks, sis can't handle this.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts were in a complete mess, like tangled threads.</p><p></p><p>However, she still forced herself to calm down and take the photo.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she really wanted to give Mr. Qi a big thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>The powerful are truly powerful, even marrying a wedding dress!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the office.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou frowned, a strange look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What is all this, one person... two names, even the ID card needs an extra line. The powerful really are powerful."</p><p></p><p>"This is even more ridiculous, filling in 'wedding dress royal clan' for race. When did our Qinyuan country have this race?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou was complaining furiously in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare show any dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was so absurd, all this information could be entered into the system.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that in their system, this information couldn't be filled in randomly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were all choices.</p><p></p><p>For example, there were only certain races that could be selected.</p><p></p><p>This was the regulation from headquarters.</p><p></p><p>But now, it could actually be customized.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>This system belonged to headquarters.</p><p></p><p>This directly opened up a new clan for Qinyuan country! The fact that they had this privilege meant... hmm they must have connections with headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... one of the Seven Star Martial families?</p><p></p><p>No, the Seven Star Martial families do indeed have this kind of authority, but they wouldn't bother with this kind of thing. It's too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>Two wives, if they marry then they marry."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou couldn't figure it out no matter how he thought about it.</p><p></p><p>Now, everything on his end was ready, just waiting for Wang Tong to bring the electronic and paper copies of the photos.</p><p></p><p>One was to enter into the system, the other to paste onto the marriage certificate and ID card.</p><p></p><p>It was that simple.</p><p></p><p>Just then, hurried footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou looked up to see Wang Tong, panting and looking anxious.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Longshou frowned slightly: "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, do you know what Mr. Qi's wife is?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Zhao Longshou was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"It's a wedding dress!" Wang Tong said seriously, then muttered to herself afterwards, as if she had lost her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Zhao Longshou was stunned for a moment, then laughed, "These powerful people really know how to play. Marrying a piece of clothing, and even wanting a marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, but it's also normal.</p><p></p><p>A while back, there was an otaku who brought an inflatable doll, saying he had to get a certificate. It made us laugh so hard at the time."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, it's not an ordinary wedding dress, it's a wedding dress that has become a spirit. It can walk!" Wang Tong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she showed Zhao Longshou the photos she had taken.</p><p></p><p>"Look, it's this wedding dress. She's called Little Bride, and she's very gentle!"</p><p></p><p>"??? You're not pulling my leg, are you?" Zhao Longshou looked doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm lying to you, may I walk out the door and get hit by a car and die.</p><p></p><p>Hahaha, spiritual energy has returned, it really has returned!" Wang Tong laughed excitedly, then after a while showed a disappointed expression.</p><p></p><p>What did the return of spiritual energy have to do with a nobody like her?</p><p></p><p>Was it a blessing or a curse? Suddenly, she thought of Qi Yuan, and a bold idea arose in her heart: "Could he help me enter the supernatural realm?"</p><p></p><p>But then she became despondent again. She was just a nobody, why would others help her?</p><p></p><p>"I think you've gone a bit crazy. How could a wedding dress possibly become a spirit?" Zhao Longshou still didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of footsteps</p>

        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her shoulders were as if carved, her waist like a slender ribbon, with intricate patterns embroidered on golden silk bands.</p><p></p><p>She stood in the void, like a goddess emerging from the dark sky.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's cold eyes glanced at Lü Zhu. Away from Qi Yuan's side, she had regained that frost-like aura of the Northern Demon Thirteen Demons.</p><p></p><p>Cold on the outside, alluring within.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is..." Lü Zhu bowed respectfully, many thoughts flashing through her mind. </p><p></p><p>Not only the great enemy from just now, but also the mysterious powerful figure before her who was like a goddess - both were people she could not match.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have a guess in your heart?" Ning Tao spoke, her voice different from her icy demeanor, as if there was some sweetness mixed in with the ice, "Qi Yuan... he is my husband."</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of claiming ownership in her voice.</p><p></p><p>When facing Xiao Jia, she was willing to call her "sister". When she was Jinsi Que, she would address her as "Sister Xiao Jia".</p><p></p><p>But she wasn't willing to address everyone that way.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was different if her husband instructed her to.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings... Master's wife!" Lü Zhu hurriedly bowed, a look of dejection and envy appearing in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Only a goddess-like woman such as this was worthy of her master.</p><p></p><p>In terms of both beauty and cultivation realm, she was unparalleled in this world.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao's gaze towards Lü Zhu softened slightly: "The worlds are about to converge. Be prepared, and do not cause any killing!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, understood!" Princess Lü Zhu quickly replied, then looked at Ning Tao and said softly, "Master's wife is peerlessly beautiful. I imagine all men in this world would be infatuated. Master being able to marry you is truly his good fortune."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao smiled charmingly: "My appearance is feared by all, except for him... who doesn't mind at all."</p><p></p><p>In the past, when she was Jinsi Que, she had entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and was cursed, detested by heaven and loathed by people.</p><p></p><p>Everyone despised her, hated her, and dared not look at her face.</p><p></p><p>Only her husband dared to look at her with clear eyes, and would converse with her in gentle, sincere words.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the girl in the pond had already planted a seed in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"This?" Lü Zhu was confused for a moment, puzzled in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to recall the past, Ning Tao smiled gently: "There are still many vermin outside that may affect the atmosphere of this society and ruin my husband's mood for playing games. I'll go deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Killing intent surged in Ning Tao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, she was carefree and a bit vain, following behind Qi Yuan as his little follower Jinsi Que.</p><p></p><p>But now, she was Ning Tao, closely following her husband's footsteps, solving problems for him - the Ning Tao that Jinsi Que most wanted to become.</p><p></p><p>After she finished speaking, her figure disappeared in that moment.</p><p></p><p>Only Lü Zhu and Wang Yuanyu were left in the Landscape Scroll, with complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wang Yuanyu said softly: "The stockings wrapped around that goddess's legs just now should be silk stockings, right?"</p><p></p><p>Thin stockings were wrapped around Ning Tao's legs.</p><p></p><p>The outfit of her current body was the same as when she first met Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It should be," Lü Zhu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Is this what Qi Yuan wants to give me?" Wang Yuanyu muttered, covering her mouth and saying, "I just don't know if wearing this would scare him."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Black Sea, a petite girl was drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>She was flying back and forth in the sky, constantly casting spells.</p><p></p><p>With each spell, old men and women fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Demoness!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you stop us, you are a sinner of the world!"</p><p></p><p>"She is also at the Martial Lord realm. If we join forces, we can kill her!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Deer Martial Lord said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand Martial Lords opened up a net, surrounding and attacking that girl.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they had been wandering in the Black Sea, searching for the entrance to the Landscape Scroll.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this girl appeared and fiercely pursued and attacked them.</p><p></p><p>This girl's strength was extremely powerful, even Titled Martial Lords were no match for her.</p><p></p><p>However, they had many Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand Martial Lords united, determined to eliminate the girl.</p><p></p><p>Faced with so many Martial Lords, the girl became a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Tao, come quickly and save this young lady!"</p><p></p><p>The girl shouted towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>This girl was Ning Tao's past self after becoming a Yang Spirit, also known as Jinsi Que.</p><p></p><p>Currently, she only had the strength of a peak Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, she had gained insights in the Black Sea, absorbing the power of time, comprehending space and time, and finally perfected herself, stepping into the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"Here, no one can save you!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Celestial Venerable Qi Yuan has gone to meet the Eastern Lord. He will become one of us. He won't have any feelings about your death."</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!" Jinsi Que was angry, hands on her hips, "Ning Tao, come quickly and beat him into a pulp, tear his mouth off and bury it in a manure pit for ten thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>Jinsi Que was really angry.</p><p></p><p>How could they say Qi Yuan didn't care about her?</p><p></p><p>She was the number one beauty of Nine Pan Mountain, certified by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The person Qi Yuan loved most was undoubtedly her.</p><p></p><p>To say Qi Yuan didn't care about her was simply committing the second greatest mistake in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm afraid the one who will die is you." That Titled Martial Lord spoke, looking at Jinsi Que with fear.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an alluring voice sounded in everyone's minds: "While my husband fights the big boss, naturally I will help him deal with these small fry."</p><p></p><p>Endless killing intent rolled over the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao in a black dress appeared, standing in the void, her black hair like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Joy appeared in Jinsi Que's eyes: "You finally came."</p><p></p><p>Those Martial Lords saw Ning Tao and their expressions suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>They couldn't understand how there could be a Celestial Venerable in this Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Venerable, Celestial Venerable Qi Yuan is currently meeting with the Eastern Lord. If there's anything, could you wait until Celestial Venerable Qi Yuan comes out to discuss?" The Black Deer Martial Lord said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Why didn't you wait for my husband to come out before doing your things?" Killing intent flashed in Ning Tao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Black Deer Martial Lord hurriedly said: "This concerns the life and death of the world. We could only resort to this!"</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords also said righteously: "Although our actions violate heavenly principles, for the continuation of the world, we are willing to be villains!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, when Celestial Venerable Qi Yuan comes out and sees that we have saved the world, he will forgive us!"</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords spoke one after another, their expressions excited and impassioned, as if they were willing to die for the world at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood above the Black Sea, the waters of the Black Sea flowing from her feet, the power of time surrounding her body. Her figure seemed somewhat unreal, as if she did not exist in this time and place.</p><p></p><p>She smiled, her smile bright.</p><p></p><p>"What happens to the world has nothing to do with me. My husband is the only thing that matters."</p><p></p><p>Becoming one of the Northern Demon Thirteen Demons, she was detested by heaven and loathed by people, experiencing the treachery of human hearts to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>To her, the world and other people were no different from roadside pebbles or grass.</p><p></p><p>The world hated her, people detested her, how could she repay evil with kindness? Only her husband was the person she cared about most.</p><p></p><p>She looked at this group of "righteous" Martial Lords, her expression like frost.</p><p></p><p>"I am not my husband. I am not as reasonable as him."</p><p></p><p>"Since in your hearts, saving the world is most important.</p><p></p><p>Then... please die for the world!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't waste any more words.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, she simply couldn't be bothered to deal with these people's "grand principles".</p><p></p><p>Her husband was all she cared about.</p><p></p><p>What if she was love-brained?</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>She pushed out a palm strike, without any fancy moves.</p><p></p><p>Although she had just entered the Yang Spirit realm and wasn't fully familiar with her power yet,</p><p></p><p>The might of one palm strike was still not something these Martial Lords could compare to.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sea instantly overturned, endless power of time continuously washing over.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be like this!"</p><p></p><p>"The world!"</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand Martial Lords screamed miserably.</p><p></p><p>The seawater splashed onto their bodies, time rapidly flowing over their forms.</p><p></p><p>They either aged, withered, or became younger and powerless.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Their mouths finally softened.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you like women who are obsessed with love? That's me!" </p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't even look at these people as she pushed out another palm strike. In an instant, nearly ten thousand martial masters were wiped out.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Gods and Yin Gods was too great.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the divine realm Ning Tao mastered was the power of space and time.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I didn't expect this young lady to be so strong!" The golden canary flew to Ning Tao's side, looking at her beautiful face proudly. "This young lady is too pretty, no wonder Qi Yuan likes me so much!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at her past self somewhat helplessly: "Don't be so narcissistic, okay? And... I'm still not strong enough."</p><p></p><p>"This isn't strong enough?"</p><p></p><p>"I still can't keep my husband imprisoned by my side forever."</p><p></p><p>"...Hey, don't be too yandere!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you want me to imprison my husband so the three of us can live together?" Ning Tao said in a coquettish voice.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The golden canary put her slender white fingers to her mouth, stars in her eyes. "It sounds very exciting."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal winds brush clouds and moisten the cave; Divine light reflects the moon and illuminates the jade tower."</p><p></p><p>At the site of the great calamity, Qi Yuan looked at the words carved on the stone wall ahead, a smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This place is fated for me!"</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, what does this have to do with you?" Qi Qi stood to the side and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Old Thunder God stroked his beard: "Whatever he takes a liking to becomes fated for him, it's simple."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, how can you baselessly sully someone's reputation? I'm not Kong Yiji, I excel at 327 ways of writing the character 'hui'."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was anxious. He pointed at the stone wall ahead: "Do you see? It has the characters for 'divine light'. I come from the Divine Light Sect, and I'm about to become the first Purple Mansion cultivator in the sect's history. Isn't it normal for this place to be fated for me?"</p><p></p><p>Old Thunder God was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi tilted her head: "What Godfather says makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a gentle and refined voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"You... have finally come."</p><p></p><p>The voice was like heavenly music falling into everyone's ears, like jade striking a jade plate.</p><p></p><p>Everyone suddenly felt as if bathed in spring breeze, ripples stirring in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up to see a man in tattered white robes gracefully approaching from amidst the myriad colors ahead.</p><p></p><p>Though covered in wounds, his eyes were as bright as sunlight.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with seemingly deep affection: "Ah Qiao, you've finally come to see me. Do you still remember me? I am your husband, Sheng Kongming."</p><p></p><p>With his voice, endless memories flooded into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The insights of the Myriad Path Martial God became intense at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to see himself become the woman in the mural, walking hand in hand with Sheng Kongming under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the divine infant Yang Gods behind Qi Yuan all looked at him curiously, as if discovering some great scandal.</p><p></p><p>"Is the master a dao partner with Sheng Kongming?"</p><p></p><p>"They're actually a couple!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the person Sheng Kongming has been waiting for all along is the master!"</p><p></p><p>"How touching!"</p><p></p><p>"To save his love, he went alone to a foreign realm, suppressed enemies for a million years, unwilling to leave, only wishing to wait for your return in the mortal world!"</p><p></p><p>"Guarding an entire realm, how moving."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's eyes were shining even more, her fists clenched, almost moved to tears.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Sheng Kongming's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Clan was few in number and very rare.</p><p></p><p>But for the Holy Light Clan, numbers were the most useless thing.</p><p></p><p>There were thousands of Yang Gods before him. To be honest, even Yang Gods at the Principle Realm would be terrified upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>But... he was of the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>As long as they weren't a full major realm higher than him, they were all toys in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>So facing thousands of Yang Gods, he remained calm and unruffled.</p><p></p><p>These Yang Gods were mostly at the first level of Yang God, the Lesser Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Those at the Greater Celestial Realm were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>While he... was at the Greater Celestial Realm of Yang God, just one step away from the Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>Below the Principle Realm, he was invincible and could toy with them easily.</p><p></p><p>For Yang Gods at the Principle Realm, he could deal with them too with some effort and planning.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes full of tenderness: "Although you've become a man now, my love for you has never diminished!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Qi couldn't help saying: "I told you love can transcend gender!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe also widened his eyes: "True love!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi frowned: "Hey, don't fight Old Zhu for..."</p><p></p><p>Ever since Sheng Kongming appeared, the tone had suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pushed down his crazily elongating nose and couldn't help but hold his head in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Can you stop being so disgusting?"</p><p></p><p>The game designers were really something.</p><p></p><p>A perfectly good big boss, originally called Dong Jun.</p><p></p><p>Using the Pen of Mountains and Rivers to paint the scroll of mountains and seas, constantly restarting the world, fighting alone against root demons for a million years.</p><p></p><p>How impressive.</p><p></p><p>But now, a gay man who ran out of a gay bar.</p><p></p><p>"Don't touch me!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he waved his large hand and collected all the divine infants present into his own body.</p><p></p><p>Though he wouldn't be fooled by Dong Jun,</p><p></p><p>These divine infants of his were not him, and could be fooled.</p><p></p><p>Now, their gossipy looks made Qi Yuan sick.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's reaction was not unexpected to Dong Jun.</p><p></p><p>"I know you can't accept it now, but I will always accompany you, waiting for you to break through worldly prejudices." As he spoke, Dong Jun Sheng Kongming reached out his hand to Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>As if encouraging Qi Yuan to bravely walk towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Between you and me, there are a hundred steps. I will walk ninety-nine steps, can you walk the last step?" Sheng Kongming said gently, very warmly, like a caring man.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was completely speechless: "Damn game, I want to quit!"</p><p></p><p>By now, Sheng Kongming had already walked ninety-nine steps and reached out his left hand, looking at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Qiao, can you take this one step for me?"</p><p></p><p>Sheng Kongming was very expectant, his eyes also full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that this Heavenly Venerate before him had not reached the Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan had received the gift of the Myriad Path Martial God.</p><p></p><p>Those gifts were the second layer of insurance he left for "her".</p><p></p><p>No matter who accepted the memories of the Myriad Path Martial God, they would become the "her" he believed in.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan before him was naturally no exception.</p><p></p><p>Now, his display of disgust and speechlessness was just because he couldn't accept it in the short term.</p><p></p><p>When he reached out his hand, using his warm magnetic voice to soothe, Qi Yuan would surely be moved by him.</p><p></p><p>"If you're unwilling to accept that we're both men, I can also become a woman, as long as you like it, Ah Qiao."</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun was very warm, his voice also very sincere.</p><p></p><p>Such a voice seemed enough to move any female lead in a TV drama.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not holding your damn hand!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll chop off your dog paw!"</p><p></p><p>"You disgust me!"</p><p></p><p>Under Dong Jun's incredulous gaze, a blood-red sword light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Endless surging power rolled and spread at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jun's left arm was actually chopped off in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raged furiously: "You want to be more despicable? Disgust me more!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan increasingly felt that mystery was indeed the best charm.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Dong Jun, he was disillusioned with him.</p><p></p><p>Just a scheming lowlife man.</p><p></p><p>I recommend a book, the author is a tall domineering beauty, the kind Han Xianyun likes, Dream of Spring and Autumn!</p><p></p><p>Book title: "Past Life Comes True, I Have Countless Mysterious Identities!"</p><p></p><p>Demon hunter, demon catcher, immortal...</p><p></p><p>Creating countless glorious identities through repeated reincarnations, and all of these are real!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

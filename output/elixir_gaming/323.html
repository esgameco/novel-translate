        <h1>Chapter 323</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed not to notice the mockery deep in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way then. I need to study carefully how to have a grand wedding."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the dark-skinned man took Qi Yuan for a foolish rich man from the county town.</p><p></p><p>"Whose wedding could compare to our Sea God's? Our Sea God is an all-powerful deity that reaches to the heavens and penetrates the earth!"</p><p></p><p>The dark-skinned man puffed out his chest proudly as he spoke of the Sea God's greatness.</p><p></p><p>"How many wives has the Sea God taken?" Qi Yuan asked casually. "I'd like to learn from him."</p><p></p><p>"Well..." The dark-skinned man frowned. "I can't remember exactly. The Sea God has been here for three years, and takes a young woman as wife every two months. For some reason recently, even though he just married one last month, he's marrying again this month. Sigh."</p><p></p><p>The dark-skinned man seemed troubled as he mentioned this. </p><p></p><p>He was already 30 years old and still hadn't found a wife.</p><p></p><p>Even his old flame from the brothel had been tricked into marrying the Sea God.</p><p></p><p>"Three years?" Qi Yuan pondered. "Does the Sea God have any connection to the water tribe in the county town? Are they allies or rivals?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the demon clan in the county town was the water tribe's Boss Kun.</p><p></p><p>There was a Sea God here.</p><p></p><p>The two might have some kind of relationship.</p><p></p><p>"No," the dark-skinned man shook his head, then puffed out his chest again. "Six months ago, Boss Kun from the county town came to our Seastone Village seeking an audience with our Sea God."</p><p></p><p>This statement implied that the Sea God's status was no lower than Boss Kun's, and may even be higher.</p><p></p><p>"I see," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts ran through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then this Sea God must also be a powerful demon at the Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, all the demons in Yunyan County were gathered at three strongholds.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Huang and Snake Woman's two strongholds were out in the open, gathering various demons to join them.</p><p></p><p>So the locations of these strongholds were exposed to Qi Yuan's view.</p><p></p><p>All these demons had been slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only Boss Kun's stronghold remained a mystery to Qi Yuan so far.</p><p></p><p>Logically, all the notable demons of Yunyan County should have gone to the three major strongholds.</p><p></p><p>A powerful Jade Blood realm demon like the Sea God should probably be with Boss Kun, discussing the matter of the Spirit Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>But the Sea God was doing his own thing, still taking wives here.</p><p></p><p>This was interesting.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he could make a bold guess? Was Boss Kun the Sea God's wife?</p><p></p><p>Boss Kun disappeared without telling the Sea God, so the Sea God got jealous and angrily took two more wives.</p><p></p><p>That made sense, more plausible than wild historical accounts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards the depths of Seastone Village, his interest growing even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Following the dark-skinned man, Qi Yuan entered Seastone Village.</p><p></p><p>The village was mostly filled with young and middle-aged men, wearing coarse linen clothes with bare chests.</p><p></p><p>Young women were extremely rare to see.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the village, Qi Yuan smelled a strong fishy odor. Fish were drying in winnowing baskets on the low thatched roofs.</p><p></p><p>Some eaves also had salted fish hanging from them.</p><p></p><p>In the corners, red scraps of paper seemed to have been washed against the walls by rain.</p><p></p><p>The small fishing village had a somber yet festive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the sound of an argument came from not far away.</p><p></p><p>"You may be from the government office, but in our Seastone Village, the Sea God comes first, and the government office can only rank second. You want to see the Sea God? No way!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what bullshit laws. Aren't laws just ropes you government officials use to tie around the necks of us common folk?"</p><p></p><p>"Can the county magistrate feed us? Can the emperor keep us safe when we're fishing?"</p><p></p><p>"Since they can't, the Sea God is supreme."</p><p></p><p>The village chief's beard quivered as he faced the government officials before him, showing no courtesy at all despite their status.</p><p></p><p>Over the past three years, Seastone Village had grown stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>There were now over a thousand able-bodied men.</p><p></p><p>And hundreds of fishing boats large and small.</p><p></p><p>At first, Seastone Village may have needed help from the government to defeat the neighboring village.</p><p></p><p>But now, Seastone Village didn't take the government seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>The fishermen here could be fishermen, or they could be pirates.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had the Sea God backing them, so they had no fear of the government.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao, leading a tracking dog, frowned when she heard the village chief's words: "These women married to the Sea God are so innocent and pitiful."</p><p></p><p>After all, she came from modern society. Although she had experienced many such things, she still couldn't accept or approve of this.</p><p></p><p>The old village chief looked at An Qiao with contempt: "Trading a few women for a year's harvest is a very profitable deal.</p><p></p><p>People are just livestock anyway, whether they serve as beasts of burden for officials and government, or as servants for the Sea God.</p><p></p><p>Since they'll be serving either way, why not choose the option where we can see the benefits?"</p><p></p><p>In the old village chief's eyes, people were just resources. As long as they were resources, they could be bought, sold and exchanged.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers looked maliciously at An Qiao and the government officials beside her.</p><p></p><p>They clearly agreed with the old village chief's words.</p><p></p><p>In the past, they had to get up early and work late fishing every day. Over 70% of their catch had to be handed over to the imperial government, and they were still exploited by petty officials.</p><p></p><p>Seeing those in official uniforms, they had to bow and scrape.</p><p></p><p>That life had no hope.</p><p></p><p>How could it compare to now, when they ate and drank well, and dared to curse at government officials to their faces.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was furious, mainly because she felt the village chief's words made some sense: "If you were exchanged to be the Sea God's bride, would you be willing?"</p><p></p><p>The old village chief looked at An Qiao with contempt and said: "Young lady, you must come from a good background to ask such a naive question at your age.</p><p></p><p>It's them marrying the Sea God, not me.</p><p></p><p>If I were them, of course I wouldn't be willing, but... I'm not.</p><p></p><p>Why don't you go ask the emperor if he'd be willing to be a peasant farmer with his face to the yellow earth and back to the sky, still having to pay harsh taxes to the emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"You..." An Qiao was so angry she wanted to draw her sword, but was stopped by the man in black fitted clothes beside her.</p><p></p><p>"If you sincerely wish to observe the ceremony, we naturally welcome you.</p><p></p><p>But if you want to cause trouble, hehe... don't expect to leave Seastone Village alive.</p><p></p><p>In this Seastone Village, the Sea God is emperor, and I am the crown prince!"</p><p></p><p>The nearly 70-year-old village chief spoke forcefully, his voice extremely domineering.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a slightly surprised voice came:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't know there were 70-year-old crown princes in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked over, looking at the village chief with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"After being crown prince for so many years, are you content? Are you like in TV shows, secretly resentful and always hoping for the emperor's death? Oh, these young strong men around you must be the secret death squad you've been cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stared wide-eyed at the old village chief.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, I see a murderous aura rising to the heavens here, about to erupt in violence, with the imperial star dimming.</p><p></p><p>Don't tell me that you, the crown prince, are harboring resentment, hiding a death squad, preparing to assassinate the Sea God on his wedding day!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke rapidly, like a machine gun.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his exaggerated performance, he immediately raised the tension in the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The old village chief's expression changed several times: "I'm not, don't talk nonsense, I'm completely loyal to the Sea God!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, no wonder I had a dream yesterday. I dreamed of a white snake that could speak human language. It said: 'Seastone rises, village chief becomes king.'</p><p></p><p>Originally, I didn't know what this meant, but coming here, I've found the answer."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Village chief, you're really ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, the young strong men around the village chief unconsciously moved away from him.</p><p></p><p>The village chief's head was buzzing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, for some reason hearing Qi Yuan's voice made him feel excited, he even wanted to raise his arm and shout, to really become king.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly came to his senses. </p><p></p><p>He had no son, if he became emperor, who would inherit the throne?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that just benefit others? Thinking of this, he glared angrily at Qi Yuan: "Who are you, spreading such treasonous talk here?"</p><p></p><p>"I am... a blood collector from the myriad realms," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>He came here to collect the Sea God's blood.</p><p></p><p>The village chief looked bewildered. He didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words. At this moment, his head was still buzzing, the blood rushing to it. He said rudely: "So you're a madman."</p><p></p><p>At this time, An Qiao looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes containing a smile: "Brother Qi, how did you get here?"</p><p></p><p>She had called Qi Yuan "newbie" before, but now called him "Brother Qi", which made Qi Yuan sigh, "Ah, women."</p><p></p><p>"My child bride is getting married today, I'm here to attend the wedding," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"???" An Qiao looked confused.</p><p></p><p>The village chief's gaze towards Qi Yuan also turned unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the woman captured below was this madman's child bride?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his words carrying a threatening tone: "Today, whoever dares to disrupt the Sea God's wedding, don't expect to leave the village alive!"</p><p></p><p>These people were all from the government, he couldn't openly break with them yet.</p><p></p><p>After making his threat, the village chief left with the villagers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched the village chief's retreating figure and shouted loudly: "Don't misunderstand, my child bride and I have already settled things, even if I were to snatch a bride, I wouldn't snatch her. The Sea God... is my true love!"</p><p></p><p>But the village chief and others didn't hear his words.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao now very much agreed with the village chief's words, this Qi Yuan might really be a bit mad.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, do you remember that madman from yesterday? We followed him here.</p><p></p><p>Our captain is now secretly lying low here, while the two of us have openly come to Sea Stone Village to investigate the situation and see if there are any clues." An Qiao told Qi Yuan the reason for their coming.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded: "Do as you please, just don't interfere with my bride snatching."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" An Qiao's expression turned serious, "Brother Qi, this Sea God... is suspected to be a great demon of the Jade Blood realm. If you snatch its wife, it definitely won't be happy."</p><p></p><p>"Who said I'm snatching his wife?" Qi Yuan looked nonchalant, "Don't worry, I'm very measured in what I do. Let's go watch the ceremony first, I also want to learn... how to get married."</p><p></p><p>The first time he got married, he was asleep and had no impression of it at all, hazily entering the bridal chamber.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had to watch carefully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, An Qiao was speechless.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to say, brother, the mission is more important.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of Qi Yuan's strength and his erratic way of doing things,</p><p></p><p>She was afraid of being beaten to death, so she didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, the three people and one dog took a stroll around the village.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the Sea God's wedding officially began.</p><p></p><p>A long and grand procession carried the bridal sedan chair, hands beating gongs and drums.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao looked at all this, her gaze complex: "Leaving aside everything else, these ancient people's weddings are quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Although there was no ten-mile red dowry, tall horses, or phoenix crown and robes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head in disappointment: "It's not as grand as my orchestra, not even as good as my mourning team."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" An Qiao blinked, "What orchestra and mourning team? Where?"</p><p></p><p>She suspected Qi Yuan was talking nonsense again.</p><p></p><p>"They are... in my heart," Qi Yuan's gaze became slightly heavy.</p><p></p><p>All those villagers from the Mortal Heart Realm had become his divine infants, becoming part of him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was unable to awaken them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but think of the actress Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao stopped talking, feeling she couldn't communicate with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the village procession had already spread to the beach on the coast.</p><p></p><p>Eight villagers carried the large sedan chair, their faces showing joyful expressions.</p><p></p><p>The village chief stood on a high platform, burning incense, bowing to the sea, and kowtowing, looking extremely devout.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sea God, all-powerful Sea God, please grant our Sea Stone Village a season of bountiful harvest and peace."</p><p></p><p>With the village chief's words, all the villagers present faced the sea, uniformly kneeling down, prostrating themselves on the ground, their expressions extremely devout.</p><p></p><p>The only ones standing were the observers and the villagers carrying the eight-man sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>The men carrying the sedan chair now moved their feet, stepping on the beach, walking towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, An Qiao felt distressed.</p><p></p><p>She was about to witness another innocent person die tragically.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Qi Yuan pricked up his ears, looking puzzled: "Why isn't the officiant asking if they're willing yet? If he doesn't ask, how can I snatch the bride?"</p><p></p><p>That's how it is in movies.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the officiant asks if they're willing, the camera zooms in on the bride or groom, and that's when the bride snatching begins.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also felt that was the best timing for bride snatching, otherwise TV wouldn't portray it that way.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always followed rules and customs, never breaking the law.</p><p></p><p>After all, if that's how it's shown on TV, it must not be illegal.</p><p></p><p>If it were illegal, it definitely couldn't be broadcast.</p><p></p><p>"There... doesn't seem to be an officiant here." An Qiao really didn't want to talk to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? No officiant? How am I supposed to snatch the bride?" Qi Yuan was also confused.</p><p></p><p>He stood there dumbfounded, his thoughts racing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, An Qiao's gaze turned towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a wave in the sea suddenly boiling up, the momentum tremendous, reaching several dozen meters high, like a tall building.</p><p></p><p>The sound of waves rose and fell, and the villagers present knelt even lower.</p><p></p><p>The village chief's other thoughts that had been provoked by Qi Yuan earlier were completely wiped away in the face of this heavenly display of power.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, An Qiao's expression became grave: "It really is of the Jade Blood realm. Just this wave alone, I can't deal with.</p><p></p><p>That... poor girl."</p><p></p><p>The Sea God hadn't appeared in person, but just the means used to welcome the bride were shocking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, however, was very calm: "This display is just average, the special effects aren't that great."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao and the man in black automatically filtered out Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was staring at the sea's surface.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Refining level magic enhancing his eyes, his vision was better and could see further.</p><p></p><p>However, across the sea, he couldn't discover the Sea God's true form.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the tracking dog suddenly sniffed: "Huh, this scent... is very familiar, similar to aquatic creatures, no... "</p><p></p><p>The tracking dog suddenly looked at Qi Yuan, terrified.</p><p></p><p>"It's exactly the same as your scent."</p><p></p><p>"You are the Sea God!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" An Qiao was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The man in black also looked stunned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan is the Sea God? An Qiao suddenly recalled that Qi Yuan had never said he was the same kind of person as them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how could a newbie be so strong? Could it be that the Sea God had devoured that newbie and was disguised as Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

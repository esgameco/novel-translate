        <h1>Chapter 445</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mixed Blood Sect was too domineering, buying people with celestial jade without explanation.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed, and a voice came from the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"How could I use a disciple's treasure? Take back your Primordial Stone, I will personally visit the Mixed Blood Sect."</p><p></p><p>The voice of Wind Spirit Celestial Lord was quite sighing and speechless.</p><p></p><p>Even becoming a Yang Spirit, one cannot obtain great freedom and ease.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to other cultivators, Yang Spirits were still too comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian heard this and felt grateful in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However, Wind Spirit Celestial Lord's next words were like cold water poured into her heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Mixed Blood Sect has always been arrogant and domineering. Tuoba Lingyu is also the most beloved granddaughter of the Mixed Blood Sect's ancestor. I'm afraid in this matter... I am powerless."</p><p></p><p>After Wind Spirit Celestial Lord finished speaking, his form dissipated and disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His meaning was very clear - he might not be able to stop Tuoba Lingyu, hinting for Yu Mengxian to take Qi Yi and leave.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, when Qi Yi heard this, her expression was somewhat moved: "Master, this is all my fault."</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for her, the master wouldn't have to suffer this grievance.</p><p></p><p>"This has nothing to do with you. If we must blame someone, blame that Tuoba Lingyu!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian's mood was complicated.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord's hint was very clear, telling her to take Qi Yi and leave.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhili Celestial Realm, even though he was honored as a Celestial Lord, there were many things he was powerless to do.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord going to the Mixed Blood Sect to make a final effort was actually buying time for her, letting her take Qi Yi away.</p><p></p><p>But... leave?</p><p></p><p>How could they leave when targeted by the Mixed Blood Sect?</p><p></p><p>Which cultivator in the lower three heavens didn't know of the Mixed Blood Sect's shamelessness?</p><p></p><p>For the sake of bloodlines, they captured people at will.</p><p></p><p>Anyone targeted by them had almost no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian even felt that if she took Qi Yi away, it might fall right into the Mixed Blood Sect's trap.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what the Mixed Blood Sect seeks is me. This disciple is unwilling to implicate the master!" Qi Yi pondered for a moment and said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeking the master's protection again would likely lead to the master's demise as well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yi more clearly understood the cruelty of the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>If on Gongxing, some nobles still paid lip service to face and benevolence and morality on the surface.</p><p></p><p>In the immortal cultivation world, these things didn't matter at all. Demonic cultivators even wished they could carve the character for "demon" on their foreheads to tell everyone, I am a demonic cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens, the Ghost Controlling Heaven wantonly used living beings to refine the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner, capturing and killing realm after realm. Did any major power stop them?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>In the Six Heavens, strength was everything.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian looked at Qi Yi, and the face of that Celestial Lord floated in her mind.</p><p></p><p>If she had that Celestial Lord's strength, how could she let Qi Yi suffer? Back then, in that strange land, that Celestial Lord mysteriously disappeared, and the robot Zero One found her, entrusting her to give something to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the end, she took Qi Yi and left Gongxing. Looking back, she found that Gongxing had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity Gongxing is gone. Otherwise, if we had a chance to return to Gongxing, the Mixed Blood Sect wouldn't be able to find us."</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian sighed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she was just thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>It was too far from here to the entrance to the Fire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>They would probably be intercepted by the Mixed Blood Sect before they could arrive.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yu Mengxian thought of something and couldn't help asking: "Your brother... does he have any connection to the Black Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>She recalled the figure she saw in the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yi's expression was puzzled, then she shook her head: "Never."</p><p></p><p>Her master on Gongxing was Qi Yuan's mother.</p><p></p><p>She had complicated feelings about that brother.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she just wanted him to live an ordinary life, not wanting him to be caught up in the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought he would suddenly become a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"However... it's possible there is a connection." After pondering, Qi Yi still seriously added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>After all, she knew too little about that brother.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian frowned: "I seemed to see him among the geniuses from the Black Demon Abyss who came to participate in the Zhili Debate Conference."</p><p></p><p>She was a bit confused. If it was Qi Yuan, how could he be standing among those geniuses?</p><p></p><p>The geniuses were all merely Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yi was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, our status is too lowly. We can't even manage to pay a visit to someone from the Black Demon Abyss." Yu Mengxian sighed.</p><p></p><p>Even if Tuoba Lingyu from the Mixed Blood Sect went to visit, she would probably have to wait a long time before the message could be passed to that person's hands.</p><p></p><p>After all, for geniuses of that level, many people would visit them every day. If it wasn't an important person, the visiting card probably couldn't even be delivered to the hands of that genius from the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"I just had someone investigate earlier. The information came back that the person is named Blood Robe, ranked second among the geniuses in the Black Demon Abyss. It's rumored he's a genius who can become a Zhili Realm Yang Spirit. He shouldn't be... Qi Yuan." When going to see Wind Spirit Celestial Lord, Yu Mengxian still remembered to have Zhao Yu investigate that person's identity.</p><p></p><p>Just now Zhao Yu transmitted the investigation results to her.</p><p></p><p>She felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Without meeting in person, she could only rely on external information to judge whether it was him or not.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't be certain if the other person was really Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yi frowned. She thought of something and suddenly said: "If you want to know if it's him... why not... curse him on the street?"</p><p></p><p>For a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord, if someone in the same realm discussed or cursed them, the Yang Spirit Celestial Lord would sense it.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Mengxian heard this, her expression became strange: "What you say makes sense."</p><p></p><p>What if it really was Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't, cursing once wouldn't hurt Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it was, wouldn't that be perfect?</p><p></p><p>So sometimes to find a Yang Spirit, it's better to go curse them.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do it." Qi Yi's motivation was maxed out. She imagined Qi Yuan's appearance in her mind. Her cherry lips parted slightly, her pretty face blushing: "Qi Yuan, you unconscionable bastard, irresponsible scumbag, playing with this young lady's feelings, sleeping with this young lady and then running away..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yi started cursing directly.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the banquet, there was clinking of glasses and exchanging of cups. In a corner, Sister Ox Horn was winking at Blood Robe: "How about that sister just now? Her assets are comparable to An Xunlu's, her big butt is very perky, and her personality is as shy as Purple Mist Xiaolu's. But sister has seen countless women, this kind of woman is very..."</p><p></p><p>"Contrasting?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's the word! Oh my, your little head is so clever!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't flatter me, flattering me won't work.</p><p>As a woman, how dare you casually define women and casually evaluate others? You're just a biological woman!" Qi Yuan was brewing, preparing to launch a big move to expel Sister Ox Horn from womanhood.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, I define women, and you define me, right?</p><p>Aren't all people equal? Women can't be defined, but I can be defined?" Sister Ox Horn said lazily.</p><p></p><p>She once again left Qi Yuan speechless, his face flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you live too constrained a life. If she had flirted with me like that just now, I would have given her my contact information directly and invited her to watch the lanterns together at night." Purple Mist Daxue said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Not to that extent." Qi Yuan shook his head, "I'm not that desperate."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't all people equal? You're treating her like your wife?" Purple Mist Daxue said lazily, "Don't many cultivators who are seen taking brothel girls away say it's a friend they just met for the first time?"</p><p></p><p>"..." Qi Yuan decided not to pay attention to Purple Mist Daxue.</p><p></p><p>This guy's mouth was full of crooked reasoning and heretical theories.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was not good with words to begin with.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue noticed the change in Qi Yuan's expression and her face became serious. She asked quietly, "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"My great enemy has actually come to the Zhili Heavenly Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Great enemy? Who?" Ziyuan Daxue's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I've already come to the Sixth Heaven, how did she still follow me here." Qi Yuan was speechless, and sighed again, "Aren't women supposed to be born with the ability to love? I only owe her 300,000, it's not like I'm not going to pay it back. Yet she chased me all the way to the Sixth Heaven, and even spread rumors that I'm a scumbag who doesn't take responsibility."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ziyuan Daxue felt relieved. She covered her mouth and laughed, "So it's a creditor. You got all worked up over nothing. How much do you owe?"</p><p></p><p>"Not much, just 300,000, sigh." Qi Yuan continued, "Indeed, if you want a woman to remember you for life, don't treat her well, just owe her money."</p><p></p><p>"300,000 celestial jade? Tsk tsk, if you owed me that much, I'd sleep in your bed every day!"</p><p></p><p>300,000 celestial jade was also a huge sum for Ziyuan Daxue, one she couldn't come up with herself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I have to go find her now, otherwise if she reports me and it goes on my credit record, wouldn't I become a deadbeat?</p><p></p><p>Although I don't need to fly when I travel, the name 'deadbeat' sounds awful, not elegant at all, and doesn't suit my status."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What a boring day." Ziyuan Daxue picked up her wine glass and started drinking.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yi had her hands on her hips, cursing at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian looked a bit embarrassed, but didn't stop her.</p><p></p><p>This approach seemed childish, but it might actually work.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an exasperated voice came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, beautiful, I only owe you 300,000, why are you spreading rumors?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the familiar voice, Yu Mengxian's expression changed abruptly, and Qi Yi's already flushed face turned even redder.</p><p></p><p>They saw Qi Yuan appear before them, wearing plain black clothes, tall and slender.</p><p></p><p>"Qi... Qi Yuan!" Qi Yi hadn't expected Qi Yuan to actually show up when she was cursing him out.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!" Yu Mengxian beside her still felt like she was in a dream, and hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"You try to get close to me, you spread rumors about me, damage my reputation. For the 300,000 I owe you, I'll pay you back at most 299,990!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment and decided to pay back 10 less.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't dare to short her too much.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were too many cases of people killing in anger over unpaid debts or bride prices.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yi was still wearing tight clothes with a purple robe over them, her pretty face even redder: "I didn't mean to curse you, I just wanted to..."</p><p></p><p>She hurried to explain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief: "You're not asking for the money?"</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't have the money to pay her back right now. If Qi Yi asked him to repay her, he wouldn't be able to, which would be extremely awkward.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Yu Mengxian was about to say something.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect your Heavenly Venerable to be so fond of you, actually going to my grandfather to negotiate for you.</p><p></p><p>But now he's playing chess with my grandfather and won't be able to come for a while."</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, seven or eight people appeared.</p><p></p><p>The leader was the arrogant Tuoba Lingyu.</p><p></p><p>She scanned Qi Yi as if inspecting goods.</p><p></p><p>But soon, her gaze moved from Qi Yi to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Your bloodline..." Her eyes widened, showing wild joy, and she took a deep breath, "Smells so good!"</p><p></p><p>She had an infatuated look, as if she had discovered a priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan widened his eyes: "Are you sexually harassing me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he still preferred gentle types of women.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to stay far away from both the cow-horned sister and this vulgar woman before him.</p><p></p><p>"I thought your Wind Spirit Holy Land had one treasure, I didn't expect there to be two!" Tuoba Lingyu stared at Qi Yuan as if looking at a priceless jade.</p><p></p><p>This made even Qi Yuan feel awkward.</p><p></p><p>Calling him "treasure" at their first meeting, was she going to check out his legs next?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yu Mengxian quickly sent a message to Qi Yuan: "Senior, this is the Mixed Blood Sect's..."</p><p></p><p>She told Qi Yuan about what had happened today.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Not only was she vulgar, but she was also involved in human trafficking.</p><p></p><p>He disliked this Tuoba Lingyu even more now.</p><p></p><p>"This is my sister Xiao Mei, give me some face and let this matter go!" For now, Qi Yuan was still planning to comprehend the ultimate principles, so he had to hide his identity to avoid being discovered by the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, before comprehending the supreme principles, he had to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>"Give you face... heh..." Tuoba Lingyu's mocking smile grew, "A mere Yin God of the Second Heaven, what face do you have?"</p><p></p><p>"You..." Qi Yuan really wanted to reveal his true identity.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, he was from the lower realm, and just a Purple Palace cultivator, so it was better not to reveal it. Tuoba Lingyu glanced at Yu Mengxian: "I'm taking these two people with me, don't interfere, otherwise... your Wind Spirit Holy Land won't have such an easy time."</p><p></p><p>The several mythical beings behind Tuoba Lingyu stared at Qi Yuan and the others with unfriendly expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, one celestial jade can't buy me, and besides, you already called me a treasure. You should know, a treasure is priceless." Qi Yuan felt it was still better to keep a low profile and communicate verbally, avoiding physical conflict if possible.</p><p></p><p>He also needed to train his verbal skills, he couldn't always lose arguments to the cow-horned sister.</p><p></p><p>"One celestial jade... is insulting you, don't you understand? Could it be... you're mentally challenged!" Tuoba Lingyu looked at Qi Yuan as if he were an idiot.</p><p></p><p>In her view, even talking to Qi Yuan was giving him face.</p><p></p><p>After all, the purpose of existence for people like him was just to be livestock for bloodletting.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Qi Yuan was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a vicious person in this world! How could there be such a vicious mouth in this world! He wasn't hurt, nor was it like a stone hitting a barking dog!</p><p></p><p>"Dressing so revealingly, and not just revealing, but showing three breasts, what does that mean? The world has lost its morals, offending this old man's eyes. Die!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a sound came from the space.</p><p></p><p>A Yang God Heavenly Venerable appeared, glanced at Tuoba Lingyu with disgust, and slapped her to death with one palm.</p><p></p><p>The several mythical beings next to Tuoba Lingyu didn't even have time to react before they also died from this slap.</p><p></p><p>This incident happened too suddenly.</p><p></p><p>They were still arguing just now, when suddenly a Yang God appeared and slapped Tuoba Lingyu to death.</p><p></p><p>The power of a Yang God was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>Mythical beings were like ants to him.</p><p></p><p>Killing a few ants took almost no effort.</p><p></p><p>The Yang God Heavenly Venerable's eyes turned, glancing at Qi Yuan, and he said pretentiously: "This old man was just passing by, not helping you."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a roar suddenly came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you! Who killed my granddaughter!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying figure appeared in the Zhili Heavenly Realm, with godly might like fury and bloody aura filling the sky.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was filled with a thick bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying figure's gaze fell on the location where Qi Yuan and the others were.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was the ancestor of the Mixed Blood Sect, the Divine Blood Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Qi Yuan's expression became tense, and he hurriedly said: "I didn't kill her, it has nothing to do with me. It was this Yang God Heavenly Venerable who killed her. I don't know him, and I don't know that his name is Mo Tong!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 306</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A blood-red light rose up and flashed by in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The civilians on the hilltop widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Young Yaji tightly clutched his dirty little sister, his pupils constricting sharply.</p><p></p><p>"This... was this done by Mr. Qi?"</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes almost exceeded Yaji's imagination. </p><p></p><p>Even modern weapons would be hard-pressed to create such a terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>If one had to compare it to something, perhaps only the special effects of a terrible divine attack in movies could come close.</p><p></p><p>But those were just movies, greatly exaggerating the power of deities.</p><p></p><p>Yet they still couldn't match the heart-shaking impact of this scene before him.</p><p></p><p>Yaji's young mind was filled with all kinds of emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Is Mr. Qi... on par with the gods?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the steel prison building within the camp.</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Kuanghuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The sound... it stopped!"</p><p></p><p>Next to Kuanghuan, a bearded man opened his eyes wide: "A red light flashed by... and then everything was gone?"</p><p></p><p>They were locked deep in the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>But even so, they had heard the earlier sounds of gunfire and explosions.</p><p></p><p>At first, they thought the camp was under attack, and felt uneasy, not knowing what awaited them.</p><p></p><p>Because they never imagined this camp could be breached.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was inside Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>With 3,000 soldiers stationed here, it would be very difficult for Yuelang country to penetrate this far inland.</p><p></p><p>It would also be hard for Yuelang to hastily organize a war of this scale.</p><p></p><p>They probably just encountered a small-scale attack.</p><p></p><p>However, suddenly afterwards, the world turned blood red for an instant.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Kuanghuan completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man locked up with him also looked bewildered, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Especially after that huge flash of red light, following a thunderous boom, the entire camp suddenly became eerily quiet again.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of gunfire and explosions had vanished, and there were no alarms either.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers stationed in the dungeon also seemed to have vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It was undeniably rather creepy.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are there no sounds at all?"</p><p></p><p>The two men were extremely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In their minds, that blood-colored light lingered.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them had any idea what had actually occurred.</p><p></p><p>Tap tap.</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps were heard.</p><p></p><p>The faint footsteps sounded especially clear and loud in the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>The two men held their breath, but also felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>The sound of footsteps meant the camp was fine.</p><p></p><p>The stationed soldiers must be on patrol.</p><p></p><p>The two looked towards where the footsteps were coming from.</p><p></p><p>There was an iron door there, the only entrance and exit to the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at that moment, a flash of blood-red light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Before the two could even be shocked, they saw that iron door suddenly shatter, as if it were cut through like tofu.</p><p></p><p>This sight truly startled Kuanghuan and the bearded man.</p><p></p><p>"What... what's going on? What kind of weapon? Who is it?" The bearded man had many questions in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this time, through the shattered iron door, a slender and well-proportioned figure appeared, with a handsome and elegant face bearing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Kuanghuan, I've come to take you away."</p><p></p><p>"Mr... Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>When he saw that person's face, tumultuous waves surged in Kuanghuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man was stunned for a moment, then turned to Kuanghuan: "You know each other, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The phrase he had said most today was "what's going on".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, looked at Kuanghuan, and slowly said: "Two days ago, I received a call from your wife, saying you had encountered trouble in Wugui country and were captured by their military.</p><p></p><p>So, I came here to bring you back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan felt shocked, and then grateful.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man was stunned, then said: "So all that commotion up above was caused by you. Your team is very impressive. And... that blood-red light, what kind of weapon was that? I've never heard of anything like it."</p><p></p><p>The bearded man seemed to have ten thousand questions in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He also voiced Kuanghuan's doubts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two of them and said calmly: "The blood-red light was naturally the glow of my sword.</p><p></p><p>Alright, follow me and leave. We're going back to Qinyuan country."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he swung the long sword in his hand again.</p><p></p><p>The steel prison door in front of them instantly shattered at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the bearded man's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan had calmed down by now.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that Qi Yuan was a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Slicing through an iron door with one sword strike... shouldn't be anything special.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this bearded man is also from our Qinyuan country. Could he leave with us as well?" Kuanghuan asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had risked danger to come rescue him.</p><p></p><p>Above was a military camp, with 3,000 soldiers stationed there.</p><p></p><p>One more person meant one more risk.</p><p></p><p>He naturally thought that Qi Yuan must have used some drones to bombard the military camp in cooperation with his sister Kuangxi, causing chaos, and then took the opportunity to enter the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>As for directly confronting that military force, he didn't even dare to imagine it.</p><p></p><p>The combat power that could be unleashed by 3,000 well-equipped modern soldiers was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man and Kuanghuan walked out of the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared in the bearded man's eyes: "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The two of them followed behind Qi Yuan. Although they had many questions in their minds, they knew that right now they should quickly and quietly leave this military camp and rendezvous with their support to depart. They shouldn't linger too long.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan spoke again: "We're in no rush to leave. There's a place in this military camp that's... quite interesting. Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Qi Yuan, Kuanghuan naturally didn't dare to have any objections.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man anxiously said: "If we don't leave quickly now, what if the soldiers up above discover us?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, they won't discover us, because... they're all dead."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?" The bearded man was stunned, somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"I killed them all with one sword strike." Qi Yuan didn't conceal anything, nor did he need to.</p><p></p><p>"All killed?" The bearded man was dumbfounded, still not comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's eyes suddenly constricted, as a terrifying idea formed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Before the topic could continue, Qi Yuan led the two of them across the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>On the way, they encountered many corpses of soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Those corpses looked very peaceful on the surface, still preserving their appearance from before death, with no visible wounds on their bodies, as if... they had just suddenly died while going about their daily routines.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man fell silent, not daring to speak anymore, only secretly glancing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan said nothing, but unconsciously quickened his pace somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they passed through many buildings and arrived in front of an iron door.</p><p></p><p>The air seemed to be filled with the smell of disinfectant, along with a strong scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>The long sword flashed again.</p><p></p><p>The iron door collapsed with a boom.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan watched Qi Yuan's actions, his eyes revealing a look of envy.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man had a look of amazement and seemed lost in thought, as if puzzling over... how Qi Yuan had acted, how he had accomplished this?</p><p></p><p>With the iron door shattered, a huge hall appeared in everyone's view.</p><p></p><p>In the hall, there were over thirty enormous glass containers.</p><p></p><p>The glass containers were cylindrical, filled with liquid. Not only that, but in the liquid of each glass container, three people were submerged.</p><p></p><p>These people had weak auras, with tubes inserted all over their bodies. Blood was slowly being transported through the tubes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These people were immersed in liquid, like corpses of five poisonous creatures in medicinal wine.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Human experiments... The Guiran people are so heartless!" The bearded man clenched his fists, anger rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As fellow humans, seeing others treated like lab rats inevitably evoked sympathy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the immersed people, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes: "All signs of life gone... beyond help."</p><p></p><p>These people... or rather, they were already dead.</p><p></p><p>A murderous glint flashed in his eyes: "The Guiran people truly deserve death. This is not just illegal or corrupting social morals, this is... utterly inhumane. </p><p></p><p>These people must be chaotic evil!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan belonged to the lawful good alignment, and hated chaotic evil the most.</p><p></p><p>Capturing civilians for human experiments beneath a military camp - Qi Yuan found this behavior utterly repulsive. </p><p></p><p>He looked ahead and swung his long sword again.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>All the tubes snapped at once.</p><p></p><p>The blood and bodily fluids of the people floating in glass containers were finally no longer being drained.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, they showed no reaction, as if already dead.</p><p></p><p>"I must photograph this scene. Where's a phone? I want to expose this, expose the crimes of the Guiran people!" the bearded man said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan also felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>He could kill without much psychological burden.</p><p></p><p>But experimenting on civilians - he couldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>"These aren't even human!" Kuanghuan said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>These civilians represented so many families.</p><p></p><p>Among them were even teenagers in their early teens, captured and brought here.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes and said softly: "Come out."</p><p></p><p>The bearded man was suddenly on alert.</p><p></p><p>So was Kuanghuan. They naturally thought there were still... people hiding here.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>A huge roar suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>The ground shook at that moment.</p><p></p><p>They saw a terrifying beast, even larger than an elephant, suddenly roar and charge out.</p><p></p><p>This giant beast was covered in blood, extremely ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Its body was also pierced with rubber tubes.</p><p></p><p>Its terrifying body, like a war beast, roared and charged towards the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"M-monster!" The bearded man's face was filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge terrifying monster gave an extremely strong sense of intimidation.</p><p></p><p>It even felt like if this terrifying monster rammed into them, it could send tanks and armored vehicles flying.</p><p></p><p>How could they withstand it charging at the three of them? This terrifying monster was surely a creation of the Guiran human experiments.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely afraid.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with this enormous monster, Qi Yuan remained completely calm.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the label on the terrifying monster and laughed heartily, hands on his hips: "This... also dares to call itself a god?"</p><p></p><p>On the monster's label were written the words "God Creation Project - Mighty God No. 1" in large letters.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the terrifying monster created by Wu Gui country's biological experiments was called a deity.</p><p></p><p>His long sword trembled again.</p><p></p><p>"A deity... that doesn't even have its own bones, but uses metal?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled lightly as a blood-colored light flashed.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying beast weighing over a hundred tons suddenly froze, suspended in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the terrifying beast split into pieces, turning into a large mass of blood.</p><p></p><p>Metal bones fell and scattered on the ground, looking particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the bearded man breathed heavily. His gaze towards Qi Yuan changed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan's eyes burned with excitement. He couldn't help saying: "Mr. Qi... could I one day kill such a giant beast with one sword strike?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan killing the giant beast with one sword strike made him yearn for such power.</p><p></p><p>Is this the power of cultivators? Wouldn't this kind of strength mean one could send a tank flying with a single sword strike?</p><p></p><p>"Of course you can, it's not difficult." Qi Yuan patted his hands.</p><p></p><p>His long sword trembled again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a blood-colored bead formed on the long sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes immediately saw a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored bead was the power core of the terrifying beast from earlier.</p><p></p><p>This power core also came from those civilians.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Guiran people used the blood of civilians, plus some special technology, to create this blood-colored beast.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored beast was also called a deity by them.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that for ordinary people, even genetic warriors, this terrifying beast could indeed be considered a deity.</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure physical strength, this blood-colored beast had already reached the level of an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary artillery shells couldn't harm it at all.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blood essence, various emotions flashing in his eyes: "If I consume this blood, my martial arts talent... would also greatly increase."</p><p></p><p>The blood essence extracted by the Guiran people created this blood-colored beast. For Qi Yuan, the greatest use of this blood essence was to enhance martial arts talent.</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts talent is already very strong, why would I need this."</p><p></p><p>He wasn't Shi Yi after all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, drinking human blood - what if he contracted a virus? Besides, this blood would only increase a certain bloodline, which had already solidified.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was to forge his own bloodline martial arts.</p><p></p><p>His martial arts, with him at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, wouldn't there still be an ancestor above his head?</p><p></p><p>He looked at those bodies drained of life force.</p><p></p><p>His long sword trembled again.</p><p></p><p>"Rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>With his words, the glass containers exploded with a boom.</p><p></p><p>The entire steel building collapsed at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Everything was buried in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grabbed Kuanghuan and the bearded man, appearing on the surface in a flash.</p><p></p><p>This move truly shocked the bearded man.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was in chaos, looking at Qi Yuan as if looking at a deity.</p><p></p><p>However, when they appeared on the surface and saw the military base turned to ruins, his eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They saw collapsed steel buildings, shattered heavy tanks and armored vehicles, soldier corpses everywhere.</p><p></p><p>This place... had become a land of death!</p><p></p><p>Astonishment also flashed in Kuanghuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He understood.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi had single-handedly... killed everyone in a military camp before coming to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we should head back now.</p><p></p><p>I'm in a hurry to attend the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>As for the Guiran people... I'll deal with them after I finish my business.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of a lawful good person like me, I can't stand to see chaotic evil exist!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was being very cold-blooded today.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very self-aware.</p><p></p><p>Such a kind person like him, if put on TV, would be a Mary Sue - no, a Gary Stu - very unpopular with viewers.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Kuanghuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he knew Qi Yuan's thoughts, he definitely wouldn't nod.</p><p></p><p>You killed three thousand people with one sword... and still dare to call yourself a Mary Sue?</p><p></p><p>The bearded man beside him had a surprised expression: "Mr. Qi... you're also participating in the martial arts tournament?"</p><p></p><p>Some younger members of the bearded man's family were also participating in the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this fierce man who had killed an entire regiment wanting to participate in the martial arts tournament, he found it ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, do you know any of the contestants in the martial arts tournament?</p><p></p><p>How strong are they? Are there any formidable opponents to watch out for? My goal is to win the championship, I wonder if it will be difficult." Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man recalled Qi Yuan killing the terrifying beast underground with one sword strike, and a complex smile appeared in his eyes: "It shouldn't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

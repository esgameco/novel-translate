        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fragments of the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"This game is quite generous, the things it gives are not bad."</p><p></p><p>As a person from the Blue Star, the Fragments of the Heavenly Dao were the most familiar thing to him.</p><p></p><p>After all, defying the heavens had already become a clich√©.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the Fragments of the Heavenly Dao were definitely good things.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Xuanyuan Prohibition has become mine?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan accepted the Fragments of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that the Xuanyuan Prohibition had become his own domain.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>The Fragments of the Heavenly Dao seemed to control the authority over the Xuanyuan Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan obtaining the Fragments of the Heavenly Dao was like becoming the GM of the game.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanyuan Prohibition... is it mine?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Is this all the Fragments of the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it only when all the fragments are collected that it becomes useful?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shifted his attention from the Fragments of the Heavenly Dao to the Divine Brush.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Brush is condensed from the power of the rules, can it inscribe rules on the Xuanyuan Prohibition?"</p><p></p><p>"For example, how can one enter the Xuanyuan Prohibition?"</p><p></p><p>"Then one must carry a ladder to enter."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled some interesting things he had seen on the Blue Star, where a person could go anywhere as long as they carried a ladder on their back.</p><p></p><p>Movie theaters, amusement parks, zoos, as long as you had a ladder on your back, the staff wouldn't stop you.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Qi Yuan inscribed a rule on the Xuanyuan Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a ladder can enter, with unobstructed passage.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting late, I should go for a walk with my pet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rubbed his tired eyes.</p><p></p><p>Playing this game too much had taken a bit of a mental toll on him.</p><p></p><p>So in the Divine Light Sect, he sometimes appeared dazed and disorganized.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wasn't entirely due to the game.</p><p></p><p>His personality was also like that.</p><p></p><p>He seemed... a bit eccentric.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tidied up and prepared to take a stroll with his pet, and also to see Zhuge Miu.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Jiang Lingsu also came out of the thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>She had been busy all day, finally finishing up the house.</p><p></p><p>Now she was thinking of going down the mountain to buy some daily necessities.</p><p></p><p>But then, footsteps approached, and Jiang Lingsu immediately looked over.</p><p></p><p>It was the senior brother going out? But when she saw the senior brother, Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what are you doing?" Jiang Lingsu's face was filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>In her line of sight, Qi Yuan was still wearing the white robe from earlier, but unlike the initial encounter, he was holding a rope in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It looked like he was walking a pet.</p><p></p><p>But that pet... was it really a pet?</p><p></p><p>That was... a cleaver!</p><p></p><p>Yes, the end of the rope was tied to a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan was leading the cleaver, this scene was too absurd.</p><p></p><p>"I'm walking my pet." Qi Yuan said calmly, "It's been cooped up in the house for too long, its legs are about to rust. Taking it out for a walk to breathe some fresh air."</p><p></p><p>A cleaver has legs?</p><p>Walking to prevent rusting? You're treating it like it's made of spiritual iron!</p><p>This is clearly an ordinary iron cleaver.</p><p>She was now certain that this senior brother's head was a bit problematic.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother's taste is quite peculiar." Jiang Lingsu forced out these words.</p><p></p><p>"Are you also going down the mountain? Want to come along?" Qi Yuan invited.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Jiang Lingsu quickly refused, "Senior brother, you go first, I'll go later."</p><p>If she followed the senior brother walking a cleaver, it would definitely attract too much attention.</p><p>That would be too embarrassing! Qi Yuan glanced at Jiang Lingsu and then turned his gaze back to the cleaver on the rope, focusing as he said, "Be good, listen obediently, don't struggle."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Take off the leash, or else you'll be beaten to death by the sticks, I don't care about you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still had some quality, he walked his pet on a leash.</p><p></p><p>Unlike some people, they walk their pets without a leash.</p><p></p><p>Then the pet runs around aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>It's better to keep his pet on a leash, otherwise it would be bad in the summer.</p><p></p><p>He held the leash and slowly walked towards the foot of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>The night breeze was cool, and the sun in the sky had become gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked his pet, feeling particularly comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Playing games too much, his eyes hurt, and his fingers hurt too.</p><p></p><p>Blowing the wind, taking a walk, and looking at beautiful women, it's not bad either.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is a world of cultivating immortals, the probability of encountering beautiful women is much higher than in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, they all have fair skin.</p><p></p><p>There are no obvious flaws on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Even without makeup, they are still very capable.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan." A tall and slender young woman greeted Qi Yuan, she was wearing a short skirt, her long legs were as white as jade, not sickly pale, and very attractive.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan responded.</p><p></p><p>He would come out to walk his pet almost every night.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was the only one walking his pet.</p><p></p><p>But he was the eldest disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, with a certain celebrity effect, and the act of walking pets gradually became popular in the Divine Light Sect, and many of his fellow disciples also started imitating Qi Yuan to walk their pets.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the pets that those senior brothers and sisters walked were real pets, or rather, spiritual beasts, possessing combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Your little crab is not bad, I estimate it will give birth to spiritual intelligence in a few thousand years." Qi Yuan looked at the long-legged woman's pet and gave his evaluation.</p><p></p><p>The long-legged woman heard the first half of the sentence and her face was full of pride.</p><p></p><p>She had carefully selected this spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>But the second half of the sentence made her a little annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Giving birth to spiritual intelligence in thousands of years? Is that good? Even with her good temper, she couldn't help but retort: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, when will your pet be able to awaken spiritual intelligence?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's pet was a kitchen knife, how could it awaken spiritual intelligence?</p><p></p><p>Nearby, many disciples of the Divine Light Sect who witnessed the event burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned and thought for a while, then said seriously, "At most a year, at least very short, it should be able to awaken spiritual intelligence."</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is really joking." The long-legged woman laughed, obviously not believing Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan just smiled and didn't explain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the figure of Zhu Ge Miao also appeared in the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>He said, "Senior Brother Qi Yuan has reformed the Refining Spirit Technique and personally tested it, whether successful or not, his courage is admirable.</p><p></p><p>You all laugh at this, which is truly a frog in the well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhu Ge Miao's words, the people present all bowed their heads.</p><p></p><p>"The senior brother's teaching is right!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ge Miao was the eldest disciple of the Divine Medicinal Peak, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They were in awe of him.</p><p></p><p>As for the amiable Qi Yuan, they didn't have much reverence for him in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ge Miao scolded the crowd for a while, then walked up to Qi Yuan: "Senior Brother Qi Yuan, the master is refining pills today, and I was late in attending to him, please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ge Miao's overbearing aura had dissipated, and he treated Qi Yuan equally, with a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, this is a Nourishing Element Dan formula I obtained from a cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>But there is a part that is lacking, I don't know if the junior brother can point me in the right direction.</p><p>I am willing to offer a Foundation Establishment spiritual treasure."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ge Miao's attitude was very humble, in stark contrast to his previous overbearing manner.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Nourishing Element Dan formula and looked it over.</p><p></p><p>[This is a incomplete Nourishing Element Dan formula, if the cinnabar yellow is replaced with female Ligustrum, and the sheep drum is replaced with small marigold, the effect of the refined pill can be increased by 50%, and the pill toxicity will also be reduced by a bit.]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

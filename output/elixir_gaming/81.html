        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother, if you have reached the Foundation Establishment stage, there should be some auspicious signs appearing during the process.</p><p></p><p>If the hundreds of birds sing in the morning or the myriad flowers bloom in the dead of winter.</p><p></p><p>But these past few days, there is no sign of anything good, only endless snow and thunderous roars from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Rather than saying it's the Foundation Establishment, Jiang Lingsu even suspects that some evil entity has emerged.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the constant thundering can't really be considered an auspicious sign.</p><p></p><p>As long as Elder Brother succeeds in the Foundation Establishment, Jiang Lingsu will naturally be happy for him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's eyes showed a worried expression: "Sister, you have seen a lot, after the Foundation Establishment, will there be any side effects? </p><p></p><p>I don't know why, but I've been feeling muddled lately, and I even occasionally have auditory hallucinations."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Jiang Lingsu furrowed her brows, "There shouldn't be such symptoms after a successful Foundation Establishment. Elder Brother, I think you should go see a doctor or consult an elder."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those strange murmurs invaded his ears again.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally reached the third layer of Qi Cultivation, my senior sister should look at me more favorably now, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh, no! It stinks!"</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Origin Technique has seven layers, reaching the seventh layer will allow one to enter the realm of the Elixir Cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>These voices, like mosquitoes, kept buzzing incessantly in Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Listening to these voices, Qi Yuan suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"I've got it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu blinked her eyes, with three question marks in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"My cheat code has arrived!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>When he entered the Qi Cultivation stage, Qi Yuan's eyes could see the hidden information that ordinary people couldn't see.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has reached the Foundation Establishment, his ears can hear some strange words, isn't that normal?</p><p></p><p>His cheat code has arrived.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu felt that even though Elder Brother has reached the Foundation Establishment, the problem with his brain still hasn't improved.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Jiang Lingsu said, "Elder Brother, you wanted to join the Divine Flower Association, right? Now that you've reached the Foundation Establishment, I'll recommend you for membership, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and smiled, "Good, thank you, sister."</p><p></p><p>Now, he and his sister have killed that Zhu Lianhua from the Bright Palace.</p><p></p><p>That day, his kind sister helped him take the blame, and Qi Yuan still felt uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Joining the Divine Flower Association will give him an extra layer of buff.</p><p></p><p>This is Qi Yuan's idea.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a small-town cultivator, getting close to the university cultivators early on will make him look very impressive when talking about it.</p><p></p><p>"Your membership application will take some time to be approved," Jiang Lingsu said, looking at Qi Yuan expectantly, "I've helped you so much, how will you repay me, Elder Brother?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Jiang Lingsu's chest.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the petite and cute Jiang Lingsu is wearing a thin green dress today, which looks quite loose, but still fails to conceal the two lush snow peaks, with a faint creamy white cleavage visible through the thin fabric.</p><p></p><p>Very impolite to say, but very big and substantial.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly remembered the voices he had heard before.</p><p></p><p>The bra is too small again, so annoying.</p><p></p><p>Helping his sister solve the problem she's facing, isn't that a way to repay her? He couldn't help but say, "I'll buy you a bigger bra."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu looked down at herself, and her hands immediately covered her chest.</p><p></p><p>Just now, she had changed clothes in the room, and due to the excitement of knowing that Elder Brother had emerged from seclusion, she had hastily put on the small-sized bra and casually thrown on the thin gauze dress next to it.</p><p></p><p>The spring scenery was slightly revealed, and her face instantly turned red: "Shameless."</p><p></p><p>She finished speaking and hurried back into the thatched cottage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu's retreating figure, a look of surprise on his face, and then immediately reflected, "I was too impolite."</p><p></p><p>Feeling that his words were too low in emotional intelligence, he needs to be more high-EQ in the future.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw that his sister had returned to the thatched cottage.</p><p></p><p>He also went back to his own room.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the room, the empty feeling after completing the game had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Especially the heavy snow on the Seven-Color Peak, which made him reminisce about the heavy snow on the Seven-Month Lake in the game.</p><p></p><p>He sat alone on the blue stone, with only the moon as his companion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his arm.</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon mark on it had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Life is like a dream."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out the game jade slip, and his consciousness entered it.</p><p></p><p>But what he saw was a vast expanse of white.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer enter the Wueyue Continent as he had done before.</p><p></p><p>"After completing the game, can I no longer enter it?" Qi Yuan walked out of the thatched cottage and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The stars in the sky were densely packed, no different from the stars he had seen on the Wueyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The stars in the sky are all projections, so the Wueyue Continent and the Qinglan Realm are seeing the same starry sky."</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel a little better.</p><p></p><p>He went back into the cottage.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've completed one game, will the second game be unlocked?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness wandered in the white expanse of the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan saw a bright light, which looked like the icon of a game app.</p><p></p><p>"A new game?" Qi Yuan's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness kept approaching the game app icon.</p><p></p><p>But that game app icon seemed to be extremely resistant, and Qi Yuan's consciousness could not get close to it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Damn game, won't let me play!" Qi Yuan got angry.</p><p></p><p>He tried hard to get closer, but still couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face turned deathly pale: "Could it be that the memory is not enough, so I can't download it?</p><p></p><p>Or maybe the level of this game is too high, and I can't play it now?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remembered when he first played the Wueyue Continent, as an ordinary person, he could only stay there for less than an hour before having to leave.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual consumption was too great.</p><p></p><p>As his strength increased, his divine soul became stronger, and he could play in the game for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"So, my divine soul is too weak, and I can't enter the second game?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>He has already reached the Foundation Establishment stage and can release his spiritual sense, his divine soul has grown a lot, but it is still too weak to enter the second game.</p><p></p><p>"Either this game is too big, or this game has blacklisted me."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan didn't make much effort to move his consciousness forward.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a murmuring voice entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>"When I, Ning Tao, grow up, I will definitely be the most beautiful girl in the world."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"My ears are so powerful? Can I even hear the voice from the game icon?"</p><p></p><p>This voice was clear and sweet, with a faint childlike tone, and it seemed that the life was very happy and fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but say, "Little Ning Tao, I believe you."</p><p></p><p>He said this with a helpless expression, not knowing if the NPC in the game could hear his voice.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Autumn colors everywhere, the sound of pine trees, the blue-green moss-covered blue stones.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's long black hair covered half of her face, her pupils were pitch-black, and she had a sweet smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>The black dress clung tightly to her body in the wind, and perhaps due to malnutrition, her body was a bit thin, but the exposed skin on the back of her hand was so white that it seemed unnaturally pale, with visible blue veins.</p><p></p><p>The girl's appearance was extremely beautiful, though not yet fully developed, she was already a beauty in the making.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was a scar on her face, with a strange character carved into it, adding a sense of brokenness to this face.</p><p></p><p>The girl sat on the moss-covered blue stone, looking at the reflection in the water, her eyes filled with a sweet smile: "When I, Ning Tao, grow up, I will definitely be the most beautiful girl in the world."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, her dagger stabbed the neck of the man lying beside her.</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered, landing on Ning Tao's black dress, also splashing onto her face.</p><p></p><p>Around her, six men in black clothes, their faces gloomy as they looked at Ning Tao, holding various weapons in their hands: a black-clothed man holding a sword spoke in a deep voice, "You demonic woman, so ruthless and cold-blooded at such a young age, what will you be like when you grow up?"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, a loose-mouthed axe-wielding man coldly said, "The mark of a demonic woman has been carved onto your face, making you ugly and hideous!"</p><p></p><p>"Demonic woman, everyone who sees you will want to kill you, you are as vile as a demonic calamity! Even the purest and kindest saint in the world would not think you beautiful? Who in this world would dare to think so?"</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since I tasted a woman, cut off her head, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao suddenly stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>She thought of her mother.</p><p></p><p>Her mother had also once been a saint, and she had also said that Ning Tao would be the most beautiful girl in the world when she grew up.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The young Ning Tao tightly gripped the dagger, looking at the six men slowly approaching her, her eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>But she was too badly injured and could not break through the situation.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a thunderous roar seemed to come from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A thick yet ethereal voice entered the ears of all present.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend Ning Tao, I believe in you."</p><p></p><p>The vast voice was like a great bell striking in everyone's heart. It fell upon Ning Tao's ears, yet it was like a gentle breeze caressing her face.</p><p></p><p>"Who?" </p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"What distinguished person, we are here to slay the demon woman, please do not interfere!"</p><p></p><p>"When encountering a demon woman, she must be slain!"</p><p></p><p>The six men, holding their weapons, turned pale-faced. They looked around warily, their spirits in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>For this voice was vast, like that of an immortal master. </p><p></p><p>If the owner of this voice were to attack them, they dared not imagine the consequences.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ning Tao's figure moved. She was like a black Mandala, and the dagger in her hand pierced the chest of a black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed, staining her black dress. The blood on her unnaturally white palms was also overly vivid.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Beware the demon woman!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>But that majestic voice, like a thunderclap, still left a buzzing in their ears.</p><p></p><p>Their reaction ability had also been greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, they had been stunned by that voice and had been on guard against it, completely failing to notice Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao suddenly struck, inflicting heavy damage on them.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>These men let out agonizing screams as Ning Tao, like a ghost, slaughtered among them.</p><p></p><p>In half a quarter-hour, all the black-robed men lay on the ground, without any breath of life.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood amidst the corpses, her entire body covered in blood. The blood on her arms flowed down, dripping onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>She had also sustained serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>She bent down, holding the dagger, and walked towards the corpses, even though they were already dead, she still wanted to finish them off, cutting off their heads.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ning Tao slowly walked towards the pool she had been by earlier.</p><p></p><p>The pool water was clear, but there were no fish or other living creatures.</p><p></p><p>The water reached her knees, and she suddenly looked up, her voice childishly cute, "Uncle, are you still here?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood quietly, waiting.</p><p></p><p>But there was no answer.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, if you're still here, answer me, I'm about to...take a bath."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao waited again, but it was silent here, only the fragrance of flowers and the stench of blood, not even the sound of insects.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, Ning Tao is taking a bath now, don't peep, okay?"</p><p></p><p>"If you peep, when I grow up, you have to marry me, and if you don't, I'll..."</p><p></p><p>Her black dress slowly fell off, and Ning Tao waded into the water, only her small head visible. Her face had an innocent expression, but her vigilance had not yet completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after an unknown amount of time, Ning Tao emerged from the water.</p><p></p><p>She looked up at the sky, her black pupils devoid of any emotional color, but her voice was deliberately childish, "Uncle, I've remembered you."</p><p></p><p>Towards the unknown voice, she only had fear, and her previous actions were just for the sake of survival.</p><p></p><p>Her mother had said that if you tell a man you want to marry him, he would probably be stunned.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Achoo!" Qi Yuan sneezed, the cold wind blowing through the dilapidated thatched hut, biting to the bone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was studying the cultivation method, stood up: "I have already reached the Dao Foundation Establishment realm, I am a powerful Dao Foundation Establishment Grandmaster, yet I still live in a thatched hut, this is too low-profile. Tomorrow I will go change to a wooden house."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that with his increased strength, his status and identity should also be elevated.</p><p></p><p>To continue living in a thatched hut would be too frugal and thrifty.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, even if I change to a wooden house, I still cannot avoid the toil of life." Qi Yuan sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although he worked hard cultivating during the day and studying cultivation methods, he still had games to play at night.</p><p></p><p>It was just like the working class on the Blue Star, working hard 996 every day, but after get off work, they could still play games, watch videos on Weishi, and enjoy their simple pleasures.</p><p></p><p>But now, the games are gone, and the simple pleasures are also gone, every day is spent studying painfully, it can be said to be extremely bitter.</p><p></p><p>"Should I resign from my position as the First Disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak and go to the mortal realm to become a wealthy landowner, bullying and domineering?" Qi Yuan thought about this, his eyes lighting up.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon discarded this idea.</p><p></p><p>"Without the Divine Light Sect backing me, if that old demon Black Chicken finds out I destroyed the Black Mountain Sect, he will definitely give me trouble, and I won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>"If I become a wealthy landowner, I'll definitely have to marry dozens of concubines and have a huge family of gold-devouring beasts.</p><p></p><p>If they cause trouble, I'll have to clean up their messes!</p><p>If I offend the cultivators, it'll be even more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't I just become a nanny in that case?"</p><p></p><p>"Even mortals have their own difficulties, I'd better just focus on cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan abandoned this impulsive idea.</p><p></p><p>He began to seriously study the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Now he has three important things to do.</p><p></p><p>The first is to supplement the subsequent cultivation methods of the "Qi Yuan Sutra".</p><p></p><p>The current "Qi Yuan Sutra" can only cultivate to the Dao Foundation Establishment realm, the methods from Dao Foundation Establishment to Golden Core are still incomplete.</p><p></p><p>This requires Qi Yuan to slowly supplement.</p><p></p><p>The second is to strengthen his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>With a powerful divine sense, he can enter the game world and break free from the daily cultivation confinement.</p><p></p><p>The third is to obtain more high-grade cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivation methods still seem too slow, and tens of thousands of cultivation methods are not as helpful to Qi Yuan as a single high-grade cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>But where can one obtain high-grade cultivation methods so easily? "Thinking of Zhu Lianhua's hundredth day, sigh, when will I be able to meet a bright and handsome man like Zhu Lianhua, my white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about Zhu Lianhua's Mysterious-Grade Technique.</p><p></p><p>The night was deep, and outside the thatched hut, it was a white expanse.</p><p></p><p>"I'm craving for games."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out the game jade slip, but still could not enter the game icon.</p><p></p><p>And listening carefully, he could not hear the sounds from the game either.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to play games, I want to kill, kill, kill."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his hand touched a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"East Xian gave me a game jade slip, the cold and aloof female sword immortal? This female sword immortal must be very strong, I wonder how many of my sword strikes she can withstand."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan's consciousness entered the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the illusion of a cold and aloof female sword immortal appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Defeat me!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>A sword light flashed, and the sword in the female sword immortal's hand broke.</p><p></p><p>"How weak, how boring." Qi Yuan wanted to give this game a bad review.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the cold and proud female sword immortal, a drop of clear tear rolled down her beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>"I have been defeated by you, do with me as you please!" The female sword immortal said with humiliation, "Even if you obtain my body, you can never obtain my heart, my heart will always belong to my senior brother."</p><p></p><p>The female sword immortal's clothes slid off, her face with an expression of humiliation, crawling towards Qi Yuan like a dog.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, that's not playing fair, using seduction?" Qi Yuan cut down the female sword immortal with a sword, cursing as he left the game.</p><p></p><p>"My own game is still the most fun." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The morning sun climbed up the clouds, the snow slowly melting.</p><p></p><p>The entire Seven-Colored Peak had become even colder.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, East Xian pays his respects!" </p><p></p><p>Outside the wooden house, the black-robed East Xian had a respectful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before Qi Yuan came out of the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>He looked at East Xian, saying proudly, "Junior brother, how do you find my new home? Is it grand and majestic, does it have the potential of a mansion? Does it match my current status and identity?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thatched hut had been renovated into a wooden house yesterday.</p><p></p><p>East Xian looked at the wooden house, his smile somewhat stiff.</p><p></p><p>This dilapidated wooden house...</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother's cave dwelling is truly an immortal abode, a spiritual realm in the world." East Xian still praised it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>It's just like buying a bicycle and posting a picture on your circle of friends, getting endless praise from old classmates.</p><p></p><p>Feeling proud and pleased, it's not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>"I heard from my junior sister that you've been wanting to find me during my seclusion, what is the matter?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the last time he talked about the chest armor with his junior sister, she has been unwilling to talk to Qi Yuan for several days.</p><p></p><p>But a few days ago, his junior sister still came outside Qi Yuan's house and told him that East Xian had been looking for him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, do you know about the Contention for the Dragon?" East Xian stood respectfully outside the wooden house, his attitude very sincere.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a bit about it." Qi Yuan had also heard about the Contention for the Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Last time, his junior sister Jiang Lingsu said that Zhu Lianhua from the Light Palace was going to interfere in the Contention for the Dragon of the Great Xia, and then control the Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the ambitions of the Light Palace are quite large.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother Qi Yuan, in fact I have another identity, I... am the Seventeenth Prince of the Great Xia."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat atop the city wall, dressed in a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was sacred, his voice ethereal like celestial music. </p><p></p><p>As soon as he began preaching, everyone present was entranced.</p><p></p><p>Even the malicious Supreme Milo felt as if he was alternating between paradise and purgatory.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was spellbound, time slipping away unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Outside No Return City, three terrifying auras lay in wait.</p><p></p><p>The leader was Milo Supreme's father, the Great Supreme Mikong.</p><p></p><p>An odd expression crossed his face: "Even with the aid of the Destiny Tablet, the Blood Lord's talent is frighteningly impressive."</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Human Demons is the way of human nature. One must either deeply understand human nature or be obsessed with a single thought to comprehend its essence. To preach it requires at least... worldly wisdom, seeing through the true nature of all things. Unfortunately, this also means... confusion," another Great Supreme sighed. "The Blood Lord's madness is not an act. Even a Great Supreme cannot withstand the extreme power of Human Demons. His insanity is normal."</p><p></p><p>All three present were Great Supremes. </p><p></p><p>They had inscribed their Origin Divine Abilities onto their bodies and souls.</p><p></p><p>They had a deeper understanding of the Way of Human Demons.</p><p></p><p>This path was truly chaotic and frenzied. The deeper one's realm, the greater the influence.</p><p></p><p>Not a single supreme powerhouse like the White Emperor or the Sovereign remained in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who knows if they might suddenly go mad.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Destiny Tablet, the Blood Lord could clearly explain the chaotic Way of Human Demons, allowing Earthly Legends to directly contact the Origin. It could be said that the Blood Lord had delved too deep into the Human Demon path and could collapse into madness at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Even Great Supremes could not withstand it, let alone... the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Once we obtain the Destiny Tablet, we cannot emulate the Blood Lord and become too entangled with it. Each of us will wield it for seven years, taking turns," proposed a yellow-browed Great Supreme from the North.</p><p></p><p>This proposal had been agreed upon by them beforehand.</p><p></p><p>"No objections," said the blue-haired woman coldly. "I enjoy studying strange things. Two-thirds of the Blood Lord's body should be left for me to thoroughly examine."</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme Mikong chuckled: "When we make our move later, we can't be too fierce. If we accidentally smash the Blood Lord to pieces, Great Supreme Ice Snow won't be able to study him."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-browed Great Supreme smiled, his eyes filled with worry: "My eyebrow keeps twitching. I don't know if it's a good or bad omen."</p><p></p><p>"What else are you worried about?" asked Great Supreme Mikong.</p><p></p><p>"The Purple Daoist's disappearance in Blood Fall Thousand Cities is very strange," the yellow-browed Great Supreme said uneasily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Great Supreme Mikong felt utter contempt for the yellow-browed Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>They had discussed this matter many times, yet this old yellow-brow was still worried.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Blood Lord used the Destiny Tablet to kill the Purple Daoist, we have... over a thousand Supremes at our command. Even the White Emperor would have to be cautious, let alone the Blood Lord!" Great Supreme Mikong reassured helplessly.</p><p></p><p>His lifespan was nearly exhausted. He had to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the three Great Supremes had gradually sent peak Earthly Legends into No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Including those attending this sermon, there were a total of 1,500.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that No Return City's prosperity was inseparable from their contributions.</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme Ice Snow spoke coolly: "If we delay any longer, we won't be the only ones coveting the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-browed Great Supreme pressed his twitching eyebrow: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Great Supreme Mikong smiled: "Let's discuss again how to divide the spoils."</p><p></p><p>Discussing these things was always exciting and joyful.</p><p></p><p>After all, this opportunity was even greater than when they became Great Supremes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, the sermon ended.</p><p></p><p>The audience sat, some frowning, some pondering.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on the wall, murmuring: "I was much more serious in this sermon than in previous ones. Don't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice fell,</p><p></p><p>A man in the barbican suddenly stood up, the power of Origin bursting forth from his body.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were tightly closed, but his irrepressible joy was still visible.</p><p></p><p>A Supreme! Some Supremes awoke from their enlightenment and looked at the newly ascended Supreme with complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>As one Earthly Legend ascended to Supreme, more and more Supremes appeared like bamboo shoots after rain.</p><p></p><p>In just a few hours, the number of new Supremes in the barbican exceeded a thousand.</p><p></p><p>This was comparable to over a thousand years of accumulation in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Milo Supreme opened his eyes, filled with amazement.</p><p></p><p>The information he had received was nothing compared to witnessing it firsthand.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Blood Lord on No Return City's wall, an extremely bold idea flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Soon... he could take his place.</p><p></p><p>Wait... wait... wait for all the sleeper agents to ascend to the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed. For working people, it was another day of torment. For those on vacation, it was far too short - the day ended just as they woke up and barely started to enjoy themselves.</p><p></p><p>For those who had broken through to Supreme, time was short, almost unreal.</p><p></p><p>But for Milo Supreme, this afternoon felt exceptionally long.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after the last Earthly Legend ascended to Supreme,</p><p></p><p>All 2,000+ Earthly Legends present had entered the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>As usual, these 2,000+ Earthly Legends bowed to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"We thank the Blood Lord for imparting the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand Supremes shouted in unison, their voices echoing for tens of miles throughout No Return City.</p><p></p><p>At least this shout was somewhat sincere.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on the city wall, a lazy expression on his face: "It's finally over."</p><p></p><p>An ending is also a kind of beginning.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he seemed about to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"It's not over yet." The speaker was Milo Supreme, who had been biding his time.</p><p></p><p>His voice was light, but it reached everyone's ears, including Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, the gazes of thousands of Supremes fell on him.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of Supremes looked at Milo Supreme with complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>Some looked surprised, some terrified, some confused and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi stood in the crowd, cursing at Milo Supreme: "This guy is finally making his move."</p><p></p><p>There was also worry in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who wasn't a fool could see that many Supremes were walking towards Milo Supreme, seemingly taking sides.</p><p></p><p>Among them were many veteran Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Milo Supreme: "If it's not over, hurry up. I'm busy."</p><p></p><p>Milo Supreme looked at the calm Qi Yuan, feeling nervous, but he knew that at this moment, the arrow was already on the string and had to be fired.</p><p></p><p>He shouted: "Today's matter is a grudge between myself and the Blood Lord. Everyone else... just watch. If you interfere and die here, don't blame me!"</p><p></p><p>Milo Supreme laid down his threat.</p><p></p><p>As his voice rang out, more and more Supremes flocked to him.</p><p></p><p>Even the "veteran" Supremes of No Return City rushed to Milo Supreme's side.</p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths, over a thousand Supremes had gathered around Milo Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand Supremes gathered together, their aura enough to shock everyone.</p><p></p><p>The remaining thousand or so Supremes were like scattered sand, their faces uncertain.</p><p></p><p>A tall and burly Supreme stepped forward, his expression agitated: "What are you doing? The Blood Lord granted us Origin enlightenment, helping us become Supremes. You've just become Supremes, and you're already betraying the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>He cursed at Milo Supreme and those Supremes behind him.</p><p></p><p>After cursing, he shouted at those behind him: "Everyone, follow me to protect the Blood Lord! They have numbers, but the Blood Lord needs us!"</p><p></p><p>Of the thousand Supremes behind him, only a few dozen stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The rest had various expressions - some hesitant, some uneasy, some even wanting to join Milo Supreme's side.</p><p></p><p>Milo Supreme looked at the tall and burly Supreme, contempt in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Human nature... is always selfish.</p><p></p><p>The occasional flashes of brilliance are like the stars in the ancient legends of the sky.</p><p></p><p>When the stars are gone, where is the brilliance?</p><p></p><p>However, Milo Supreme still spoke with a smile in his eyes: "Don't be fooled by the Blood Lord. The Blood Lord was originally a young prodigy, quite admired by my father. My father, Great Supreme Mikong, even wanted to betroth my younger sister to him. But who knew this person had evil intentions? He seduced my sister, bewitched her, and stole a supreme treasure from my father, Great Supreme Mikong. It's by relying on that treasure that he achieved his current success. I have had a long-standing grudge with the Blood Lord. Please don't get involved!"</p><p></p><p>No matter when, it's necessary to have some righteousness.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when this news came out, some Supremes who were originally afraid and unwilling to protect the Blood Lord said:</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Blood Lord could impart the Dao. So he stole Great Supreme Mikong's treasure. I'm unwilling to protect such a despicable person!" Some Supremes found a reason not to protect him, feeling more at ease.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, some opportunists even asked: "Milo Supreme, can we join you?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let's kill this despicable villain together!"</p><p></p><p>"You're most welcome," Supreme Lord Miluo spoke with a smile.</p><p></p><p>On the opposite side were also over a thousand supreme lords, even more numerous than their side. However, those thousand supreme lords... could not unite as one.</p><p></p><p>They were not to be feared at all.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, nearly a hundred more supreme lords joined Supreme Lord Miluo's side.</p><p></p><p>The smugness on Supreme Lord Miluo's face grew even more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord... hand over the treasure and kill yourself to atone for your crimes," Supreme Lord Miluo, accompanied by a thousand supreme lords, pressured the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood atop the city wall, excessively calm: "Is this all of you? Are there no others?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Blood Lord lives up to his name, truly courageous indeed!"</p><p></p><p>A hearty laugh rang out.</p><p></p><p>Three Great Supreme Lords appeared, emanating powerful auras. They landed inside the City of No Return, shielding the thousand supreme lords before them.</p><p></p><p>They were Great Supreme Lords, with extraordinary strength.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the three appeared, it was like an iron rod calming the sea. The newly defected supreme lords following Supreme Lord Miluo also felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>These three Great Supreme Lords faced Qi Yuan across the thousand supreme lords, their expressions burning with intensity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Lord was excessively calm.</p><p></p><p>This further deepened their suspicion that the Blood Lord had already gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if the White Emperor were replaced by the Blood Lord, he would not be so composed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even though these three Great Supreme Lords were confident, they did not stand in front of the thousand supreme lords, but positioned themselves behind.</p><p></p><p>Who knew if that Blood Lord had some terrifying method? If they were to be sacrificed, it would be too tragic.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lord, we three Great Supreme Lords and over 1,700 supreme lords are here to send you off. Are you satisfied?" Great Supreme Lord Mikong's face was full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>When had he ever been able to command over a thousand supreme lords? As long as they killed the Blood Lord, everything belonging to the Blood Lord... would be theirs.</p><p></p><p>With the aid of the Fate Stone Tablet, they would be even more powerful than the legendary White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Even if they entered the battlefield of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, they would have a place, and could even bargain with the legendary Supreme One.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme One was so powerful, wasn't it also because of a Fate Stone Tablet?</p><p></p><p>On the scene, Li Yunzhi was worried: "Old Gai, how can the Blood Lord turn this around? There are a full 1,700 supreme lords!"</p><p></p><p>1,700 supreme lords, as if they were cheap as cabbage.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying force, led by three Great Supreme Lords in an encirclement attack.</p><p></p><p>Even if the White Emperor himself were here, he could not break this deadly situation.</p><p></p><p>"You... will know soon," Wang Gai touched his back, feeling the cold sensation. It would soon be his turn to take the stage.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood atop the city wall and also smiled: "Did you think that when you plotted against me, I had no awareness at all, no precautions at all?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, Great Supreme Lord Mikong's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Those 1,700 supreme lords also felt a hint of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard Qi Yuan say: "I have also prepared a great gift for you."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he took out a cup in his hand and gently tossed it down the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, those thousand supreme lords couldn't help but take half a step back.</p><p></p><p>Even the three Great Supreme Lords were scared into retreating several steps.</p><p></p><p>The cup fell from the city wall, making only a thud sound, with almost nothing else happening.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai looked at the intact cup with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>This was a bit different from what was agreed upon.</p><p></p><p>The over 3,000 supreme lords on the scene had uneasy expressions, all examining Qi Yuan, not knowing what he was up to.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard Qi Yuan say with a smile: "Oh my, I used a silver cup for the cup-smashing signal, and it didn't break. How embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Whether it broke or not... come out, you all, my great gift to you!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, Great Supreme Lord Mikong, Great Supreme Lord Ice Snow, and Great Supreme Lord Yellow Eyebrows felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>There really was a backup plan? If so... it seems this would be a fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>Following Qi Yuan's voice, among the supreme lords below, a hundred flew towards the top of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Among these hundred was naturally Wang Gai.</p><p></p><p>These hundred were also supreme lords who had witnessed Qi Yuan in action before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these people land on the city wall, Qi Yuan felt greatly reassured: "With them here, what do you have to fight me with?"</p><p></p><p>The three Great Supreme Lords below looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>An absurd feeling spread.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for the Blood Lord to have a hundred supreme lords willing to die for him.</p><p></p><p>But to rely on a hundred supreme lords to block their thousand?</p><p></p><p>Was he an idiot?</p><p></p><p>The three Great Supreme Lords felt that the Blood Lord was indeed sick, not acting, and quite seriously ill at that.</p><p></p><p>They had been so wary of this madman for so long, devising countless plans and contingencies. Thinking about it now, it was especially laughable.</p><p></p><p>They saw the Blood Lord standing on the city wall, facing the thousand supreme lords before him, with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with you, I've formed a band. That's giving you enough face, right?"</p><p></p><p>Back in the Cang Lan Realm, Qi Yuan had thought about playing some background music during battles to make them more atmospheric.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in the Cang Lan Realm, he didn't have so many lackeys, and could only use jade slips to play music, greatly reducing the effect.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had become the Blood Lord, what he had no shortage of was people.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred supreme lords to play music for you, to send you off. Isn't that grand enough?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Those hundred supreme lords wearing blood-red robes had solemn expressions and took out various musical instruments.</p><p></p><p>Flutes, trumpets, gongs, drums, suonas, sheng, cymbals, erhus... everything was there.</p><p></p><p>The five at the front, including Wang Gai, held instruments similar to suonas.</p><p></p><p>This scene made everyone present feel ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>"Play the music," Qi Yuan stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai held the suona and blew hard.</p><p></p><p>Woo-hoo.</p><p></p><p>As the suona sounded, the noise was shrill, like a funeral dirge.</p><p></p><p>It continued high and loud, as if weeping and pleading.</p><p></p><p>Those hundred supreme lords, like musicians at a funeral, had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>In the dry desert, only that shrill sound could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately got into the rhythm.</p><p></p><p>"At first hearing, one doesn't recognize the suona's sound. Hearing it again, one is already in the coffin."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I haven't prepared coffins for you, so you can't even be called people in coffins!"</p><p></p><p>As the music started, Qi Yuan walked out from the city wall, stepping through the air towards those thousand supreme lords.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>With a hundred supreme lords playing suonas, his battle power was stronger.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, such a thing could not be replicated in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would find hundreds of supreme lords every day to play suonas outside the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Those thousand supreme lords looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the suonas was indeed full of sorrow, but it was also... too much.</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme Lord Mikong's expression was not good.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Lord was truly a madman!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Great Supreme Lord Mikong spoke.</p><p></p><p>Those thousand supreme lords hesitated for a moment, but finally began to prepare to act.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen... a thousand demons rampaging, blood floating in the human world?"</p><p></p><p>Virtual Realm Lord's Heart Demon Summoning!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Qi Yuan's long-prepared innate divine ability, like a flood of water, surged forth continuously in his blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sound of suonas, blood rain fell, landing around those thousand supreme lords.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, those thousand supreme lords instinctively wanted to block the blood rain.</p><p></p><p>However, the blood rain seemed formless, impossible to block or touch.</p><p></p><p>But... when it fell on their bodies, terrifying things happened!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, like a blood-colored god of death, sat in the void, with a cruel smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Keep playing the music, keep killing!"</p><p></p><p>Virtual Realm Lord's Heart Demon Summoning!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sound of suonas, countless terrified screams rang out. Those supremely powerful supreme lords now seemed to have seen the most terrifying monsters in this world.</p><p></p><p>Some kept howling, some kept crying loudly.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying demons crawled out from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>They were like the most powerless newborn infants, utterly unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>A thousand supreme lords, under Qi Yuan's innate divine ability, gave birth to heart demons.</p><p></p><p>The imposing army of supreme lords collapsed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The mournful music sounded, representing the thoughts of the living for the dead.</p><p></p><p>In the enceinte, over 1,700 supreme lords had twisted expressions, biting themselves, devouring themselves.</p><p></p><p>On the scene, there was only the sound of music, and the screams of those thousand supreme lords.</p><p></p><p>The scene was... extremely bizarre for a time.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi, and the remaining thousand supreme lords who saw this scene, had no words.</p><p></p><p>What... exactly was this?</p><p></p><p>The divine ability was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand supreme lords had their heart demons break out of their bodies! Even Supreme Lord Miluo, that veteran supreme lord not from the City of No Return, was equally miserable.</p><p></p><p>This scene was truly... terrifying.</p><p></p><p>That Blood Lord... where was he a born saint? This was clearly... a god of slaughter!</p><p></p><p>The thousand living supreme lords swallowed and looked extremely frightened.</p><p></p><p>Didn't this mean that if the Blood Lord wanted to, he could also kill them in an instant?</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, looking at the constantly dying supreme lords with extremely terrified eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three Great Supreme Lords' eyes were filled with terror for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"You... you... what exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>A thousand supreme lords dying together, like a demon realm... was this a scene they could witness?</p><p></p><p>Even gods couldn't do this, right?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

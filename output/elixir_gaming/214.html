        <h1>Chapter 214</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the Twilight Elder finished expressing his indignation, </p><p></p><p>He declared: "Now, the generals under the Origin Heavenly Lord are sweeping through the Maple and Forest countries. This action will surely draw the attention of the Evil God's army! I am willing to go to the Forest country to assist the Origin Heavenly Lord. Who is willing to go with me?"</p><p></p><p>"So today's big commotion was done by the Origin Heavenly Lord. I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Origin Heavenly Lord? This move seems unwise."</p><p></p><p>"They're just trying to show off for a moment. Once the Evil God's army mobilizes, they'll all be dead. Going to support them now would just be going to our deaths!"</p><p></p><p>"They're destroying the Evil Gods, and that's showing off? What are we doing by hiding like turtles?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't our Ancient God Alliance destroy the Evil Gods in the Forest and Maple countries? Why don't we do it? Isn't it just for the sake of enduring for the bigger picture? Is that wrong too?"</p><p></p><p>"If all the ancient gods in our Alliance go to assist the Origin Heavenly Lord, even if the Evil God's army comes, they won't be able to handle us!"</p><p></p><p>"We should keep a low profile and develop quietly now. Starting a war lightly will drag the Ancient God Alliance and the Mortal Heart Realm into an irredeemable situation."</p><p></p><p>"Keep retreating, keep retreating. Are we going to wait until the Evil Gods are at our doorstep before we start resisting?"</p><p></p><p>There was much debate in the group, with different ancient gods expressing their own views.</p><p></p><p>They argued in the group for half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Under the locust tree, the Twilight Elder had a wistful expression.</p><p></p><p>Around him were gathered over twenty ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>These twenty-odd ancient gods had all voluntarily left the Ancient God Alliance, wishing to go to Green Water Village to support the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these ancient gods were in high spirits, ready to face death.</p><p></p><p>"Twilight Elder, we should go now," the Fire Lotus Elder spoke up, her voice gentle like a woman from the south.</p><p></p><p>"We've waited for so long, those who were going to come have already arrived. The other ancient gods have made their own choices, we don't need to wait anymore," an ancient god said, his voice full of resignation.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient God Alliance, there were over three hundred ancient gods, but only twenty-odd had come.</p><p></p><p>Not even one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>But this was also normal.</p><p></p><p>Going to support Green Water Village would mean facing an attack from the Evil God's army.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that with their current strength, they simply could not withstand the Evil God's army.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Fire Lotus Elder asked the Twilight Elder: "You are most familiar with the Origin Heavenly Lord. Do you know why their Green Water Village suddenly increased in strength, and why... they suddenly took action against the Evil Gods of the Maple and Forest countries?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, all the ancient gods present looked at the Twilight Elder.</p><p></p><p>They were actually very curious about this matter too.</p><p></p><p>Green Water Village was unknown, with only a village-level guardian god, yet suddenly it had many true gods and dared to take action against the surrounding Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>This was exaggerated and bewildering.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the Evil Gods hadn't reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Elder frowned, pondering: "The Origin Heavenly Lord... he once visualized twenty-one legendary-level god observation methods!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with these ancient gods willing to go to Green Water Village, the Twilight Elder chose to trust them.</p><p></p><p>"What? That world-class genius was him!" The gentle Fire Lotus Elder's eyes showed shock.</p><p></p><p>At that time, an ancient god in the Visualization Realm had visualized twenty-one legendary-level god observation methods in a row, shocking the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the ancient gods in the Ancient God Alliance had heard about this.</p><p></p><p>They had thought it was a world-class talent from the southern region.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined it would be someone from the occupied area.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, it's more understandable," the ancient gods present spoke up one after another.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an ancient god suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"The other day, eight mythical gods appeared in the Visualization Realm. Could it be... him too?" This ancient god's voice trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Being able to visualize twenty-one legendary methods was rare.</p><p></p><p>Eight mythical ones was already unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The probability of these two being the same person was both low and high.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," the Twilight Elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"If it's him... I think those old fellows in the alliance are right, we should keep a low profile, develop quietly, and accumulate strength," an ancient god couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>"They keep a low profile and develop, what have they developed? They're just being turtles!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods debated among themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Elder's gaze became determined: "If he really visualized eight mythical methods, we must protect him no matter what!"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Evil God's army was strong, but that didn't mean Green Water Village was already doomed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God had already returned to Flying Wutong City, and even made a trip to Green Water Village.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was gritting his teeth, glaring at the big black dog beside him: "Couldn't you have stopped the Origin Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The big black dog trembled, feeling extremely aggrieved inside.</p><p></p><p>It had terrible luck today.</p><p></p><p>It was bad enough that his sworn brother Shi Zhongshan didn't serve it tea and food.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi even sat directly on top of it.</p><p></p><p>Now, even the Thunder God was bullying it.</p><p></p><p>It was just a dog, how could it stop the Origin Heavenly Lord? Should it just bark non-stop? It didn't want to be served on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, where on earth did Qi Yuan go!" The Thunder God felt desolate in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Qi Yuan had led people on a thousand-mile expedition to kill Zhang Feng, which moved him deeply.</p><p></p><p>He had planned to persuade Qi Yuan to keep a low profile and relocate with the gods as soon as he returned.</p><p></p><p>But as it turned out, before he could persuade him, Flying Wutong City and Green Water Village were empty.</p><p></p><p>When he asked, he learned that Qi Yuan had made a plan to destroy a hundred gods in one day.</p><p></p><p>Now, all the ancient gods of Green Water Village had set out to hunt Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>Such a high-profile action would definitely drag the entire Maple and Forest countries into an abyss.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know where my adoptive father went either," Qi Qi said from the side, her expression quite calm, as if she wasn't surprised by Qi Yuan's actions.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God felt like letting out a long howl to the sky.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he quickly opened his communication jade slip.</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Region.</p><p></p><p>Inside a cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God's phantom appeared, and seeing the Pear Mountain Lord in front of him, he directly threw a thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>The Pear Mountain Lord was startled, casually waving his hand to dispel the thunderbolt, and questioned: "Thunder God, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"What am I doing?" The Thunder God was indignant, "Since you knew Qi Yuan had visualized eight mythical methods, why didn't you keep him in the Southern Region? These are eight mythical methods, how many mythical descents can the current Visualization Mountain support?"</p><p></p><p>The foundation of Visualization Mountain was the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>"He refused to participate in the mythical plan, saying he vowed to kill those above true gods. Since he has such lofty aspirations, I naturally wouldn't force him. Such an ancient god is most worthy of my admiration!" The Pear Mountain Lord murmured.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan's declaration to kill those above true gods had stunned him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder God became even more angry: "You let him go back, that's fine, but couldn't you have advised him to be more cautious? I've told you before, he's even more reckless than me!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Pear Mountain Lord had an ominous premonition: "Did he not keep a low profile and send people to rescue you? This only shows that you have an important place in his heart, it's not a big deal. You should persuade him again, to stay calm in everything."</p><p></p><p>The Pear Mountain Lord had heard Qi Yuan's sincere speech at the time.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had said he would develop slowly, accumulate strength, and only act when fully prepared.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't just send people to rescue me, he directly led over twenty Ancient Gods to rush to Cai Kingdom and killed Zhang Feng!" As Thunder God Supreme said this, he felt both moved and helpless.</p><p></p><p>Pear Mountain Supreme was also somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>This Origin Celestial Lord was really bold.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I didn't expect he would be this kind of impulsive person.</p><p></p><p>But it's okay, you are now very close to the North Sea Divine Eye. If you take him to the North Sea Divine Eye during this time, there shouldn't be any major issues."</p><p></p><p>The North Sea Divine Eye was a special place, even the Evil God Army Camp could not easily attack it.</p><p></p><p>"Later, just take good care of him and advise him not to be rash." Pear Mountain Supreme felt that although the situation was serious, it wasn't too bad, and there was no need to exaggerate like Thunder God Supreme was doing.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Supreme was used to being careless and didn't have the cultivation befitting a Supreme at all.</p><p></p><p>"Advise my ass! I just got back and heard that he led those Ancient Gods to sweep through the Evil Gods of Feng and Lin kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>He's planning to kill 100 Evil God Supremes in one day!" Thunder God Supreme said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Pear Mountain Supreme was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>It seemed... he had only parted from Qi Yuan less than a day ago?</p><p></p><p>He was just talking about developing quietly, but as soon as he returned to Qingshui Village, he directly started a divine war!</p><p></p><p>This was... too fast! Did he get kicked in the head by a donkey?</p><p></p><p>"This is bad, once the Evil God Army Camp takes action, they... will have no way out." Pear Mountain Supreme said worriedly, "I must go to Qingshui Village!"</p><p></p><p>Pear Mountain Supreme quickly made up his mind to go to Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let Qi Yuan mess things up anymore.</p><p></p><p>He hoped he would make it to Qingshui Village in time.</p><p></p><p>"You quickly take him to the North Sea Divine Eye, you must protect Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you don't need to tell me that!</p><p></p><p>Why couldn't you advise him properly?" Thunder God Supreme said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Huaye City.</p><p></p><p>Located in the occupied area, this city had no Ancient Gods, only New Gods.</p><p></p><p>However, this New God had been in seclusion and had not assimilated the people of this city.</p><p></p><p>So although the people here lived as if treading on thin ice, they could still barely manage to survive.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two figures were standing on a small hill in the city.</p><p></p><p>One figure was burly and strong, looking like someone not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>The other had an upright posture and handsome features, with an absent-minded expression as if recalling something. This person was Qi Yuan. He looked at the small hill in front of him and the pavilion on top, and couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to come to Little Jiangshan."</p><p></p><p>"Has the master been here before?" Zhu Zhuangshi asked beside him, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's background had always been a mystery.</p><p></p><p>The villagers of Qingshui Village, as well as other Ancient Gods, had all speculated about Qi Yuan's identity in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, once I traveled the world with a peerlessly beautiful woman. She said this was her birthplace.</p><p></p><p>This place should have originally been a bamboo forest, but now a pavilion has been built."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh, feeling that time waits for no one.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the No Food Holy Mother had brought Qi Yuan to Little Jiangshan. She had taken a bamboo stick and made it into a fishing rod, fishing together with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The No Food Holy Mother had murmured that if only she had been born tens of thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's a place of old memories, why not revisit?" Zhu Zhuangshi said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>He had come out with Qi Yuan to do great things.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it happens to be a teahouse, let's go take a look." Qi Yuan said casually, "There seems to be a treasure inside, we'll take it while we're at it."</p><p></p><p>It was called a teahouse, but it was no ordinary teahouse.</p><p></p><p>There were people singing, dancing, playing instruments, everything you could think of.</p><p></p><p>Before they even entered, a plump woman with a face full of smiles came up to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"Are the guests here to listen to music, watch dancing, or do you need a private room?" The plump woman's gaze fixed on Zhu Zhuangshi, with a mysterious smile in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A private room." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Certainly!" Hearing this, the plump woman immediately smiled so hard her ample bosom shook.</p><p></p><p>Entering the pavilion, an exotic fragrance assailed their nostrils. In the center of the pavilion, seventeen graceful young women were dancing elegantly.</p><p></p><p>Draped in colorful gauze, with slender waists swaying slightly and lotus feet moving lightly, every smile and gesture was alluring.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi's eyes were fixed straight ahead.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding guests also slowly applauded, appreciating the dancers' charming movements.</p><p></p><p>Who could imagine that this was an occupied area, with such an extravagant scene? Perhaps it was precisely because they knew there was no hope for the future that these cultivators were indulging in pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu walked in front, with a peculiar look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't see through the strength of either of these two guests.</p><p></p><p>But even though that burly fat man was hiding it well, she could sense that he was at least at the Purple Palace Realm perfection stage, and might even be an Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>What were they doing in Huaye City? Aunt Liu was puzzled, but didn't dare to ask.</p><p></p><p>How many Ancient Gods in this world were still loyal to the Mortal Heart Realm? Most were running dogs.</p><p></p><p>The followers of their No Food Holy Sect were rooted here and couldn't be exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Please be seated, gentlemen. Which girl would you like to come play the zither or sing?" Aunt Liu said with a face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, the images of over a dozen young women appeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>Each one was beautiful and alluring, with coquettish expressions, incomparable to any beauty filter.</p><p></p><p>Next to each young woman floated some text introducing her.</p><p></p><p>Some were skilled at playing the zither, some at playing the flute, while others excelled at both dance and music.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over these dozen or so young women, but didn't find a suitable one. He asked, "Who can play the suona?"</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu's eyes froze: "The guest's tastes are quite unique."</p><p></p><p>It was normal for guests who came here to have various quirks.</p><p></p><p>But wanting to listen to the suona was indeed unique, even rare.</p><p></p><p>It was like asking two comedians to perform at a funeral.</p><p></p><p>"Whenever I hear the sound of the suona, I want to kill people.</p><p></p><p>I happen to be preparing to kill someone, so I need someone who can play the suona." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Aunt Liu's face froze.</p><p></p><p>Kill someone? She knew that something big was definitely about to happen.</p><p></p><p>The two guests before her were clearly no ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"There are New God masters stationed nearby, the two of you should think thrice before acting." Aunt Liu hinted vaguely, speaking ambiguously.</p><p></p><p>"Who can play the suona?" Qi Yuan repeated, Aunt Liu's words going in one ear and out the other.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xing once learned to play the suona for a while." Seeing this, Aunt Liu could only answer thus.</p><p></p><p>"She'll do." Qi Yuan sat by the window, where he could look down and see the graceful dancing in the center of the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, sir."</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu left the room and went to another room.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xing, two guests have come to the Sky 17 room. Pay attention and see if you can find out their identities." Aunt Liu instructed.</p><p></p><p>As followers of the No Food Holy Sect, they paid special attention to mysterious strong figures like Qi Yuan and Zhu Zhuangshi.</p><p></p><p>"Try your best to find out who they want to kill." Aunt Liu added, "But most importantly, prioritize your own safety."</p><p></p><p>Little Xing, wearing an apricot-colored long dress, nodded: "Understood, Aunt Liu."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Rogue Immortal Lord, you've even made it onto the Eastern Land's Young Genius List!" </p><p></p><p>The usually silent Ice Empress spoke up in the group.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord hurriedly said, "How can I compare to Sister Ice Empress!"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord seemed to have some fear towards the Ice Empress.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor said, "Rogue Immortal Lord, make another push and you can get onto the Eastern Land's True Genius List!"</p><p></p><p>After lurking in the group for a while, Qi Yuan finally understood that the Eastern Land's Genius List recorded the top 1,000 geniuses under the age of 60.</p><p></p><p>The Young Genius List was a secondary list for those who couldn't make it onto the Genius List.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, they were all more impressive than the Ten Eminent Ones list of the Great Merchant Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan admired them greatly, and thought of his knowledgeable group friends, so he asked in the group, "Do you all know the Broken Wolf from the Hall of Radiance?"</p><p></p><p>Knowing yourself and knowing your enemy, you will be undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>"Broken Wolf? Never heard of him. Oh, newcomer, our Godflower Three Emperors have become Four Emperors now," the Ice Empress said.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord hurriedly said, "Origin Celestial Lord, you haven't encountered Broken Wolf, have you? He's on the Eastern Land's Genius List, ranked in the top 700. </p><p></p><p>That's the true Genius List, not my little Young Genius List.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who makes it onto the Genius List will have the ability to challenge realms above their own.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of Radiance and the Godflower Sect are enemies, you must never reveal your Godflower Sect identity, or else Broken Wolf will definitely not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this, both shocked and delighted.</p><p></p><p>Shocked that the other party seemed to be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Delighted that this White Moonlight must have many good things on him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Sun Flame Emperor also expressed concern, "Origin Celestial Lord, if you don't have the strength of an Elixir Celestial, it's best to avoid Broken Wolf."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor knew some of the Hall of Radiance's actions.</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf seemed to have gone to a small place to do something, but he didn't know the specific location.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that Origin Celestial Lord's "Brilliant Sword" was obtained by slaying one of the Hall of Radiance's people.</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf went there to get revenge for that person.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you all for your concern, I, the Celestial Dao Foundational, will not be afraid of him?" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"You're also Celestial Dao Foundational?" the Ice Empress asked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, that day, I fought the evil demons of the Three Thousand Domains, and finally captured the Celestial Dao, achieving Celestial Dao Foundational!" Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Empress paused for a moment, then quickly said, "Origin Celestial Lord is so powerful, another great figure is rising in the cultivation world!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt the admiration of the group members, and finally felt that the people in the group were good.</p><p></p><p>The others didn't believe his Celestial Dao Foundational claim, only the group members believed him.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and continued to ask, "Does this Broken Wolf have any powerful cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>A wealthy White Moonlight was the good kind of White Moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"Broken Wolf's master is the Furious True Lord, a late-stage Spiritual Infant expert. Broken Wolf should have many good things on him," the Great Sun Flame Emperor said, "Origin Celestial Lord, you must be careful."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Empress spoke up at this time, "Furious? I've seen him, he's not that impressive. </p><p></p><p>Once, he tried to refine a treasure, and secretly overthrew a small country.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his master being somewhat powerful, I would have scattered his ashes long ago."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord: "...Sister Ice Empress is still the most formidable."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly hugged the Ice Empress's thick leg: "Sister, sister!"</p><p></p><p>This Ice Empress must be a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a woman's power is boundless, and she is among the immortal ranks.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also wanted to soar to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>After praising the Ice Empress for a while in the group, Qi Yuan exited the chat group, filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm already burning with desire, wanting to find a secluded place and ruthlessly..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qi Yuan, the time has come, you should go out," Dong Xian's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then reined in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the palace, a group of people stood with their hands behind their back.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood near Dong Xian, his gaze sweeping across the crowd, as if he was looking for someone.</p><p></p><p>The main hall was becoming more and more crowded.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of princes, all wearing golden robes embroidered with huge pythons.</p><p></p><p>Behind them stood Foundational Realm cultivators with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>The eldest prince was tall and bearded, standing in the front.</p><p></p><p>The two Foundational Realm sword cultivators from Suspended Mountain stood behind him, exuding a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary cultivators felt a painful sensation in their eyes just from glancing at those two Foundational Realm sword cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"My senior sister has cultivated a Mysterious-grade Dharma, the Foundational Realm cultivators of Suspended Mountain and Radiant Sect can be suppressed with a single hand."</p><p></p><p>This was a voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>But sometimes, Qi Yuan's ears could hear strange sounds around him.</p><p></p><p>Some were others' conversations, some were others' thoughts, and some were voice transmissions.</p><p></p><p>Now, a voice had been heard by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He immediately brightened up.</p><p></p><p>Which little darling had a Mysterious-grade Dharma?</p><p></p><p>Mysterious-grade Dharma, Qi Yuan's favorite.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze across the crowd, finally landing on a bewitching female cultivator from the Demonic Desire Gate.</p><p></p><p>That female cultivator wore a large red dress, her curvy figure very exaggerated, her slender waist and explosive bust forming a stark contrast. The fabric of the dress was not much, revealing her pale, snow-white shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Deep cleavage, rounded half-spheres, that female cultivator was very open, not even using her hands to cover up.</p><p></p><p>Very large, but in Qi Yuan's eyes, still not as good as his Shijie Jiang Lingshu.</p><p></p><p>Shijie's clothes were very loose, but that was deep concealment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze burned as he stared at that female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>White Moonlight, ah!</p><p></p><p>He had another White Moonlight.</p><p></p><p>He had to keep staring at her.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that if he focused on a specific person and was close to them, his target was clear, he might be able to hear their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If this Demonic Desire Gate female cultivator was cultivating a technique, and he could eavesdrop on it now, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Desire Gate's Lu Fei seemed to have noticed Qi Yuan's scorching gaze.</p><p></p><p>She turned to look at Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with coquettishness: "Little Yuan'er, if you keep staring at Sister like this, Sister will get shy. Why don't you come to Sister's room at night, and Sister will let you look boldly."</p><p></p><p>Lu Fei said this while deliberately pushing out her chest, allowing a large expanse of spring scenery to fall into Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she spoke, she attracted the attention of the others.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Qi Yuan and Lu Fei, with a playful expression.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a female sword cultivator from Suspended Mountain looked at Qi Yuan with a trace of disdain in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally didn't care about these gazes, his face showing a delighted expression: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fei paused for a moment, and her smile grew even wider: "Sister will be waiting for Little Yuan'er."</p><p></p><p>She was a little confused, could it be that the top disciple of the Seven-Color Peak was like this? But if that was the case, it would be even better. </p><p></p><p>She most liked to use the advantages of her body to manipulate some stinky men.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a powerful voice came: "Is everyone here?"</p><p></p><p>A man in a white robe slowly entered from outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>On his back, he carried a long sword.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to stand in the midst of radiance.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present knew that this was due to his cultivation of a technique.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was Broken Wolf, and the Eighteenth Prince was closely following behind him, almost like Broken Wolf's servant.</p><p></p><p>All the princes and cultivators looked at Broken Wolf, their eyes filled with wariness.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Hall of Radiance was the outsider.</p><p></p><p>They were all very resistant towards the Hall of Radiance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also stared intently at Broken Wolf.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the real deal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Pure Moonlight.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Lu Fei was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Poluang swept his gaze over the crowd, his eyes lingering on Qi Yuan and Kang Fulou, finally resting on Kang Fulou, pausing for a few breaths before withdrawing his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Poluang stood in his position, not speaking anymore.</p><p></p><p>But all the people present felt a great pressure.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very calm, sometimes staring at Poluang, sometimes staring at Lu Fei.</p><p></p><p>The two pure moonlights had to be watched closely, otherwise, if they escaped, he would have to chase them to the crematorium.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's fiery gaze attracted the attention of many people in the venue.</p><p></p><p>Poluang was also very uncomfortable with Qi Yuan's gaze, and he looked back at Qi Yuan with a trace of murderous intent in his eyes: "I have remembered you, Qi Yuan of the Divine Light Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired one was Kang Fulou, the first Foundation Establishment disciple of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Then the other one must be Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally sensed the murderous intent in Poluang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was a little angry.</p><p></p><p>I just looked at you for a moment, and you already have murderous intent towards me! The Bright Palace is indeed as domineering and hypocritical as my shijie said.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the other pure moonlight from the Desire Demon Gate, after being looked at by Qi Yuan, even invited Qi Yuan to come over at night.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Desire Demon Gate are much more generous.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Poluang's words, Kang Fulou stood in front of Qi Yuan: "The Bright Palace is indeed domineering. Are you Poluang?</p><p></p><p>I am the son-in-law of the Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect, the closed-door disciple of the Peak Master of the Five Light Peak, the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator Kang Fulou. The person you should remember is me!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura emanated from Kang Fulou.</p><p></p><p>Poluang narrowed his eyes: "Interesting."</p><p></p><p>He said no more.</p><p></p><p>He was a figure on the Eastern Land Genius Ranking, why bother saying more to this rural Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Once he entered the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, a single sword strike would be enough to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulou looked at Qi Yuan: "Shidi, with your shixiong here, Poluang will not dare to be reckless!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, shixiong." Qi Yuan, supported by his shixiong, stared even more intently at Poluang and Lu Fei, his gaze jumping between the two.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulou saw this and was quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>As for the female swordsman from the Floating Mountain, she occasionally glanced at Qi Yuan, her gaze somewhat hesitant, with a trace of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sharp voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor has arrived."</p><p></p><p>All the whispering people below looked up.</p><p></p><p>They saw the Emperor of the Great Xia Kingdom slowly walking in, supported by a beautiful lady-in-waiting.</p><p></p><p>He was coughing as he walked, his face pale and weak, looking like he could die at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this Emperor.</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary Emperor, with serious injuries and grave illness. Under normal circumstances, he only has one month left to live.]</p><p></p><p>This was an elderly Emperor, old and weak, not far from death, and without any imperial majesty.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Emperor, we pay our respects to the Empress."</p><p></p><p>The people present paid their respects, at least maintaining basic courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." The Emperor of the Great Xia looked at the crowd, and just standing for a while, he was already a little out of breath, being helped by the Empress to sit on the Dragon Throne.</p><p></p><p>The Empress sat beside him, her aura far exceeding that of the Emperor: "In two days, the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm will open, and the struggle for the Dragon will begin.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, there are many treasures.</p><p></p><p>The rules for this struggle for the Dragon are very simple, whoever obtains the most valuable treasures will be the... future Emperor of the Great Xia Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>The Empress spoke sparingly, not giving a long speech.</p><p></p><p>With just a few sentences, the princes present all started to breathe heavily.</p><p></p><p>Some clenched their fists, some had gloomy expressions, and some were just resigned, not hoping for this struggle for the Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Even Dongxian was a little excited.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to become the Emperor of the Great Xia Kingdom! "His Majesty's health is not very good, you all may leave." The Empress came quickly and left quickly, the Emperor of the Great Xia had not even officially said a word before leaving.</p><p></p><p>The thoughts of the people below were diverse, Qi Yuan stared at Lu Fei, wanting to hear her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Lu Fei also noticed Qi Yuan's gaze, her brows and eyes smiling: "Little brother, come to my room to play at night, I'll leave the door half-open for you."</p><p></p><p>The alluring Lu Fei of the Desire Demon Gate left with the Seventh Prince.</p><p></p><p>The people in the venue also gradually left.</p><p></p><p>That female swordsman from the Floating Mountain, after looking at Lu Fei's back, looked at her own flat chest, and angrily cursed in her heart: "Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Qi Yuan really wanted to leave and go find that pure moonlight, Lu Fei, to play.</p><p></p><p>However, he could not leave yet.</p><p></p><p>Shixiong Kang Fulou said that there would be guests visiting tonight.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, not long after, a young couple entered the hall, emanating a fierce sword aura.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Shixiong Kang, greetings to Shidi Qi."</p><p></p><p>The two who came were the two Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Floating Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The male cultivator was named Lei Wen, and the female was named Miao Li.</p><p></p><p>When Miao Li entered the hall, her gaze towards Qi Yuan was somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulou warmly said, "Please, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen and Miao Li sat down.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen said, "In this struggle for the Dragon, our sect master has said that the affairs of the Great Xia Kingdom should not be interfered with by outsiders.</p><p></p><p>This time, facing the Bright Palace, we of the Floating Mountain and the Divine Light Sect should unite.</p><p></p><p>First, drive out the Bright Palace, and then consider the rest."</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen stated his purpose directly.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulou nodded: "That's right, our sect master also instructed before coming that the Great Xia Kingdom should not fall under the control of the Bright Palace."</p><p></p><p>If the Great Xia Kingdom fell under the control of the Bright Palace, the days of the three major sects would not be good.</p><p></p><p>"I have already secretly contacted the Foundation Establishment disciples of other sects, and five families are willing to cooperate with us.</p><p></p><p>A few more, the Divine Light Sect is closer to them, so I trouble you two fellow Daoists to contact them." Lei Wen went straight to the point, telling Kang Fulou and Qi Yuan his purpose.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Xia Kingdom, the three major sects were the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The other sects actually all had the backing of the three major sects, and had more or less relationships with them.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's a small matter." Kang Fulou said gently.</p><p></p><p>"Poluang of the Bright Palace has unfathomable strength. When the time comes, I'll have to ask Shixiong and our Shimei to join us in taking him down!" Lei Wen said, not mentioning Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had just reached Foundation Establishment, his combat power was not high.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Kang Fulou nodded, "We are all fellow Daoists of the Great Xia, we should unite against the common enemy."</p><p></p><p>The group reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>The two sword cultivators from the Floating Mountain were also preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the silent female swordsman Miao Li slowly said, "Lu Fei is ruthless and skilled in the art of absorbing yang to nourish yin. Some people should not be deceived by her beauty."</p><p></p><p>Miao Li said this and left with Lei Wen.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Miao Li's words, Qi Yuan was a little puzzled, not knowing what she was trying to express. After thinking for a while, he said to Kang Fulou, "Shixiong, I think Shijie Miao is warning you not to be entangled in Lu Fei's sensual charm."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulou: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the night, the half-moon hung in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left the palace, using stealth techniques to move around the palace.</p><p></p><p>The palace was now brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>There were cultivators walking around from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan moved stealthily, and no one noticed him at all.</p><p></p><p>"The Desire Demon Gate's residence should be just ahead, right?" Qi Yuan hesitated for a moment, the purpose of his outing tonight was to eavesdrop on Lu Fei's walls and see if he could overhear any profound cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>After all, that big-chested sister invited him to her room, and Qi Yuan, being shy and bashful, didn't dare to go to her room, so he would just eavesdrop on the walls instead.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

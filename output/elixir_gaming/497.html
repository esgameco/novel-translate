        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>87 female ghost spirits fell.</p><p></p><p>A figure in blood-red armor sat calmly in the air, with a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>He held a long spear, like a divine being descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying and eerie ghost spirits were utterly powerless against him.</p><p></p><p>The villagers who witnessed this scene all knelt down and reverently called out "Divine being!" "Divine being!"</p><p></p><p>"This must be a god!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-dressed woman was dumbfounded, also deeply shocked by this scene.</p><p></p><p>What kind of perfect skills were these? A total of 87 high-level yellow-grade ghost spirits, each one formidable.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual attacks combined would make even a mid-ranked military commander cautious.</p><p></p><p>Even a powerful military commander at the mysterious level would have no choice but to face certain death against such a barrage of spiritual attacks.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this figure in blood-red armor was able to shrug off all these spiritual attacks.</p><p></p><p>Could he truly be a divine being? Besides that, his flawless combat skills, flowing like water, were unparalleled. </p><p></p><p>Despite being inferior in strength and speed compared to the ghost spirits, he single-handedly fought against 87 of them, treating them as nothing.</p><p></p><p>Such technique was too perfect.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-dressed woman had seen high-ranked military commanders, but none possessed skills like these.</p><p></p><p>Mid-ranked military commanders could fight against thousands of armored troops, relying on their robust physique and sharp weapons.</p><p></p><p>But the man in the blood-red armor, the Taoist-dressed woman felt that with just his perfect combat skills, he could singlehandedly slaughter three thousand elite troops and emerge unscathed.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" the Taoist-dressed woman's voice trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I am... the Descending Deity!" came the majestic voice from the sky, like the voice of a divine being.</p><p></p><p>"Descending Deity?" the Taoist-dressed woman was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Descending Deity... was that the same Descending Deity she knew of? Descending Deity... wasn't that the name of a divine weapon?</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's expression was fervent as he looked at the figure in blood-red armor.</p><p></p><p>They all cried out in unison:</p><p></p><p>"Descending Deity, Descending Deity, revered by all realms.</p><p>The Celestial Maiden serves by his side, the Five Thunder Gods heed his command.</p><p>The Six Dings and Six Jias guard and protect him, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces form a divine formation around him.</p><p>...</p><p>His gaze emits golden light, vanquishing evil and upholding justice, his hand wields the light, dispelling the darkness.</p><p>...</p><p>Wherever the Descending Deity goes, light eternal shall reign,</p><p>All things in the world shall bask in his divine grace."</p><p></p><p>The kneeling villagers immediately echoed in unison:</p><p></p><p>"Without light in the world, but the Descending Deity appears!"</p><p>"Without light in the world, but the Descending Deity appears!"</p><p></p><p>Their voices surged like waves, fervent and devout.</p><p></p><p>Even the Taoist-dressed woman was infected, almost joining in.</p><p></p><p>When she emerged from this special atmosphere, she realized that the "divine being" had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Several miles away.</p><p></p><p>A figure fell from the sky with a "thud".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face was pale, looking somewhat ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Where was the imposing aura from before?</p><p></p><p>"Luckily I ran fast, this mosquito drone is too poorly made!"</p><p></p><p>If he continued to ramble on with those people, he would probably end up embarrassing himself.</p><p></p><p>In the fight against the ghost spirits, Qi Yuan was unharmed, but the consumption of his spiritual energy was immense. </p><p></p><p>Especially the mosquito drone, which had depleted too much, unable to keep him airborne any longer.</p><p></p><p>If he continued, he would have to perform a "divine fall" in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, how was the chant I recited just now?" Chen Kangbao said proudly nearby, as if seeking praise.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, from now on you'll be my strategist and get a small loudspeaker!" Qi Yuan praised him.</p><p></p><p>The chant Chen Kangbao had just recited was naturally something Qi Yuan had hastily stitched together.</p><p></p><p>The bad news was that it was stitched, but the good news was that it was all stitched.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, in order to play the role of the Descending Deity, having a presence was not enough, he also needed a catchy chant.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it had an imposing aura; secondly, it was easier to spread.</p><p></p><p>"The only flaw is that this drone is too poorly made, next time I need to get a better one.</p><p>As for thunder, lightning, and so on, I'm still considering and pondering about that."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was reviewing his own performance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always liked to review.</p><p>Even after arguing with someone, he would review his own performance during the argument.</p><p></p><p>After the review, he began to organize his gains.</p><p></p><p>"87 yellow-grade ghost spirits, I've finally reached level 57, directly leveling up by more than 20 levels!"</p><p></p><p>Level 57, according to Qi Yuan's calculations, in this world, could be considered a high-level yellow-grade military commander.</p><p>Just one step away from becoming a mysterious-grade military commander.</p><p>Mysterious-grade military commanders, in some large counties, could even serve as county magistrates, commanding the defense of an entire county.</p><p></p><p>"The increase in strength is a minor matter, the most important thing is... the degree of portrayal of the Descending Deity..."</p><p></p><p>It had surprisingly increased to 12%.</p><p></p><p>The gift of the Descending Deity identity appeared.</p><p></p><p>[As the Descending Deity, I can manifest a divine form, summoned by the faithful, to purify the boundless.]</p><p></p><p>A vast amount of information flooded into Qi Yuan's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"As the Descending Deity" is a skill, or something akin to a divine ability.</p><p>When there are faithful worshippers kneeling in reverence or praying, Qi Yuan can sense it and manifest a divine form to display divine miracles.</p><p>This divine form possesses a portion of the power of the Descending Deity divine weapon.</p><p>Of course, it is not without limitations, the further the distance, the weaker the power.</p><p>The only flaw is that it can only be summoned by others, he cannot initiate it himself.</p><p>This skill is too passive.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, are you my follower?" Qi Yuan looked at Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Chen Kangbao nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually the Descending Deity, quickly summon me!" Qi Yuan wanted to conduct an experiment.</p><p></p><p>Old man Chen Kangbao closed his eyes, his face filled with reverent expression: "Oh God, please open your eyes and look at me, this pale and thin man!"</p><p></p><p>The voice resounded in his ears and in his heart.</p><p>Qi Yuan had three choices:</p><p>1. Respond to the summons as the Descending Deity.</p><p>2. Activate his superpower to communicate with him.</p><p>3. Ignore it or block it.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, as long as he can summon me himself."</p><p>Qi Yuan did not choose the first option.</p><p>He was too weak now, too lazy to respond.</p><p>So he chose the second option.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll fulfill your wish."</p><p></p><p>After the Purple Palace, Qi Yuan had gained the superpower to communicate with "heard" voices, and unexpected things would happen.</p><p>This skill was particularly suitable for the identity of the Descending Deity.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Chen Kangbao suddenly opened his eyes, and on the ground in front of him, a fragrant aroma wafted up.</p><p></p><p>"This... this is a divine miracle!"</p><p></p><p>His previous prayer was that he was hungry and needed food.</p><p>As a result, the deity had responded and provided him with food.</p><p></p><p>The packaging of the food was a bit strange.</p><p>It was a cylindrical box, made of a material Chen Kangbao did not recognize, looking somewhat like paper.</p><p>He peeled off the paper on top and saw the steaming hot food.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... noodles?" he looked at it with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Instant noodles," Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>Yes, what appeared before Chen Kangbao was none other than instant noodles from Earth.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not noodles, it's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Instant noodles with a seasoning packet!" Qi Yuan was somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Without even a seasoning packet, how could these instant noodles be eaten?...</p><p></p><p>Pain, his whole body ached!</p><p></p><p>It felt as if every inch of his skin had been violated.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan slowly woke up, her face bearing a heavy expression of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Her long black hair was askew with a black wooden hairpin, her brows furrowed, with unmelting frost.  Her slender jade legs were pressed together like icicles.</p><p></p><p>Ice, frigid ice.</p><p></p><p>The feeling she gave others was like ice that would not thaw for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>She thought of something, her face revealing an expression of great terror, her hands frantically beginning to check, reaching into her clothes.</p><p></p><p>Because this aching sensation made her realize that a terrible thing had happened.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, she gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with frost.</p><p></p><p>She was still a virgin.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the young master was incapable? After tormenting her for so long, he had only gone as far as touching her.</p><p></p><p>But her clothes also showed no signs of having been opened.</p><p></p><p>She looked up and immediately saw the familiar figure sleeping on the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan's face, complex emotions surged in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You... what did you do to me?" Zhishuan couldn't help but ask coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? The air conditioning is on, why is it a bit cold?" Qi Yuan woke up, stretching, his gaze falling on Zhishuan. "I didn't do anything, I just knocked you out because you were too noisy, and then turned you into a long spear wrapped around my waist."</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense are you spouting?" Zhishuan was confused.</p><p></p><p>She was a high-ranking Imperial Guard, how could this young master, who was powerless, have knocked her out? And turning her into a spear wrapped around his waist, this was simply preposterous.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he... had truly been possessed by a demonic spirit and gone mad?</p><p></p><p>She was also puzzled as to how she had fainted. At this moment, a smug voice came from outside the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I have done as you instructed, the matter of Red Cloud Stronghold has been turned into a story..."</p><p></p><p>After returning from Red Cloud Stronghold, Qi Yuan had been contemplating how to play the role of the Deity's Arrival.</p><p></p><p>To accelerate the progress, he needed to first raise the fame of the Deity's Arrival.</p><p></p><p>So he had fabricated the events of Red Cloud Stronghold into a story, and had Chen Kangbao record the story and distribute it to the storytellers in the taverns, paying them to promote it.</p><p></p><p>In other words, on the Blue Star, he was a self-published book mogul.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan's eyes suddenly fixed on Chen Kangbao, her expression filled with vigilance and dread: "You are...?"</p><p></p><p>She was sharp-eyed, and with a single glance, she could tell that Chen Kangbao was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a thin old man, his hands were calloused, and his bearing suggested that he might be an Imperial Guard.</p><p></p><p>"I am the strategist the young master summoned from the asylum!" Chen Kangbao replied haughtily.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan's face showed a look of astonishment, then suddenly dawned with realization.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with a mocking expression: "Unexpectedly, in just a few days, the young master's abilities have grown, to the point of being able to lure a patient from the asylum and have him knock me out!"</p><p></p><p>She naturally assumed that Chen Kangbao was the one who had knocked her out.</p><p></p><p>After all, the young master Qi Yuan was just a weak scholar.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, Zhishuan was not polite.</p><p></p><p>She could see that Chen Kangbao's condition was not normal.</p><p></p><p>The last time she had been careless and been knocked out, now she would be more careful, how could she have been attacked by Chen Kangbao?</p><p></p><p>"What luring, this is my believer." Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>"I am the young master's most loyal servant!" Chen Kangbao quickly chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan looked at the two of them, her eyes filled with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the young master... had truly gone mad?</p><p></p><p>This way of acting was completely different from what she had seen before.</p><p></p><p>But the young master had some luck, being able to summon a mad Imperial Guard to serve him even in his madness.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the conversation with the young master before she fainted, and her tone softened a bit: "Young master, you boldly returned to the manor. As for the matter in Ninghe County, Miss will personally inquire with the old loyal one!"</p><p></p><p>These words had two meanings.</p><p></p><p>If it was indeed Qi Yuan's misconduct, Miss would severely punish him.</p><p></p><p>If it was a false accusation, then she would clear Qi Yuan's name.</p><p></p><p>If the young master had truly lost his soul and gone mad... Zhishuan felt a trace of pity, which then turned into elation.</p><p></p><p>The young master becoming a little foolish was better than his previous evil deeds.</p><p></p><p>At least, he would not bring disaster to Miss.</p><p></p><p>"This old loyal one, I must also greet him properly, actually framing me, seeking death!" Qi Yuan, playing the role of the son-in-law, said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhishuan was convinced that the young master had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>The young master had always been timid, meekly obedient in the manor, and never dared to get angry.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, she continued to ask: "Young master, what exactly did you do to me, why does this servant's whole body ache?"</p><p></p><p>Now she felt sore and numb all over, as if she had been through a long battle.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I tell you already? You have a bad memory." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Zhishuan did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Zhishuan with an expectant expression: "I have a question to ask you!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please speak." Zhishuan's voice was icy cold, but her face still had a basic politeness and courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"I heard my wife is a Mysterious-level Imperial Guard, how strong is her strength, how fast is her speed, and what are the highlights of her cultivation?" Qi Yuan asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>A frigid aura swept over, Zhishuan's face completely icy: "Young master, who told you to ask this?"</p><p></p><p>Miss not only was a beauty on the Hundred Fragrance List, but also a true disciple of the Heavenly Sect. </p><p></p><p>In Ninguo, the sect and aristocratic powers were strong, even the imperial court had to consider their faces.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Heavenly Sect and the Ancient Thunder Gate were the two most powerful sects in Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>These two major sects had been fighting fiercely, shedding blood to compete for the position of the national religion.</p><p></p><p>In a few months, it would be the competition between the true disciples of the Heavenly Sect and the Ancient Thunder Gate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asking this, Zhishuan naturally thought someone wanted to use Qi Yuan to probe Miss's depths and know her level.</p><p></p><p>"No one, I'm just curious." </p><p></p><p>Look at my sincere big eyes! Qi Yuan looked at Zhishuan earnestly and continued: "As the saying goes, Lü Bu's horse is invincible, Dian Wei's horse is invincible, Ma Chao's riding skills are invincible, so if Lü Bu rides Ma Chao's horse, and Ma Chao rides Dian Wei's horse, wouldn't they be invincible in the world?</p><p></p><p>I just happen to be lacking a mount, so I'll emulate the predecessors and ride your Miss in battle!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke very seriously.</p><p></p><p>Using a mosquito as a drone, or a bird as a drone, ultimately wouldn't work very well.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan suddenly had a brilliant idea, why not turn a powerful Imperial Guard into a drone?</p><p></p><p>For example, the son-in-law Qi Yuan's wife, a Mysterious-level Imperial Guard, although she couldn't fly.</p><p></p><p>But... the speed and strength of a Mysterious-level Imperial Guard are far greater than a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>He could use Thousand Transformations to turn his wife into a drone and carry him in battle.</p><p></p><p>As for the legs and such, just make them invisible, and treat it as low-altitude flight.</p><p></p><p>Then, cultivate his wife to a Earth-level Imperial Guard, wouldn't that allow high-altitude flight? Qi Yuan applauded his own creativity.</p><p></p><p>So he came to ask about the strength and speed of the son-in-law Qi Yuan's wife.</p><p></p><p>"You... are you serious?" Zhishuan's face was icy, filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"I'm serious!" Qi Yuan was very sincere.</p><p></p><p>"You're despicable!" Zhishuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>She would write a letter to Miss, the young master not only had a broken brain, but had also become more despicable!</p><p></p><p>Wanting to ride Miss!</p><p></p><p>Although she was a virgin, she knew what "riding" meant, was it that after riding, he would also get up and kick?</p><p></p><p>"You're worried about your Miss, not wanting me to ride her?" Qi Yuan pondered, "Too bad, your speed and strength are a bit lacking, otherwise I would ride you instead."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell into brief contemplation beside the martial cloud carving.</p><p></p><p>He carefully recorded all the traces above.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying Luo Bufan really broke through the limits of martial arts and shattered the void?" Han Xianyun asked blankly, looking at the traces left by Luo Bufan.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan was recorded in history as the most recent person to break through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As a child, Han Xianyun admired Luo Bufan the most and saw him as an idol. </p><p></p><p>It could be said that most martial artists in martial arts circles greatly admired Luo Bufan.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he shattered the void, or perhaps... he died," Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>He recalled seeing Yu Xiu in that torture space last time.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiu... was already a dead person.</p><p></p><p>So in this world... there was an underworld.</p><p></p><p>Did Yu Xiu come from the underworld? Qi Yuan thought of many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Regarding breaking through the limits of martial arts, Qi Yuan already had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I should also prepare to break through the limits of martial arts," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"?? Wait, Mr. Qi, you want to break through the limits of martial arts?" Han Xianyun was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>He had seen Qi Yuan in action before.</p><p></p><p>This kind of cultivator was like a deity.</p><p></p><p>But now he was going to break through martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Was this... a hobby?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of Zhang Yang from South Lion. Compared to Qi Yuan, Zhang Yang's couldn't even be called a hobby.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that from looking at this martial cloud carving, you've already gained some insights... Did you figure out something from the traces left by Luo Bufan? Are you going to emulate Luo Bufan and break through the limits of martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "I won't emulate Luo Bufan. First, I have no relatives. Second, his path is not suitable for me.</p><p></p><p>The little treasures in the sea are more suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun was shocked inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator was indeed a cultivator, already discovering how to break through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, since your family is so rich, can you lend me a yacht? I'm planning to go out to sea to find an opportunity to break through the limits of martial arts," Qi Yuan reached out to borrow something.</p><p></p><p>He had thick skin and would borrow whatever he lacked without any psychological burden.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... I don't have a yacht," Han Xianyun replied awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a second generation rich kid, he wasn't the kind that lived very well.</p><p></p><p>His father died early, and power had long been in his older brother's hands.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ordinary people, his life was heavenly, but compared to other second generation rich kids, it was quite tight.</p><p></p><p>"But Princess Huansha definitely has one!" Han Xianyun quickly said, "You can borrow from her!"</p><p></p><p>"The paramecium princess has one?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. He pondered, "I've protected her so well, borrowing a yacht from her... she shouldn't refuse, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt this was a done deal.</p><p></p><p>After all, his protection of Princess Huansha was so thoughtful and thorough, he had almost paused her cell division.</p><p></p><p>This greatly extended her lifespan by over ten minutes.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun beside him was speechless hearing this.</p><p></p><p>This was called protecting well?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't dare to refute Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find the princess and borrow a yacht," Qi Yuan waved his hand and headed towards where they came from.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Xianyun was a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid the princess had turned into a paramecium and died.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, paramecia don't have very long lifespans.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>A luxury yacht sailed slowly.</p><p></p><p>A man stood on the yacht, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha stood behind the man, her eyes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday's ten-plus minutes were definitely the most wondrous experience of her life.</p><p></p><p>Facing this amazing man before her, she had none of a princess's arrogance, but was instead like a servant.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, let's head southwest for a bit," Qi Yuan said at this time.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha quickly ordered the AI robot to steer the yacht according to Qi Yuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the yacht sped off towards the southwest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on the yacht, his eyes constantly scanning the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>He was searching for the mutant sea monster he needed.</p><p></p><p>However, in the past half day, he had found almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>Mutant sea monsters were not so easy to encounter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had to be a mutant sea monster of the same bloodline as Qi Yuan, which was even rarer.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had transformed into a radar, constantly patrolling.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha looked on curiously, with many questions in her heart, but obediently didn't ask.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan spoke: "Stop."</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha, like a driver, had the AI robot stop the yacht.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan curiously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a long sword appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, that blood-colored long sword immediately shot into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha saw this scene and widened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She finally saw Qi Yuan take action again... and this blood-colored long sword... wasn't it? Her gaze towards Qi Yuan instantly changed again, as if looking at a deity.</p><p></p><p>After the sword left its sheath, Qi Yuan sat cross-legged on the yacht.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually over ten thousand meters deep, looks like we'll have to wait a while."</p><p></p><p>He discovered that the mutant sea monster was actually over ten thousand meters deep on the seafloor.</p><p></p><p>This depth was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>On Earth, the enormous pressure would be enough to tear apart any human submarine.</p><p></p><p>Even though Arch Star's technology was a notch above Earth's, diving over ten thousand meters still posed huge difficulties.</p><p></p><p>To give an example, Princess Huansha's country of Liulis, even mobilizing the entire nation's resources, could not build a submarine capable of diving over ten thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's target was below ten thousand meters on the seafloor.</p><p></p><p>Now, over ten thousand meters deep on the seafloor, broken pieces of wood were eerily still stained with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Various strange rocks were covered in all kinds of blood stains, as if even the passage of time could not wash away the blood.</p><p></p><p>The corpse of a bloated mutant sea monster lay quietly in the deep sea, encased in a transparent crystal.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had been sealed inside.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the blood-red long sword flickered, and the transparent crystal containing the mutant sea monster's corpse rose up from the deep seafloor.</p><p></p><p>On the yacht, Qi Yuan's expression was surprised: "It seems my luck stat is very high in this game, encountering such an extraordinary sea monster right away."</p><p></p><p>"Game?" Princess Huansha beside him showed a curious expression, "What game?"</p><p></p><p>"I mean, your world is a game I like, and I'm a game player."</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha was stunned briefly, then smiled and said, "Mr. Qi sure knows how to joke."</p><p></p><p>Even if Mr. Qi was a cultivator, it didn't mean everything he said was true.</p><p></p><p>"I never joke," Qi Yuan smiled, not continuing on this topic.</p><p></p><p>The people of this world were nothing but NPCs after all.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sea surface in front churned.</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood-red light, and the blood-colored long sword brought a transparent crystal onto the yacht.</p><p></p><p>The transparent crystal was about one meter tall, one meter long, and one meter wide, a perfect cube.</p><p></p><p>Inside the transparent crystal was the corpse of a strange fish with three legs, two fins, and three eyes.</p><p></p><p>The strange fish's eyes were still open, and human emotions could be seen in them - anger and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>[King of Ink Sha Fish, a fish of the Martial Hero level, possessing a terrifying bloodline. Once swallowed two thousand people from a small town whole. Sealed here.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes also instantly saw various information.</p><p></p><p>His throat bobbed, feeling a thirst, very much wanting to break open the transparent crystal</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Opening, drinking the fresh blood of the ink-black fish.</p><p></p><p>Princess Huansha looked at the strange fish, a trace of fear appearing in her eyes: "This is a mutant sea monster... it looks so disgusting."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, even if you haven't eaten pork, you've at least seen a pig run, right?</p><p></p><p>That saying is outdated now. Princess Huansha had never seen a mutant sea monster, but she had eaten one.</p><p></p><p>On Blue Star, many city dwellers are the same - they've eaten pork but never seen a pig run.</p><p></p><p>"This catch is very big, and moreover..." Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile, "It's the best fish bait."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan took out fishing line and wrapped it around the transparent crystal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very greedy. </p><p></p><p>This mutant sea monster was probably enough to let him break through to the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>But since he rarely went out to sea, shouldn't he earn a bit more? After all, on the path of martial arts, bloodline power needs to be constantly replenished.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he used the fishing line to wrap around the transparent crystal, then used the blood sword to make tiny holes in the crystal.</p><p></p><p>The fishing line passed through the transparent crystal, piercing the body of the mutant sea monster.</p><p></p><p>This mutant sea monster had not yet awakened, seeming to still be in a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go fishing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan happily threw the mutant sea monster directly into the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Using your ancestor as bait, you all should take the hook, right?"</p><p></p><p>The path of blood martial arts lies in devouring.</p><p></p><p>With a sleeping ancestor as bait, those mutant sea monsters would surely come flocking.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were too eager to progress.</p><p></p><p>After setting the bait, Qi Yuan sat down to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Now, he just needed to wait for the mutant sea monsters who were too eager to progress to deliver themselves.</p><p></p><p>"What an illusory world, such a boring casual game. It's still more fun to kill, kill, kill," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>How to play was a daily matter.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing Yu Xiu, he had a premonition that soon, he would be able to open the map and start killing.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "Finally, they've come."</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed to pierce through the sea surface as his hand suddenly pointed.</p><p></p><p>From within the seawater, a fish-like mutant sea monster was suddenly flung out, landing on the yacht.</p><p></p><p>A smug smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Considering how eager you are to progress, after you die, I'll scatter your ashes in the sea so you can return home."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan increasingly felt he was a good person.</p><p></p><p>For those who wanted to progress, he was also very generous.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his hand forcefully squeezed.</p><p></p><p>That progressing mutant sea monster suddenly burst apart.</p><p></p><p>A drop of fresh blood was squeezed out from the mutant sea monster's body, while the rest became meat paste.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand flicked, and a flame rose up.</p><p></p><p>The original meat paste became ash under the flame's roasting.</p><p></p><p>"I do as I say, I never deceive sea monsters."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan scattered the ashes in his hand into the sea.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he swallowed that one drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... my martial arts talent has increased a bit, but... the bottleneck... is still a bit far."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to have a status panel. That way, doing things would be very convenient.</p><p></p><p>He felt that if he had a panel where he could see his progress at any time, his cultivation speed would definitely increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, the mutant sea monsters Qi Yuan needed gathered in greater and greater numbers.</p><p></p><p>On the first day, a full eighteen came.</p><p></p><p>On the second day, the number of sea monsters increased greatly, with one hundred and thirty coming.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan sigh: "In this world, there are still more people who want to progress."</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Qi Yuan caught more and more mutant sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the speed at which sea monsters arrived continued to increase.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a huge yacht appeared on the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>The owners of this yacht were a pair of siblings, and there were about a dozen rich second-generation youths on board.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a man in black was leaning on the railing, looking at the sea surface, seeming to recall something.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the yacht's owner Liu Yu approached gracefully. She looked at the man in black robes, curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>This black-robed man was someone they had discovered in the sea.</p><p></p><p>According to the black-robed man, he had been swimming at the time and ran into some trouble.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was rescued by the siblings and brought on board, only then regaining consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Fan, seeing you frown, you don't seem happy?" Liu Yu asked curiously, looking at Chen Fan's handsome face.</p><p></p><p>The man before her looked young, but had an air of vicissitude about him.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yu, who had always liked "older men", was very taken with this.</p><p></p><p>"I have some matters... Miss Liu, could you pilot the yacht in the direction I indicate? After it's done, I will surely reward you handsomely!" Chen Fan's eyes seemed to pierce through the seabed as he saw a mutant sea monster.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had already seen no less than one mutant sea monster heading in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>He had an ominous premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Liu Yu was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>They had plans for their sea excursion.</p><p></p><p>Now, to change course based on Chen Fan's words...</p><p></p><p>However, looking at Chen Fan's handsome face, Liu Yu smiled gently: "No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Chen Fan cupped his hands in thanks, looking quite upright.</p><p></p><p>About three hours passed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan sat on the yacht, a smug look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had caught another two hundred mutant sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>The blood he obtained was becoming more and more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he couldn't help but sigh: "Ah, even sea monsters work so hard and want to progress so much. What reason do I have to be lazy?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Princess Huansha came over: "Mr. Qi, a yacht not far away is signaling us. They want to board our ship, saying they have an extremely urgent matter."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan looked up and immediately saw the yacht not far away.</p><p></p><p>He saw the man in black on the yacht at a glance.</p><p></p><p>He instantly caught the scent of death.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xiu... a similar person?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became curious.</p><p></p><p>If it were others, he might have refused directly.</p><p></p><p>But for people like Yu Xiu, he was very curious.</p><p></p><p>"Let's meet."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>About fifteen minutes passed.</p><p></p><p>The Liu siblings accompanied the black-clad Chen Fan as they boarded Princess Huansha's yacht.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yu still had a handgun at her waist, in case of accidents.</p><p></p><p>When she saw there was only one man and one woman on the yacht, the wariness in Liu Yu's heart disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This couple looked just like some rich second-generation youths out for a honeymoon cruise.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the black-clad Chen Fan spoke. He looked at Qi Yuan, then at the sea surface, a cold look in his eyes: "Are you fishing?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "If I answer your question, can you answer one of mine? That would be fair."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words made Chen Fan slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because among all the various people he had encountered, this was the first time he had met... someone who spoke like this.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." He was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm fishing.</p><p></p><p>Now it's my turn. Your world... how does one enter it?" Qi Yuan asked casually, stretching his waist.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Liu siblings and Princess Huansha were a bit confused, not knowing what Qi Yuan was talking about.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Fan looked at Qi Yuan again: "You won't want to enter. When you die... you'll enter."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

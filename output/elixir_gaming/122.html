        <h1>Chapter 122</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He Wu glanced at Ning Tao and said after a long while: "On this journey to the ends of the earth, we will pass through eighty thousand cities. We are all supreme beings of the North, so we must be careful."</p><p></p><p>Among the Thirteen Demons of the North, only two were great supreme beings - Ning Tao and He Wu.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a murderous glint flashed in Ning Tao's eyes: "Is the Purple Daoist also among those eighty thousand cities?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist had plotted against her, exposing the Blood Demon. </p><p></p><p>This led to her being hunted and attacked for thousands of miles. If not for her "husband's" help, she may have already died a bloody death.</p><p></p><p>This grudge must be repaid no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"He should be in the region of the Thousand Blood-Fallen Cities," He Wu did not conceal anything. "But I advise you not to go there. You are somewhat stronger than him, but not by much. If he manages to detain you, the other supreme beings of the North may intervene and capture you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao gave a light laugh, hiding daggers in her smile: "I just want to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Do as you wish!" He Wu glanced at Ning Tao. "I must leave now. If I stay with you any longer, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist... killing you."</p><p></p><p>With that, He Wu's form dissipated into the vast snowy landscape.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stroked her left cheek, looking at the mass of flesh restrained by chains behind her. She smiled coyly: "Is my husband unwilling to see me also because he's afraid that if he stays with me too long, he won't be able to resist killing me?"</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Demons of the North were not just detested by heaven and hated by people.</p><p></p><p>Especially Ning Tao - she was the most unusual among the Thirteen Demons of the North.</p><p></p><p>It seemed her "demonic nature" ran deeper. Anyone who spent time with her would inevitably develop murderous thoughts, wanting to kill her.</p><p></p><p>The other demons were like this too, but not to her extent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat atop the city wall: "My current cultivation in the real world should be close to late Foundation Building stage."</p><p></p><p>Due to the difference in time flow, it wasn't good for him to exit the game now.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak right now," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Both in reality and in the game.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Qi Yuan had challenged and killed a great supreme being above his level.</p><p></p><p>It looked easy, but was actually extremely difficult. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mastery of the Great Forgetting Scripture, a primordial divine ability, was only at the exhaustive level.</p><p></p><p>Last time he killed the Purple Daoist, he had depleted that primordial power and needed quite some time to replenish it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Void Sovereign's Heart Demon Attraction, he had plenty of that and couldn't use it up.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a little bit was too much for supreme beings of the same level to withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, in the real world I can transcend two major realms, with Foundation Building defeating Nascent Soul. Why can't I do the same in the game, transcending two major realms as a Supreme Being to kill... Yang Spirits?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was too weak in the game, only able to be invincible at the same level, and struggling to challenge those above his level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this had a lot to do with the fact that as one's strength increased, the gaps between minor realms also became larger.</p><p></p><p>"In the real world, even if I break through to Core Formation, transcending two major realms, it would still be difficult to contend with Yin Spirits."</p><p></p><p>"I must destroy the Palace of Light quickly. Otherwise, if the high-interest loan Sister Ice Mountain Tyrant borrowed gets tied up by the Palace of Light, what if she comes after me for trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what reward the game will give me for guarding No Return City for so long... Will it help me as a Core Formation cultivator to defeat Yin Spirits?"</p><p></p><p>"Key fragments?"</p><p></p><p>"If not... I'll just have to condense the Flowing Wind Realm into my golden core, hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan felt as if the world around him trembled slightly, though he wasn't sure if it was just his imagination.</p><p></p><p>How could the world tremble? It was clearly just his imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's not the world trembling, but Chen Huan returning."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood up. Looking into the distance, he saw a group of five people flying quickly towards No Return City.</p><p></p><p>The one in the lead was Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>Behind Chen Huan were four Earthly Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Three of them looked very old, while one still maintained the appearance of a young woman.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could see they were in decline, not far from perishing.</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Immortals of this world only had a lifespan of just over a thousand years, much shorter than the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this point, these people were already halfway into the grave.</p><p></p><p>Only Earthly Immortals like this would be willing to come to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>A single spark can start a prairie fire.</p><p></p><p>As long as he gave one lecture, there would inevitably be more and more people coming to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>If not, then there was something wrong with this world that needed to be corrected.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I went to Great Sorrow City, but only these four were willing to come," Chen Huan said, his eyes filled with an apologetic look.</p><p></p><p>The four people behind Chen Huan were now sizing up Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a red robe, extremely handsome, with dense blood color hidden in his eyes, ready to burst forth. In a word, he could be described as "bewitching".</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai stared at Qi Yuan, growing more and more astonished the longer he looked.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen such a special... person.</p><p></p><p>Even those powerful supreme beings had never given him this kind of feeling.</p><p></p><p>Could he really help them break through to the realm of supreme beings?</p><p></p><p>That was... Supreme Being level.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. Since you've come to my No Return City, you must join my Blood Palace. Understand?" Qi Yuan looked at these four people, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Garrison, if you can help this humble woman enter the Supreme Being realm, not to mention serving the Blood Palace, I would even be willing to oppose Great Sorrow City," said the young woman.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai and the others also nodded.</p><p></p><p>If they could truly enter the Supreme Being realm.</p><p></p><p>Then the conditions put forward by this Garrison of No Return City were not too harsh, but rather so lenient it was hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>How many Earthly Immortals were there in this world? No one knew.</p><p></p><p>But the number of Supreme Beings was fixed - just a few thousand.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Supreme Being gave one the possibility of jumping off the chessboard to become a player.</p><p></p><p>Below Supreme Being, all were merely chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, since that's the case, let's begin the lecture," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Gai's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>So fast? No contract signing? No swearing of demonic oaths?</p><p></p><p>No test of loyalty? Just casually handing over the opportunity to become a Supreme Being like this?</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai felt it was somewhat farcical.</p><p></p><p>Hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>This was even easier than taking his ninth concubine.</p><p></p><p>The others were thinking mostly along the same lines as Wang Gai.</p><p></p><p>They all felt it was ridiculous to varying degrees, and then disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Because the simpler it was, the more likely it was to be fake.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they couldn't even be bothered to put on an act.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan was most familiar with Qi Yuan's personality and knew his big brother's unconventional ways.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan gave a meaningful look outside No Return City: "Some little bugs from Great Sorrow City followed us here. Should we deal with them?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. Our Blood Palace doesn't have a publicity department, so let them do the advertising for us. We'll even save on wages," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He had long noticed the few Earthly Immortals outside No Return City.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone... the lecture is beginning," Qi Yuan looked at these four people, his gaze becoming profound in this moment.</p><p></p><p>The aura around him also grew increasingly mysterious, as if merging with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The four people present also became solemn, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>Whether true or false, this concerned the major matter of advancing to Supreme Being. Even if there was only a one in ten thousand chance it was real, it needed to be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Human and Demon, the Human Way, the Demon Way..."</p><p></p><p>"Human and Demon as one, two sides of the same coin..."</p><p></p><p>The voice was ethereal, like celestial music.</p><p></p><p>The four people present instantly entered a state, as if appearing in a celestial realm with immortal cranes, jade pools, auspicious clouds and flying phoenixes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, their surroundings changed, as if they were in an endless demonic realm.</p><p></p><p>The immortal cranes turned into black crows, the jade pool became a pool of blood, the auspicious clouds disappeared, and red and white burning twilight filled the sky. Countless demonic creatures stretched out their hands from underground, grabbing at everyone's ankles as if to drag them into hell.</p><p></p><p>The lecture continued.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan stood to the side, also listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was already a Supreme Being, hearing the lecture again gave him deep insights that would greatly help improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside No Return City, three Earthly Immortals all had looks of astonishment on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"He's started lecturing just like that? This is too frivolous," said Li Yunzhi.</p><p></p><p>He and Wang Gai, who had entered No Return City, were close friends.</p><p></p><p>When his friend entered No Return City, he had tried to dissuade him, fearing there was a huge conspiracy within.</p><p></p><p>However, for his own sake and unable to let go of his clan, Wang Gai still chose to come to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi was somewhat worried, so following the instructions of a Supreme Being from Great Sorrow City, he came to No Return City.</p><p></p><p>He thought that with him here, even if the Garrison of No Return City had some scheme, he would probably be more restrained.</p><p></p><p>As for being born a divine saint, lecturing to allow people to comprehend the origin and enter the Supreme Being realm.</p><p></p><p>This was really too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Even the White Emperor and the Sovereign couldn't do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is truly strange. What exactly is the Garrison of No Return City trying to do? Why do something that would be so easily exposed? Could it be just to trick a few Earthly Immortals? He's a newly ascended Supreme Being - if he wanted to trick a few Earthly Immortals, why go to such trouble?" pondered a bearded man who looked wise beyond his years.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that No Return City's Garr-"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is the Guardian really born divine?" The only woman present laughed.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi shook his head: "Even those born divine cannot help others reach the supreme realm. Even if the White Emperor were to preach, he couldn't make people comprehend the origin. The origin needs to be comprehended by each person themselves, in order to forge their own path."</p><p></p><p>The bearded clever man nodded and sighed: "What Yunzhi says makes sense. How can those four not understand such a simple truth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi continued: "Cultivation is about contending with heaven, and worldly resources are limited. It's impossible for there to be so many supreme beings in the world! Even if the Guardian of Wugui City is born divine and can help people reach the supreme realm, he would offend the world by doing so and incur heavenly punishment."</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi analyzed from various angles and concluded... this was an inconceivable scam. If there had to be a reason, it would be that the Guardian of Wugui City was mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>The three of them waited outside Wugui City. </p><p></p><p>Time flew by swiftly, and night had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi lazily stretched: "Looks like we'll be waiting here for a while. If his preaching lasts a dozen years or so, and my foolish brother Wang Gai's lifespan runs out and he dies in there... we still couldn't deny the ineffectiveness of the Guardian's preaching."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the woman furrowed her brow and said: "The Guardian of Wugui City... has left. The preaching is over?"</p><p></p><p>All three present were somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi laughed awkwardly: "The Guardian of Wugui City... is quite unexpected."</p><p></p><p>He had just said the Guardian would wear out the lives of several people, but the preaching ended so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Was it effective?" The bearded clever man looked over with an indescribable expression.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the origin isn't so simple. Even if there was an effect, it would take months..." Li Yunzhi's words trailed off halfway.</p><p></p><p>He stared wide-eyed at Wang Gai on the city wall of Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>His close friend, who had always been stuck at the Earthly Legend realm and unable to step into the origin, was now emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"The origin!" Li Yunzhi's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>That aura was all too familiar to him - it was the origin he had dreamed of for hundreds of years!</p><p></p><p>The woman's eyes also widened like copper bells: "It really is the origin!"</p><p></p><p>"Son of a bitch." The bearded clever man slapped himself and looked at Li Yunzhi, "Your close friend isn't putting on an act, is he?"</p><p></p><p>"He's not!" Li Yunzhi said indignantly, "Damn it, this guy's talent is worse than mine, his situation is worse than mine, how did he suddenly become supreme?"</p><p></p><p>Before coming, he had hoped his good brother would be alright and have a bright future.</p><p></p><p>But now, seeing Wang Gai seemingly step into the supreme realm, about to condense an origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>He felt sour inside.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like, fearing your brother wasn't doing well, but fearing even more that he was doing too well!</p><p></p><p>"This matter is truly strange. Even with my intelligence and wisdom I can't figure out the key. I think we should quickly report this to the supreme beings," the bearded clever man said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>The woman rolled her eyes at him: "There's no point in going back now!"</p><p></p><p>"But the task assigned by the supreme beings - if we can't complete it, we'll be punished!" the bearded clever man said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if we become supreme beings ourselves, how could they punish us?" Li Yunzhi's face was excited as he looked at Wugui City, his eyes full of exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>The woman felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Now, the mission had been thrown to the back of their minds.</p><p></p><p>That was an opportunity to become supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" After the woman spoke, she turned into a stream of light and flew towards Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi followed and flew in as well.</p><p></p><p>The bearded clever man was stunned for a moment, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be they went in to obtain more useful information, to better complete the task?" Thinking this, he quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let these two flatterers outdo him!</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time, the bearded clever man, the woman and Li Yunzhi entered Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan looked at the three people before him, a faint smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the three and slowly said: "Today's preaching has ended. The Blood Lord said he finds it troublesome, so the next preaching will wait until ten people are gathered. The time after that, it may be twenty people, or perhaps a hundred or a thousand."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Li Yunzhi was somewhat disappointed upon hearing this, but he quickly regained his spirits, "This is also right, how could the matter of preaching be so easy."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Chen Huan turned and left, returning to Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the three standing in place.</p><p></p><p>These three looked at the four people on the city wall, their eyes revealing envy: "All have the aura of origin..."</p><p></p><p>Apart from Wang Gai, the aura of origin was slowly appearing on the other three as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi knew that in less than a day, all four of them would step into the supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>What an incredible opportunity this was.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head to look at the sky, lost in thought about something.</p><p></p><p>The bearded clever man also looked up at the sky but saw nothing. He asked in confusion: "Li Yunzhi, what are you looking at?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm looking at... why hasn't heaven sent down punishment?" The Blood Lord's actions went against heaven's will, there should have been heavenly punishment.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"What heavenly punishment? And weren't you here to gather information? Why do you also want to join the Blood Palace?" said the bearded clever man.</p><p></p><p>"Has your brain been fried by heart demons? Of course it's to become supreme beings," said the woman.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we need to go to Dabei City and gather ten people to listen to the Blood Lord's preaching!" Li Yunzhi was urgent.</p><p></p><p>His brother was about to step into the supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to see his brother's smug expression.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>Dabei City.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling opened her eyes and looked at the information before her, an expression of disbelief on her face: "Supreme... truly supreme, how is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, news came from within Dabei City that Wang Gai and the other three who went to Wugui City had comprehended the origin and were condensing origin divine abilities. Once successful, they would become true supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>This was truly inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>After all, Huang Mengling had seen Wang Gai just a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai was old and decrepit, how could he possibly comprehend the origin?</p><p></p><p>"Is this news true or false?" Huang Mengling still couldn't quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... is absolutely true." A supreme being spoke up, he was one of the few supreme beings of Dabei City.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Mengling fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>She had met the Guardian of Wugui City just days ago.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly just like Chen Huan, how did he suddenly step into the supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... must have some trick to it!" Huang Mengling paced back and forth, finally making up her mind, "This must be reported to Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>She had no channel to meet the White Emperor directly.</p><p></p><p>Such a major event happening here must be reported to Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, that supreme being also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Such a major event indeed needed to be made known to some true bigwigs.</p><p></p><p>As a supreme being himself, but only in the early stage, he couldn't resolve such matters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this supreme being thought of something and quickly said: "In recent days, the Demon Controller supreme beings of the Blood Fallen Thousand Cities region seem to have disappeared without a trace. Even the Purple Daoist hasn't appeared again. I don't know if there's some plot, or if it's related to what happened in Wugui City."</p><p></p><p>"What? Those supreme beings have vanished?" Huang Mengling was shocked.</p><p></p><p>She recalled what Chen Huan had said before, that the Guardian of Wugui City had killed the Purple Daoist and a group of supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Of course she didn't believe it at the time.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Purple Daoist had disappeared?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... he was really killed? But, that was a great supreme being!</p><p></p><p>Even if Senior Brother personally took action, it wouldn't be so easy to kill him.</p><p></p><p>How could a cultivator who had just entered the supreme realm kill a great supreme being? Or was there some other change?</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengling rubbed her hair, finally saying: "Supreme Being Yintian, this matter still requires you to send people to investigate clearly, to see if the Purple Daoist... has really perished."</p><p></p><p>"Perished? What!" Supreme Being Yintian was shocked and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>That was a great supreme being.</p><p></p><p>An existence standing at the pinnacle of this world.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing that needs to be told to Supreme Being Yintian. In the near future, the Northern Demon Thirteen Fiends may pass through the Eighty Thousand Cities, and may pass through Dabei City. Please do not obstruct them, this is my Senior Brother's intention." Huang Mengling said.</p><p></p><p>Her Senior Brother's intention most likely represented the White Emperor's intention.</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, certainly." Supreme Being Yintian agreed. Compared to the first matter, the second was nothing.</p><p></p><p>The plans of those at the top, they only needed to carry out.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, thank you for your trouble, Supreme Being Yintian." Huang Mengling's words carried a tone of dismissal.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Yintian's eyes held a suspicious look, but he finally left.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, Huang Mengling had a headache.</p><p></p><p>The development of events was beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Senior Brother comes here and can resolve this matter." She knew this wasn't something she could resolve.</p><p></p><p>She also couldn't understand how someone she had seen just days ago, who was just an Earthly Legend with some good looks and bearing, could suddenly...</p><p></p><p>PS: I got a bit stuck writing, my apologies.

        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Arhats and Four Heavenly Kings remained very calm, seemingly unfazed by what was happening before them.</p><p></p><p>Only the old dragon in the blue robe looked worried, muttering: "It's over, you killed the strongest genius of the Ancient Ape clan. The Ancient Apes will surely... come looking for trouble."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled and said: "Why is it over? If I could kill the Golden Flood Dragon, why can't I kill a monkey?"</p><p></p><p>The old dragon in blue was stunned upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>Their Northern Sea Dragon Clan didn't dare kill the Golden-Haired Monkey, but the Origin Venerable dared to. The Origin Venerable had even killed the Golden Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the old blue-robed dragon felt a pang of heartache: "Alas."</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether he was lamenting for the Golden Flood Dragon or for the Golden-Haired Monkey.</p><p></p><p>The Golden-Haired Monkey was arrogant and unruly, with strength only at the Purple Palace realm. He had no idea how formidable the Qionghua Venerable and Qi Yuan's powerful companions were.</p><p></p><p>It could be said he was fearless due to ignorance.</p><p></p><p>Then, he was killed by Qi Yuan with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wouldn't bother with the principle of "those who don't know are not guilty."</p><p></p><p>The other two monkeys stood to the side, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the monkey named Little Six stepped forward, cupped his hands and said: "Ancient Jin brought this upon himself by offending you all. My brother and I are willing to return to the Ancient Ape clan and report today's events truthfully to the elders, to avoid any conflict!"</p><p></p><p>Little Six spoke quickly, his mind working fast.</p><p></p><p>He was trying to save himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Little Six with some surprise: "What if the Ancient Ape clan wants to cause trouble for me?"</p><p></p><p>"I will explain the situation clearly. The elders are reasonable and surely won't rashly start a war."</p><p></p><p>"What if they do?" Qi Yuan looked at Little Six.</p><p></p><p>"If the elders still want to cause trouble for the Venerable, I will die before them!" Little Six's gaze was determined, his voice carrying a sense of being ready to die.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Then I'll give you a chance, and give the Ancient Ape clan a chance."</p><p></p><p>As for what would happen afterwards, Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to consider, or rather didn't care.</p><p></p><p>It was just a game after all. Playing it to one's heart's content was the way to go.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Northern Sea Dragon Clan, Qi Yuan passed by Qionghua Palace and finally left the Northern Sea Divine Eye with the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Venerable stayed at Qionghua Palace.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, Qi Yuan had bestowed the Hundred Flowers Immortal's divine viewing method to her. Regarding the Flower God divine position, she had gained something and needed time to break through.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, she also needed to stay at Qionghua Palace to help Qi Yuan collect the supreme treasures that had leaked out of the Northern Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the Northern Sea Divine Eye, a group of ancient gods were bidding farewell to Qi Yuan one after another.</p><p></p><p>During this Hundred Flowers Gathering, Qi Yuan's subordinate Dragon Subduing Arhat had killed members of the Northern Sea Dragon Clan, Qi Yuan had awakened the Qionghua Venerable, and the Qionghua Venerable had acknowledged Qi Yuan as her master. Each of these events was shocking.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, I reside on Mount Xuankong. If you pass by my blessed land, I will certainly offer fine wine and delicacies," an ancient god said casually.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun looked at Qi Yuan, his inner shock deeper than the others.</p><p></p><p>The others were not of the dragon race, so they couldn't see that the phantom behind the Dragon Subduing Arhat was a dragon of the Seven Steps to Heaven, only knowing it was a great venerable.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun was different. He also had dragon blood, and that dragon phantom was far stronger than the Dragon Ancestor's phantom, undoubtedly of the Seven Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand why such a powerful dragon would still be killed by the Dragon Subduing Arhat.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of what Qi Yuan had said before, he couldn't help but wonder. As he bid farewell to Qi Yuan, he lowered his voice and asked: "Origin Venerable, do the Ying Long, Zhu Long, Azure Dragon and Five-Clawed Golden Dragon you mentioned before really exist?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, they exist in my memories," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Weren't those deities just existing in his memories?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan answer like this, Ye Liuyun drew in a sharp breath: "How do they compare to the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon behind the Dragon Subduing Arhat?"</p><p></p><p>"Only stronger, not weaker," Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Liuyun was shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>He had to hurry and tell the elders of his clan about this.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Liuyun left, the others also bid farewell to Qi Yuan one after another.</p><p></p><p>The last one was the Twilight Venerable. He looked at Qi Yuan and said with a sigh: "With your talent, staying in the fallen zone is really... too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Venerable knew how terrifying Qi Yuan's talent was - twenty consecutive legends.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the top-tier chosen ones who could create myths, who else could match that?</p><p></p><p>"If you're worried about my safety, why not become my bodyguard?" Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Venerable smiled helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't that selfless.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan could visualize a legendary-level divine viewing method suitable for him, perhaps he would serve Qi Yuan like the Qionghua Venerable did. But obviously, such divine viewing methods were rare enough with just one, how could there be a second?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the gains this time weren't bad. It's time to go home," Qi Yuan said, leading the Four Heavenly Kings and Eighteen Arhats as they turned into a streak of light and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In Qionghua Palace.</p><p></p><p>There were traces of flower petals in the Qionghua Venerable's pupils.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Palace Lord stood to the side, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"You're wondering why I, a great venerable, would serve the Venerable as my master?" the Qionghua Venerable spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Palace Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>She was indeed very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable had visualized the Hundred Flowers Immortal and awakened the great venerable, which was certainly an enormous favor.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of favor could be repaid with supreme treasures or other means.</p><p></p><p>Serving as a subordinate seemed truly excessive.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in ancient times, the Origin Venerable's status was precious, being a powerhouse of the Six Steps to Heaven or even Seven Steps to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed.</p><p></p><p>Now the Origin Venerable was merely at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the Qionghua Venerable's starting point far surpassed the Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable in this life had almost no possibility of surpassing the Qionghua Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Qionghua Palace Lord didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Serving the Venerable and becoming his subject was not just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Venerable's gaze was profound: "Have you heard of the Hundred Flowers Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Palace Lord shook her head: "Never."</p><p></p><p>Before this, she had never heard any stories about the Hundred Flowers Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"The position of Flower God is what I've sought all my life, I know it best of all. In the Mortal Heart Realm, there is no deity... holding this position," the Qionghua Venerable said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Qionghua Palace Lord's expression changed: "Then he... could it be..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It was raining continuously when we left, now the sky is clear for thousands of miles on our return."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the clouds in the sky and the reddish stars, feeling in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>After a long journey, he brought everyone back to Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qingshui Village was peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yulei and Divine Official Shentu had gone to Fehuang City to purchase supplies and hadn't returned today.</p><p></p><p>The Four Heavenly Kings and Eighteen Arhats all left, leaving only Qi Yuan in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blood color in the sky, Qi Yuan prepared to dig a big hole to sleep in.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, Qi Yuan stopped his actions and looked at Little Jia standing quietly beside him.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly remembered that the clothing spirits in the Clothing Prohibition all sleep hanging on trees. Why don't we hang on a tree together today?" Qi Yuan looked at Little Jia, eager to try.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia stood to the side, the blood-red weak light shining on her body, making her look somewhat bewitching.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan imitated the clothing spirits in the Clothing Prohibition, hanging himself and Little Jia on tree branches.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like sleeping in an earthen pit is still more secure," Qi Yuan said, holding Little Jia's cool sleeve. "But hanging on a tree, feeling the night breeze and looking at the stars in the sky, is quite romantic sometimes."</p><p></p><p>In the night sky, stars twinkled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pointed at what used to be the moon and said: "I heard there's a Chang'e living on the moon, don't know if it's true or not."</p><p></p><p>Little Jia also looked up at the moon in the sky, seeming to be thinking about something.</p><p></p><p>From her intricately patterned sleeve, a wooden tag with a happy expression slid out and fell into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you really like hanging on trees, Little Jia," Qi Yuan said, looking at her.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia gripped Qi Yuan's hand tighter, without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly, the night breeze gently frolicked, quietly enjoying the good times.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, various thoughts passing through his mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>"This game world is indeed a bit... strange."</p><p></p><p>By summoning Little Jia, Qi Yuan confirmed the time flow rate between this world and the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flow of time here was strange.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in the blink of an eye in the Cang Lan realm, eons would pass in the Mortal Heart realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had been in the Mortal Heart realm for so long, yet time in the Cang Lan realm was still frozen at the moment just before entering the game.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, he was somewhat afraid to leave the game and return to the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>If he logged out and slept for a night in the Cang Lan realm, what if Qingshui Village disappeared?</p><p></p><p>"It's very odd. Logically, time in the Cang Lan realm should be frozen, and my Stellar Golden Core should be frozen too. Why is the Solar True Fire in my Stellar Golden Core still constantly growing?" Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>It was as if at this moment, time no longer had an accurate comparison or scale.</p><p></p><p>"This world is truly strange," Qi Yuan sighed. Since he couldn't figure it out, he simply decided not to think about it.</p><p></p><p>"Even Xianglong and Fuhu cannot advance through treasures. It seems that for now, even if I visualize some more powerful beings, it won't be possible." On the way back, Qi Yuan had Xianglong Arhat and Fuhu Arhat try to break through to True God realm.</p><p></p><p>This left Qi Yuan in a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was troubled over who to visualize.</p><p></p><p>Visualizing weaker beings might allow them to break through limits and become True Gods.</p><p></p><p>But visualizing powerful ones might get stuck at the peak of the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>To break through this impasse, there were two methods: one was to have more powerful experts like Qionghua Dazun among his subjects; the second was to solve the limitation of breaking through to True God realm.</p><p></p><p>Grasping Xiao Jia's cold sleeve, Qi Yuan slowly drifted off to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Flying Wasteland City, a carriage stopped outside the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Three men and two women in luxurious clothing alighted from the carriage, all appearing to be from prominent families.</p><p></p><p>These five people were all from the Wang family of Flying Mist City.</p><p></p><p>The Wang family owned 70% of the restaurant business in Flying Mist City. In Flying Mist City, they were the type that could make the whole city tremble with a stomp of their foot.</p><p></p><p>Huang Mengying received the message and came out of the city lord's mansion with a puzzled expression: "Madam Wang, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Wang family group, a middle-aged woman with black hair streaked with white, spoke with deep concern in her eyes: "At the hour of Yin today, the former emperor... passed away."</p><p></p><p>"What?!" Huang Mengying was shocked to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Among the fallen areas, the Lin Kingdom was considered one of the strongest in resisting evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the king believed in ancient gods and strongly opposed evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Now, the king had passed away.</p><p></p><p>For Huang Mengying, this was undoubtedly a bolt from the blue.</p><p></p><p>"The Third Prince has ascended to the throne," Madam Wang delivered another cruel reality.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince had always been the one in the royal court advocating for worshipping evil gods.</p><p></p><p>What the Third Prince's ascension meant was all too clear to Huang Mengying and the others.</p><p></p><p>The heavens of the Lin Kingdom were about to change.</p><p></p><p>However, Madam Wang's next words made Huang Mengying's face change even more drastically: "At noon, an order came from the capital. Lord Zhuge... has been transferred away from Flying Spirit Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Flying Wasteland City, Flying Mist City, and five surrounding cities, a total of seven cities, were all under the jurisdiction of Flying Spirit Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Lord Zhuge was also a pure follower of the ancient gods. Now that he had been transferred away, one could imagine what that meant.</p><p></p><p>"Our Wang family has been keeping a close eye on the situation and has long been prepared. Now that the former emperor has passed away, we are preparing to leave the Lin Kingdom and head to the Ancient God Alliance," Madam Wang said, her words tinged with uncertainty about the future.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Wang family had long been prepared to relocate.</p><p></p><p>With this change in the situation, even core figures like her were starting to move.</p><p></p><p>"Flying Wasteland City should also make early preparations," Madam Wang said. "If the Huang family wants to leave, our Wang family can lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>The Wang family and the Huang family were considered old friends.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few words, Madam Wang took her leave without staying overnight in Flying Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>Watching the silhouette of Madam Wang's carriage, Huang Mengying's gaze became determined: "Come, report this matter to the Origin Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The carriage left under the cover of night, with the occupants all wearing grim expressions.</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang lifted the curtain and looked at the lively Flying Wasteland City, sighing: "After the evil gods descend, who knows when Flying Wasteland City will turn into a ghost realm."</p><p></p><p>Believing in evil gods might bring short-term benefits, but once assimilated, one would become nothing more than a walking corpse.</p><p></p><p>This was an outcome that these aristocratic families absolutely refused to accept.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some evil gods had also put forth conditions, gaining the support of many aristocratic families and even ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenya thought of something and asked softly, "Madam Wang, do you think that ancient god from Qingshui Village will leave?"</p><p></p><p>On the way here, they had already learned about the events in Flying Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>They were quite interested in the ancient god from Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>"Judging by his setup, he probably won't leave," Madam Wang gave her assessment.</p><p></p><p>One could see an ancient god's intentions from their fief.</p><p></p><p>Take the Wang family for example. Although they were in Flying Mist City, their restaurants had been contracting, and fixed assets were being sold off.</p><p></p><p>This showed that the Wang family was prepared to flee at any time.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, according to the information Madam Wang had received, Qingshui Village placed great emphasis on agriculture and was constantly opening up new farmland.</p><p></p><p>This showed no signs of intending to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Now, going to the Ancient God Alliance is the best outcome," Wang Wenya said.</p><p></p><p>The man beside her then said, "Perhaps he is unwilling to abandon his subjects."</p><p></p><p>The people in the carriage fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the caravan slowly moved on.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a familiar voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Routine inspection!"</p><p></p><p>When passing through various cities and towns, routine inspections were the norm.</p><p></p><p>In areas controlled by evil gods, they checked for spies of ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>In areas controlled by ancient gods, they checked for lackeys of evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice, Wang Wenya parted the curtains and saw a familiar figure. Her eyes showed surprise: "Zhao Zun, is that you?"</p><p></p><p>"Wenya?" Zhao Zun recognized Wang Wenya.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here?" Seeing Zhao Zun, a flash of joy crossed Wang Wenya's heart.</p><p></p><p>She had once studied at the academy, and Zhao Zun was her classmate. Their relationship had been ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But a year ago, the Zhao family had encountered misfortune, and Zhao Zun had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"My family encountered misfortune, and I fled here as a refugee," Zhao Zun briefly explained what had happened to Wang Wenya.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Wang Wenya's thoughts were complex. She hadn't expected the Zhao family to have encountered such misfortune.</p><p></p><p>This former classmate had actually suffered such a blow.</p><p></p><p>"So now you're following the Origin Venerable?" Wang Wenya was curious. Remembering their past friendship as classmates, she said, "War may break out soon... do you want to leave this troubled place with me?"</p><p></p><p>"No need," Zhao Zun shook his head, his gaze determined. "The Venerable gave me my future. I won't leave this place."</p><p></p><p>Since becoming the Xianglong Arhat, he was no longer the Zhao Zun of before.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wenya was puzzled. She didn't understand why Zhao Zun's attitude was so resolute.</p><p></p><p>However, since her old friend was unwilling to leave, she wouldn't force the issue.</p><p></p><p>She returned to the carriage feeling somewhat desolate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Madam Wang showed a puzzled expression: "Was this classmate of yours always this strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Wang Wenya didn't understand Madam Wang's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"How could someone as strong as him have had his family property seized by Zhao Si?" Madam Wang was very confused.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he just at the Divine Infant stage?" Wang Wenya was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"He's not at the Divine Infant stage. If he wanted to, everyone in this carriage would probably have to stay here," Madam Wang said quietly.</p><p></p><p>As the top figure in the Wang family, her strength was at the peak of the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>But facing that Zhao Zun, she had a feeling that she was no match for him at all.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? How could he be so strong?" Wang Wenya couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a year apart, yet he had crossed a major realm?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has something to do with him calling himself the Xianglong Arhat," Madam Wang thought of the God Visualization technique and murmured, "No wonder he's willing to pledge loyalty to the guardian god of Qingshui Village. To raise one's strength to the peak of Purple Palace realm so quickly, this God Visualization technique must be of a very, very high level."</p><p></p><p>Of course, while it was impressive and enviable, the Wang family would not stay in Qingshui Village to serve the so-called guardian god of Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Ancient God Alliance was the only way to survive in this fallen area.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

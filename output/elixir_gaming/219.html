        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Elder was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"You don't think that with the Divine Realm Elixir, we can defeat the Evil Gods? You're overestimating us!" The Twilight Elder then laughed.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Lotus Elder gave the Twilight Elder a sidelong glance: "Who said it was you?"</p><p></p><p>Even if all twenty-some Ancient Gods here suddenly broke through to become Great Elders, it wouldn't be enough to change the overall situation in the Mortal Heart Realm, let alone giving them the Divine Realm Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I will lead everyone to a place. When we get there, don't move around carelessly. Follow my instructions exactly," Qi Yuan instructed the many Ancient Gods and villagers present.</p><p></p><p>This time, after killing two Evil God camps and slaughtering all the Evil Gods at Sunset Slope, Qi Yuan had accumulated a large amount of Evil God spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>Since the Thunder God Great Elder said to leave a few Mythical slots for the Mythical Plan, Qi Yuan decided not to covet what others desired. He would directly use the Lost Glow Stick to travel to the past and conduct visualization.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Pillar of Heaven had not yet collapsed, so visualization would not be restricted in any way.</p><p></p><p>When he said this, the Ancient Gods were stunned. </p><p></p><p>Wasn't he going to distribute the Divine Realm Elixir as a benefit?</p><p></p><p>The anticipation in their eyes visibly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, facing Qi Yuan, no one dared to bring up this matter.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Elder looked at these Ancient Gods and couldn't help saying: "A bunch of spineless fellows. The Divine Realm Elixir is nothing."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Twilight Elder wanted to say: You're a Great Elder, you don't need the Divine Realm Elixir, but we ordinary Elders do. </p><p></p><p>However, fearing the Thunder God Great Elder's power, the Twilight Elder did not say these words.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the benefits this time are no less than the Divine Realm Elixir," Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Under everyone's puzzled expressions, he took out the Lost Glow Stick.</p><p></p><p>The many Ancient Gods and villagers on the scene looked at the Lost Glow Stick curiously.</p><p></p><p>The Lost Glow Stick emitted a radiance that enveloped everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Space-time began to flow.</p><p></p><p>The scene before everyone suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>"How strange, why can't I touch the flowers, grass and trees here!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what is that... the Pillar of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods and villagers present couldn't help but look towards the towering mountain in front, their eyes revealing shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because that huge mountain was the Pillar of Heaven!</p><p></p><p>Hadn't the Pillar of Heaven already collapsed long ago? How did it suddenly appear?</p><p></p><p>Everything before their eyes was beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these villagers and Ancient Gods and calmly said: "Don't worry, we've just come to the past."</p><p></p><p>Traveling through space-time was something Qi Yuan did often, so he was used to it.</p><p></p><p>But the villagers and Ancient Gods on the scene drew in sharp breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Back to the past..."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>The more powerful one's strength, the more one could feel one's own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad worlds, even Yin Gods were merely tiny specks of dust.</p><p></p><p>True Gods who seemed omnipotent in the eyes of mortals actually couldn't do many things.</p><p></p><p>Traversing space-time was an extremely profound matter.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Time was something Yin Gods could not even touch.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of these Ancient Gods, probably even Yang Gods would find it difficult to dabble in.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had brought them through space-time to return to the past.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>"I used a treasure obtained from the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan to bring you back to the past. However, we can only see but cannot perceive the past, nor can we interact with people from the past," Qi Yuan did not conceal the truth about the Lost Glow Stick.</p><p></p><p>He did not know whether the owner of the Lost Glow Stick was alive or dead.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't plagiarize.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Wu Tong from the Flowing Wind Realm, who said something Qi Yuan really liked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly killed him and used his words, making them his own original creation.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at the Lost Glow Stick with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>These people had long heard of the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan, full of dangers.</p><p></p><p>But they never imagined there would be such a peerless treasure.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that they could not influence or perceive this world.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean many things couldn't be done?</p><p></p><p>"The Pillar of Heaven has not yet broken at this time. Hurry and make use of this period to cultivate well, you may improve quite a bit," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>So, returning to the past to cultivate? This was the benefit? These people didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p></p><p>Only the Thunder God Great Elder seemed to realize something. He transmitted to Qi Yuan: "You're not planning to visualize the gods of your Chinese Dragon Team, are you!"</p><p></p><p>"You guessed it," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"It really is!" The Thunder God Great Elder had a shocked expression. "I missed it last time. This time... I want to see it for myself."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He entered the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>This time when he entered, there was no chat group.</p><p></p><p>He directly entered the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the great mountain ahead, feeling quite curious.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Pillar of Heaven and the visualization realm must be related to the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan. Otherwise, many things cannot be explained," he murmured.</p><p></p><p>Setting aside all emotions, Qi Yuan began to visualize.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had brought several thousand villagers, as well as those thirty Ancient Gods.</p><p></p><p>What the villagers needed, apart from a few familiar faces Qi Yuan would customize visualizations for, the rest would be directly assigned as Celestial Soldiers and Generals, or the Thirty-six Heavenly Spirits, Seventy-two Earthly Fiends, Sixty Jiazi Gods, Twenty-four Cloud-Summoning Rain-Assisting Dharma-Protecting Celestial Lords, Thirty-six Thunder Generals, and so on.</p><p></p><p>After all, the deities in Qi Yuan's memory were countless.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Celestial Court, there were also the Ancestral Shamans and Primordial Gods and Demons from the Primordial Era.</p><p></p><p>What he lacked least was visualizations.</p><p></p><p>"I should visualize someone powerful for old Thunder God first. Otherwise, what if he kicks the bucket one day?" Qi Yuan pondered who to visualize for the Thunder God Great Elder.</p><p></p><p>There were actually many thunder-related deities.</p><p></p><p>The Five Thunder Emperors, the Five Thunder Kings.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Lei Zhenzi and the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable were the ones Qi Yuan remembered most.</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's memory, the former ultimately achieved physical sainthood and was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>The latter was the supreme leader of the Thunder Department, commanding the Thunder Department and revered as the Thunder Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the avatars of the South Pole Longevity Great Emperor, one of the Six Venerables, with an extremely noble status.</p><p></p><p>The Six Venerables were the Jade Emperor, Heavenly Emperor, Purple Subtlety Emperor, Azure Essence Emperor, Longevity Emperor, and Empress of Earth.</p><p></p><p>An avatar of such a big shot was a level higher than even Tianpeng Marshal.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go with the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable!" Qi Yuan made his decision after some thought.</p><p></p><p>This big shot's path was most suitable for the Thunder God Great Elder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, and the image of that terrifying deity floated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's understanding, this level of deity far surpassed Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>Even "mythical" was insufficient to describe it.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Palace, Supreme Jade Clarity King. </p><p>Transforming to fill the ten directions, discoursing on the Dao while sitting on nine phoenixes."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan chanted softly, this time no figures appeared beside him in the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>However, terrifying dark clouds densely covered the sky above.</p><p></p><p>As if brewing world-shaking thunder.</p><p></p><p>The air was very quiet.</p><p></p><p>The visualization realm fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the visualization mountain and saw it transform into lightning.</p><p></p><p>The former mountain changed into the form of lightning.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vast voice resounded in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The visualization mountain...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Why didn't he ask the second heart question? He directly condensed the God Observation Method?</p><p></p><p>This turn of events was beyond Qi Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when slaying the evil god at Sunset Slope last time, the reason Qi Yuan summoned the illusory sun to kill enemies was twofold.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it was to kill enemies. </p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was also to intercept a trace of the "Great Forgetting Heart Sutra" origin.</p><p></p><p>After all, after returning to the past, he would not be able to use the Solar Golden Pill to illuminate himself and pass the second heart question.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, Qi Yuan merely visualized this being,</p><p>And directly... assimilated the visualization mountain?</p><p>Or rather... subdued it.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even asked the second heart question, and directly condensed it.</p><p></p><p>So hastily?</p><p></p><p>The illusory image of the big shot Qi Yuan had imagined didn't even appear.</p><p></p><p>There were no ripples at all.</p><p></p><p>All the thunder turned into a God Observation Method.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it wasn't a myth manifesting, but just the most ordinary God Observation Method.</p><p></p><p>In the visualization realm, the Thunder God Venerable looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan went in earlier, he had said he would help visualize a God Observation Method for him.</p><p></p><p>Although he outwardly disdained it, he was actually looking forward to it inwardly.</p><p></p><p>His requirements weren't high - it didn't need to be mythical, or even legendary. Epic would do.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Qi Yuan had been in there for so long.</p><p></p><p>No golden light had appeared in the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the most ordinary one? The Thunder God Venerable pouted.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan really visualized an ordinary God Observation Method for him,</p><p></p><p>He was thinking about how to give Qi Yuan the cold shoulder without angering him.</p><p></p><p>After all, as a mighty Venerable, he still needed to maintain his dignity.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had to kowtow, he would find a place with no one around to do it.</p><p></p><p>"This kid, don't really fool around with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Although I said I don't care about benefits, that was just talk."</p><p></p><p>"He better not take it seriously!"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Because in front of him, a crack appeared on the visualization mountain.</p><p></p><p>The visualization mountain... cracked! What's going on?</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable was shocked.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, a look of surprise also appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Your visualization mountain isn't very good. It cracked just from visualizing a Six Transformations avatar?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt it was absurd.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, the visualization mountain was fine back in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Now, just visualizing one of the Six Transformations avatars,</p><p></p><p>It broke?</p><p></p><p>Isn't there a Heavenly Pillar here?</p><p></p><p>It should be even harder!</p><p></p><p>"How about... trying again?"</p><p></p><p>"What if the visualization mountain was just being mischievous and wanted to crack?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On top of the Heavenly Pillar, the woman in the red dress had a cold expression. The breeze blew through her hair, making her appear particularly lonely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a helpless voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Wushi... leave the Heavenly Pillar."</p><p></p><p>"The collapse of the Heavenly Pillar is irreversible. Why do you insist on supporting it?</p><p>What's being consumed... is your divine realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Bell Spirit Venerable appeared. He had no head on his neck, looking particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>"I promised him I would help guard the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>When the Heavenly Pillar breaks, it will be the day of my demise." The Holy Mother Wushi looked at the Heavenly Pillar, her eyes still carrying a hint of naivety.</p><p></p><p>However, the aura emanating from her body was mythical.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Holy Mother Wushi's stubborn appearance, the Bell Spirit Venerable sighed softly: "Why do you insist on embodying the Heavenly Pillar? Tying your life and death to the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>You are... beloved by the world. One day, you will have the chance to step beyond true godhood."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mother Wushi smiled sadly: "There's no chance."</p><p></p><p>"Why... are you so stubborn?" The Bell Spirit Venerable lamented, "The Heavenly Pillar is on the verge of collapse. Perhaps it won't be long before it falls."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mother Wushi looked at the Bell Spirit Venerable, her expression calm but her voice very determined: "You go back. Don't try to persuade me anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Why... do you have to do this?</p><p></p><p>Why imagine guarding the Heavenly Pillar for someone who doesn't exist? You are the world's darling. Even the disasters in your youth were just the world's tempering for you.</p><p></p><p>Who helped you wasn't anyone, it was the world, and yourself.</p><p></p><p>I asked Old Man Brahma Heart, and he said... the person you've been looking for doesn't exist.</p><p></p><p>That was just your imagination when you were young!"</p><p></p><p>The Bell Spirit Venerable tried to persuade her earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The Holy Mother Wushi's voice suddenly became sharp, "I will fulfill the promise I made!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Mother Wushi's gaze became profound.</p><p></p><p>She always kept her promises.</p><p></p><p>She would definitely fulfill what she promised.</p><p></p><p>Even if it meant paying the price of her life.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the Bell Spirit Venerable: "You leave. If you take one more step onto the Heavenly Pillar and cause it to shake, I won't let you off!"</p><p></p><p>The Bell Spirit Venerable said regretfully: "Doing this will offend other mythical beings.</p><p></p><p>After all... the Heavenly Pillar isn't yours.</p><p></p><p>If you forcibly occupy the Heavenly Pillar for ten years or a hundred years, other mythical beings won't say anything.</p><p></p><p>But for a thousand years or ten thousand years, that won't be acceptable."</p><p></p><p>"So what if I offend them? As long as I'm strong enough, who dares to say anything!" The Holy Mother Wushi in her red dress had a look of contempt for the world in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Bell Spirit Venerable finally said nothing more and his form dissipated.</p><p></p><p>On the majestic Heavenly Pillar, only the Holy Mother Wushi remained alone.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Heavenly Pillar shook violently, and the Holy Mother Wushi's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the Heavenly Pillar was about to break.</p><p></p><p>On her pale face, she squeezed out a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it wasn't all my imagination."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had just finished visualizing the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation of the Thunder Sound of the Nine Heavens and was about to continue visualizing.</p><p></p><p>A familiar female voice entered Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"If you visualize now... the Heavenly Pillar will break."</p><p></p><p>"Holy Mother Wushi?" Qi Yuan was startled.</p><p></p><p>This voice was indeed the Holy Mother Wushi's.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Holy Mother Wushi's voice again, Qi Yuan felt a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the Holy Mother Wushi fall before, and seeing her again now, he felt quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>"I'm on top of the Heavenly Pillar. Come find me." The Holy Mother Wushi's voice continued, with a slight tremor in it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan remembered the matter of the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>He decided to go see the Holy Mother Wushi.</p><p></p><p>What if he really broke the Heavenly Pillar? Qi Yuan exited the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>On top of the Heavenly Pillar, the Holy Mother Wushi seemed to have heard something, and her face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Then, the paleness faded, and she smiled like a flower.</p><p></p><p>Because a familiar voice sounded by her ear.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this time, I didn't expose my identity?" Qi Yuan looked at the Holy Mother Wushi.</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious.</p><p></p><p>Because if he met the Holy Mother Wushi this time,</p><p></p><p>Why didn't the Holy Mother Wushi recognize him the last time they met?</p><p></p><p>Or are all timelines parallel?</p><p></p><p>"What identity?" The Holy Mother Wushi spoke, her voice curious.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also observing the Holy Mother Wushi at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he first met her, she looked a bit more naive, but... her strength was still mythical.</p><p></p><p>"I mean, if I say we've met once in the future, would you believe me?" Qi Yuan said casually, "Why no lounge chair this time? Get me one."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, is there a quick way to increase one's strength in this world?" Jinli couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly become stronger?" Qi Yuan instantly had a few answers in mind.</p><p></p><p>Eat a Devil Fruit? Receive enlightenment from a master? Or... do push-ups.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are no Devil Fruits, nor anyone to bestow enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Doing push-ups can make you stronger," Qi Yuan said enthusiastically. "I know someone who was ordinary and unremarkable, but by persistently exercising - push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups - he became stronger, even though he went bald."</p><p></p><p>"Exercise, push-ups? Sit-ups? Pull-ups? What are these?" Jinli was puzzled. "Are they some supreme cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan realized: "Ah, so you're a girl who doesn't like exercise. Let me teach you how to exercise then."</p><p></p><p>"Is that really okay?" Jinli thought Qi Yuan was going to teach her some supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, these are basic exercises, very simple." After some thought, Qi Yuan spent about ten minutes teaching Jinli these exercises.</p><p></p><p>"This... can improve my strength?" Jinli found it hard to believe, as the movements seemed so ordinary and not at all profound. But remembering that just carrying a ladder could get one into the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, she felt it must be true.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... actually, no, maybe after ten years of practice you could defeat a wolf?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Jinli paused, then smiled: "These could still be popularized among ordinary soldiers."</p><p></p><p>"But it's not entirely useless." Qi Yuan then took out his magic pen. Now that the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area was under his control, he could change its rules.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's add that cultivating the body through these exercises can improve one's cultivation." After writing this down, Qi Yuan pondered: "It's done... but there seems to be some side effects?"</p><p></p><p>"Like going bald?"</p><p></p><p>"So... even when changing the rules, I'm still limited by my own understanding, huh?" Qi Yuan felt a headache coming on, unable to delve deeper into the principles.</p><p></p><p>He quickly told Jinli: "In the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, doing the exercises I mentioned can quickly improve your cultivation. Bring some people over, increase our strength, and let's try to break through the challenges there to help me clear the dungeon."</p><p></p><p>"Doing those exercises in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area can increase strength?" Jinli was still a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I'm not lying to you. But be careful, too much of the exercise can make you go bald."</p><p></p><p>Jinli was still skeptical logically and rationally, but she chose to believe Qi Yuan. As for the side effect of going bald, she didn't really care. Compared to improving her cultivation, that was nothing. After some thought, she bit her red lips: "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"I have to log off now, it's too late." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?" Jinli asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven-Color Peak, I'm a disciple of the Divine Light Sect." Qi Yuan then logged off to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Jinli made a note of the place Qi Yuan mentioned. "The Divine Light Sect, the Seven-Color Peak? Where is that?"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan's method of getting stronger sounded ridiculous and far-fetched, Jinli still chose to believe him and decided to act on it.</p><p></p><p>"Summon the guards, we're going to the Grand General's Manor!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell gradually.</p><p></p><p>The carriage stopped outside the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage were Jinli's trusted aides and Qin Aunt. They had ridden for almost a day and a night without rest, sleeping in the carriage when tired.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they had arrived at the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Have you all remembered what I said?" After getting off the carriage, Jinli looked at the more than thirty people in front of her, her expression serious.</p><p></p><p>These more than thirty people were all her true confidants, loyal soldiers who would die for her.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí was among them.</p><p></p><p>They all nodded their heads, not opposing Jinli's orders at all.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí was holding a ladder, lost in thought. She then asked, "Your Majesty, the imperial medicine was taken from the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone? It seems Your Majesty has already mastered the method of entering the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí looked at the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone ahead and began to speculate. She was just curious about how to get in.</p><p></p><p>Could the ladder in her hand be of any use?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, carry the ladders and enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone together. Remember, no matter what happens, do not let go of the ladders."</p><p></p><p>"As you command!"</p><p></p><p>Although puzzled, these confidants did as Jinli said.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't speak, their faces were full of question marks.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the imperial guards, Hua Xian, saw this scene and couldn't help but chuckle lightly.</p><p></p><p>When she first entered the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone this way, she was also completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Soon, after they entered, their expressions would definitely be very interesting.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when the group carried the ladders and entered the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone without any obstruction, even the most well-trained imperial guards couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Hua Xian had a smug smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Carrying a ladder can enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone, this was told to me by a good friend of mine, and this matter must not be revealed!"</p><p></p><p>"As you command." These confidants all knew the seriousness of the matter.</p><p></p><p>They all felt it was unbelievable. The Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone, perhaps no one has been able to enter it for thousands of years. Why... can they enter just by carrying a ladder? In all these thousands of years, has no one tried this method before? </p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, which emperor would be so idle as to carry a ladder and enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone? But why can they enter? Does carrying a ladder represent some special meaning? They were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone, the group went deeper inside.</p><p></p><p>Jinli spoke again, "The ladders must be carried, do not let go. Do you remember the few movements I taught you on the way here?"</p><p></p><p>"We remember."</p><p></p><p>"Get ready, we'll do those movements here in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone." Jinli gave the order.</p><p></p><p>The people present were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí also asked, "Your Majesty, what are we doing these movements for?"</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yí, do you trust me?" Jinli looked at Qin Yí and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever Your Majesty says, this servant naturally believes."</p><p></p><p>"These movements..." Jinli looked up at the sky, "can quickly improve one's cultivation in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Improve cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>If they were not Jinli's confidants, if Jinli was not the Empress, </p><p></p><p>if they were some keyboard warriors from Qi Yuan's previous world, they would definitely be spraying now.</p><p></p><p>Words like "ridiculous" and "shark arm" would be pouring out.</p><p></p><p>But these confidants also had an incomprehensible expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí as well.</p><p></p><p>This was even harder to accept than carrying a ladder to enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Zone.</p><p></p><p>If cultivation could be so simple, wouldn't the world be filled with high-level cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí naturally didn't believe it in her heart, but she still slowly said, "This cultivation method does seem quite interesting, I wonder where Your Majesty learned of it."</p><p></p><p>"It was also told to me by that good friend." Jinli did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that senior must be a powerful figure who roams the world." Qin Yí murmured.</p><p></p><p>The word "game" represented her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>But she still carried the ladder and started doing push-ups: "Let this old servant try it out and see the effect."</p><p></p><p>She took action.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people present all stopped what they were doing and looked at Qin Yí.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 396</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" </p><p></p><p>The canary poked half her body out and looked back at Qi Yuan curiously, seeing that he wasn't moving.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... I'm a bit too big, it's a little difficult to enter."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>After reflecting on the myriad worlds, with Ning Tao's help, he had found the coordinates for the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>For a powerhouse of his level, entering a lower realm only required knowing the coordinates to enter through the dark void. </p><p></p><p>But now the problem was that his power was too great, making it difficult to enter.</p><p></p><p>He was at a loss for words regarding the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was the same before - the game icon only showed halfway.</p><p></p><p>This game couldn't wait to give him a wife, namely Ning Tao back then, who kept calling him "husband" from the other side, making Qi Yuan's heart itch.</p><p></p><p>The provocative game always tempted him, but wouldn't let him in.</p><p></p><p>Now it was the same - a bit hard to enter.</p><p></p><p>"How can that be!" The canary wrapped her small hands around Qi Yuan and bit her lip, using force.</p><p></p><p>Still, it didn't budge at all.</p><p></p><p>However, this action seemed to remind her of something, and her little face blushed.</p><p></p><p>"You try it yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I understand now. It's not that I'm too big, but because this is a game world, and I'm a character from reality trying to enter a game world... it really is difficult!"</p><p></p><p>Imagine on Earth, how hard would it be for a person to crawl into a computer game? Wouldn't they have to break the screen and then squeeze in? The game looks big, but anyone slightly clever would realize that the scenes in the game are all fake, not a real world, all hidden within the screen.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was an enormous computer, it would be very difficult to stuff a person into a game.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to use my clever brain."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's thoughts turned.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because I haven't pretended to be a game character?"</p><p></p><p>He recalled what Grand Master Zhizhen had said - when a Yang Spirit of the Heavenly Realm descends into a world, they become a mythical level powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Those at the Lesser Principle Realm would drop one small realm.</p><p></p><p>Those at the Greater Principle Realm would retain their power.</p><p></p><p>He had too many divine embryos inside him, and his own strength was comparable to a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't restrain himself, he simply couldn't enter.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he used too much force, the Flowing Wind Realm would shatter.</p><p></p><p>"Condense," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the four thousand divine embryos within him were restrained at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His own aura was also restrained.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Immortal Dao was reduced to mythical level at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"What about the Myriad Dao Martial God?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Would there be such restrictions at the Myriad Dao Martial God realm?</p><p></p><p>He tried to squeeze into the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>A look of joy flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "It's not rejecting me!"</p><p></p><p>The power brought by the Myriad Dao Martial God realm seemed not to have been detected by the rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He embraced the canary, and with a flash, entered the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I need to be a bit more careful, the quality of this game is somewhat poor..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that if he accidentally leaked his Myriad Dao Martial God power, there would be holes everywhere in this Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like a character in the game throwing a punch and directly punching a hole in the computer screen.</p><p></p><p>So, although the world didn't restrict his Myriad Dao Martial God power, he had to control it himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Flowing Wind Realm was the canary's home.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Immortal Dao power is limited to the mythical level."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Flowing Wind Realm, he had reduced his Immortal Dao power to the mythical level.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Flowing Wind Realm, he found he couldn't restore it.</p><p></p><p>Probably, he would have to leave this realm to recover.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Yang Spirits rarely descend to lower realms.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with power fixed at the mythical level, if surrounded and attacked by a dozen or so mythical powerhouses, dying in a small world would be too frustrating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the canary took a deep breath, her eyes filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Flowing Wind Realm!"</p><p></p><p>In front, maple trees stood straight and red, red everywhere, like a fairy tale world.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's figure appeared, standing on either side of Qi Yuan with the canary.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes held a nostalgic look: "This is where I first heard your voice."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao wore a black dress, her figure petite and delicate. She looked up at Qi Yuan, her eyes full of endless reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence," Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the memories of the past, he looked at Ning Tao's clear, cold smile that aroused pity, and said gently: "Ning Tao has grown up to be the most beautiful girl in the world."</p><p></p><p>In the past, young Ning Tao was seen as a demon girl because of the character for "demon" carved on her face, and was hunted down.</p><p></p><p>On this mountain, her pursuers insulted her as a demon girl, an ugly freak.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the young Ning Tao stubbornly raised her head and said: "When I grow up, I will definitely be the most beautiful girl in the world."</p><p></p><p>This voice was also heard by Qi Yuan outside the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in a good mood and casually responded with a few words, which also caused the assassin chasing Ning Tao to lose focus, giving Ning Tao the opportunity to kill him instead.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand touched Ning Tao's face, infinitely gentle on the place where the "demon" character had left its mark.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled, as bright as spring snow melting, pear blossoms on the treetops.</p><p></p><p>"When reflecting on the myriad worlds, this servant did not discover traces of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Now, entering this realm, this servant's cultivation is restricted and cannot help my husband. My husband, please search for the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons."</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>For finding things, a Yang Spirit is definitely stronger than a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>He still retained his Myriad Dao Martial God realm, and if he was a bit careful and serious, he could sweep through the entire Flowing Wind Realm in about a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>This sweeping was limited to searching for the aura of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was still out of consideration for the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, accidentally causing the Flowing Wind Realm to collapse would not be good.</p><p></p><p>"There's a stone pool ahead, this servant will go take a bath. My husband must not peek!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this little miss will go too!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao and the canary held hands as they went towards the stone pool of the past.</p><p></p><p>After countless years, even if the stone pool was no longer there, with Ning Tao's current power, she could make it reappear.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Myriad Dao Martial God was exerted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The vast Flowing Wind Realm became tiny in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He even had a feeling that if he punched the Flowing Wind Realm, this world would shatter.</p><p></p><p>So, he had to search carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes being too strong isn't a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was amazed at the power of his qi and blood, simply searching the entire Flowing Wind Realm for the aura of the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>This search was very rough.</p><p></p><p>After all, if it was more detailed, the server of this game would crash.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute, second by second, and disappointment appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, I didn't find it, but it's okay... I have plenty of time."</p><p></p><p>The time flow between the Cang Lan Realm and the upper realms was equal, one to one.</p><p></p><p>And one day in the Cang Lan Realm was about ten years in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Time was very abundant, and being anxious was of no use at all.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, as one of the most peculiar treasures Qi Yuan had ever seen, couldn't be seen just because one wanted to.</p><p></p><p>This required opportunity, and also time.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the Ten Days Soaring Sky situation was already formed, the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra was influencing the Flowing Wind Realm at all times, which was equivalent to Qi Yuan searching.</p><p></p><p>In the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, Qi Yuan's Great Forgetting Heart Sutra had left a mark.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons was still in the Flowing Wind Realm, given enough time, the Sun Golden Core could find it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if the Flowing Wind Realm was destroyed, it probably wouldn't appear.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, Qi Yuan had also tried, and his left eyebrow was twitching.</p><p></p><p>So the journey to the Flowing Wind Realm would definitely yield something for him.</p><p></p><p>Why not... just treat it as...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Travel.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan got up and walked towards the stone pool.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a clear voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you really did peek back then. Otherwise, I wouldn't have married you."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Ning Tao had said in the stone pool that if Qi Yuan peeked, she would marry him when they grew up. </p><p></p><p>The golden canary was now deducing what happened back then based on the result.</p><p></p><p>"Don't falsely accuse me, I'm a gentleman," Qi Yuan looked over.</p><p></p><p>On the blue stone, the golden canary wore a long dress with alternating blue and orange colors. The blue silk was embroidered with patterns of flowers and birds. The butterfly knot on the orange belt in front of her belly was wet, like a butterfly drenched in rain.</p><p></p><p>She lifted her skirt, swaying her two delicate white calves. Her bare feet, like tender lotus roots, had exquisite and round jade toes like works of art - small, crystalline, and able to be held in one palm.</p><p></p><p>In the pool, Ning Tao in a black dress was completely submerged in the water. Through the clear pond water, her expression was cold and beautiful. Her overly pale skin formed a stark contrast with the black stockings, which wrapped around her feet, with her lovely jade toes pressed together.</p><p></p><p>One was as cute as a cherry, the other as cool as a snow pear.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these two, or rather one person, Qi Yuan's expression softened: "There's still plenty of time, so I'll accompany you along all the paths... that I didn't accompany you on before."</p><p></p><p>From the golden canary to Ning Tao, Qi Yuan had missed too much during those countless years in between.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, when the golden canary became a demon woman, despised by heaven and annoying to people. She who used to be the most vain was now seen as an ugly freak - one can imagine what she went through.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, there's a lot to walk then!" The golden canary turned her head, unable to suppress the joy on her face.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao in the water stretched out her slender jade hand: "Let's start from here."</p><p></p><p>This was where Ning Tao and Qi Yuan's fate began.</p><p></p><p>With a splash, water splattered everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, this water is very cold, this young lady doesn't want to get in!" The golden canary grumbled, but still hugged Qi Yuan, her eyes full of deep affection.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's hand grasped the golden canary's delicate little jade foot, his eyes showing curiosity: "Why haven't we heard of any women with foot fetishes?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be because men's feet are not appealing? Qi Yuan imagined wildly.</p><p></p><p>"Gross!" The golden canary's pretty face turned red. "Ning Tao, help me, step on him!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Save me, Master, save me."</p><p></p><p>"I'm so miserable!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to die!"</p><p></p><p>"How vicious, how can they be so vicious!"</p><p></p><p>In the room, Ling Yayi was on the verge of tears, wailing like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>The Lightless Buddhist Disciple looked at Ling Yayi, his eyes calm: "If he were still alive and could come save you, everything could end."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Lightless Buddhist Disciple, you're not human! How can you bully people like this! </p><p></p><p>I said I don't want to be a monk, and I don't want to participate in any Great Buddhist Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>This little old man Ling Yayi was indignant.</p><p></p><p>It was bad enough being captured by this Lightless Buddhist Disciple.</p><p></p><p>This Lightless Buddhist Disciple actually wanted him to become a monk.</p><p></p><p>He naturally disagreed.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this Lightless Buddhist Disciple didn't care about his thoughts at all, and still "tortured" him every day, saying his desires were too deep and needed to be resolved.</p><p></p><p>This kind of resolution was mental torture.</p><p></p><p>First, using Taoist methods, Ling Yayi's desires were amplified several times, even tenfold.</p><p></p><p>Then, all kinds of delicacies, beautiful fox women dancing seductively, various treasures - all passed by next to him.</p><p></p><p>He could only look, not touch, not take, not eat.</p><p></p><p>How could Ling Yayi not be angry.</p><p></p><p>This kind of torture was too exhausting, no less than doing it twelve times in one night.</p><p></p><p>Why so specific? That's unknown.</p><p></p><p>"You have the power of reincarnation, and are destined for Buddhism. You should become a true Buddha.</p><p></p><p>This time, when the Great Buddhist Assembly is held, you will represent our Tanka Holy Land and must win first place," the Lightless Buddhist Disciple said calmly. "You have too many desires. If you don't diligently wipe them away, even with your reincarnation power, it will be difficult to rank in the top ten."</p><p></p><p>"How can you ask someone for help like this!" Ling Yayi wailed in pain.</p><p></p><p>Too vicious. </p><p></p><p>There are bad people in the upper realm! How can they test people like this!</p><p></p><p>This isn't even torture!</p><p></p><p>If it were torture, he might have confessed long ago!</p><p></p><p>"I'll represent you in the competition, isn't that enough? Can you stop torturing me?"</p><p></p><p>"This is not torture, but the cleansing of desires.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity you're not the Blood Master.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, perhaps he wouldn't need cleansing and could still become a true Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>The reincarnation power in the Thirteen Northern Demon Monsters must be inextricably linked to the Blood Master.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Master must surely have an even more concentrated reincarnation power.</p><p></p><p>From the few words in ancient texts, the Lightless Buddhist Disciple had glimpsed that the Blood Master was a truly amazing genius.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the one before him, who had too many desires, too mottled.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you're wrong about that. My master is much more ruthless than me.</p><p></p><p>He kills without blinking an eye, his robes are stained red! Why do you think he's called the Blood Master? Isn't it because he's killed too many people?</p><p></p><p>How could he become a true Buddha?" Ling Yayi laughed.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, since his master wasn't here, he could make up a few things to vent.</p><p></p><p>"Killing hundreds of thousands, what he killed were no longer living beings, but the distracting thoughts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't such a genius become a true Buddha?" The Lightless Buddhist Disciple's voice was full of Buddhist nature.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi was stunned, his mouth twitching: "Do I have too many desires because I've killed too few people?"</p><p></p><p>The Lightless Buddhist Disciple shook his head: "If you kill too much, you'll become a great demon.</p><p></p><p>After putting down the butcher's knife, when your spirit is extinguished, your physical body can become a Vajra protector for our Buddhist sect."</p><p></p><p>"...So whether I kill a lot or kill a little, it's wrong?" Ling Yayi was completely speechless. "Also, isn't it supposed to be 'put down the butcher's knife and instantly become a Buddha'? How come the physical body becomes a Vajra protector?"</p><p></p><p>"If becoming a Buddha were so easy, I'm afraid there would be killing everywhere in the Buddha's realm," the Lightless Buddhist Disciple's calm tone carried a hint of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if my fellow disciples were captured by you people from the upper realm, what kind of treatment would they receive?" Ling Yayi asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"You who possess the power of reincarnation can become true Buddhas. Generally speaking, there shouldn't be much danger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, you are... White Marsh's junior disciples. In the Buddha's realm, no one should do anything to you.</p><p></p><p>But... all things have their karmic connections, anything is possible." The Lightless Buddhist Disciple replied.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's realm is not entirely peaceful either.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, over so many years the Buddhist countries wouldn't have attacked each other, fighting for orthodoxy.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to fight for orthodoxy has appeared this time in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all the Buddhist disciples from the holy lands have entered the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Lightless Buddhist Disciple naturally hopes that the Buddhist countries can be unified and stop attacking each other.</p><p></p><p>But... is it really that easy to unify?</p><p></p><p>"I hope they're alright." Ling Yayi sighed. "This feeling... really isn't good."</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Wordy literature. Each female lead appears once, so there will be one less chance for them to appear. So in the Flowing Wind Realm, let's give a bit more to the tsundere Golden Canary and the yandere Ning Tao!</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Recommending a new book by a great author, link below!</p><p></p><p>Book title: "Burning Paper Every Day, I Became the Ancestor of Taoism"</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Wang Hun woke up one day, standing in a mass grave, and found he had become a ghost...</p><p></p><p>Burn "three wild chicken feathers", receive one stick of [White Phoenix Fragrant Incense]</p><p></p><p>Burn "half a volume of tattered scriptures", receive one stick of [Ten Thousand Buddhas Pilgrimage Incense]</p><p></p><p>Burn "one flirtatious fox tail", receive one stick of [Blissful Joy Incense]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"In this life, one should burn some treasures for oneself!"</p><p></p><p>In a world where gods and Buddhas stand in the sky and demons and monsters are seen everywhere, Wang Hun looked at the blazing fire in the brazier and enshrined himself as the Ancestor of Taoism!!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

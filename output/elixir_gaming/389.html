        <h1>Chapter 389</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at her and said speechlessly, "Did you not clean your ears last night? Did you stuff them up? I said it so loudly but you didn't hear - 1.05 billion spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Fearing her ears were full of wax, Qi Yuan raised his voice.</p><p></p><p>His words echoed through the hall.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, many people stared at Qiong Yunting's ears.</p><p></p><p>Some who couldn't control themselves even covered their mouths and laughed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu hugged Qi Yuan's arm, her face almost pressed against it as she laughed non-stop. </p><p></p><p>She felt like she had gotten sweet revenge.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting's face turned bright red, and she angrily retorted, "What nonsense are you spouting? I... I did clean my ears!"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you didn't clean them thoroughly. Not very diligent," Qi Yuan concluded directly.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting was furious. Even though she had reached Foundation Establishment, she was so angered by Qi Yuan's words that she could hardly breathe.</p><p></p><p>She could already foresee that rumors about Immortal Qiong Yunting not liking to clean her ears would spread throughout Cloud Sky City today.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you don't need to be embarrassed. Just be bold and clean your ears thoroughly now, otherwise I'll have to keep speaking so loudly which is very tiring," Qi Yuan continued to advise.</p><p></p><p>"You!" Qiong Yunting's eyes turned red, on the verge of tears from Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be shy, sister. We should reject the shame of ear cleaning and be ourselves openly! I once knew an immortal who even created her own Dao technique for better nose-picking. You should learn from her and not care about others' opinions!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he became more animated, his words taking on an inflammatory tone.</p><p></p><p>Red-eyed, Qiong Yunting had completely forgotten her original intention of humiliating Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Yunteng, dressed in a cyan robe and exuding an extraordinary aura, spoke up: "Friend, are you the... live-in son-in-law of the Jiang family, here at the Divine Infant Banquet to borrow spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>This time, it was Jiang Lingsu's turn to blush.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all. I'm not a live-in son-in-law, nor do I wash feet water," Qi Yuan shook his head. "Today, the Ear Wax Immortal said her husband's family is very wealthy. If I needed money, I could come to the Divine Infant Banquet and her husband would solve my problem."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng looked at Qi Yuan with an arrogant expression: "The Jiang family is a great clan of the Eastern Lands. This Perfected Lord knows a thing or two about their business troubles in Cloud Sky City. How many spirit stones do you need?"</p><p></p><p>Before the Divine Infant Banquet, he had heard Qiong Yunting mention Qi Yuan and Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had also agreed to take Qi Yuan down a peg or two, and if possible, acquire the Jiang family's businesses in Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>"1.05 billion!" Qi Yuan repeated.</p><p></p><p>He felt this couple must never clean their ears.</p><p></p><p>They should be cleaning each other's ears every night before bed.</p><p></p><p>A flash of displeasure crossed Wang Yunteng's eyes: "1.05 billion spirit stones? Is friend joking? With so many spirit stones, one could probably buy all of Cloud Sky City!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng didn't know if 1.05 billion spirit stones could buy Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>But it was definitely enough to buy the life of a Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking, I've done the calculations.</p><p></p><p>Your Wang family has 45 spirit stone mines, operates 5 auction houses, and has stakes in over 300 businesses. If you sold everything, it would be worth about 1 billion spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ear Wax Immortal, her family is even poorer - a gambling addict father, a seriously ill mother, and a good-for-nothing younger brother. They only have about 50 million spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to keep the appointment. Will you lend me the money?" He held out his palm.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng's expression remained unchanged, but his gaze towards Qi Yuan became different.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators also looked at Qi Yuan strangely, some with expressions of watching a show.</p><p></p><p>This red-robed cultivator had actually investigated the Wang family's affairs so thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly not just about borrowing money.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng naturally understood this. He sneered, "I wonder who is backing Brother Qi, giving him such confidence to borrow 1 billion spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful aura of a Divine Infant stage cultivator swept out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, some of the surrounding cultivators watched the show, while others moved away.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu moved closer to Qi Yuan, not feeling the Divine Infant cultivator's aura. Her clear eyes looked at Qi Yuan, her attitude having changed significantly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had never thrown his weight around before.</p><p></p><p>Today, he was here to play with his junior sister, with nothing else to do.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then replied: "Behind me stands... the Blood Robe Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>He directly borrowed his own influence.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan felt quite good.</p><p></p><p>No wonder those second-generation rich kids always liked to say, my father is so-and-so, my grandfather is so-and-so, my master is so-and-so.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of throwing one's weight around was actually quite nice!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The guests' expressions changed slightly, some showing fear.</p><p></p><p>"He's actually from the Blood Robe Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>"He's wearing a blood-red robe..."</p><p></p><p>"The Wang family has been targeted by the Blood Robe Alliance. They're finished!"</p><p></p><p>Who hadn't heard of the Blood Robe Alliance nowadays?</p><p></p><p>The story of the Blood Robe Sword Immortal could be considered inspirational.</p><p></p><p>He left home in middle age to pursue immortality, achieving great things late in life.</p><p></p><p>When he returned home, he found his daughter had been humiliated by the Light Palace and kept in a dog house!</p><p></p><p>So, filled with hatred, the Blood Robe Sword Immortal began his legendary journey.</p><p></p><p>He destroyed the Light Palace, killed the Yin God, and founded the Blood Robe Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Later, he offended the Divine Flower Society and was cruelly silenced.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword Immortal went alone to the Divine Flower Society headquarters and ended the Society Master with one sword strike! The Divine Flower Society also fell into the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's hands.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword Immortal was now the most famous legendary figure in the Eastern Lands and over 20 surrounding realms.</p><p></p><p>If this blood-robed man truly had the Blood Robe Alliance behind him, the Wang family was in real danger! The Wang family was a hegemon in Helan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But if the Blood Robe Alliance moved against the Wang family, even Wang Yunteng with his Yin God potential wouldn't be enough.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was worrying for Wang Yunteng, he unexpectedly gave a light laugh tinged with mockery: "These days, even con artists dare to come before my Wang family.</p><p></p><p>Do you know that the senior Blood Robe Sword Immortal of the Blood Robe Alliance has already agreed to take this Perfected Lord as his disciple soon!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng declared proudly.</p><p></p><p>The important news the Wang family was going to announce at this Divine Infant Banquet was that Wang Yunteng had been accepted as the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's disciple.</p><p></p><p>"What? Perfected Lord Wang has been noticed by senior Blood Robe Sword Immortal and taken as a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations! This is truly enviable... to the point of turning purple with envy!"</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon has emerged from the Wang family!"</p><p></p><p>"Wang Yunteng's talent is extraordinary. If he participated in the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings, he would definitely place. It's understandable that the Blood Robe Sword Immortal noticed him and took him as a disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"I never thought senior Blood Robe Sword Immortal would take disciples!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked and extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>"So this Qi Yuan is actually causing trouble for the Wang family? Isn't this like a flood washing away the Dragon King's temple?"</p><p></p><p>"This red-robed cultivator is in trouble!"</p><p></p><p>These people looked at Qi Yuan with pity.</p><p></p><p>Even if he really was from the Blood Robe Alliance, now that he had offended the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's disciple, he was doomed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was very confused.</p><p></p><p>The development of events was a bit beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, this is going too far. I'm clearly the Dragon King Battle God!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all shocked about him?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, why are you stealing my crooked mouth's lines?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless. He had rarely been in a good mood, accompanying his junior sister to play the role of the Dragon King Battle God, but it had failed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Wang Yunteng and said flatly: "You say you're the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's disciple, but do you have any proof? If you're his disciple, then... then I'm the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's father!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had intended to say he was the Blood Robe Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But if the other party wasn't the Blood Robe Sword Immortal's disciple, and he said he was the Blood Robe Sword Immortal, the sentences wouldn't correspond properly and might be grammatically incorrect.</p><p></p><p>"You dare disrespect the Blood Robe Sword Immortal? You're finished. In these Eastern Lands, no one can protect you!" Wang Yunteng's eyes held killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he truly regarded the Blood Robe Sword Immortal as his master.</p><p></p><p>"Call out your master Blood Robe Sword Immortal and let me see!" Qi Yuan put his hands on his hips.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if someone had the same name as him.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean... his copyright was infringed?</p><p></p><p>He should ask for some compensation.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robed Sword Saint isn't here, but this old man is."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>An old man came tottering out, with a wine gourd hanging at his waist and a strong smell of alcohol on him.</p><p></p><p>The tip of his nose was red, clearly a drunkard's nose.</p><p></p><p>He appeared suddenly, seeming to have evaded everyone's perception.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present all showed wary expressions upon seeing this old man appear.</p><p></p><p>Because he seemed to have materialized out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Wine Master!" Wang Yunteng immediately bowed respectfully, then said, "Wine Master is a legendary immortal figure. Even my master the Blood Robed Sword Saint would address him as Senior when they meet!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng introduced the Wine Master to everyone present.</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master took his wine jug and poured alcohol into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present smelled the wine's fragrance and all showed shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because that wine seemed to contain endless divine power.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was wine brewed from the divine power of Yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>For the Wine Master to be able to drink such wine, he must be a Yin spirit!</p><p></p><p>They looked at the Wine Master with even more belief.</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master finished a mouthful of wine and burped: "This kid Wang Yunteng is pretty good, with excellent talent. I like him a lot.</p><p></p><p>Too bad this old man finds it troublesome and doesn't want to take disciples, so I handed him over to that Blood Robed fellow."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Wine Master, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, everything about the Wine Master was laid bare.</p><p></p><p>This Wine Master before him was indeed a powerful Yin spirit, and moreover a Great Venerable, no ordinary Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"You've met the Blood Robed Sword Saint? You dumped Wang Yunteng on him, would he agree to take him as a disciple?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Back then I was just waking from a drunken stupor, lying in a carriage. That Blood Robed kid was quite considerate, keeping watch for this old man at night." The Wine Master said carelessly, "Me handing Wang Yunteng to him was an honor for him. He couldn't wait to curry favor with this old man!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Wine Master's eyes held a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze remained calm.</p><p></p><p>For the first half of what he said, his nose grew slightly, indicating... the Wine Master was lying, Blood Robed hadn't kept watch for him at night.</p><p></p><p>For the second half, his nose didn't change, indicating the Wine Master was telling the truth, or at least believed it to be true.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite confident. I'm 99% sure the Blood Robed Sword Saint wouldn't take him as a disciple," Qi Yuan said flatly.</p><p></p><p>"On this matter, even if you were truly the Blood Robed Sword Saint's father, he'd still have to listen to me," the Wine Master said confidently. "The strongest experts in this world, the more powerful the Great Venerable, the more they'll have to ask favors of me. Because only this old man can give them a way out!"</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master spoke arrogantly, full of pride.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "I've heard the Blood Robed Sword Saint is the strongest in the world. Does he still need you to give him a way out?"</p><p></p><p>"Young lad, you just don't understand," the Wine Master said. "If I take off my shoes, the Blood Robed Sword Saint would have to put them on for me.</p><p></p><p>Aren't you from the Blood Robed Sect? Call him over, I'll have him demonstrate putting on my shoes right here!"</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master spoke with full confidence, like a peerless expert.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present all changed expression, some falling silent in fear.</p><p></p><p>Because what this Wine Master said was too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Robed Sword Saint truly heard this...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this old man dares to speak like this because I have confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword Saint is very powerful, but his name isn't even on the Mythic Monument. Hehe... he's nothing special," the Wine Master continued.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng then said: "In this world there are great sects, and also hidden organizations. The Wine Master is the vice leader of a hidden organization!"</p><p></p><p>The others were all shocked to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Could it be this Wine Master was a true dragon? But regardless of whether it was the Blood Robed Sword Saint or this Wine Master, they were both people they couldn't afford to offend.</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master looked at Qi Yuan, his expression wistful: "Kid, help me put on my boots, and I'll overlook your offense today.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise... hehe, if you make this old man unhappy, your sect, that girl behind you, and even the Jiang family, will all likely be reduced to ashes!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "The atmosphere in the cultivation world has really deteriorated.</p><p></p><p>I just casually wiped out the Feng family on the way here, and now I encounter another potential serial killer.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, why are there still so many bad people in the world despite how hard I try?"</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew past, making Qi Yuan's blood-colored robe flutter.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were stunned hearing Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>What? The Feng family was wiped out?</p><p></p><p>They were shocked in their hearts, as if hearing something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, they seemed to realize something, and looked at Qi Yuan with surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>Today was Wang Yunteng's Divine Infant Banquet. By rights, the Feng family should have sent someone, but no one had arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>They quickly sent out messages, spreading the information.</p><p></p><p>"Wiped out?" The Wine Master frowned, his powerful divine sense sweeping out. Instantly, the tragic state of the Feng family appeared in his mind's eye.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Qi Yuan, his eyes showing a surprised look: "You're pretty impressive kid, you really did wipe out the Feng family!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Wine Master's powerful divine sense swept towards Qi Yuan, wanting to see through Qi Yuan's background.</p><p></p><p>However, his powerful divine sense touched Qi Yuan's body like a spring breeze entering water, not raising any ripples.</p><p></p><p>"You kid..." The Wine Master looked suspicious, "Could you really be the Blood Robed Sword Saint's father?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were all a bit dazed hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, countless messages reached their ears, and their gazes towards Qi Yuan completely changed.</p><p></p><p>Because just now they received news that the Feng family had been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>The people of Feng Palace seemed to be rushing towards Cloud Sky City to apologize.</p><p></p><p>Because the one who destroyed the Feng family was... the legendary Blood Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked and confused.</p><p></p><p>How did they only find out about such a major event now?</p><p></p><p>They had no idea that where Qi Yuan appeared, ten suns took turns shining, intensifying the effects of forgetting.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robed Sword Saint, he's the Blood Robed Sword Saint!" Some Divine Infant cultivators trembled, their minds shaken.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined the Blood Robed Sword Saint would appear here.</p><p></p><p>And seemingly in the identity of the Jiang family's son-in-law! The cultivators who had secretly laughed at Qi Yuan earlier now turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The others' expressions all turned reverent.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Blood Robed Sword Saint!" Immediately, some Divine Infant cultivators bowed.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators all bowed in unison.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wine Master had boasted impressively and looked like a powerful expert, they had no idea how strong he really was.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword Saint was different, he was a true monster.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Yunteng's face also turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Qiong Yunting's eyes also showed an incredulous look. She glanced at Jiang Lingsu, then at Qi Yuan, her expression close to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Only the Wine Master merely looked a bit surprised, still sitting there calmly like he was fishing.</p><p></p><p>"So you're the Blood Robed Sword Saint? Come, put on this old man's boots!"</p><p></p><p>The Wine Master's voice carried confidence, confidence in his own great power.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators present were all shocked hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yunteng's face also turned pale, though he truly hoped in his heart that this Wine Master... wasn't just talking big.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Wang family was truly finished.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the Wine Master's strange abilities, Wang Yunteng felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the Wine Master, his eyes carrying a smile: "To paraphrase the ancients, this Azure Waves Realm cannot allow the existence of anyone more arrogant than me!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't stand it anymore, this Wine Master was too good at pretending.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't compete, his whole body would itch with ants.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after competing, it would be time for what Qi Yuan was best at... killing, killing, killing.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

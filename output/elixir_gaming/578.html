        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how much time had passed, but Jiang Lingsu was lying half-dead in Qi Yuan's sturdy embrace. Her jade toes were curled up, her delicate and smooth foot arches were arched, and her beautiful eyes were hazy and somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>A few strands of blue-green hair were messily stuck to her round head.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you are still a bit weak," Qi Yuan said, as if speaking with a double meaning.</p><p></p><p>A flash of lucidity passed through Jiang Lingsu's hazy eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I know I cannot compare to Shixiong," Jiang Lingsu whispered softly, as if recalling something, her pretty face becoming even more enchantingly flushed.</p><p></p><p>"You need to practice and replenish yourself, and have a good rest," Qi Yuan, who had high emotional intelligence, was not the kind of man who would just say "drink more hot water."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Shidi Jiang Lingsu, truly did not need any covering.</p><p></p><p>She was just... too big.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Jiang Lingsu recalled the captivating sensations from before, naturally unwilling, her slender neck lifting up, the perfect delicate arc, her gaze filled with anticipation, "Can I still... tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that, for her, the reality that had occurred was much more pleasurable than her fantasies.</p><p></p><p>Although she was exhausted to the point of being unable to continue, she still wanted to...</p><p></p><p>That feeling of her body, mind and soul merging and colliding, had made her infatuated.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan smiled brilliantly, his hand brushing over Jiang Lingsu's exquisite jade toes, her smooth foot arch, and grasping her ankle.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's delicate body trembled, her expression a mix of anticipation and resistance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Highest Reason Assembly.</p><p></p><p>A figure descended, emanating a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>It stood upright, like a towering mountain, or the eternal and unchanging laws of the universe.</p><p></p><p>When this figure appeared, the Highest Reason Assembly's Grand Elder's eyes held an expression of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Biluo, you have actually stepped into the Third Layer of the Celestial Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Biluo's expression was neither joyful nor sorrowful: "The Anomalous Fruit is compatible with me, so I naturally advanced quickly."</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the Second Elder of the Highest Reason Assembly had a look of admiration on his face: "From today onwards, Sovereign Biluo, you are undisputedly the number one in the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm. When will you hold a Sovereign Assembly and announce it to the world?"</p><p></p><p>"Just an empty title," Sovereign Biluo said indifferently, "Ever since I fused with the Anomalous Fruit and witnessed the broader world, I also feel my own insignificance, and only wish to quickly improve my strength."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder looked at him with reverence: "As expected of Sovereign Biluo."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, Sovereign Biluo has already become the number one in the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm, you no longer need to hesitate. </p><p></p><p>In this universal cycle, there are only 300 billion years left. We must quickly help Sovereign Biluo improve his strength."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder's gaze flickered, and he finally nodded: "Yes, he is now the Sovereign, the greatest hope of the Immortal Realm. The Highest Reason Assembly must bestow upon him.</p><p></p><p>I will go find the Primordial Assembly now."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder's figure then dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Highest Reason Assembly stood by the side: "Sovereign, please wait a moment, enter the Primordial Assembly, and you will surely obtain a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Sovereign Biluo responded.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a violent fluctuation came.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Highest Reason Assembly's face showed shock and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, what happened?" The Second Elder asked.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Biluo was also curious.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Highest Reason Assembly, an ancient dragon turtle who had lived for countless years, rarely showed such an expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Assembly... has disappeared!" The Grand Elder said solemnly, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? The Primordial Assembly is the Sovereign's precious treasure, it has always been within the Highest Reason Assembly. How could it be lost?</p><p></p><p>If there were thieves who infiltrated, how could Elder Brother and I not have sensed it?</p><p></p><p>Although the Primordial Assembly has no true spirit, if thieves approached, it would still resist.</p><p></p><p>Unless... the Primordial Assembly has run away!" The Second Elder said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Assembly was a treasure of the Sovereign without true spirit or wisdom, but it had a "faint instinct."</p><p></p><p>Within the Highest Reason Assembly, although the Primordial Assembly was sealed, the Grand Elder and Second Elder had always revered it like an ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder nodded: "If the Primordial Assembly has left, we will have great difficulty finding it."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder's expression was bitter: "What are we to do? Without the Primordial Assembly, Sovereign Biluo cannot enter that realm, cannot improve his strength, and may even be unable to attend the Grand Assembly of the Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Biluo's gaze was complex, he also did not expect to encounter such a situation.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder's expression changed repeatedly, and finally he gritted his teeth and said: "I have a method that can take Sovereign Biluo into that realm.</p><p></p><p>However, it will take some time, and it will consume Immortal Veins."</p><p></p><p>The Highest Reason Assembly had obtained the Primordial Assembly for a long time, and had researched it for more than one cycle.</p><p></p><p>Within the Primordial Assembly, they had also studied some results, a method to enter that realm without the true spirit of the Primordial Assembly.</p><p></p><p>But the consumption was great.</p><p></p><p>And the number of times it could be used was limited.</p><p></p><p>"How many Immortal Veins does it require? Biluo will pay the price." Sovereign Biluo said generously.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Cosmic Spiritual Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Lady sat on the 260th layer, frequently glancing around, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"That fellow didn't just go eat a meal, how come he hasn't come back in three days?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, like me, he has a big appetite." The Boar Sovereign said with a snort.</p><p></p><p>"You actually believe he went to eat? He's just dissatisfied with the Myriad Changes Academy's response, and is bargaining for a better deal." A female Sovereign spoke in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>This was a similar view held by the other Sovereigns in the Cosmic Spiritual Sea.</p><p></p><p>That Sovereign, dressed in clothes, stepped into the 1000th layer.</p><p></p><p>This strength, was clearly at the Primal Chaos Realm, and not just any ordinary Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, before stepping into the 1000th layer, the Myriad Changes Academy had not invited him to join.</p><p></p><p>Later, someone came to invite him, and it was an ordinary formal member of the Myriad Changes Academy.</p><p></p><p>But that Sovereign was a Primal Chaos Realm giant, and not just any ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>If it was not a Primal Chaos Realm expert who invited him, how could he have joined?</p><p></p><p>"He is so aloof, isn't he afraid the Myriad Changes Academy won't accept him?" A Sovereign murmured.</p><p></p><p>In this Spiritual Boundary Realm, the position of the Myriad Changes Academy was extremely special and revered.</p><p></p><p>After all, some major forces may have a Dao Master behind them, but behind the Myriad Changes Academy were not just one Dao Master, but many.</p><p></p><p>Exactly how many, no one knew.</p><p></p><p>Hegemon-level forces all had to show respect to the Myriad Changes Academy.</p><p></p><p>"If the Myriad Changes Academy doesn't accept him, that would be interesting." A Sovereign said in a sinister tone.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? His strength is at the second tier within the Myriad Changes Academy, the Myriad Changes Academy would not miss such an opportunity." </p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>"Look, he's here!"</p><p></p><p>"Finally he's come!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, many gazes fell on Qi Yuan, their eyes filled with reverence and envy.</p><p></p><p>After all, Primal Chaos Realm Sovereigns were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Many Sovereigns may never see a Primal Chaos Realm Sovereign in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Cosmic Spiritual Sea, perhaps there were Primal Chaos Realm Sovereigns in hiding.</p><p></p><p>But in all these years they had been in the Cosmic Spiritual Sea, they had not seen a single Primal Chaos Realm Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan's figure appeared, he immediately became the focus of all the Sovereigns' gazes.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, being good-looking is a burden."</p><p></p><p>"Staring at him like this, I'm going to die of social anxiety."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, casually waving his hand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his entire body was pixelated.</p><p></p><p>All the Sovereigns looking at him saw nothing but pixels.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Lady on the 260th layer widened her eyes: "Is he going to strip and enter the 1000th layer? Damn it, I can't see anything clearly with these damn blocks!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was calm.</p><p></p><p>As expected, even aliens dislike pixelation.</p><p></p><p>Without heeding the voices of many domain lords, Qi Yuan went straight to the depths of the Cosmic Spirit Sea to refine his true spirit.</p><p></p><p>This kind of refinement has many benefits for the true spirit and can also slightly increase one's strength.</p><p></p><p>After becoming an Yin Deity, Qi Yuan's strength reached a bottleneck and was difficult to further improve.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice like a gentle breeze sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"I am Qingfeng, from the Myriad Transformations Academy. May I know your honored name?"A thin, bamboo-like man appeared, his face always bearing a smile as gentle as spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan." Qi Yuan glanced at Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This Qingfeng before him was a domain lord at the Opening Heaven realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Qi Yuan had seen such a powerful and complete Opening Heaven realm domain lord in the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>"Would you be willing to join the Myriad Transformations Academy?" Qingfeng asked humbly.</p><p></p><p>Even for him, it was difficult to enter the Cosmic Spirit Sea while wearing a physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Join the Myriad Transformations Academy?" Qi Yuan said, "I like freedom and dislike being constrained. If you let me be the academy head, perhaps I will consider it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qingfeng was taken aback, not expecting such an answer.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding domain lords were also surprised, feeling that Qi Yuan was too bold, actually wanting to be the academy head.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a domain lord suddenly shouted, "Senior Qi Yuan, why don't you join our Refining Fire Academy and be our academy head!"</p><p></p><p>The originally gloomy atmosphere instantly became lively.</p><p></p><p>"Fire Essence Domain Lord, you really know how to come up with ideas. Your Refining Fire Academy doesn't even have a Myriad Transformations realm cultivator, yet you want to invite Senior Qi Yuan! That's just charity work!"</p><p></p><p>"If Senior Qi Yuan joins, that would be lifting you out of poverty!"</p><p></p><p>Many domain lords said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, "See, others are already inviting me to be their academy head. I'm so sought after, if you don't invite me to be your academy head soon, you'll miss the chance."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng smiled awkwardly, then said, "I don't have the authority to decide this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Then find someone who does have the authority." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng continued, "With your strength, as long as you make some effort after joining the Myriad Transformations Academy, you can quickly rise to the upper echelons. If you contribute enough, becoming the academy head is not impossible."</p><p></p><p>"This is just charity work for you? I'm not a love-struck fool." Qi Yuan directly refused.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's awkward expression deepened. Normally, he wouldn't have given such people face, but now the Myriad Transformations Academy had reached a critical juncture in one of its research projects and needed talents from all aspects.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations Academy does not merely suck blood." Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then what can the Myriad Transformations Academy give me?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This conversation was heard by the surrounding domain lords, who felt it was absurd.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of an ancient monster at the Opening Heaven realm, he's really bold."</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary Myriad Transformations realm cultivators to enter the Myriad Transformations Academy, they don't even have the chance."</p><p></p><p>"When will I have the same confidence as Senior Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Many domain lords sighed and were filled with envy and jealousy. After all, if they dared to speak to Qingfeng, the domain lord of the Myriad Transformations Academy, in this way, they could forget about leaving the Mundane Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng looked at Qi Yuan and slowly said, "The Myriad Transformations Academy exists solely to unravel all the mysteries and transformations of the world. Whatever the question, we have the answer."</p><p></p><p>"So if I have any doubts, I can get the answers from you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, this Myriad Transformations Academy doesn't seem too bad.</p><p></p><p>"But to obtain the answers, you must pay a price. The Myriad Transformations Academy follows the principle of equal exchange. You get the answers, but you also need to solve the academy's doubts."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case... then I can join the Myriad Transformations Academy." Qi Yuan thought for a moment and agreed.</p><p></p><p>He also had many questions, such as the path of the Yang Deity and how to devour stars faster.</p><p></p><p>"This is the credential of the Myriad Transformations Academy. Whoever holds this token is a member of the academy." Qingfeng handed a golden jade pendant to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Liu Su saw this and was filled with envy. In the Myriad Transformations Academy, aside from the purple jade pendants, the most prestigious was the golden jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I've received it. But I need to go refine my true spirit in the Cosmic Spirit Sea recently. After I'm done, I'll report to the Myriad Transformations Academy." Qi Yuan put on the golden jade pendant and turned to re-enter the Cosmic Spirit Sea.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qingfeng said with a light smile, "If you come to the Myriad Transformations Academy first and acquire some knowledge about the Cosmic Spirit Sea, the speed and effect of your true spirit refinement may be even better."</p><p></p><p>"It can be done like that?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. "It seems I should go to the Myriad Transformations Academy."</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me, friend." Qingfeng heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He had finally brought another powerful cultivator into the Myriad Transformations Academy. Those who can become powerful cultivators must have exceptional wisdom, talent, and fortune. This would be of great help to the academy's research. If they could help the academy break through some research, the benefits would be immense.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you should have just arrived in the Mundane Realm?" Qingfeng asked curiously along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>"The Mundane Realm is very special. There are many places similar to the Cosmic Spirit Sea, full of opportunities. However, most of these opportunity-rich places are controlled by major powers, and ordinary people cannot enter them. Only the Cosmic Spirit Sea can be freely entered."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng said indifferently, "Among those who control the most opportunity-rich places in this Mundane Realm, we, the Myriad Transformations Academy, hold the most, a total of seventeen such places."</p><p></p><p>"With the golden jade pendant you hold, you can freely enter fourteen of these opportunity-rich places, in addition to the three you can already access. With your talent and insight, if you thoroughly explore these seventeen opportunity-rich places, your cultivation and strength may double, or even allow you to glimpse the scenery of the Yang Deity's Fourth or even Fifth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"That powerful?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could now step into the Yang Deity's Fourth Realm anytime if he wanted, as he had learned about it from his battle with Hei Tian in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>"But won't stepping into the Yang Deity's Fourth Realm cause the true spirit to be extinguished? Does anyone really want to enter it?" Qi Yuan asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's expression became solemn and sacred. "Hear the Dao in the morning and be willing to die by evening. If one can glimpse the Yang Deity's Fourth Realm, what does the extinction of the true spirit matter?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, like me... according to my memory, I have lived for three thousand seven hundred cycles. From the perspective of a Dao Sovereign, perhaps... countless cycles.</p><p></p><p>If one can step into the Yang Deity's Fourth Realm and break out of the cycle, is it not a path?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>The forbidden knowledge about the Yang Deity's Fourth and Fifth Realms may not be known to Realm Lords or Myriad Transformations realm cultivators, but Opening Heaven realm domain lords, especially those of the Myriad Transformations Academy, naturally knew of it.</p><p></p><p>"The founding purpose of the Myriad Transformations Academy was to research a way to break through the cycle and escape the Yang Deity's Fourth Realm, or even the Fifth Realm!" Qingfeng's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a strange look, feeling like his brain was about to explode. "If you succeed, doesn't that mean the cycle has already ended?"</p><p></p><p>Now they are still researching. That means this research is still within the cycle. This also implies that success is impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you may not know that the Mundane Realm... is located outside the Dao, not within it."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

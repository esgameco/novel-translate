        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also remembered these two people, a brother and sister.</p><p></p><p>This morning when they came to visit him, they also brought some spiritual soup.</p><p></p><p>The taste was good, just a bit salty.</p><p></p><p>"This fight for the dragon must be handled with great care," Kong Fulu's face was gloomy. "Daring to harm our Shenguang Sect's allies, they are courting death!"</p><p></p><p>"This person's Regret Dragon Hand has been practiced to great perfection, three people were swiftly killed. Among the imperial princes, who is hiding so deeply?" Dong Xian was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The imperial princes of the Great Liang Kingdom were mediocre in talent.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not have sought external aid to help with their foundation building.</p><p></p><p>The result was that one prince and two foundation building cultivators were killed in one strike, indicating the murderer's strength was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to think about who the murderer is, we will eventually encounter the murderer and kill him!" Qi Yuan said on the side.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, Qi Yuan did not want to use his brain.</p><p></p><p>If he could use his hands, why bother using his brain?</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's continue deeper into the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm," the white-haired Kong Fulu said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days passed, Qi Yuan, Kong Fulu, and Dong Xian had walked a considerable distance deeper into the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, they discovered six more corpses in the depths of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>These corpses, just like the ones Dong Xian had seen before, were all killed by the Regret Dragon Hand.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu's face looked extremely grim: "Again the Regret Dragon Hand, one strike killed six foundation building cultivators, does the Great Liang Kingdom's imperial clan have such a powerful prince?"</p><p></p><p>Even Kong Fulu himself could not instantly kill six foundation building cultivators, two of whom were in the late foundation building stage.</p><p></p><p>This was at least at the Yuandan level of strength.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the six corpses, his eyes revealing a solemn expression for the first time: "This killer is quite formidable."</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see more.</p><p></p><p>[He was an ordinary foundation building cultivator, killed by a unique Infant Immortal cultivator.]</p><p></p><p>The other five corpses did not reveal any useful information.</p><p></p><p>An Infant Immortal, how could they enter the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm? At the entrance of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, the Venerable True Lord Taigang was stationed.</p><p></p><p>And to reach the Infant Immortal realm in just a hundred years?</p><p></p><p>This talent was too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Even for a unique Infant Immortal, it was still exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Which of your Great Liang Kingdom's royalty has cultivated to the Infant Immortal realm?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian was taken aback, not knowing why Qi Yuan asked this, but he still answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"In our Great Liang Kingdom's royal clan, there are only two Infant Immortal ancestors, but the two of them... passed away several years ago," Dong Xian said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the royal clan was also greatly related to the passing of those two Infant Immortal ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the Infant Immortal veneration in the royal clan was not from the royal bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan did not ask further.</p><p></p><p>An Infant Immortal monster somehow infiltrated and hunted the foundation building cultivators entering the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but smell a whiff of conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kong Fulu suddenly said, "There are fluctuations of battle ahead, it seems to be people from the Floating Mountain, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan was somewhat expectant.</p><p></p><p>Was his white moonlight there?</p><p></p><p>The three hurried towards the direction of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Even before arriving, Qi Yuan saw a sky full of sword qi and constantly severed trees.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the battle ahead was extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Jingold Sword Technique!" Kong Fulu's eyes revealed a solemn expression, "One of the seven major sword techniques of the Floating Mountain, it is indeed powerful."</p><p></p><p>The three hurried over, only to see in front of them, Lei Wen and Miao Li were battling a robe-wearing expert.</p><p></p><p>That robe-wearing expert, alone faced the two foundation building disciples of the Floating Mountain, and did not fall behind.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian saw the robe-wearing expert and his eyes revealed a trace of shock: "Second Prince!"</p><p></p><p>That robe-wearing expert was actually the Second Prince.</p><p></p><p>The Second Prince, who was also his second elder brother, when did he become so formidable, able to contend with the two true transmission disciples of the Floating Mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lei Wen's voice came: "Elder Brother Kong, quickly come and help me, this person in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm is indiscriminately killing innocents with the Regret Dragon Hand, at least three princes have already died by his hand.</p><p></p><p>The fellow disciples of the Hatred Gate and the Great Complete Association have died by his hand!"</p><p></p><p>"So it was him?" Kong Fulu was furious, "Deliberately targeting us, let him experience the might of the Shenguang Sect's Sect Master's son-in-law, the Peak Master of the Five Light Peak's personal disciple!"</p><p></p><p>He also saw that three princes died at the hands of an unknown expert.</p><p></p><p>It seems that it was this Second Prince recklessly killing innocents here.</p><p></p><p>And this Second Prince, just happened to target the sects related to the Shenguang Sect and the Floating Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu raised his duster, quickly joining the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Five Light Saint Art!</p><p></p><p>As soon as Kong Fulu acted, it was his most satisfactory Five Light Saint Art.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not take action, because that Lei Wen did not call him.</p><p></p><p>And he felt that with Kong Fulu's addition, that Second Prince would certainly not be a match.</p><p></p><p>He was a Dao Foundation Building cultivator, how could he casually act?</p><p></p><p>He had to maintain his style.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, with Kong Fulu's intervention, the Five Light Saint Art combined with the Jingold Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>The trees in front were flying, and multicolored lights constantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was like a messy special effects animation video.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watching on the side felt quite bored.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian watched with a trembling heart, with sweat constantly flowing out.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's really better with music in the battle, it looks more passionate, how boring." Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Watching animations or browsing short videos before, the content might be ordinary, but with the music playing, the aura would be completely different.</p><p></p><p>It could even give people a surge of fighting spirit, making them feel deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xian stood beside Qi Yuan, completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan took out a jade slip from his storage bag: "Fortunately, I have some music stored."</p><p></p><p>Since the battle in front of him was not worthy of music, he would provide his own.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, with the music playing, Qi Yuan watched the battle with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"I am a Dao Foundation Building cultivator, in the future when I fight, I must also have a BGM for myself, this way it will be more in line with my style." Qi Yuan thought seriously.</p><p></p><p>BGM could give him an invincible mentality.</p><p></p><p>When he faced the nearly three thousand foreign evil cultivators in the Realm Extermination, if he had a BGM, perhaps he would not have suffered such heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>The battle was now nearing its end, the battling Miao Li, seeing Qi Yuan playing some tunes, glared at him angrily.</p><p></p><p>Others were fighting, while he was just playing music.</p><p></p><p>"Good tune!" Kong Fulu felt spirited, feeling that his junior brother really understood him.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, the Five Light Saint Art landed on the Second Prince's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful energy of the Five Light Saint Art drilled into the Second Prince's chest.</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed from the Second Prince's seven orifices, his aura rapidly plummeting, but he had a crazed smile on his face: "Insulting my royal clan, you will all die."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a blood-red flower appeared in his hand, and he crushed it.</p><p></p><p>His aura completely disappeared at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan at this time widened his eyes: "What a loss!"</p><p></p><p>Because just now, his eyes had glimpsed that flower.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had received a prompt.</p><p></p><p>[Soul Remembrance Flower, when crushed, it can completely transmit the scenes witnessed by the deceased to the person holding the main flower.</p><p></p><p>If not crushed, it can also transmit only fragments of words.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Remembrance Flower is also the main medicinal herb for refining the Divided Soul Pill, consuming it can enhance one's spiritual will.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure flashed, appearing in front of the Second Prince's corpse, picking up the fragments of the Soul Remembrance Flower, his eyes filled with a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>The flat-chested Miao Li glanced at Qi Yuan, her eyes revealing a resentful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, what have you discovered?" Kong Fulu asked.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen also stood nearby, full of curiosity, wondering what Qi Yuan had discovered.</p><p></p><p>"This is called the Soul Remembrance Flower, after being crushed, the scenes that occurred here will be transmitted to the person holding the main flower.</p><p></p><p>So, the Second Prince must have had an accomplice." There was no need to hide this information.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu's face turned gloomy upon hearing this: "It seems this matter is not simple."</p><p></p><p>Miao Li couldn't help but say, "Even if there are accomplices, could their strength surpass the Second Prince? A minor problem."</p><p></p><p>Lei Wen also agreed to some extent.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable True Lord Taigang was stationed at the entrance, even if someone was trying to fish in troubled waters and enter, it could not be in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan said, "Elder Brother, I may have to separate from you all."</p><p></p><p>Since there was a Soul Remembrance Flower, the Second Prince's accomplice must also have a Soul Remembrance Flower.</p><p></p><p>Now, what Qi Yuan lacked the most was the strength of his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>With a weak spiritual will, he couldn't even enter the game.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Qi Yuan had been constantly seeking methods to enhance his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Consuming the Soul Remembrance Flower could increase his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>And it could also be used to refine the Divided Soul Pill.</p><p></p><p>He urgently needed it.</p><p></p><p>With an enhanced spiritual will, perhaps he could even enter the second game.</p><p></p><p>That mischievous game had been tempting him every day, but wouldn't let him in.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had long wanted to enter the depths and wreak havoc, to increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fu Lu sighed, "Shidi, be careful."</p><p></p><p>He did not ask Qi Yuan the reason for his departure.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the entire Shenguang Sect and the Seven-Color Peak actually have a somewhat equal relationship.</p><p></p><p>The other peak's senior disciples were required to respect Kong Fu Lu, but Qi Yuan did not need to.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Miao Li said, "Leaving alone, you may be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Just now, Qi Yuan had said that those people still had accomplices, even if their strength was not enough, it was still a threat to the Ten Great Elites of Da Shang.</p><p></p><p>In her view, Qi Yuan had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage, and in this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm it was indeed dangerous, especially if he encountered the Broken Wolf.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have my own plans," Qi Yuan said, bidding farewell to the group and heading deeper into the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Qi Yuan transformed into a beam of light, flying inward.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself, "Hearing the Ice Maiden say that in the Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, one is blessed with auspicious Qi, and words become reality, causing the gods to fall.</p><p></p><p>Why is my Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment so weak?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that when I was dreaming during my Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, I didn't defeat that guy and signed an unequal treaty?</p><p></p><p>Weakening my strength?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan flew while thinking, getting more and more angry.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he accidentally entered that guy's wooden hut, and they had to come and attack him! Qi Yuan was dissatisfied, and although he couldn't defeat the other, he still beat him until his face was bruised and swollen.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Qi Yuan and that guy reached an agreement, and he stayed in that wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan felt that it was probably that agreement that caused his Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment to be weaker than others.</p><p></p><p>"So, for Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, one must completely subdue that guy in the wooden hut, in order to truly have words become reality as the Ice Maiden said? I just didn't have a teacher to tell me this, if someone had told me, I would have used all my strength to defeat that guy!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Because in front of him appeared a river.</p><p></p><p>This river had still water, without any flow.</p><p></p><p>In the river, there were also no living creatures.</p><p></p><p>"Does this Lost Soul River divide the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm into two halves?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the spiritual Qi on the other side of the Lost Soul River was more dense than the outside.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sent out a strand of divine sense, spreading it over.</p><p></p><p>But the Lost Soul River, which could trap the divine soul, had no effect on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that with my Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, I am no longer an ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This Lost Soul River cannot make my divine soul fall into it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became bolder, his figure flying into the river.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, an old man completely shrouded in a purple robe was sitting with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he opened his eyes, his entire body emanating a dense aura of death.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has crossed the Lost Soul River?" A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Lost Soul River also existed in the first Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Da Shang Kingdom had been secretly researching it for centuries, and with the support of a mysterious great cultivator, they had finally found a loophole in the Lost Soul River, entering the deepest part of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, which was the Sunken Coffin Land.</p><p></p><p>But now, someone had suddenly entered here, how could the old man not be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Ye," the purple-robed old man murmured.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a man in soft armor appeared, his gaze extremely fanatical in front of the old man.</p><p></p><p>And this man in soft armor, his aura was actually that of an Elixir Cultivator! In this Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, with the True Lord of the Radiant Peak guarding it, Elixir Cultivators were not allowed to enter.</p><p></p><p>If Kong Fu Lu saw this, he would definitely be shocked, how did this Elixir Cultivator manage to enter?</p><p></p><p>"To the northeast, there is a cultivator who has entered, you go and deal with him, quickly," the old man ordered.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was planning to truly control the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who disturbed him would be killed without mercy.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" Liang Ye respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could easily suppress and subdue him.</p><p></p><p>He quickly retreated, heading to the northeast to subdue that person.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed old man still sat in his original place, his face full of ferocious expressions: "It's almost time, in ten days, the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm will truly belong to our Da Shang Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>Little Two, don't worry, I will avenge your grievances! After the matters here are settled, I will personally behead Kong Fu Lu, Lei Wen, Miao Li, and Qi Yuan, and offer sacrifices to you!</p><p></p><p>The Shenguang Sect, the Floating Mountain, they all deserve to die!</p><p></p><p>Our Da Shang Imperial Clan, is the true emperor of Da Shang!"</p><p></p><p>His eyes filled with a deathly aura, revealing a frenzied look.</p><p></p><p>Once he refines this place, the coffin in the Sunken Coffin Land will appear, and it will not flee as before, the purple-robed old man couldn't imagine how great the opportunity would be.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan?" The man in soft armor, upon seeing the person who had mysteriously entered the Sunken Coffin Land, had a momentary look of surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You know me?" Qi Yuan looked at the other, but his eyes did not find any useful information.</p><p></p><p>"I remember all the young talents of the three major sects!" Liang Ye said, his eyes filled with thick killing intent, "Today, I will use your blood to consecrate, and open the great journey of our Da Shang!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Ye said, slowly walking towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered Kong Fu Lu or the other Da Shang Ten Elites, he would have some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, who had just reached Foundation Establishment, he didn't take him seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, remember my name, Liang Ye.</p><p>In the future of the Da Shang cultivation world, this name will be a legend!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Ye's expression was fanatical, his eyes filled with anticipation for the future.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this: "The villain is just a villain, he wants to kill me after just a few words?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out a kitchen knife, wanting to create a false impression.</p><p></p><p>"This knife was given to me by my teacher, it is a divine infant treasure.</p><p>I can barely activate it a bit, but it's enough to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, holding the knife and frantically attacking Liang Ye.</p><p></p><p>The knife techniques were powerful, emanating a terrifying aura, as if being struck by this knife would result in serious injury.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the terrifying aura, Liang Ye's expression changed slightly: "How can he be so strong!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that the other party's strength, under the blessing of that treasure, was clearly beyond the Da Shang Ten Elites.</p><p></p><p>However, he could still suppress the other party in battle.</p><p></p><p>"After you die, this treasure will be mine!" Liang Ye looked greedily at the kitchen knife in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face then showed a look of distress: "How can you be so strong?</p><p>No, I must use a secret technique, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan steeled his heart, suddenly murmuring something.</p><p></p><p>Only a white flash of the knife could be seen on this patch of grass, extremely sharp, even able to slice through an Elixir Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Liang Ye's face was filled with extreme terror, but he had no chance to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>One slash, and Liang Ye's entire body was split in two.</p><p></p><p>The victorious Qi Yuan looked pale: "Phew."</p><p></p><p>A mouthful of fresh blood spurted out, his face as white as paper, and he could barely walk steadily.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is an Elixir Cultivator, using the treasure given to me by my teacher, it consumed most of my spiritual power to slay him.</p><p>I must quickly recover my spiritual power here, otherwise if more enemies come, I won't be able to activate that treasure."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, taking Liang Ye's storage bag and putting his soul-nurturing flower inside.</p><p></p><p>He disappeared with a weak appearance.</p><p></p><p>"My previous performance should be enough to get that... White Peony Award, right?</p><p>I'm really a genius!"</p><p></p><p>When encountering Liang Ye, Qi Yuan could instantly slay him.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't do that.</p><p></p><p>The other party also had a soul-nurturing flower, and a few words spoken would be transmitted to the other party.</p><p></p><p>So he deliberately pretended, saying he defeated the other party with the treasure given by his teacher, and that he was seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>Now he appears to be recovering his spiritual power, and the hidden manipulator must be eager to send someone else to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Defeat the small, then the big comes, defeat the big, then the old comes.</p><p>In this way, an endless stream of soul-nurturing flowers will fall into his hands.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he displays too much strength and scares the other party away, what would he do?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his own schemes, Qi Yuan had a smug expression, delighted with his own intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, this is a big problem!"</p><p></p><p>He had a look of horror on his face: "I forgot to put on the background music just now, without the audio atmosphere, my acting skills may not get the White Peony Award."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan deeply regretted this.</p><p></p><p>He decided that next time he encounters an enemy, he will first play some passionate battle music.</p><p>After the battle is over, play some emotional music.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I don't have 'Plum Blossom', otherwise after the battle, while I cough up blood to the tune of that song, the effect would definitely be better."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine sound was vast and carried a mysterious charm.</p><p></p><p>How dare those kiln workers really rise up.</p><p></p><p>Those humming steel constructions had broken through their cognition, and even the casual imperial soldiers might not have such might.</p><p></p><p>After all, being able to fly in the sky had already broken through the cognition of these people.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan saw this scene and bowed down in reverence.</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess stood upright, her peach eyes carrying a hint of confusion. Finally, she looked at the man and said dissatisfiedly, "Pretending to be a deity!"</p><p></p><p>She did not feel any aura of divinity.</p><p></p><p>How could this be called a deity?</p><p></p><p>She determined in her heart that the other party was a fraud and a charlatan with some minor abilities.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a gaze fell on the woman dressed as a Taoist priestess.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged in the air, without a word.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao stepped forward: "These are heavenly gods and angels!"</p><p></p><p>Many drone-like flying objects seemed to have wisdom and took to the air.</p><p></p><p>Those kiln workers knelt on the ground, most of them daring not to look directly at the "gods", except for some bold ones who stole glances at the "angels".</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?" The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess was obviously unconvinced.</p><p></p><p>Without divinity, how could they be gods?</p><p></p><p>She was deeply puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The techniques of the gods, how can mortals comprehend?" Chen Kangbao spoke, like a charlatan, clustering behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess looked at Chen Kangbao, a flash of red light passing through her eyes, as if she wanted to see the roots of Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, discernment was not her forte, and she did not have the ability to see anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan, carried by mosquitoes and small birds transformed into drones, was in a pensive mood, assuming the appearance of a god.</p><p></p><p>"It's still not perfect, there should be some entrance music or BGM."</p><p></p><p>To increase the progress bar, he must play the role of a god well.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's clever mind, the easiest way to play the role of a god is to add special effects and anomalies to himself.</p><p></p><p>Colorful special effects, coupled with various divine sounds, can easily deceive the people of this world.</p><p></p><p>After all, the people of this world have combat power but no divine powers.</p><p></p><p>And this world is a bit strange, the Tao and the law do not work, and even the talismans they make are just waste paper.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan prepared to play the role of a god in this way.</p><p></p><p>"The divine heart is holy, and the heavenly gods cannot bear to see the suffering of the people, so they have descended to the mortal world to subdue the evil spirits with their divine bodies!"</p><p></p><p>"Red Cloud Stronghold, evil spirits are rampant, and believers have been praying day and night!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, the gods have descended, and the world is clear!"</p><p></p><p>Amid the buzzing of many drones, Chen Kangbao's voice also sounded particularly vigorous.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiaodan knelt on the ground, her small face filled with joy mixed with fear.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the villagers were also filled with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Red Cloud Stronghold has been plagued by evil spirits, and people have been dying frequently, with a gloomy cloud hanging over them.</p><p></p><p>Now, such a god has suddenly appeared to save them, how could they not be delighted? "Has the god come to save us?"</p><p></p><p>"God, the common people pay respects to the god!"</p><p></p><p>These kiln workers praised with their mouths, with a devout attitude.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qi Yuan's superpowers listened carefully, he heard a lot of chaotic voices in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if making a wish to this god can be fulfilled!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to marry a third wife!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to freeload, to get a free flower girl!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope my parents are safe and prosperous for life?"</p><p></p><p>They were treating him like a wish-fulfilling machine?</p><p></p><p>Although playing the role of a god requires fulfilling people's wishes.</p><p></p><p>But now, Qi Yuan is playing the role of a god descending, and only needs to fulfill the wishes of believers with a god-like image.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, he doesn't need to care.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that the superpowers I obtained when I broke through the Purple Palace could be used in this world."</p><p></p><p>When he broke through the Purple Palace, Qi Yuan gained the superpower that the words he spoke when activating his superpower would randomly enter some people's ears.</p><p></p><p>And the voices he heard, if he answered, would cause inexplicable situations.</p><p></p><p>For example, when he was in the Canglan Realm, Qi Yuan heard the voice of a Taoist cultivator who wanted a devoted and considerate partner.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan responded.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a fleshlight appeared next to that Taoist cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Using this superpower in this world, wouldn't it be very applicable?</p><p></p><p>"You want to kill the evil spirit of Red Cloud Stronghold?" The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Although she did not know how the other party was pretending to be a deity, but to slay the evil spirit of Red Cloud Stronghold was a big matter.</p><p></p><p>If they were not careful, they might lose their lives, or even accelerate the downfall of Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"The evil spirit is wreaking havoc, and believers have prayed, so the heavenly god has descended in person to subdue the evil spirit!" Chen Kangbao was Qi Yuan's little mouthpiece.</p><p></p><p>After all, when playing the role of a god, it's best to speak less.</p><p></p><p>Mystery and the unknown are what make people revere.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even thought about turning his back on the common people and facing the world with his back.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess walked towards Qi Yuan, her gaze constantly scrutinizing him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Hu also arrived, and he looked at Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen Qi Yuan before, and with the layer of light on Qi Yuan's face at the moment, he couldn't see him clearly, so he didn't associate the person in front of him with his son-in-law Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what you're doing this for, but... the evil spirit of Red Cloud Stronghold is not that easy to deal with." The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess said solemnly, "It has already touched the realm of the divine soul, and ordinary imperial soldiers cannot withstand it."</p><p></p><p>While the Mortal-level imperial soldiers are still within the realm of mortals, the Yellow-level can be considered superhuman.</p><p></p><p>As for the higher Mystic-level, they touch the realm of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the divine soul, invulnerable, the evil spirits are wary of it.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit of Red Cloud Stronghold, although only at the Yellow-level, has touched the realm of the divine soul, and ordinary imperial soldiers, no matter how many, cannot withstand the divine soul attack.</p><p></p><p>"Your gaze is clear, without the aura of a divine weapon, you should not be a Mystic-level imperial soldier.</p><p></p><p>And you have no divine tools, so what will you use to deal with the evil spirit?"</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Mystic-level imperial soldiers have powerful vital energy and spirit, which can even radiate outwards, their temples are full, and there is a divine light flickering in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This is easy to judge.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, she did not find any divine tools on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As a tool master, as long as Qi Yuan has divine tools hidden on him, she would naturally not be able to avoid her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Except for divine weapons, some special celestial tools are also excluded.</p><p></p><p>So she speculated that the other party was a Yellow-level imperial soldier, possessing some special and strange techniques.</p><p></p><p>This kind of person is rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>After all, after dealing with so many evil spirits, there are always some geniuses who will study the abilities of the evil spirits and use them.</p><p></p><p>But they cannot be copied.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Zhou Hu also hurriedly said, "To slay the evil spirit, we must plan carefully!"</p><p></p><p>He was grateful for Qi Yuan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>He did not want Qi Yuan and the woman dressed as a Taoist priestess to have conflicts.</p><p></p><p>The two should unite to explore the past of that evil spirit and find its weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>He also expressed his views to Qi Yuan at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with a mere evil spirit, it's so complicated, where is the dignity of a god? A god should have more class like me!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan spoke, he lost his dignity, and his words were somewhat contradictory.</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess silently gave Qi Yuan a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>A god should indeed have dignity.</p><p></p><p>But where would a god say that he wants to have more class?</p><p></p><p>Unless this god is crazy.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu also remained silent, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Although the heavenly god has no divine tools, he has a divine spear!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Kangbao began to act as Qi Yuan's mouthpiece again.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and shouted in a loud voice, "The evil spirit of Red Cloud Stronghold, come out and die!"</p><p></p><p>A loud shout echoed through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu's face showed an anxious and fearful expression.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess' face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Attracting the evil spirit out like this, how can they deal with it?</p><p></p><p>And even if it doesn't listen, it shouldn't come out so quickly, right?</p><p></p><p>Is this just courting death?</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the originally cloud-covered Red Cloud Stronghold, the air seemed to have generated a gorgeous red mist.</p><p></p><p>A faint red mist, ambiguous and ghostly.</p><p></p><p>A sound of weeping and sighing, mixed with panting, then suddenly, a scream of agony, hysterical, as if a female ghost from hell was howling, with pain but also a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>From the ancient well, long black hair slowly emerged, wet and dripping.</p><p></p><p>A charming, flushed face appeared, with a lustful expression in the eyes, like a nightclub queen in hot pants and a cropped top, swaying her hips wildly on the dance floor.</p><p></p><p>Her clothes were tattered and torn, as if shredded by a whip, and through the gaps, her tender and delicate body could be seen covered in whip marks.</p><p></p><p>Especially on her bare back, densely packed, bloody and cruel yet alluring.</p><p></p><p>The woman dressed as a Taoist priestess felt a great threat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she had the urge to flee.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she also had some guesses about the birth of this evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>It should be some special group, indulging in revelry and accidentally using too much force, killing someone and then dumping the body into the ancient well.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts were racing, seeking a solution.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Chen Kangbao's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, quickly bless me, your old servant wants to tightly embrace this strange spirit from behind!"</p><p></p><p>He had an expectant look on his face, his eyes shining brightly. This gaze reminded Qi Yuan of a certain uncle character from a certain Korean variety show.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, don't worry about your old servant!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to bleed and sweat for the Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao repeated again.</p><p></p><p>His wolf-like ambition was blatantly exposed.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>Please, you are now the divine strategist, do you have to be so despicable? What bleeding and sweating do you want, I would know?</p><p></p><p>He did not respond to Chen Kang Bao, his gaze falling on the tattered-clothed, whip-scarred female spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious monster, I can see at a glance that you are not human!"</p><p></p><p>"Eat my shot!"</p><p></p><p>He unsheathed the long spear at his waist, Qi Yuan holding the long spear, stepping on the "drone", rushing towards the spirit.</p><p></p><p>This shot, he did not hold back at all, extremely domineering.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, she can attack the soul!" The Taoist-dressed woman quickly warned, with a look of apprehension.</p><p></p><p>Spirits that can attack the soul are particularly difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary-level spirits can easily make a yellow-level Warrior Mage flip.</p><p></p><p>Cackling laughter rang out, the heavens and earth spinning in madness.</p><p></p><p>The soul attack was unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This spirit's soul attack can make people fall into a dream world.</p><p></p><p>In the dream world, countless female spirits will appear, constantly demanding and draining one's vitality.</p><p></p><p>Only Mystic-level Warrior Mages can resist it.</p><p></p><p>"It has launched a soul attack, oh no, we must leave quickly!" The Taoist-dressed woman was very decisive.</p><p></p><p>She came to gain experience, not to die!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu hesitated, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>"No, how did he block the soul attack!"</p><p></p><p>"No, how can the soul attack be ineffective against him?"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-dressed woman was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu's face showed joy: "Doesn't this mean we have a chance!"</p><p></p><p>He was eager to go forward and help.</p><p></p><p>"Just because he can be immune doesn't mean you can. If you and I go, we'll just be sending ourselves to death. Now, we can only hope his strength is a bit stronger!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-dressed woman said calmly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she frowned, as if thinking about something.</p><p></p><p>"This female spirit seems to be the work of a heretical cult!"</p><p></p><p>The full-body whip marks, a face full of pain and desperate desire.</p><p></p><p>This made the Taoist-dressed woman think of a heretical cult, the Bloody Thorns!</p><p></p><p>This cult had betrayed humanity and allied with spirits.</p><p></p><p>They even researched how to transform humans into spirits.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that they are traitors to humanity, committing all kinds of evil.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but wonder about the collision between Qi Yuan and the alluring female spirit.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A deafening explosion rang out, cracking and popping.</p><p></p><p>A cold look flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes as he said, "Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>This spirit is the strongest he has encountered in this game so far.</p><p></p><p>However, it is still within his acceptance.</p><p></p><p>If one shot can't kill her, two shots should work, right? The female spirit couldn't speak, but her eyes also showed confusion and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Her most powerful soul attack was ineffective.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's combat power is terrifying, if this continues, she will be done for.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu..." The female spirit couldn't speak, but she could cry.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned: "This spirit is too useless, she's actually been stabbed to tears by me!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Chen Kang Bao saw this and suddenly shouted, "Oh no, she's calling for help!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist-dressed woman was also taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Hu's just-born joy disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a splashing sound came from the ancient well, as if many water ghosts were struggling to emerge from it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly: "You didn't summon all your naked men from the brothel, did you?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Qi Yuan felt like retreating, because seeing a bunch of naked men would hurt his eyes.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Taoist-dressed woman's expression was terrified: "Quickly, let's go, this is the spirit-nurturing ground of the Bloody Thorns!"</p><p></p><p>Her guess was right!</p><p></p><p>This spirit is indeed the work of the Bloody Thorns.</p><p></p><p>And the Bloody Thorns would not have created just one spirit.</p><p></p><p>It means that spirits similar to that female spirit are not just one.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit-nurturing ground, there must be at least ten, or even more.</p><p></p><p>Under everyone's terrified gaze, one by one, long-haired, pale-faced women climbed out of the ancient well. Their bodies were wet and dripping, their pale bodies covered in whip marks, their gazes alluring and passionate.</p><p></p><p>These spirits, piled up together, were neatly arranged, numbering a total of... eighty-seven! The surrounding civilians saw this and their faces turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiao Dan felt like vomiting. They had been drinking from this well for so many years, and it turned out to be filled with the bodies of female spirits!</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's over!" Zhou Hu's expression was desperate.</p><p></p><p>So many spirits, and all of them so special.</p><p></p><p>This is not just the end of Red Cloud Village, this is the end of Ninghe County!</p><p></p><p>Is this even possible? At this time, Chen Kang Bao's body was also trembling, like a sieve.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Qi Yuan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Heaven has truly given him a great gift.</p><p></p><p>So many white moonlights.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid?" Qi Yuan spoke, addressing Chen Kang Bao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao swallowed hard: "Young Master, quickly bless me, I feel my arm has an endless bull strength, I want to help the Young Master... hug ten of them!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless again.</p><p></p><p>It's not that his arm has bull strength, it's his niu-zi that has bull strength! But he's playing the role of a god, this is his stage to perform on.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, my white moonlights have gathered together!"</p><p></p><p>"Good thing you can't speak, no need to worry about a bloodbath!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll let you see... what a god is!"</p><p></p><p>Facing eighty-seven spirits, he actually did not retreat but advanced.</p><p></p><p>Those brothel people were terrified, their bodies trembling. Now, their only hope was this god.</p><p></p><p>Can this god really do it? However, in the next moment, they saw a sight they would never forget in their lives! With the Deity!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, this entire space seemed to be dyed in a bloody color.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly deity displayed a terrifying divine power, and in a bloody hue, a blood-colored armor covered his body from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>The armor plates were tightly connected, neatly arranged, shimmering with blood color and vivid red. The intricate and complex patterns in the middle were strange, engraved with images of various powerful creatures.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored spear was also covered in blood, emanating sharpness and bloodiness, representing slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The blood crystal thorns on the shoulders were bewitching yet dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Only a pair of cold eyes were left exposed, this blood-colored armor had raised that divine figure to three meters tall, like an invincible heavenly deity!</p><p></p><p>Clad in blood armor, wielding a blood spear! "The deity has arrived, all spirits retreat!"</p><p></p><p>"The deity has arrived, the human world is clear!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The spear was like a soaring dragon, dominating all.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying slaughter unfolded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Powerful soul attacks kept assaulting, even if facing this many soul attacks, a Mystic-level Warrior Mage would still die.</p><p></p><p>Even an Earth-level Warrior Mage would be cautious and wary! But the figure in the blood-colored armor was unstoppable! These soul attacks were completely useless.</p><p></p><p>And his spear, truly did the job, stabbing one female spirit after another.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill him until the heavens and earth are overturned, the blood flows like a river!"</p><p></p><p>In Red Cloud Village, more than eighty female spirits surrounded that terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored armor was like a heavenly deity, no, He was the heavenly deity, with perfect combat skills, a perfect strong physique, and perfect lines and curves.</p><p></p><p>Those female spirits, how could they be his match, they could only be slaughtered! "How can he be so strong?" Zhou Hu's expression was shocked, unable to understand.</p><p></p><p>"God!" Some brothel people knelt on the ground, kowtowing continuously.</p><p></p><p>This is not a god, who is the god?</p><p></p><p>The powerful female spirits were fragile as paper under that terrifying deity.</p><p></p><p>"This fighting art..." The Taoist-dressed woman saw more.</p><p></p><p>This fighting skill, reaching the pinnacle of perfection, did not seem to be of this mortal world.</p><p></p><p>And his power is clearly still at the yellow level, even the early yellow level.</p><p></p><p>Yet... he forcefully subdued eighty-seven female spirits.</p><p></p><p>"This... blood armor, what is it?" She was full of question marks about the sudden appearance of the armor on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"He is a god, he has a divine armor... isn't that normal?" Zhou Hu trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter lasted for a full quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>The number of female spirits finally dwindled down to the last one.</p><p></p><p>That majestic deity wielding the blood-colored spear had a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the trembling, pale-faced female spirit.</p><p></p><p>"In your next life, you'll still be my white moonlight!"</p><p></p><p>The spear struck out, like a fierce dragon!</p><p></p><p>The female spirit perished! In this place, only the deity's thought-provoking words remained.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, bring your sisters along!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

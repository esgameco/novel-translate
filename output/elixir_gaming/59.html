        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ahead were the endless mountain ranges, and he stood on a flat ground, stopping his steps.</p><p></p><p>Going further ahead was a bottomless abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was unfathomably deep, with swirling mists.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were no signs of animals or plants.</p><p></p><p>But he could vaguely see five colors, representing the five elemental forces.</p><p></p><p>Those five colors were like boiling, flowing paints - if one were to fall in, their bones might be completely melted.</p><p></p><p>If he had not yet embarked on the cultivation path of Qiyuan, looking down into the abyss, his acrophobic self would surely have trembling legs, unable to resist jumping down.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he did not have that feeling.</p><p></p><p>"According to the usual game settings, shouldn't I first slay all the five souls here before I can reach the final reward area? Unexpectedly, the five souls are gone, and I don't have to kill any monsters to get here."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan picked up Xiaojia in his arms: "Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan leaped down into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he felt as if he had crashed into a thin membrane.</p><p></p><p>He squeezed through.</p><p></p><p>When he looked around, Qiyuan saw even more of the five colors.</p><p></p><p>This seemed to be a pool.</p><p></p><p>In the pool, the five colors were boiling.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan felt a tingling sensation in his body.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xiaojia, her red color had become even more vivid, like a whole sauna, and she seemed quite uncomfortable in this place.</p><p></p><p>Together till the end!</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan chose to merge with Xiaojia.</p><p></p><p>Not for the sake of enhancing his strength and defense, but to protect Xiaojia. Xiaojia's main body was not very strong, and it was easy for her to get injured staying here.</p><p></p><p>It would be better for her to transform into armor and imprint on Qiyuan's chest.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the armor, Qiyuan walked in the pool.</p><p></p><p>However, his speed was very slow, as if he was wading through a thick paste.</p><p></p><p>"This place looks quite ordinary, there doesn't seem to be anything useful, right?"</p><p></p><p>The five colors in the pool were very pure. Using an inappropriate analogy, each color was like a single element, a pure substance composed of the same type of element.</p><p></p><p>So, although this place was vast, the actual things here were not many.</p><p></p><p>As his eyes scanned around, a series of prompts appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This is golden sand, the essence of gold gathered by the scorching of the Great Sun. Bathing in the golden sand can increase the probability of comprehending the Qi of the golden essence."</p><p></p><p>"This is wooden sand, the essence of wood gathered by the scorching of the Great Sun. Bathing in the..."</p><p></p><p>"This is water sand..."</p><p></p><p>What he saw were the products of the five elemental essences being scorched by something called the Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>These products could increase the probability of comprehending the Qi of the five essences.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they would be of great use to the three people he had encountered.</p><p></p><p>But for Qiyuan, they were almost useless.</p><p></p><p>"My drop rate is already 100%, these five-element sands are completely useless to me. Can they even break through the drop rate to 100%?"</p><p></p><p>"However, the three NPCs I encountered that day might find them useful. Their drop rates are probably less than 1%, so pitiful."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan thought, and with a big hand, he grabbed a large handful of the five-element sands.</p><p></p><p>They were useless to him, but useful to others, so they had value. It wouldn't be a loss to grab a handful.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, coming here and returning empty-handed would be too boring.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, Qiyuan paused.</p><p></p><p>He saw something other than the five-element sands.</p><p></p><p>"The Flower of the Great Sun, if one touches it, they may hear some of the Great Sun's remaining thoughts. The lucky ones may even obtain some useful techniques."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the faint light in front of him, no bigger than a firefly.</p><p></p><p>He grasped that strand of light.</p><p></p><p>Some intermittent murmurs entered Qiyuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"The Wangyue Continent is my foundation, how dare you!"</p><p>"Demonic forces from the outside, ah ah ah!"</p><p>"The Great Sun's Deluge!"</p><p>...</p><p>"I cannot accept this!"</p><p></p><p>These fragmented remnant thoughts entered Qiyuan's ears, and he felt a little unsteady on his feet.</p><p></p><p>"Standing in the five-element sand area, the consumption is too great. I've stayed in the game too long today, I need to get out of here quickly."</p><p></p><p>After this thought, Qiyuan began to analyze the fragments he had heard.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be a powerful expert who encountered another powerful expert and was defeated in a great battle?"</p><p></p><p>"Demonic forces from the outside? Could it be referring to the final boss of this game? This Great Sun, could it be a deity? He fought a great battle with the demonic forces from the outside, but was ultimately defeated, only managing to scorch the legs of the demonic forces?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this demonic force is quite powerful. The deity, perhaps at level 99? Combined with the power of the Empress Bride at the time, reaching a level of 104, yet they were still defeated by the demonic forces, only managing to injure them!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll have to solo this final boss myself, and I'll need to reach level 100 to have a chance. And who knows, after all these years, how much the boss has grown in strength?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that there are too few monsters in the Four Great Forbidden Lands, otherwise I would have grinded to level 999 before going to solo that boss."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the strand of light in his hand suddenly flashed brightly, like an old man's final flicker of life, and then instantly dimmed, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>A fragmented technique was transmitted into Qiyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Daydream Technique?"</p><p></p><p>When he learned that the technique was called the Daydream Technique, Qiyuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Daydream, not even as good as a regular dream. No wonder the deity couldn't defeat the demonic forces."</p><p></p><p>Then, he received the fragmented information of this technique.</p><p></p><p>The Daydream Technique, true to its name.</p><p></p><p>Although the content was mostly incomplete, the fragments still made Qiyuan feel that it lived up to its name.</p><p></p><p>This technique seemed to have been created by the owner of this technique, who appeared to be the Great Sun, contemplating the myriad stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This technique emphasized devouring all things, and the early content was relatively normal, but the later content was fantastical, aiming to devour the entire starry sky to empower oneself.</p><p></p><p>"The universe is so vast, can I only take a bite?"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, this technique is doomed to fail!"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's gaze pierced through the abyss, looking up at the boundless stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"This is the moon, the projection of the moon."</p><p>"This is the Soul-Severing Star, the projection of the Soul-Severing Star."</p><p></p><p>The myriad stars filled the sky, but they were not real, only projections of the stars.</p><p></p><p>The stars and the moon were all fake, how could one devour them?</p><p></p><p>"However, if he lived on the Blue Planet, this technique would still have great potential.</p><p>So many stars, eating one a day, from the Mountain Man era to the destruction of the Blue Planet, they could never be finished."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan's imagination ran wild.</p><p></p><p>"I need to get out of here, the consumption is a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the fragmented Daydream Technique, Qiyuan left the abyss and found a secluded place to dig a large pit, burying himself and Xiaojia.</p><p></p><p>Only after logging off the game did Qiyuan feel his body recover a bit.</p><p></p><p>"After reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, I must cultivate techniques to increase my spiritual consciousness!" Qiyuan secretly decided.</p><p></p><p>"The Daydream Technique is too fragmented, but some of the content above is related to the 'Qiyuan Sutra'.</p><p>However, I need to find some similar techniques for reference to perfect it."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan was a person with plans.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Black Mountain Sect definitely did not have similar techniques.</p><p>He could go ask Jiang Lingsu.</p><p>Little junior sister looked like a rich lady, she must know a lot.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He tidied up and prepared to go to the thatched hut next door to see Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the thatched hut, a layer of frost had formed on Jiang Lingsu's face.</p><p></p><p>She opened her eyes, and the frost dissipated, revealing a trace of bitterness on her youthful face: "Is this the price of wielding the Mirror of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>After awakening her bloodline, she was given a chance to wield the Mirror of Heaven and Earth, catching a glimpse of a fragment of the future.</p><p></p><p>But the Mirror of Heaven and Earth, such a precious treasure, how could someone of her cultivation be allowed to wield it at will?</p><p></p><p>She had also developed a serious illness.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, the ice would invade her body, causing her unbearable pain.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was relatively mild, and she could endure it.</p><p></p><p>But when it became severe, it could make her lose consciousness from the agony.</p><p></p><p>To alleviate this pain, she would need the help of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator with a water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root.</p><p></p><p>Well, the Jiang Clan knew some great Violet Palace Realm cultivators, and they also had Violet Palace Realm elders, but none with a water-attribute Heavenly Spirit Root.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had one, it would be too costly to invite a great Violet Palace Realm cultivator just to remove this "insignificant" pain.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu sensed something and walked out to the courtyard, where she saw Qi Yuan standing at the door: "Senior Brother, are you looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu and stared at her face: "Junior Sister, are you ill?"</p><p></p><p>"Shall I go and make you some chicken soup?" Qi Yuan was very attentive.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu sighed: "Senior Brother, it's not necessary. I just didn't sleep well.</p><p></p><p>What did you come to see me for? Just tell me directly."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, seeing this, did not hide anything and told her the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu gave Qi Yuan a strange look upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the cultivation method you asked about does not exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>If there is any, the legend says that in ancient times, there was a tribe called the Jujin in the depths of the East Sea, and their cultivation method was similar.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this tribe has long since been wiped out, and it is unknown if there is still any inheritance left in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Junior Sister, for informing me." Qi Yuan was a little disappointed, but he also felt it was normal. It's not like every time he had a problem, it would be solved immediately. He looked at Jiang Lingsu, "Junior Sister, if you have any problems, just tell your Senior Brother. My strength is not bad, and I can still help you with ordinary matters."</p><p></p><p>Caring for the rich lady is everyone's responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Junior Sister has also helped him a lot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood the principle of "giving me peaches, and I will repay you with jade."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu smiled slightly: "Thank you, Senior Brother, for your kindness."</p><p></p><p>Although the Senior Brother was a bit silly and his strength was not that great, his nature was still good.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Re-entering the game, Qi Yuan was surprised to find that the Five Elements Practitioners who had gone out to party had all returned to the core area of the Five Elements Training Ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was particularly delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Little Jia, why don't you hide in the pit, and I'll go and come back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said to Little Jia, but the cold little hand, which was just the sleeve, was clutching the corner of Qi Yuan's clothes.</p><p></p><p>The wooden plaque with the crying face pattern slid out of the sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The crying face represented Little Jia's unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, do we have to merge every day?"</p><p></p><p>"It feels like getting married and having to pay the public tax!"</p><p></p><p>He said, and instantly merged with Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red armor covered his body, with sharp spikes all around, making him look fierce and dangerous.</p><p></p><p>His towering figure and the cold, crimson color contrasted sharply with the Five Elements Practitioners.</p><p></p><p>"My sword thirsts for blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you all can't bleed!"</p><p></p><p>"Then, die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his forty-meter-long sword, without any fancy moves, just using the strongest force to slash down.</p><p></p><p>Techniques? That's something close-range and long-range casters should consider.</p><p></p><p>He was just brute force now.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike raised a heat wave several meters high.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dozens of the Five Elements Practitioners who failed to dodge were turned into Qi Yuan's sword victims.</p><p></p><p>Level 90 versus level 89, it was a completely different concept.</p><p></p><p>And with Little Jia's support, in the core area, as long as he wasn't surrounded by a few level 90 Five Elements Practitioners, he could kill at will!</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had to pay attention to his consumption.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan charged into the territory where the Five Elements Practitioners were living a good life, swinging his sword wildly.</p><p></p><p>However, except for the first sudden attack, when many Five Elements Practitioners were caught off guard and killed, the killing speed had slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow, at this rate, it might take me half a month to fill up the Five Elements!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I'm so useless, so incompetent!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a distance away from the core area, four pairs of eyes were watching Qi Yuan's battle with the Five Elements Practitioners.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the original trio, there was also a thin-looking man.</p><p></p><p>He watched Qi Yuan slaughter without restraint, effortlessly sensing the Five Elements Qi.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were wide open, and his face was filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The man in red robes smugly extended his palm: "Li Qin, hand over the Water Element Crystal."</p><p></p><p>Li Qin looked pained: "This is too outrageous, why should I?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, the man in red had told him that the new Clothing Sect Master was able to comprehend the Water Element Qi almost instantly, one after another.</p><p></p><p>He naturally didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>The man in red took the opportunity to make a bet with him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think twice and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it turned out to be true.</p><p></p><p>The man in red obtained the Water Element Crystal, feeling extremely smug.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tang Yan was staring intently at Qi Yuan's figure, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Look, he has also comprehended the Earth Element Qi, no, even the Fire Element Qi!"</p><p></p><p>The others looked over and saw Qi Yuan, after killing the Water Practitioners, charging towards the remaining four Elements.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a large amount of embarrassing Five Elements Qi permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>The four people present were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Tang Yan had thought that the Clothing Sect Master was only of the highest talent in the Water Element.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, this is... the top talent in all five elements.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the man in red couldn't help but blurt out: "Doesn't that mean he might be able to complete the Five Elements in less than a month?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the man in red's face turned a bit red.</p><p></p><p>He had just been talking behind the Clothing Sect Master's back, saying that he was arrogant and unrealistic, dreaming of completing the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, it was not a dream, but a reality.</p><p></p><p>And it might only take one or two months for the Clothing Sect Master to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan gritted his teeth, and the usually refined him had lost his composure: "Mastering the Five Elements Forbidden Land? </p><p></p><p>This talent, this talent..."</p><p></p><p>He said, and suddenly burst into tears with joy: "Could it be that the heavens have taken pity on us."</p><p></p><p>The power of the Outer Demons was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Even the gods in their prime were defeated by the Outer Demons.</p><p></p><p>Later, in the Forbidden Land, there were also powerful experts who reached the end of their lifespan and charged into the Abyss, trying to uncover the truth about the Outer Demons.</p><p></p><p>But most of them... returned empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Outer Demons, they couldn't even defeat the first Demonic Calamity, the former Heavenly God Golden Armor.</p><p></p><p>The Outer Demons seemed to have an immortal body, and they couldn't be killed!</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't even defeat the Demonic Calamity, how could they hope to defeat the Outer Demons?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

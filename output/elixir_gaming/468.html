        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This time, Ghost Dominion Heaven could be said to have lost both the wife and the troops.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sword failed to ambush successfully, the Black Demon Ancestor Blood disappeared without a trace, and even...the Root Demon Blood was taken away.</p><p></p><p>After that mysterious blood-armored figure vanished from the Outer Heaven,</p><p></p><p>The great battle here also came to an abrupt end, with no follow-up. Continuing to fight further would have been meaningless.</p><p></p><p>When Black Sword and Purple Origin Ancestor returned to the Demon Gate, an explosive piece of news spread throughout the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Hun Heaven...betrayed the Black Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"Yin Hun Heaven announced its separation from the Black Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"The heavens...are about to change!"</p><p></p><p>This news caused huge waves and endless chaos.</p><p></p><p>Within the Demon Gate, many conflicts also erupted due to this turmoil, with quite a few cultivators dying in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the chaos at the Demon Gate, the Ghost Gate was terrifyingly quiet.</p><p></p><p>Looking up in the majestic great hall, it seemed to be a deep starry sky, with countless stars adorning it, the Milky Way deep and magnificent.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Ghost Sin Venerable and Ghost Origin Venerable were terrifyingly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Emperor Hall's envoy...is seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>This time, the biggest reason for the failure of their plan was the sudden appearance of the Human Emperor Hall's envoy.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Root Demon Blood go to him!"</p><p></p><p>"Why was the Banner Master's ultimate killing move useless against him!"</p><p></p><p>These two questions kept lingering in the minds of Ghost Sin and Ghost Origin Venerable, very perplexing.</p><p></p><p>The Root Demon Blood was mysterious and unpredictable, born from the Root Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>This kind of blood had no self-awareness at all, and was an extremely ominous thing.</p><p></p><p>But after the Five Ancestors used it on Black Sword, it unexpectedly turned around and flew towards that Human Emperor Hall envoy.</p><p></p><p>"Could this Root Demon Blood be his son?" Ghost Sin Venerable said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"He must have a supreme treasure that changed the direction of the Root Demon Blood, taking it for himself," Ghost Origin Venerable spoke, with a look of wariness on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Root Demon Blood is in his hands, we need to be careful and cautious!" A great ultimate reason expert spoke, clearly somewhat afraid of the Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, he doesn't have the Banner Master's ultimate killing move. Even with the Root Demon Blood, he can't harm us.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his unpredictable actions, being so slippery, I would have killed him with one slap!" Ghost Sin Venerable was very angry when mentioning the Human Emperor Hall envoy.</p><p></p><p>A mere alternative Yang Spirit, Ghost Sin Venerable could kill him with one slap.</p><p></p><p>If that Human Emperor Hall envoy dared to confront him head-on, there would be no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he still couldn't understand or comprehend the other party's sudden disappearance technique.</p><p></p><p>"He could even avoid the Banner Master's ultimate killing move, it seems...he's not simple.</p><p></p><p>With the Lin Ya Molt approaching, his sudden appearance targeting our Ghost Dominion Heaven is something we must guard against!" A great ultimate reason expert spoke, his gaze deep.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, like a buzzing fly, annoying!" Ghost Sin Venerable was irritated that he couldn't detain the Human Emperor Hall envoy.</p><p></p><p>With his words, countless flying flies throughout the Ghost Gate suddenly had a "Sin" character appear on their heads, instantly shattering and perishing.</p><p></p><p>And Ghost Dominion Heaven cultivators with partial fly bloodlines also had a "Sin" character appear on their faces, dying instantly.</p><p></p><p>When a great ultimate reason expert gets angry, corpses are strewn for thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>This caused a commotion within the Ghost Gate.</p><p></p><p>The other great ultimate reason experts were unsurprised by this.</p><p></p><p>"Why get angry at a fly? Although the Human Emperor Hall envoy's methods are a bit strange, his strength...is low, at most able to harm a minor ultimate reason expert.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the Yang Spirit Venerables of the Ghost Gate should all be a bit careful. If you encounter the Human Emperor Hall envoy, don't engage in prolonged battle, just leave directly." A great ultimate reason expert spoke, his voice vast.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary Yang Spirit Venerables below all nodded, not really taking the Human Emperor Hall envoy seriously.</p><p></p><p>With so many Yang Spirit Venerables gathered at the Ghost Gate, that Human Emperor Hall envoy couldn't make any waves.</p><p></p><p>That Human Emperor Hall envoy was just all talk, wanting their Ten Thousand Soul Banners - this was seeking death.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't run away quickly, they could have easily killed him!</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Scorching hot, carrying heat waves.</p><p></p><p>"Space confinement, the Heaven-Severing Great Formation, even the Banner Master's ultimate killing move were all useless against him?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was a Yang Spirit Venerable from the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Useless!" Ghost Sin Venerable nodded.</p><p></p><p>On the Outer Heaven battlefield, they had set up various methods to confine space, including formations.</p><p></p><p>Even when the Banner Master's ultimate killing move fell on that person, he could easily leave.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there's no way to trap him for now." The Yang Spirit from Tai Huang Palace spoke, then smiled and said, "After some time, when the Palace Master inspects the myriad heavens, he...will have nowhere to hide, and you can then kill him!"</p><p></p><p>In their view, the Human Emperor Hall envoy was weak in strength but slippery. If they could find his hiding place and expose him to the light of day, he would have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yang Spirit Venerables of Ghost Dominion Heaven were all reassured.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ghost Sin Venerable suddenly thought of something and transmitted: "May I ask the Emissary, besides the Five Ancestors...who else are traitors in the Black Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Although the other party was not a great ultimate reason expert, Ghost Sin Venerable still respectfully called him Emissary.</p><p></p><p>After all, Tai Huang Palace was in charge of the Lin Ya Molt. If he offended Tai Huang Palace, they had ways to induce his Root Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Venerable from Tai Huang Palace's gaze narrowed, and he shook his head: "I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a strange place.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt refreshed.</p><p></p><p>"This time I really made a fortune!"</p><p></p><p>"So much Black Demon Ancestor Blood, a full two thousand drops..."</p><p></p><p>"No, wasn't it ten thousand drops?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn Ghost Dominion Heaven, withholding my Black Demon Ancestor Blood, actually withholding 8,000 drops, do they have no humanity!" Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>If it were ten thousand drops of Black Demon Ancestor Blood, he could use it to cultivate and enter the fourteenth level of the Ancestor Blood Scripture within a year.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only enter the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the more you understand an evil person, the more you discover their evil. What you understood before was just the tip of the iceberg."</p><p></p><p>"At first, I just thought he had stolen my family's Human Emperor Banner, but now...he's even withholding my hard-earned Black Demon Ancestor Blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Unforgivable!"</p><p></p><p>"With two crimes, even if he's my true love, I must put righteousness before family!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already planned that once the Ancestor Blood Scripture reached the thirteenth level, he would continue to execute his great plan.</p><p></p><p>At the twelfth level, he was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Sneaking into the Ghost Gate, he would be discovered immediately, unable to judge the thief before having to flee back.</p><p></p><p>But if his Ancestor Blood Scripture reached the thirteenth level, it would be completely different.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation would be comparable to a great ultimate reason expert.</p><p></p><p>Then he could sneak into the Ghost Gate, secretly judge the thief, and take back the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>Even if discovered, he could easily leave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always had a plan when doing things, strictly following the plan as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan turned his gaze to the Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>[Root Demon Blood, born from the Root Demon Calamity, related to the special lifeform Root Demon Ancestor.]</p><p></p><p>"Root Demon Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this term, Qi Yuan's heart inexplicably trembled, as if sensing an unknown great terror.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...a being at the third level of Yang Spirit, or even higher?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Is the reason the Root Demon Blood came towards me related to my innate divine ability Void Ruler Heart Demon Attraction?"</p><p></p><p>When arching the stars, Qi Yuan had once entered the Root Demon Sea with East Monarch.</p><p></p><p>To East Monarch's surprise, the terrifying Root Demon Sea was completely harmless to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew it was because of his innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>His innate divine ability, Void Ruler Heart Demon Attraction, had some common origin with Root Demons, and could resist the invasion of Root Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Void Ruler Heart Demon Attraction, comprehended in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tracing its origin, it's related to the Destiny Stone and Shang Yan.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Destiny Stone also has some connection to that Root Demon Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>If the Destiny Stone were ordinary, how could it have caused White Marsh to fall?</p><p></p><p>White Marsh had the Great Sun Golden Lotus left by the Great Sun Light Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, do you have consciousness? Why are you sleeping on me?" Qi Yuan stared at the Root Demon Blood and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Root Demon Blood had no reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you probably don't have consciousness, because you don't have a brain." Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then separated the Root Demon Blood and put it in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan had a strange idea.</p><p></p><p>"If I planted the Root Demon Blood in the ground, would I harvest a Root Demon Ancestor in autumn?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan was just thinking.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had to hurry back to the Demon Gate to refine the Human Emperor Banner, cultivate the Ancestor Blood Scripture, and increase his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Spring doesn't leave, autumn doesn't come.</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, Purple Origin Xiao Lu lifted her skirt, revealing a small section of porcelain-white ankle. Her young and adorable face bore an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>She secretly glanced at Blood Robe, that handsome and demonic face making her breathing slightly rapid.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths of time passed, and Qi Yuan, who had been meditating with closed eyes, opened his eyes. A golden light flashed in his eyes, which he quickly covered with black.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Lu, what brings you here?" Qi Yuan looked at Purple Origin Xiao Lu with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Purple Origin Xiao Lu stood with her legs tightly together, suddenly stuttering. For some reason, facing the current Blood Robe senior brother, she felt an inexplicable closeness.</p><p></p><p>If she had felt close before, it was more about being attracted by his appearance, craving his body.</p><p></p><p>Now it was completely different, as if even her soul wanted to be close, wanted to merge into one, to be kneaded into his body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to notice Purple Origin Xiao Lu's abnormality, and he immediately dyed his blood.</p><p></p><p>He guessed in his heart, could it be that the thirteenth level of the Ancestor Blood Scripture could even affect people in the Black Demon Abyss? After dyeing was complete, Purple Origin Xiao Lu felt that suffocating feeling dissipate somewhat. She looked at Qi Yuan, blinking her eyes, and stammered: "This is...new ancestor blood spirit water...I collected..."</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Lu had been collecting ancestor blood spirit water for Qi Yuan, which were intelligent micro-detection insects.</p><p></p><p>Through the intelligent micro-detection insects, Qi Yuan could find the whereabouts of ancestor blood.</p><p></p><p>"Good." Qi Yuan happily accepted the ancestor blood spirit water.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Ancestor Blood had just run out, and maybe this ancestor blood spirit water would give him new discoveries.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Lu, this is the final payment!" Qi Yuan said, taking out a spirit jade and handing it to Purple Origin Xiao Lu.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Purple Origin Xiao Lu was slightly stunned, then her eyes lit up as she looked at the spirit jade Qi Yuan gave her.</p><p></p><p>This was...spirit jade that Blood Robe senior brother had touched. Remembering the strange feeling that had suddenly appeared earlier, she excitedly grasped the spirit jade in her palm.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not stingy, here's a Yang Spirit gift for you too." Qi Yuan took out a Yang Spirit gift and gave it to Purple Origin Xiao Lu.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor blood spirit water Purple Origin Xiao Lu provided him had brought him over a thousand drops of Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could afford to give a Yang Spirit gift.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant starlight burst forth in Purple Origin Xiao Lu's pupils, her eyes misty with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe senior brother, wuwu...you know, Xiao Lu has never had a father since childhood..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Purple Origin Xiao Lu's eyes watery and pitiful,</p><p></p><p>"Can you be my daddy?"</p><p></p><p>"Pff..." Qi Yuan looked at Purple Origin Xiao Lu's petite and delicate figure, "You...play really wild!"</p><p></p><p>He suspected there was a problem with the Ancestor Blood Scripture he was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>He needed to hurry and dye all his blood.</p><p></p><p>He had just come of age and didn't want to have a bunch of offspring at such a young age.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Lu was a bit disappointed, clutching the hem of her clothes without speaking further.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan suddenly thought of something and asked: "Did Purple Origin Ancestor have a father from childhood?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Purple Origin Xiao Lu's small mouth rounded slightly, as if thinking of something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Abyss Master have a father from childhood?" Qi Yuan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Lu's face flushed red: "No...don't know."</p><p></p><p>She was a bit scared.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of hearing some terrifying news.</p><p></p><p>She looked pitiful, really wanting Blood Robe to stop talking. She was scared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Purple Origin Xiao Lu seemingly trembling, Qi Yuan smiled: "During my closed-door cultivation, did anything major happen at the Ghost Gate?"</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Lu finally breathed a sigh of relief and answered seriously: "Yin Hun Heaven rebelled from the Black Demon Abyss, there were quite a few battles, and many cultivators died in battle."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Purple Origin Xiao Lu's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>For those in the vortex with vested interests in this matter, it was a mountain, heart-stopping.</p><p></p><p>But on the scale of the river of time, it might just be a few strokes in the history books.</p><p></p><p>"The current Black Demon Abyss is in a state of panic, because...besides Yin Hun Heaven, there may be others lurking in the dark, possibly turning against us at any time." Purple Origin Xiao Lu said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples of Yin Hun Heaven may not even know about the rebellion.</p><p></p><p>They may have just been drinking with fellow Daoists from the Black Demon Abyss, only to learn that Yin Hun Heaven had rebelled from the Black Demon Abyss, and they had become abandoned pawns with a miserable fate.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the atmosphere in the cultivation world is too bad. Where's the trust between people?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but lament.</p><p></p><p>Who the traitors were, Qi Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>If Purple Origin Ancestor rebelled from the Black Demon Abyss, he would follow.</p><p></p><p>If other heavens rebelled, he would watch the show. It had no impact on him.</p><p></p><p>When he discovered that Wind Decay Venerable was an undercover agent, for Qi Yuan, it just meant knowing one more undercover agent, with no effect on his actions.</p><p></p><p>He only needed</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To implement his grand plan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked Zi Yuan Xiao Lu a few more questions, and then Zi Yuan Xiao Lu bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>After leaving, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu's face turned bright red, and she shyly stomped her foot: "How could I say such things?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within the Ghost Barrier, vast and boundless. </p><p></p><p>The place guarded by the Solar Divine Lord was even more of an unknown realm, hidden in darkness.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a cave dwelling, Divine Lord Hui Zeng had set out a banquet, with various spiritual medicines, spiritual fruits, and soul-consuming smoke made from cultivators' divine souls.</p><p></p><p>When lit and inhaled, it could make one feel carefree and happy.</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord Feng Shuai took a deep breath, his eyes showing satisfaction: "As expected of soul-consuming smoke, it lives up to its name."</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord Hui Zeng's eyes revealed pride: "If my friend likes it, I'll gift you these ten sticks of smoke."</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, friend." Feng Shuai accepted the soul-consuming smoke.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the Yin Soul Heaven had rebelled against the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Five Patriarchs returned to preside over Yin Soul Heaven, while he was dispatched to Ghost Dominion Heaven to liaise with the cultivators there.</p><p></p><p>He visited the various Solar Divine Lords of Ghost Dominion Heaven one by one, building relationships.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of you, there is actually an insignificant amusing matter," Feng Shuai thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"Back at the Demon Barrier, Blood Robe came to find me, saying he would come to kill you in a month."</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai told the story of Blood Robe sending eggs and discovering he was an undercover agent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hui Zeng laughed disdainfully: "Mere juniors who don't know how to respect their elders. When the Demon Barrier shatters, it will be the day of his demise!"</p><p></p><p>The two laughed heartily as they spoke.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Hui Zeng's expression suddenly changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, why... do I have a sense of unease?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai also narrowed his eyes, suddenly becoming alert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, abruptly, everything in their vision turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>The two looked up and saw not far away, a blood-armored giant holding a demonic blood sword, coldly looking at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>The blood armor had intricate and exquisite patterns that would captivate anyone who looked at it.</p><p></p><p>A hoarse and cold voice came at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Not only stealing my Human Emperor Banner, but also secretly taking drugs. Indeed, you cultivators of Ghost Dominion Heaven are rotten to the core!"</p><p></p><p>Hui Zeng's eyes widened, feeling an intense sense of danger: "Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace! How are you here?!"</p><p></p><p>His heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>This was the Ghost Barrier, with defense lines personally constructed by Great Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>How could the Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace secretly infiltrate?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just an Alternate Solar Immortal, not even at the level of Ultimate Reason?</p><p></p><p>"As they say, the light of justice illuminates the earth, omnipresent. Wherever there is evil, there I am!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan in his blood armor was like a death god walking out of hell, reaping the evil in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the Human Emperor Banner, and I'll leave your corpse intact."</p><p></p><p>As the sword in his hand swung, Hui Zeng and Feng Shuai immediately felt an extremely sharp sword intent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if their bodies and divine souls were about to be cut by this sword.</p><p></p><p>The two Divine Lords wanted to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't dare make any moves.</p><p></p><p>They had a feeling that before they could escape, the Emissary's sword would reap them.</p><p></p><p>The two Divine Lords' scalps tingled.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't expected the Emissary to infiltrate, nor had they imagined the Emissary would be even stronger than they thought.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Great Ultimate Reason held a meeting, mentioning that although the Emissary was strong, his strength was limited, and if encountered, they should just run away.</p><p></p><p>But today when they met him.</p><p></p><p>This sense of oppression was like encountering Great Ultimate Reason himself.</p><p></p><p>When Great Ultimate Reason dealt with Solar Immortals at their Heavenly Rank level, they couldn't even escape.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, this wasn't just an Alternate Solar Immortal, this was clearly Great Ultimate Reason! He couldn't believe the Emissary had advanced from Alternate Solar Immortal to Great Ultimate Reason in just a month.</p><p></p><p>It was too unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>Those ancestors were too useless, they couldn't even figure out the enemy's cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>The two were in a state of confusion, trying to find a way out of this predicament.</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai thought of something and hurriedly said: "Senior, I'm not from Ghost Dominion Heaven, I don't have the Human Emperor Banner, I'm just here as a guest!"</p><p></p><p>Better you die than me.</p><p></p><p>If Hui Zeng was killed, he would live, and the cultivators of Ghost Dominion Heaven wouldn't do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>In the face of life and death, their previous friendship meant nothing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Feng Shuai: "You can't leave."</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai's body trembled involuntarily, his expression mournful.</p><p></p><p>"Actually... I know you," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Feng Shuai hurriedly looked at Qi Yuan, his face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>Many faces flashed through his mind as he tried to figure out the identity of the Emissary.</p><p></p><p>If it was an acquaintance, there might still be a chance for him to survive.</p><p></p><p>"You are...?" Feng Shuai asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Who I am is not important. What's important is you - you are my pure love!" Qi Yuan said seriously, his voice cold and emotionless.</p><p></p><p>"Pure love?" Feng Shuai was stunned, not understanding the meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Pure love is what one's heart yearns for in youth, but dares not touch, fearing to disturb that beauty..." Qi Yuan explained the concept of "pure love" from the Blue Star to Feng Shuai.</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai blinked.</p><p></p><p>The other... liked him?</p><p></p><p>The male Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace liked him??</p><p></p><p>It seemed not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"I was born with the ability to love, so... you are my pure love."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the blood-colored sword, his gaze cold yet distinguished.</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai finally realized something was wrong - the other was toying with him.</p><p></p><p>"Pure love, after you die, I will take good care of your property.</p><p></p><p>You don't need to worry about them, you can die in peace.</p><p></p><p>I won't waste your bones and ashes either."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He felt more and more moved as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>He felt he was truly a considerate and thoughtful good person.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand trembled, and the world before his eyes turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>"Let's... die together!"</p><p></p><p>Having cultivated the Ancestral Blood Scripture to the thirteenth level, with the cultivation of Ten Thousand Dao Martial God reaching the realm of Great Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan was no longer his former self.</p><p></p><p>He could now wreak havoc in the Ghost Barrier.</p><p></p><p>A huge sword slashed down, without any fancy moves.</p><p></p><p>Feng Shuai and Hui Zeng had no ability to resist this dazzling sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Even if they manifested their Dharma bodies, they were as fragile as tofu under this strike.</p><p></p><p>One strike from Great Ultimate Reason, a powerful sword easily slew the two Solar Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Qi Yuan kept his promise.</p><p></p><p>He took the Ten Thousand Soul Banner into his possession.</p><p></p><p>He also treated Feng Shuai's property well.</p><p></p><p>His ashes were thrown into the underworld as energy needed for resurrection.</p><p></p><p>"Pure love, rest in peace. I know you two are lonely, but don't worry... I was born with the ability to love, loving everyone I see. Soon there will be more pure loves to accompany you."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's low voice sounded, angry roars and confused voices came one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>"How did you get in?"</p><p></p><p>"He killed Hui Zeng and Feng Shuai... hiss hiss hiss...!" A Solar Divine Lord drew in ten thousand sharp breaths at once.</p><p></p><p>Why so many? Because Solar Immortals breathe quickly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, over twenty Solar Divine Lords surrounded him, including three Great Ultimate Reasons. They looked at Qi Yuan with shock and confusion on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these old men and women, his originally cold eyes revealing a kind and gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Old age, rich."</p><p></p><p>"Don't like bathing."</p><p></p><p>Didn't this perfectly match his pure love handbook?</p><p></p><p>"I think... I've fallen in love with you all, pure loves!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the blood-colored sword, loving one person with each step.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath's time, he had fallen in love with twenty-seven people, gaining twenty-seven pure loves.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of being born with the ability to love.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, those Solar Divine Lords all had expressions of surprise or anger.</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop talking nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace, don't leave today. Come, capture him!"</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord Ghost Sin spoke with anger in his voice.</p><p></p><p>Last time the Emissary had ruined his plans.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't taken the Emissary seriously, but who knew that after not seeing him for a month, the Emissary would come killing, even secretly slaying a Solar Immortal of Ghost Dominion Heaven. How could he not be angry?</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>With Ghost Sin's angry roar, the more than twenty Solar Immortals present all attacked.</p><p></p><p>Endless attacks came.</p><p></p><p>A smile flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He held his sword, like a wolf among sheep.</p><p></p><p>"You really love me so much, are you giving me a massage?"</p><p></p><p>The attacks of ordinary Solar Immortals, falling on Qi Yuan's body, would dissipate without needing to be blocked.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary Great Ultimate Reason couldn't harm ordinary Great Ultimate Reason, let alone... Heavenly Rank Solar Immortals.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had an invincible posture.</p><p></p><p>After all, other Solar Immortals wouldn't dare to charge directly into the enemy's core area like him. If offensive Primal Artifacts were used, even Great Ultimate Reason would be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan wasn't afraid, he could enter his Purple Palace and leave at any time.</p><p></p><p>So, he had nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>"You... reached Great Ultimate Reason?" Ghost Sin's eyes widened, his face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a month, how had he reached Great Ultimate Reason?</p><p></p><p>Then, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, you all run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>If the opponent was an ordinary Solar Immortal, that would be fine.</p><p></p><p>They could surround and attack.</p><p></p><p>But the opponent had stepped into Great Ultimate Reason, they simply couldn't harm the Emissary.</p><p></p><p>Those ordinary Solar Immortals staying here, weren't they just seeking death?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other Solar Divine Lords didn't hesitate at all and scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan looked disappointed: "Am I such an ugly person? Why do you all run so fast when you see me?"</p><p></p><p>He held his sword and slashed towards the nearest few Solar Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three Great Ultimate Reasons were extremely anxious and all attacked Qi Yuan, wanting to entangle him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were too far away.</p><p></p><p>By the time they got close to Qi Yuan, another two unfortunate Solar Divine Lords had been instantly killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A Great Ultimate Reason killing ordinary Solar Immortals was as simple as an eagle killing chicks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan finally felt he had some confidence and support.</p><p></p><p>After taking the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, Qi Yuan looked at the three Great Ultimate Reasons attacking him, his expression cold.</p><p></p><p>"It's because of you that I couldn't properly look after the pure loves' inheritances, damn it!"</p><p></p><p>He held his sword and became entangled with the three Great Ultimate Reasons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan didn't want to be entangled, he just wanted to kill more pure loves.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, with three Great Ultimate Reasons surrounding him, he could only fight back.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see where his current limit was!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin was furious and extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>Because, before the Ling Ya Molt even began, Ghost Dominion Heaven had already lost six Solar Divine Lords! This was terrifying! And what was even more frightening was that their Ghost Dominion Heaven simply had no way to deal with the Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't kill him, couldn't keep him, and could only passively take a beating.</p><p></p><p>"Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace... we have no grudges, why are you making things difficult for our Ghost Dominion Heaven? Could it be that you really think our Ghost Dominion Heaven is a soft persimmon?" Ghost Sin shouted while attacking.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he wanted to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>Because Ghost Dominion Heaven currently had no ability to slay the Emissary, and couldn't even seal or restrain him.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't treat you as soft persimmons, I treated you as my dearest and most beloved pure loves! But what happened? You became complacent because of my love and stole my Human Emperor Banner! If you want me to stop bothering you, it's simple - hand over all the Human Emperor Banners!" Qi Yuan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ghost Sin was furious: "Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Soul Banner was the foundation of Ghost Dominion Heaven, the thing these Solar Immortals relied on for their existence, how could they give it up?</p><p></p><p>"In that case, then all of you can die!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blood armor swung its sword, like a demon god, constantly slaughtering.</p><p></p><p>This overwhelming momentum made everyone shudder.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the Ghost Barrier trembled in fear, even the Solar Divine Lords were fleeing.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that even those in the Demon Barrier could feel this terrifying battle.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, an extremely terrifying aura suddenly spread.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Master of Ghost Dominion Heaven finally couldn't sit still, and the offensive Primal Artifact struck again, the Ultimate Reason killing move's momentum was shocking!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a reluctant smile appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "My dear pure loves, I know you miss me. Don't worry, it won't be long before I come to see you again!"</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Reason killing move descended.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the Ghost Barrier, many Solar Divine Lords were shaken! The faces of the three Great Ultimate Reasons were particularly ugly, their expressions solemn.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: How strange, I clearly posted the recommendation ticket red envelope in the last chapter to compensate you all, but why was it discovered by bots after just a few minutes? It was clearly an in-chapter red envelope that required subscription to see, how did they discover it?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

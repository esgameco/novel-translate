        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Supreme One was wrapped in a white coat, her eyes deep and inscrutable, always making it difficult for others to discern her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the last stronghold of the White Emperor Palace on Wanzhang Plain had shrunk into a small cluster.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand supreme beings, plus over a hundred great supreme beings, had surrounded and besieged the stronghold. </p><p></p><p>Now, with the entrance to the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons opened, Shang Yanran's plan was more than halfway complete.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the stronghold, where the Golden Lotus of the Great Sun was emitting a blazing white aura, and a greedy look flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It... will be mine, and no one can stop me!"</p><p></p><p>After scheming for so many years, she was finally this close to it for the first time! The Golden Lotus of the Great Sun, the relic of the Great Sun Buddha's nirvana - such a supreme treasure was now tarnished, treated as a heartless lotus.</p><p></p><p>In her hands, this treasure would be able to unleash its most useful value.</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm, as well as the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons that she had polluted, would become her true paradise.</p><p></p><p>And she would be able to ascend.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme One, when shall we launch the final attack?" A great supreme being standing beside her asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme One had surrounded but not attacked for twenty years, and he did not understand why she would do this.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons opened, the most urgent task should be to completely annihilate the remnants of the White Emperor Palace and bring the Flowing Wind Realm fully under control.</p><p></p><p>"We'll begin the final attack once we capture the Blood Lord," the Supreme One had her own plans.</p><p></p><p>Baize... that is, the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>He had fallen into the cycle of endless rebirths, and no longer possessed the immense power of the past.</p><p></p><p>But... it wouldn't be so easy for her to defeat him completely.</p><p></p><p>Her greatest skill had never been cultivation or the Dao, but manipulating people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>So even though the Buddha of the past was far stronger than her, wasn't he still manipulated by her and reduced to a great demon?</p><p></p><p>This also created the demonic calamity of this world.</p><p></p><p>"The Cat Demon Woman Great Supreme Being... should be back soon." This human great supreme being was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>He would soon witness a momentous occasion.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of this, he also hesitated: "What if the Blood Lord is too powerful, or has helpers, and the Cat Demon Woman Great Supreme Being is unable to capture him?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong he is, he's still just a great supreme being.</p><p></p><p>How many helpers could he have?</p><p></p><p>Even if the Cat Demon Woman can't capture him and he escapes, he'll still come here.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary... has always been here."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was also quite interested in the Blood Lord, though not as much as in Baize.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't smell any trace of... divine aura on the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>So, he wasn't worth worrying about.</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented or brilliant, if one is not divine, they are nothing more than... a plaything.</p><p></p><p>Even the divine Buddha wasn't played like a puppet in her hands?</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Lord, he was just an unexpected pawn.</p><p></p><p>"Baize, are you still unwilling to see me?" At this moment, a smile flashed in Shang Yanran's eyes, and her slightly lonely voice transmitted into the last stronghold of the White Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>She began her performance.</p><p></p><p>Baize's figure appeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Shang Yanran, his eyes filled with compassion: "Yanran, the sea of suffering is boundless, turn back to the shore, don't continue down this wrong path."</p><p></p><p>"What wrong have I done?" Shang Yanran wore a pitiful expression, "All I do is for the entire Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Do you want to watch the entire Flowing Wind Realm ravaged by demonic calamity and ultimately sink into ruin?"</p><p></p><p>Baize sighed helplessly: "That's why the Southern Land... is the best solution."</p><p></p><p>Preventing cultivators from dying a natural death would eliminate the demonic calamity.</p><p></p><p>It was regrettable, but there was no better way.</p><p></p><p>"Now... isn't there a better way?" Shang Yanran looked at Baize, her eyes showing a hint of sternness, "The reincarnations of the Great Demon and Demon Woman have been found, as long as..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Shang Yanran, stop spreading lies, your collusion with the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons and bringing war is already a great crime!" One of the supreme beings among the Thirteen Northern Demon Beasts spoke up, his eyes filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be heartbroken to see his former senior sister become like this?</p><p></p><p>"Master's kindness to me is as heavy as a mountain, but he is after all concerned with the life and death of this realm, we should prioritize all living beings!</p><p></p><p>If Master perishes, I will build a temple for him, and every night I will..."</p><p></p><p>Before Shang Yanran could finish speaking, suddenly a terrified voice came.</p><p></p><p>A great supreme being, with an expression of utter terror on his face, flew towards Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>"It's terrible, it's terrible, they're attacking!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a look of surprise flashed in Shang Yanran's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Baize and slowly said: "Husband, we must prioritize all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>Back then, for the sake of all living beings, the Buddha killed the demon woman who had fallen with him, that is, her.</p><p></p><p>Now, Shang Yanran was very confident that Baize would surely kill the Blood Lord for the sake of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>In Baize's eyes, in Buddha's eyes, there had only ever been all living beings, where could there be room for her, a demon woman?</p><p></p><p>And where could there be room for the Blood Lord, a great demon?</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's figure dissipated and left this place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the stronghold, Baize's eyes were deep, his thoughts unknown.</p><p></p><p>The member of the Thirteen Northern Demon Beasts who had just cursed the Supreme One also had a puzzled expression: "They've broken through? Could it be... Master has come?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, he became somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>A reunion with an old friend was ultimately a joyous thing in this world.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao held a long sword, her black dress accentuating her graceful figure. Her face seemed to have light makeup, and the half of her face that was visible was already otherworldly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>An aura of greed, arrogance, and lust emanated from the sword. In Ning Tao's cold eyes, a trace of fear was hidden: "I want... to go out and meet him."</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat afraid to meet him in this state.</p><p></p><p>"You can't, if you go out, the Supreme One will certainly not let you go!</p><p></p><p>If Master comes here and you are captured by the Supreme One... then..." Baize trailed off.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao gripped her sword tightly: "I'll just take a look."</p><p></p><p>She wasn't being willful, she just wanted to take a look.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seated on the throne, Qi Yuan's eyes showed a somewhat relaxed expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's still better to bring people and steamroll through, clearing monsters alone is too slow."</p><p></p><p>If it were just him alone, how long would it take to clear out the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons?</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons here were not like the old men in the Absolute Ground, nor were they like the supreme beings of the Flowing Wind Realm who could easily be decided life or death with his Origin Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand demon race supreme beings, to be honest, could easily overwhelm Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Blood Lord, the Song Regiment has cleared the forward stronghold, killing thirty-seven enemies!" Liu Gaoda, the commander of the Song Regiment, wore a blood-red robe and had a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>The stronghold assigned to him this time had too few supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>It was easily destroyed in one round.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." Qi Yuan casually commented.</p><p></p><p>Liu Gaoda, despite being a supreme being, was willing to lower himself. He had a good relationship with Yuan Qi, and the name Song Regiment was also related to Yuan Qi's brother.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of something and asked: "How long until we can push into Wanzhang Plain?"</p><p></p><p>The army had been advancing continuously, killing all enemies encountered who resisted.</p><p></p><p>"About half an hour," Chen Huan replied with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>For this great battle, he was the commander-in-chief, coordinating all combat operations.</p><p></p><p>Commanding an army of 100,000, all supreme beings, he could be said to be in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Clearing most of the big instance in less than a day, this is the power of the masses," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>More people means more power.</p><p></p><p>More people is better.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to advance, kill all enemies encountered!"</p><p></p><p>As the army advanced, the game was also approaching its end, and Qi Yuan's heart was exceptionally calm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Who has broken through?" Shang Yanran's face was cold as she looked at the dozen or so supreme beings with panicked expressions in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Blood Lord, he led a large army and destroyed the stronghold in front of me. There were too many of them, all wearing red robes. If I hadn't been far away, I might have died there!" A supreme being said with a terrified expression.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings also nodded quickly: "Yes, it's the Blood Lord's army!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord? An army?" Shang Yanran's face showed a surprised expression, "How many do they have?"</p><p></p><p>"There are a thousand supreme beings!" One supreme being quickly answered.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's clearly three thousand!"</p><p></p><p>"It's five thousand!"</p><p></p><p>"You're all wrong, it's clearly ten thousand!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, where would the Flowing Wind Realm have so many supreme beings?"</p><p></p><p>Arguments broke out in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>There were various claims about the size of the Blood Lord's army.</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Shang Yanran's eyes: "It seems the Blood Lord has unified the Flowing Wind Realm, he does have some capability.</p><p></p><p>Too bad, with ten thousand demon race supreme beings here, their action is merely coming to die!"</p><p></p><p>The demon race supreme beings present also had bright smiles in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Let him take the outer strongholds as he pleases. When he reaches Wanzhang Plain, it will be his death!" Shang Yanran was extremely confident.</p><p></p><p>The world level of the Flowing Wind Realm was much smaller than that of the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>In Shang Yanran's plan, after obtaining the Golden Lotus of the Great Sun, the first realm to be devoured would be the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm would become her paradise.</p><p></p><p>"I will lead five thousand supreme beings to capture them!" A demon race great supreme being spoke up, his face full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran hesitated for a moment, then finally said: "Very well, capture the Blood Lord alive, Great Supreme Being Hongniu."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave it to you then."</p><p></p><p>Five thousand supreme beings were enough to sweep through the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>The great demon supreme being nodded: "I will definitely complete the mission!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the Liufeng Realm were all treasures.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was rubbing his hands together, just waiting to capture the Blood Lord in one fell swoop and achieve great merit.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand supreme beings can be killed in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"Come, gather the great army!" The great supreme being Hongniu, carrying Shang Yanran's orders, prepared to mobilize the army to meet the Blood Lord in battle.</p><p></p><p>"Great Supreme Being Hongniu, hastily gathering five thousand supreme beings will likely take half a day," that supreme being replied.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a clash of supreme being armies. It couldn't be like ordinary supreme beings, where you just shout once and go straight into battle.</p><p></p><p>How could scattered supreme beings contend with organized supreme beings?</p><p></p><p>"Half a day?" Hearing this, Great Supreme Being Hongniu nodded, "I'll go warm up a cup of wine to drink. When I finish drinking, we'll go sweep through the Liufeng Realm. </p><p></p><p>It's really boring to just surround them here without attacking."</p><p></p><p>Great Supreme Being Hongniu disappeared, delegating tasks to some subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, he and some familiar great supreme beings huddled together to drink.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner for the rest of the excerpt...]</p>

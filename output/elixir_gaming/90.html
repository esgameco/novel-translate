        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure transformed into a stream of light and headed deeper into the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the spiritual energy flowed like a stream, continuously flowing over the crystal coffin.</p><p></p><p>Vines that seemed to come from nowhere were swaying, as if slowly pulling the crystal coffin away from this place.</p><p></p><p>Lying inside the crystal coffin was a figure Qi Yuan was all too familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride!</p><p></p><p>After recognizing who was in the crystal coffin, Qi Yuan gripped his kitchen knife, and all his magical power converged to the utmost at this moment.</p><p></p><p>One slash, and the heavens and earth were shaken.</p><p></p><p>This slash was far more powerful than the might of the Brilliant Sword.</p><p></p><p>It directly struck the vines that were trying to lift the crystal coffin away.</p><p></p><p>"Poof." A thread of fresh blood seeped from the corner of Qi Yuan's mouth, but the vines were completely unharmed, and the speed at which they were pulling the crystal coffin away suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>The various emotions in Qi Yuan's eyes completely dissipated, instantly becoming extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>At first, when he saw Little Bride, he was truly delighted, and his mind was momentarily in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Now, having calmed down, he suddenly murmured softly, "Comrades-in-arms!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, he had activated his skill.</p><p></p><p>Comrades-in-arms, as long as he and Little Bride were in the same space.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far apart they were, Little Bride would appear by his side.</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's gaze, the seemingly indestructible vines suddenly snapped.</p><p></p><p>The crystal coffin was opened, and the large red bridal gown, as if imbued with vitality, stepped on the solidified spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>All the vines frantically grew, tightly entangling and dragging Little Bride, as if trying to take her away.</p><p></p><p>But she still walked step by step towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Her footsteps were silent, yet powerful, as if treading on Qi Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The vines broke one by one.</p><p></p><p>The bridal gown was a bit unstable.</p><p></p><p>"Silly Little Bride," Qi Yuan called out softly.</p><p></p><p>He held the kitchen knife and struck with full force, slashing at the vines.</p><p></p><p>The vines remained unmoved, but Qi Yuan continued to hack away.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride's walking was already unsteady and clumsy, and with these vines obstructing her, Qi Yuan knew how difficult each step must be for her.</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife was frantically slashing, and Little Bride was walking step by step towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The fresh blood dripping from the corner of his mouth, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a self-mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>"Your husband is still too weak."</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, she finally appeared by Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a blood-red armor covered Qi Yuan's entire body.</p><p></p><p>Now nearly a hundred meters tall, with blood-red spikes all over him, he looked like a gentle Grim Reaper.</p><p></p><p>The fusion state was instantly released, and Little Bride transformed back into a thin bridal gown, falling into Qi Yuan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>A small wooden plaque fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sleeping Little Bride, a smile unconsciously appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He tightly embraced the familiar icy waist, as if interpreting the "embrace" meaning on the wooden plaque.</p><p></p><p>He softly said, "I thought I might never see you again, and I also thought that when I saw you again, time would have passed, and the world would have changed."</p><p></p><p>"The civil affairs bureau has even closed down, the divorce cooling-off period has passed, and I still haven't seen you, so this marriage can't be divorced."</p><p></p><p>"People say that happiness comes easily and won't be cherished, but I feel that what you long for but can't obtain is indeed desirable, but you, whom I can easily embrace, are even more real."</p><p></p><p>"For me, it's only been a few months since I last saw Little Bride, but how long has it been for her since she last saw me?"</p><p></p><p>When he woke up in the Wangyue Continent, the space beside him was empty.</p><p></p><p>He didn't see Little Bride, and the Comrades-in-arms skill didn't work.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that to see Little Bride again, he would have to at least wait until he became an Yin Deity, able to roam the boundless void and travel through various realms.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he now saw his Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her was easy, and there was no heart-pounding excitement, just simple and straightforward, but Qi Yuan was exceptionally happy.</p><p></p><p>This simple and easily obtained surprise was like the first ray of sunlight in the morning, within reach.</p><p></p><p>He embraced her and quietly watched the sleeping Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>[The sleeping Bride Princess, she is the wife you carried in a grand sedan chair to your home. She may wake up at any moment, or she may be waiting for you to awaken her.]</p><p></p><p>This time, the information he received was quite extensive.</p><p></p><p>"She will wake up," Qi Yuan said, embracing Little Bride, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he murmured inwardly, "Oh no, I've been single for too long, and just seeing Little Bride in a bridal gown makes me feel a bit smitten."</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and decided to put one of his own sets of clothes on Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>After all, someone had seen the living being in the crystal coffin in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to expose Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>"Putting clothes on a bridal gown is quite interesting," he said, glancing at the crystal coffin before leaving the place, carrying the sleeping Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Sunken Coffin Realm!" Kong Fulu and Li Xiang Elder stood on the banks of the Lost Soul River, their eyes filled with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Lost Soul River, if there is no way to enter, even a divine infant could be trapped in it!" Li Xiang was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>The reason he stayed here was twofold: to find Qi Yuan and take him away, and to try to disrupt the old emperor's plot. Otherwise, if the old emperor's plot succeeded, the Divine Light Sect would be in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>He had grown up in the sect, and like the sect master, he viewed the sect as his home.</p><p></p><p>The two stood on the banks of the Lost Soul River, extremely anxious, but they had no solution.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan should also be blocked by this river. If he is unharmed, that would be a blessing."</p><p></p><p>"But where is he now?"</p><p></p><p>The two stood on the banks of the Lost Soul River, thinking of ways to cross it. At the same time, they also activated their Dao techniques, sending out several Dao law paper cranes to search for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a stream of light suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiang Elder's eyes narrowed, "Someone is coming!"</p><p></p><p>An enemy?</p><p></p><p>"It's actually Qi Yuan?" Kong Fulu, with his head full of white hair, now had two strands of black hair.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiang Elder was shocked, "He came out from inside?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how Qi Yuan had entered.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they saw Qi Yuan rush across the Lost Soul River and land beside them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xiang Elder's eyes narrowed, amazed that Qi Yuan was actually able to cross the Lost Soul River.</p><p></p><p>He anxiously asked, "Qi Yuan, you came out from inside. Did you encounter any danger in there? Did you encounter the old emperor of the Great Merchant Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu's gaze fell on the special being Qi Yuan was holding.</p><p></p><p>The special being was being held by Qi Yuan, wearing a set of clothes that didn't quite fit, looking rather strange.</p><p></p><p>He had a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Li Xiang Elder and, with a thought, understood why he had come here. He smiled, "It's safe inside, I didn't encounter any danger, and I even found my... wife."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the last two words, Li Xiang Elder and Kong Fulu were stunned.</p><p></p><p>This senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak, truly carefree, calling everyone his wife.</p><p></p><p>If translated to the Bluestar language, it would be... a shrimp-headed man.</p><p></p><p>"That's good." Li Xiang Elder sighed in relief, feeling that Qi Yuan must have been lucky and not encountered the old emperor in the Sunken Coffin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the old emperor and those Red Demon Seed Elixirs, Qi Yuan, a newly entered Foundation Establishment cultivator, would have surely died.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you don't know what a big event has happened outside. The old emperor of the Great Merchant Kingdom has actually faked his death and secretly come from the first Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm to this place..." Li Xiang Elder told Qi Yuan about the events happening outside, his face full of worry. "If he gains control of the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, our Divine Light Sect will be in grave danger."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you and Kong Fulu should leave first. I will stay here and see if I can find an opportunity to disrupt the old emperor's plot!</p><p></p><p>You need to tell me how to enter and cross the Lost Soul River!" Li Xiang Elder was prepared to sacrifice himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke softly, "Li Xiang Elder, there's no need to go in, the old emperor is already dead."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Li Xiang Elder was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Kong Fulu was also stunned, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then opened his hand.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred blood-stained soul lotus flowers were floating above his palm, including the main soul lotus flower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was light and casual.</p><p></p><p>"I need the soul lotus flowers, they wanted to kill me, so I had to kill them all."</p><p></p><p>"I have to go, my wife will be uncomfortable sleeping like this, she needs a bed. Senior, brother, farewell."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan transformed into a stream of light and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Only Elder Li Xiao and Kang Fuluo were left standing in the same spot, the two of them exchanging a silent glance.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Elder Li Xiao finally spoke, "Did I hear that correctly just now?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Kang Fuluo replied with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"The soul-nurturing flower stained with blood..." Elder Li Xiao could already imagine that it must have been an extremely terrifying battle.</p><p></p><p>According to the Sect Master and the Raging Sword True Lord's judgment, in the Sunken Coffin Realm, there were at least hundreds of Crimson Demon Core Elixirs, as well as an Emperor comparable to a Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>How did Qi Yuan manage to do it? ...</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan carried Xiao Jie back to his wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Jiang Lingsu saw Qi Yuan and the child in his arms, and she looked puzzled: "Senior Brother, weren't you participating in the Dragon Seizing Struggle? How come you're back?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Seizing Struggle is over, and it seems that this fellow Dong Xian has become the Emperor."</p><p></p><p>On Broken Wolf's body, he also found many precious treasures obtained in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He gave all these treasures to Dong Xian.</p><p></p><p>If all goes well, Dong Xian will become the Emperor of the Great Merchant.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel somewhat happy.</p><p></p><p>He sent Dong Xian, this "suspected plague god" and "protagonist-fated" person, away from the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the future, his days will surely be better.</p><p></p><p>"It's over already? That fast?" Jiang Lingsu was surprised to hear this, and then she suddenly said, "Senior Brother, did you encounter Broken Wolf?"</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, she had reminded her senior brother that if he encountered Broken Wolf, he should avoid fighting if possible.</p><p></p><p>She knew that her senior brother had the talent of a genius.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the late Foundation Establishment stage, the equally talented Broken Wolf was still a far cry.</p><p></p><p>"I encountered him and killed him," Qi Yuan said casually, "Enough chit-chat, my wife is sleeping, and I need to cover her with a blanket."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Who is she?" Jiang Lingsu was a bit taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"My wife!" Qi Yuan said proudly, returning to his wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Jiang Lingsu alone in the wind, bewildered.</p><p></p><p>She heard what? Her senior brother killed Broken Wolf? And he brought back a wife?</p><p></p><p>Both of these things sounded rather implausible.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan, who had entered the wooden hut, showed a relieved expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I've replaced the thatched hut with a wooden one in recent times, otherwise my wife would have looked down on me for not having the ability to build a proper house."</p><p></p><p>Placing Xiao Jie on the bed, Qi Yuan quietly looked at her, grasping the sleeve of her clothes.</p><p></p><p>As the night gradually darkened, Qi Yuan continued to watch her while cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something, opened the jade slip of the Divine Flower Society, and entered the chat group, which was the communication channel of the Four Divine Flower Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I've recently discovered a huge secret!"</p><p></p><p>"What secret?" The Rogue Immortal Venerable seemed to be online all the time, always able to respond first.</p><p></p><p>"During battles, if you play some light music on the music jade slip, it can greatly enhance your strength and make the fighting more passionate."</p><p></p><p>The people in the group were generous, and Qi Yuan also shared his battle experience with them.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?" The Rogue Immortal Venerable was puzzled, wondering if playing music could really increase one's combat power.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the always-lurking Ice Empress suddenly spoke up, "Wow, Origin Venerable, you are truly a genius, so creative! I can't believe I never thought of playing some music while fighting others. It's so elegant!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor also chimed in, seeming to admire Qi Yuan greatly, "Creating the 'Shocking Style' was already highly impressive, but I never expected Origin Venerable to be such a great talent, also inventing the technique of using music in battle. Truly ingenious and wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Venerable still looked a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Does playing music during battle really seem elegant? Wouldn't it be a bit awkward?</p><p></p><p>But since everyone in the group was praising him, he didn't dare to oppose it.</p><p></p><p>He could only ask, "Origin Venerable, is this really effective?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it works. Even as a small Foundation Establishment cultivator from a village, when I played music, I was able to burst Broken Wolf's head."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what did you say?" The Rogue Immortal Venerable was stunned, "You killed Broken Wolf?"</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf was a top talent on the Eastern Land's Genius Ranking, someone the Rogue Immortal Venerable looked up to.</p><p></p><p>Being killed by Origin Venerable? He found it hard to believe, feeling that Origin Venerable was joking.</p><p></p><p>How could someone from a small place be that strong?</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Great Sun Flame Emperor suddenly spoke up, "Origin Venerable, you really did kill Broken Wolf, and you even uploaded an advanced version of 'Resplendent Sword'."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Venerable was shocked, and he immediately imitated what Origin Venerable had said earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Worship the great master!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, three more people in the group were worshiping the great master.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also worshiped himself.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the praise in the group, Qi Yuan felt elated.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Broken Wolf is nothing.</p><p></p><p>At the time, I faced hundreds of Demon Core Elixirs and two hundred late Foundation Establishment cultivators, wielding a vegetable knife, cutting from the ground to the sky.</p><p></p><p>I just played five songs, and they were gone."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Venerable, seeing these words, felt very inferior in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Is this true or false?</p><p></p><p>Was he the only fake great master in the group?</p><p></p><p>"Finally, when facing the Divine Infant Demon, I drew my knife and killed it with a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Venerable: "..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Origin Venerable is a great master disguised as a Foundation Establishment cultivator? He slaughtered Demon Core Elixirs like killing dogs!</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's nothing much. Compared to the three thousand foreign demons I've slain, that Divine Infant was just trash! It's a pity that when I slew the three thousand foreign demons, I didn't play any music, otherwise the result would have been different."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to boast.</p><p></p><p>However, he thought of something and asked in the group, "Does anyone have the formula for the Soul-Splitting Elixir? I urgently need it."</p><p></p><p>"I have it, I'll upload it to the exchange group." The Ice Empress spoke up, "Origin Venerable, next time remember to take me with you to kill the foreign demons. I really want to experience killing with such elegance like you!"</p><p></p><p>"No problem, thank you, Sister Ice Empress!" Qi Yuan was extremely grateful.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to get the answer he wanted just by casually asking.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the formula for the Soul-Splitting Elixir appeared in Qi Yuan's vision.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ice Empress, I can't refine elixirs, can I get an elixir refiner to help me refine it?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>After all, it wouldn't be good to leak the Ice Empress's elixir formula.</p><p></p><p>"The Soul-Splitting Elixir formula is not precious, what's valuable is the main ingredient. This formula is something even medium-sized forces have, no problem sharing it with others."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" Qi Yuan was extremely grateful, "I happen to be good at modifying cultivation techniques, I'll improve the formula a bit and upload it to the group later."</p><p></p><p>He had no other way to repay, so he would modify the formula.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Ice Empress said, "Thank you, Venerable, for your kindness."</p><p></p><p>Just now, Origin Venerable had said he couldn't refine elixirs, but now he was talking about improving the formula. She naturally wouldn't take it seriously, but she also wouldn't expose him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan logged off, looked at the formula, and had a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before a newly refined formula appeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked exhausted, his spiritual power greatly consumed.</p><p></p><p>After uploading the formula, he looked at the night sky, took a bath, and then hugged Xiao Jie, ready to sleep.</p><p></p><p>He was too tired now, he would find someone to refine the elixir tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a voice suddenly reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"My husband, now your petite and adorable little wife has become a supreme being. When will we meet?"</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The former Ning Lao had become a regional overlord, with several Supremes under her command.</p><p></p><p>Her courage had also grown.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to see the Supreme who had once spoken by her ear.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after searching for many years, she still couldn't find him.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't want to meet!" Qi Yuan quickly said.</p><p></p><p>The first time they met face-to-face, it had caused him too much psychological trauma.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to meet again.</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>A woman in a black dress, her jade-like legs long, half-reclining on the throne.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's voice, a faint smile appeared in her calm and unfathomable eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My husband, are you afraid of me and don't dare to see your servant?"</p><p></p><p>She said this and then waited quietly.</p><p></p><p>But as always, no one responded to her.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the black dress looked up at the sky, a complex expression in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Serene Waves Realm, in the wooden hut, Qi Yuan tightly embraced Xiao Jie, and the moonlight shone through the cracks, making the two of them look especially gentle.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

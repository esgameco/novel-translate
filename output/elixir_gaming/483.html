        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, this is something unprecedented in history, extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>The Mistress of the White Dragon Abyss, wearing a jade silk robe, frowned: "He is actually the Venerable of Ten Days... The struggle for the venerable position, the one from the Taihuang Palace will not let him go, how difficult it is!"</p><p></p><p>Although she coveted the bloodline of the Blood Robe, she could not risk it to deal with the Taihuang Palace for the Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>"If he could have a night of passion with me before his death and give birth to a son... that would be a wonderful story." The Mistress of the White Dragon Abyss sighed.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the child born would avenge his father and annihilate the Taihuang Palace, what a wonderful thing?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Mistress of the White Dragon Abyss was just thinking about it, because... this is not feasible.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihuang Palace, various powerful auras surged.</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Venerable had a murderous intent in his eyes: "Hmph, Ziyuan Ancestor and Black Sword have been too arrogant, actually obstructing us!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Comprehension beside him nodded: "Unexpectedly, the Supreme Venerable has intervened, and even let this Venerable of Ten Days escape."</p><p></p><p>"Can he escape for a while, but not for a lifetime?" The True Origin Venerable said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Taihuang Palace's Linyue has molted, there must be a way to deal with the Venerable of Ten Days.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Venerable stood aside, with a complex expression: "I never thought he was a Demonic Blaze, and had comprehended two supreme Dao Comprehensions.</p><p></p><p>If he is allowed to grow, he will be an absolute archenemy to the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the Celestial Venerable present also felt a tightness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>That Venerable of Ten Days has the capital to challenge the Great Sun Supreme Venerable.</p><p></p><p>He once soared through the sky, intimidating the various realms.</p><p></p><p>Later, he also created an unprecedented masterpiece, comprehending two supreme Dao Comprehensions.</p><p></p><p>Such an existence, given enough time, can grow to what extent, it is simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"The little sinner has actually reached this level, it is really shocking.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his good luck has run out, and what awaits him next will be the thunderous wrath of the Taihuang Palace!" The True Origin Venerable exclaimed, with unconcealed murderous intent in his words.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice transmission suddenly fell into the True Origin Venerable's ear, and he narrowed his eyes, his expression slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"He is actually hiding in the Tiankun Strange Land!"</p><p></p><p>"What? Tiankun Strange Land?" The other Celestials were also surprised at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tiankun Strange Land has been making a big name for itself lately.</p><p></p><p>The Envoy of the Emperor's Palace hid in the Tiankun Strange Land and defeated the Bannerman Master.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... this Envoy of the Emperor's Palace and this Qiyuan... are the same person?" The True Origin Venerable mentioned this, with some awe on his face.</p><p></p><p>If the Venerable of Ten Days has comprehended two supreme Dao Comprehensions and has great potential, this Envoy of the Emperor's Palace has already realized his potential.</p><p></p><p>"If it's the same person... it's a bit dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, he only suppressed the Bannerman Master without the Dao Comprehension, if we intervene, who can't kill him? Without the Dao Comprehension Seal, even if he possesses an offensive Spiritual Treasure, the Supreme Venerable's hand will make him die without a doubt!" The True Origin Venerable said in a rough voice.</p><p></p><p>In this Immortal Dao Sixth Heaven, the Dao Comprehension Seal is the talisman of the Dao Comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"It's really strange, why doesn't he have the Dao Comprehension Seal?"</p><p></p><p>"Such an anomaly, anything can happen to him!"</p><p></p><p>"This enemy cannot be allowed to live outside anymore, otherwise... if he condenses the Dao Comprehension Seal, it will be troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>The people of the Taihuang Palace were tense, with a hint of urgency.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for the Supreme Venerable's order to rush to the Tiankun Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, there are more divine arts now."</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan grasped Jinli's small hand, his gaze gentle.</p><p></p><p>This time, Jinli came to the Ziyuan Heavens from the Moon Goddess Palace, bringing many divine arts.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, what do you need so many divine arts for?" Jinli's pretty face still had a slight blush, with a puzzled expression in her beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the Tiankun Strange Land, Qiyuan was not anxious, or rather, not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was leisurely browsing through some divine arts, which puzzled Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's... to refine the Sun, a divine art, about one sun, I have to hurry up." Qiyuan said, closing his eyes and starting to edit the Golden Elixir Chapter of the Qiyuan Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Jinli stood beside him, her figure voluptuous. She looked at Qiyuan: "Refine the Sun?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qiyuan was creating the Qiyuan Sutra, his expression focused.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the progress of the Qiyuan Sutra advanced a lot.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan paused slightly, glancing at the game loaded on the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"The progress bar of the game is getting faster... I have to hurry up and eliminate the threat of the Taihuang Palace! If, the time flow in the game is too slow, and Linyue's molting begins, there may be hidden dangers."</p><p></p><p>When formulating his grand plan, Qiyuan had thought it through carefully.</p><p></p><p>He must resolve the threat of the Taihuang Palace before the new game starts.</p><p></p><p>After all, if one second in the game is one ten thousand years in reality.</p><p>By the time he finishes the game, the yellow flowers will have wilted.</p><p></p><p>So, before going to the game, it's best to resolve the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>And this exposure of his identity is also within his plan, otherwise, Qiyuan has many ways to avoid the inspection of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The only surprise is that the starlight on him is too much, like waves.</p><p></p><p>Now, from fleeing the Ziyuan Heavens to stepping into the Tiankun Strange Land, he has been retreating all the way.</p><p></p><p>This way, the plan will be more normal and reasonable.</p><p>He is being forced, step by step being led by the nose by the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Qiyuan Sutra has already been passed on to Ninglan, when will the Taihuang Palace come?" Qiyuan stretched and lay down on Jinli's lap.</p><p></p><p>The faint fragrance filled the air, and Qiyuan couldn't help but feel at ease, and the fatigue on his body also dissipated a lot.</p><p></p><p>Jinli hugged Qiyuan's head and adjusted a posture, making Qiyuan lie more comfortably: "Is Ninglan your sister or your sister-in-law?"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of sourness in her words.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Qiyuan was stunned, "Are you jealous?"</p><p></p><p>"Taste it... and you'll know if I'm jealous." The Moon Goddess Jinli pursed her lips, her eyes like a spring pool, as soon as she finished speaking, she leaned in and kissed him.</p><p></p><p>Lingering, passionate.</p><p></p><p>After about tens of breaths, this entanglement finally separated.</p><p></p><p>The originally cold and aloof Jinli was now panting, her pretty face flushed.</p><p></p><p>"Can you taste it?" Jinli's jade arms hooked around Qiyuan's head.</p><p></p><p>In this tens of breaths, the situation has already reversed, and Qiyuan occupies the superior position.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan thought carefully: "No?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli is all fragrant, where is the sour taste of vinegar? "Taste it again?" Jinli's expression was quite bold, and she squatted down.</p><p></p><p>When there are outsiders, she is gentle, knowledgeable, and reserved, like a peony.</p><p></p><p>When alone with Qiyuan, she becomes particularly bold and charming, wanting to squeeze Qiyuan into her body, like a blooming peach blossom in spring.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, she raised her head and looked at Qiyuan defiantly: "Have you done this with her?"</p><p></p><p>This tone, Qiyuan seemed to have seen it when Ziyuan Xiaolu and Anhuolu quarreled.</p><p></p><p>"Probably... have?" Qiyuan valued honesty and integrity.</p><p></p><p>When he was with Ninglan and Jinsi Canary, they were like husband and wife, and naturally tasted the forbidden fruit not a little.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes Ninglan was on top, Jinsi Canary was on the bottom, even Qiyuan found it hard to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Jinli seemed to be sulking and bit Qiyuan's arm, very lightly, not as hard as when she kissed.</p><p></p><p>"What if it's like this?" Jinli thought of something, her gaze changing.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she spoke, the white dress in front of her was unbuttoned, the clothes slightly loosened, revealing the smooth and jade-like delicate body, snow-white and tender.</p><p></p><p>Different from the petite and delicate Ninglan and Jinsi Canary, Jinli's figure is much more voluptuous.</p><p></p><p>There is not an ounce of excess fat on her, but the places that need flesh are not lacking at all.</p><p></p><p>Plump and full, warm jade in the arms, making people want to drill in hard.</p><p></p><p>She hugged Qiyuan, and the two were instantly pressed together, the charming and flower-like face flushed even more.</p><p></p><p>The white dress was quickly buttoned up again, and she tightly hugged Qiyuan, sharing the same robe.</p><p></p><p>The current scene is like Qiyuan crawling into Jinli's clothes.</p><p></p><p>"We've registered..."</p><p></p><p>"This... mmm..." The soft flesh entered his mouth, the hot waves hit his face, Qiyuan instinctively said, "This dress is affecting the performance!"</p><p></p><p>He was confined in the dress and dared not make any big moves.</p><p></p><p>"Have you done this with her?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... no, her dress is a bit smaller!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you... despising me for being fat?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Happy times are always short, and Qiyuan also knows moderation.</p><p></p><p>Although alcohol and lust are harmful to the body, fortunately Qiyuan almost never drinks, the last time he drank was on the wall of Wuguicheng, drinking the Daughter Fragrance of Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>Daughter Fragrance, where can it compare to Jinli's fragrance.</p><p></p><p>These days, Jinli has been particularly active and passionate, even a bit like an abandoned pet, always snuggling into Qiyuan's arms.</p><p></p><p>This is completely different from her usual lofty and cold temperament as a Moon Goddess, Qiyuan knows that this is mostly because Jinli lacks a sense of security, so she appears so contrasting.</p><p></p><p>He also knows that Jinli is like this, she is a little afraid, anxious, and has a revenge psychology accumulated over millions of years.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to take the initiative a bit." The high-EQ Qiyuan thought.</p><p></p><p>He thought, looking at the well-dressed Jinli, bright and charming, in a simple and loose dress, it was still difficult to conceal the two big thunders.</p><p></p><p>Take the initiative?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jinli, suddenly said in an unfriendly tone, "Disrobe!"</p><p></p><p>"..." Jinli blinked her eyes, looking a little aggrieved, but more expectant.</p><p></p><p>"Disrobe!" Qiyuan said again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day in the Sixth Heaven, one and a half years in the Tiankun Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan had been in the Tiankun Strange Land for nearly a year.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace finally slowly came.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a brilliant light burst forth outside the Tiankun Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>As if a great sun was soaring in the sky, the eastern dawn had arrived, the light majestic and imposing.</p><p></p><p>Within an unknown radius, the other stars could not be seen, only that one great sun in the eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable of Ten Days, come out and die!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was resounding, stretching for thousands of miles, like a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tiankun Strange Land, under the great sun, in the void, it seemed that countless divine lords had descended.</p><p></p><p>Two Great Dao Comprehension Venerables stood at the forefront, their auras making the earth tremble.</p><p></p><p>Within the Tiankun Strange Land, Qiyuan was in a lazy mood: "Your Taihuang Palace is so powerful, why don't you come in and die?"</p><p></p><p>Going out, Qiyuan naturally would not go out.</p><p></p><p>Now, in terms of strength, he is naturally not a match for the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>And within the Tiankun Strange Land, there is a remnant robe ghost, so the Taihuang Palace must be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Soaring through the sky for ten days, wanting to seize the venerable position, aren't you very bold? Now, why are you cowering in the Tiankun Strange Land and not coming out?" The True Origin Venerable spoke, his voice cold.</p><p></p><p>The Tiankun Strange Land has the Holy Light Clan, and there is also the remnant robe ghost.</p><p></p><p>These two living beings, he is extremely wary of.</p><p></p><p>Especially the remnant robe ghost, it seems to come from the outside world, and although only a wisp of remnant soul remains, its strength is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Even a general Supreme Venerable would not dare to rashly enter the Tiankun Strange Land and fight the remnant robe ghost.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't come out, I won't come out." Qiyuan said lazily, quite shameless.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The True Origin Venerable was furious, his expression changing repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>If the Venerable of Ten Days continues to hide in the Tiankun Strange Land, the Taihuang Palace really can't do anything to him for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given enough time, the True Origin Venerable believes the Taihuang Palace will find a solution.</p><p></p><p>"You wait a bit, don't choke, the time flow in the Tiankun Strange Land is fast, I'll go take a bath, and come back to scold you later!" Qiyuan said and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>What he said was the truth.</p><p></p><p>The time flow in the Tiankun Strange Land is too fast, so when scolding, he has a lot of time to think.</p><p></p><p>After getting tired of scolding, he can still go drink some water and eat a meal, quite enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The True Origin Venerable was furious, "Someone, refine the Tiankun Strange Land for me!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice.</p><p></p><p>In the divine realm, countless Yin Venerables appeared, leaning against a great sun, constantly attacking the Tiankun Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Venerable knew that dealing with the Venerable of Ten Days... is not something that can be solved in a day.</p><p></p><p>And this refining of the Tiankun Strange Land is only a tentative attempt by the Yin Venerable Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>After all, the remnant robe is still there.</p><p></p><p>"You guys keep it up, I've already taken a bath." Qiyuan continued to say lazily.</p><p></p><p>And the current scene is quite strange.</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Venerable was outside the Tiankun Strange Land, ranting endlessly.</p><p></p><p>While Qiyuan was inside the Tiankun Strange Land, eating, cultivating, bathing, taking a stroll with Jinli, occasionally going back to retort, but very accurately.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ziyuan Heavens, the sky was overcast with dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Xiaolu's little face was deathly pale: "I heard that the Taihuang Palace has surrounded the Tiankun Strange Land, and Brother Blood Robe is in the Tiankun Strange Land, he won't be in trouble, will he?"</p><p></p><p>This time, her worries were far more than the last time.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was the Taihuang Palace taking action.</p><p></p><p>That is</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many creatures of the Black Abyss all emerged from the Black Realm.</p><p></p><p>If there are any problems with the Black Realm, the bloodlines of these Black Abyss descendants will decline.</p><p></p><p>At the last meeting, it was decided that Black Sword would be in charge of the Black Abyss, and now he is also guarding the Black Realm.</p><p></p><p>If there are any issues, big or small, in the Black Realm, he must rush in to resolve them.</p><p></p><p>The look of panic on his face quickly disappeared, and Black Sword said to the Venerable Yang Immortal, "I'm going back now."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at Zi Yuan Ancestor: "Take care, be very careful, we'll talk again after I come out of the Black Realm."</p><p></p><p>After Black Sword said this, he disappeared along with the Venerable Yang Immortal.</p><p></p><p>In the Zi Yuan Heavens, only Zi Yuan Ancestor remained. He looked at the location of the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly, then at the Zi Yuan Heavens, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>"A storm is coming!" </p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, he sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Not just coming, but... it's already here."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an aged voice suddenly sounded in the sky above the Zi Yuan Heavens.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying pressure descended, as if dark clouds were pressing down on the city.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor looked up, his figure suddenly standing tall, no longer the stooped posture he had at the foot of Black Mountain.</p><p></p><p>His eyes shot forth a sharp glint.</p><p></p><p>"Saint Wuming, you have come!"</p><p></p><p>Saint Wuming was the name of the Abyss Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the void, Saint Wuming's figure was not visible, only a layer of black clouds could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"You... are too greedy, too... cowardly. If I had known this day would come, I would not have let you have the opportunity to achieve the attack-type Transcendent Treasure back then!" Zi Yuan Ancestor gritted his teeth as he looked at the void.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Black Abyss encountered a crisis, and the entire clan was in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>Both Zi Yuan Ancestor and Saint Wuming had the opportunity to achieve the attack-type Transcendent Treasure.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor had seized the opportunity before Saint Wuming, so his chance was greater.</p><p></p><p>But the resources of the Black Abyss were not enough to support the manifestation of two attack-type Transcendent Treasures.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Saint Wuming secretly plotted against his disciple Zi Yuan Ancestor, and thus achieved his own attack-type Transcendent Treasure.</p><p></p><p>Saint Wuming also relied on this attack-type Transcendent Treasure to save the situation of the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yuan Ancestor, you are the kind of person... who values righteousness too much, and you don't understand... the most important thing in this world is the power in your hands." Saint Wuming's voice was aged, "Back then, when I plotted against you, I don't regret it. If I could go back, I would do it even better.</p><p></p><p>With your personality, if you had cultivated the attack-type Transcendent Treasure, you would have become the lord of the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss... how could it have today's prosperity?</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss might even... not be among the top ten in the Realms!</p><p></p><p>Even to the point that, during this Rinne Rebirth, the Black Abyss may be destroyed by your own hand!"</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, except for the Holy Lands with the Supreme Lord presiding, the comprehensive strength of the Black Abyss was the first.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor's face was filled with fury and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The half-finished attack-type Transcendent Treasure appeared, and his aura suddenly soared to a terrifying height.</p><p></p><p>Saint Wuming's voice was aged and indifferent: "You make friends everywhere, this time... the Blood Robe is in trouble, and... even I have descended to the Zi Yuan Heavens, but will anyone come to help you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Zi Yuan Ancestor snorted coldly, not wanting to talk to Saint Wuming.</p><p></p><p>"How about we make a bet... whether the Blood Robe will leave the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly for you, for the Zi Yuan Heavens." Saint Wuming said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of Zi Yuan Ancestor breaking through the encirclement and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, outside the Zi Yuan Heavens, he had secretly laid a heavenly net.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he was confident in Zi Yuan Ancestor's character, that he would not abandon the clan members of the Zi Yuan Heavens.</p><p></p><p>In Saint Wuming's eyes, this was stubbornness and stupidity, being constrained by his own so-called morality.</p><p></p><p>If it were Saint Wuming, the clan members' lives wouldn't matter, as long as he himself still lived, that would mean the clan still existed.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor's expression was complex.</p><p></p><p>He naturally understood that Saint Wuming was using the Zi Yuan Heavens and the Blood Robe to threaten him.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, his thoughts were tangled.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he hoped the Blood Robe would prioritize the overall situation and not fall into the trap of the Heavenly Empyrean Palace; on the other hand, he also hoped the Blood Robe was not the kind of heartless person.</p><p></p><p>"Saint Wuming, with your strength alone, you dare to speak so arrogantly. This is the Zi Yuan Heavens, my home turf. Who wins and who loses... is still unknown!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor's figure suddenly grew larger, and a terrifying aura swept through the Zi Yuan Heavens.</p><p></p><p>He had the Great Venerable Moment, even if Saint Wuming had the attack-type Transcendent Treasure, he could not kill him.</p><p></p><p>And this was the Zi Yuan Heavens, his home ground, at most he would only suffer some injuries, which would not be a hindrance.</p><p></p><p>And the Blood Robe should know this, weigh the pros and cons, and not be threatened by the Heavenly Empyrean Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think I can't kill you?" Saint Wuming's face revealed a profound expression, "It's just... the Rinne Rebirth has not yet begun, if you die, you won't be able to enter the Sole Palace... that would be too much of a waste."</p><p></p><p>As Saint Wuming spoke, a drop of blood suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this drop of blood, Zi Yuan Ancestor's expression changed drastically: "The Root Devil's Blood... it's really you!"</p><p></p><p>The blood in Saint Wuming's hand was the Root Devil's Blood.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Black Sword encountered the Root Devil's Blood attack, there was a behind-the-scenes manipulator.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Ancestor had suspected the Abyss Lord, but did not dare to believe it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Black Sword was strong, and the Black Abyss was strong.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems, the Abyss Lord... was indeed the behind-the-scenes manipulator.</p><p></p><p>This scene was particularly ironic.</p><p></p><p>It's as if... why did the Emperor rebel?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>True Element Venerable received the news and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been constantly bickering with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But the other party's time flow was fast, and he could do other things while bickering.</p><p></p><p>This made him very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>But because of the face of the Heavenly Empyrean Palace, he could only suppress his displeasure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked towards the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly and his spirit was invigorated: "Ten-Day Venerable, if you don't come out, by the time I go to the Zi Yuan Heavens... what I might see is just a pile of ruins."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "Your Supreme Lord is here, the high-end combat forces are here, do you still have the power to cause trouble for the Zi Yuan Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Great Sun had not appeared outside, but his attention was always on this side.</p><p></p><p>The other high-end combat forces of the Heavenly Empyrean Palace were also paying attention to the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly, afraid that the Venerable would intervene from within.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the Heavenly Empyrean Palace did not have many high-end combat forces going to the Zi Yuan Heavens.</p><p></p><p>To kill Zi Yuan Ancestor, the Supreme Lord would have to take action.</p><p></p><p>"The Abyss Lord of the Black Abyss has promised the Supreme Lord to act against the Zi Yuan Heavens, and now... the battle has begun."</p><p></p><p>True Element Venerable said, waving his hand to reveal an image in the void.</p><p></p><p>The image showed two terrifying auras clashing and entangling, with one side occupying the upper hand, and the one occupying the lower hand... Qi Yuan was very familiar with, it was Zi Yuan Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Zi Yuan Ancestor has the Great Venerable Moment, the Abyss Lord may not be able to kill him. Old man, suffer some injuries for me, don't worry, I will avenge you!" Qi Yuan said lazily, seemingly unfazed.</p><p></p><p>True Element Venerable was not surprised by Qi Yuan's response, he squinted his eyes, a hint of mockery in his voice: "What if the Abyss Lord... has the Root Devil's Blood?"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Qi Yuan's expression changed in a timely manner, his acting reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this also exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He had already thought that the Heavenly Empyrean Palace might use the Zi Yuan Heavens to threaten him.</p><p></p><p>But he was not worried, as long as that Supreme Lord did not leave, Zi Yuan Ancestor would have no safety concerns.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord was watching him, how could he leave?</p><p></p><p>The Root Devil's Blood, this was truly beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Zi Yuan Ancestor had been suppressing his strength all along, just to delay the arrival of the Root Devil's Calamity.</p><p></p><p>If the Root Devil's Calamity was triggered by the Root Devil's Blood, in Zi Yuan Ancestor's current state, he might very well perish.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let the Root Devil's Calamity come, the old man has a calamity to face." Qi Yuan said indifferently, continuing his performance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was a bit annoyed.</p><p></p><p>His strength was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why bother playing house with these people from the Heavenly Empyrean Palace, just directly punch them into oblivion?</p><p></p><p>"Ten-Day Venerable, why deceive yourself?" True Element Venerable said indifferently, "If you don't come out, the Root Devil's Blood will surely be used, by the time you come out, what you might see is Zi Yuan Ancestor's corpse!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Sixth Heaven, countless eyes watched this scene through various Transcendent Treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Empyrean Palace... has no shame, actually threatening Zi Yuan Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"If the Heavenly Empyrean Palace had any shame, how could they have obtained the permission of the Sole Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's a pity for the Ten-Day Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"This situation is difficult to break!" A Great Venerable sighed, "Even if the Ten-Day Venerable doesn't come out now, with the strength of that Supreme Lord, he can probably find a way to enter the Anomaly and kill the Ten-Day Venerable with thunderous force."</p><p></p><p>"The Ten-Day Venerable's talent is so astonishing, who would have thought that he, residing in the lower realms, could overturn the Three Thousand Realms with just one person.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he secretly annihilated the Demon Roc Clan and controlled them in his hands.</p><p></p><p>He has also mastered two supreme Venerable Moments, this kind of prodigy, the Immortal Realm may have only seen this one!"</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Empyrean Palace won't sit idly by and watch him grow, who knows... how powerful he will become in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, could it be that the Heavenly Empyrean Palace's luck is truly on their side, otherwise, if the Heavenly Empyrean Palace had not presided over the Rinne Rebirth, how could they have discovered the identity of the Ten-Day Venerable? If he had remained dormant for millions of years, how would the Heavenly Empyrean Palace deal with him?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Supreme Lord was wary of the remnant soul of the Blood Robe and dared not go down to the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly alone.</p><p></p><p>But as long as the Supreme Lord is given enough time to prepare, he can still go down to the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly and eliminate the Ten-Day Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If it were other Great Venerables possessing attack-type Transcendent Treasures, it would actually be very difficult, even impossible, for the Supreme Lord to succeed in killing them.</p><p></p><p>But... the Ten-Day Venerable has not yet condensed the Great Venerable Moment, no matter how amazing his combat power is, he can even suppress the Veil Lord.</p><p></p><p>But once the Supreme Lord acts, perhaps... the Ten-Day Venerable won't even have a moment to breathe.</p><p></p><p>This is the terrifying power of the Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Great Venerable Moment has protected the lives of the Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Making it difficult for the Supreme Lord to slay the Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Within three days, if you don't come out... the Root Devil's Blood will be used!" True Element Venerable spoke, his voice cold.</p><p></p><p>He placed a difficult dilemma before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts were watching this place, seemingly curious about Qi Yuan's reaction.</p><p></p><p>"I hate it the most when someone forces me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, the lazy aura on his face disappearing.</p><p></p><p>He looked at True Element Venerable, stepping forward step by step.</p><p></p><p>"How about we switch it up, and let me force the Heavenly Empyrean Palace... to make a choice?" Qi Yuan said indifferently, his voice spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, Ten-Day Venerable, what qualifications do you have to force the Heavenly Empyrean Palace to make a choice!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, you are trapped here, death... is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>"You, also dare to threaten the Heavenly Empyrean Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Immortals of the Heavenly Empyrean Palace mocked or sneered.</p><p></p><p>They really didn't think the Blood Robe had any means to threaten them.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord... represented invincibility.</p><p></p><p>"One step to heaven, one step to hell." Qi Yuan's figure slowly walked out of the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly, "Supreme Lord, do you dare to follow me... into this hell?</p><p></p><p>Or should I say, wait here for a hundred million years, and then I'll personally send you to hell?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Qi Yuan and the Sole Gate appeared outside the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not hesitate at all, rushing into the Sole Gate.</p><p></p><p>And the Sole Gate in front of them was also rapidly becoming illusory, as if it would disappear in the next breath.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators and Great Venerables held their breath, seemingly wanting to understand what the Great Sun would do.</p><p></p><p>And the Supreme Lord who was focused on this scene took a deep breath, already having the answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If it were them, no matter who it was, at this moment they would probably enter this Sole Gate.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it was the Ten-Day Venerable's coercion and threat; secondly, as the Supreme Lord, who would not be confident in themselves, what would they fear of schemes and tricks; thirdly, that was the Sole Gate, the number one Transcendent Treasure in the Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>But the Sole Gate in the Sixth Heaven gradually dissipated, and the Great Sun, with unparalleled momentum, rushed into the Sole Gate at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sky darkened, and the aura of the Sole Gate also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Many eyes stared at the outside of the Heavenly Chasm Anomaly, their expressions profound.</p><p></p><p>Because... the development of the situation had completely exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Sun Supreme Lord were to master the Sole Gate, this Sixth Heaven... would truly undergo a great change and become the Great Sun Supreme Lord's sole domain.</p><p></p><p>Some were doubtful and uncertain</p>

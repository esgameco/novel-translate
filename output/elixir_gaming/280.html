        <h1>Chapter 280</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and said, "I don't even have a marriage certificate now, I don't have a Dao partner."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ruhua fell into thought, then showed an admiring expression: "So fellow Daoist is... keeping someone on the side. Impressive, very impressive!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately understood that this fellow Daoist before him had not formally taken a Dao partner.</p><p></p><p>About a few dozen breaths of time passed, and the spirit ship finally began to stop.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the cabin came out one after another, both men and women, with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators disembarked from the spirit ship one by one. </p><p></p><p>Below the spirit ship, many rabbit carriages had also arrived to welcome the cultivators from the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, fellow Daoist," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua's face broke into a smile: "Don't forget to invite me to drink at your wedding, fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>"...Alright," Qi Yuan casually agreed.</p><p></p><p>After all, when traveling abroad, one's persona is self-created, and promises are casually made.</p><p></p><p>Only now did Jiang Ruhua turn his attention below. He swept his gaze around, and immediately saw a bright and charming young woman in a yellow dress.</p><p></p><p>A gratified look flashed in his eyes, and he felt somewhat proud in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Brat, you still know to come pick up your father? He decided that when he saw his daughter later, he must not give her a good look.</p><p></p><p>He stood there looking slightly tsundere, just waiting for his daughter to come welcome him.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, his daughter's face bore a joyful expression as she came straight towards him.</p><p></p><p>His expression was serious, but he was actually overjoyed inside.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you're finally back!"</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Ruhua's face froze.</p><p></p><p>He saw that familiar daughter walk towards the fellow Daoist he had conversed with earlier, skillfully linking arms with him, her eyes seemingly only for her Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>A flame spread in his chest.</p><p></p><p>He revealed an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>His daughter had not come to welcome him, and even at just a few meters' distance, had not noticed him.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, that brat! Many thoughts flashed through his mind, and he immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>That fellow Daoist he had encountered on the road was actually his daughter's Senior Brother Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>No wonder! No wonder indeed! Jiang Ruhua understood, and was also enraged!</p><p></p><p>Obedient and cute?</p><p></p><p>Considerate and gentle? </p><p></p><p>Was this what Jiang Lingsu was like? And... busty junior sister? Jiang Ruhua's eyes seemed about to spit fire.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Lingsu!"</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and shouted loudly! If voice could kill, he would have probably already chopped Qi Yuan into pieces by now.</p><p></p><p>Especially on the flying ship, he had even taught Qi Yuan how to hook up with his daughter! At his voice, the smile froze on Jiang Lingsu's face as white as jade. Her arm around Qi Yuan's seemed at a loss. She looked at Jiang Ruhua with wide eyes: "Father?"</p><p></p><p>"So you still know I'm your father!" Jiang Ruhua looked at Jiang Lingsu, and at the arm linked with Qi Yuan, his eyes about to spit fire.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also stunned for a moment. He couldn't help but say: "This lecherous cultivator... is your father?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard Qi Yuan say: "Just now on the road, this person taught me that I should consummate the relationship with my busty junior sister."</p><p></p><p>A blush immediately crept up to Jiang Lingsu's ears. The corners of her eyes also seemed tinged with rouge, exceptionally charming.</p><p></p><p>"You're talking nonsense!" Jiang Ruhua was furious.</p><p></p><p>He also hadn't expected that young fellow Daoist to be his daughter's Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, he also asked me how to take several wives," Qi Yuan looked pitifully at Jiang Lingsu. "Junior Sister, you're going to have several stepmothers!"</p><p></p><p>The anger on Jiang Ruhua's face completely disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu also gritted her teeth: "I'm going to tell Mother about this!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't!" Jiang Ruhua was truly scared now!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's mother was not at all domineering or overbearing, but rather very gentle and amiable.</p><p></p><p>But... she liked to cry.</p><p></p><p>If she found out about this, she would cry in front of him for ten years. How could he bear that!</p><p></p><p>"This isn't over!" Seeing that she had grasped Jiang Ruhua's weakness, Jiang Lingsu breathed a sigh of relief and stuck out her tongue.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, encountering her father in this situation would have been quite awkward for her.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua was anxious and helpless inside.</p><p></p><p>He also hadn't expected his meeting with his daughter to be like this.</p><p></p><p>He also hadn't expected the person he randomly encountered on the road to be his daughter's Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Ruhua looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze quite resentful.</p><p></p><p>After all, having exposed himself in front of Qi Yuan, he had lost his previous dignity.</p><p></p><p>Especially teaching Qi Yuan strategies to consummate the relationship, which now made him very short of breath.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please don't take to heart the matter of consummating the relationship. This old man doesn't go for that sort of thing!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Jiang Lingsu left, Jiang Ruhua hurriedly said to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan just smiled and said: "Fellow Daoist misunderstands. My relationship with Junior Sister is pure and innocent. The things on the Shenhua Forum are all fictional, and I also... don't have a senior sister. As for the Sect Leader's daughter, she is Kang Fulu's Dao partner, and has no connection to me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's explanation only made Jiang Ruhua misunderstand even more.</p><p></p><p>This guy... even likes married women!</p><p></p><p>If they were still on the flying ship and he didn't know this person was Qi Yuan, he might have said they were kindred spirits.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only say his character was despicable!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I believe you," Jiang Ruhua said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged, quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's innocent look, Jiang Ruhua seemed to see himself.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled when he first brought his junior sister to meet his father-in-law, and was immediately beaten up by him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "Hmph, aren't you the number one Divine Infant of Da Shang? This old man will challenge the number one Divine Infant of Da Shang!"</p><p></p><p>Rather than a challenge, it was more like taking the opportunity to teach Qi Yuan a lesson.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had been beaten up and rained on in the past, so naturally he didn't want Qi Yuan to have an umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was a Divine Infant cultivator from the Eastern Lands. Although Qi Yuan wasn't an old man and was quite young, he was from Da Shang, so his strength must be far inferior.</p><p></p><p>"I've always respected the elderly and loved the young. I never bully old men," Qi Yuan flatly refused. He asked expectantly, "How about letting Junior Sister replace you old man in battling me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ruhua felt like vomiting blood.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan had much thicker skin than him.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Seven-Colored Peak gained a new resident as Jiang Ruhua stayed on the peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan went about his usual routine, revising techniques alone in his room.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the matters of the Shenhua Society and the Original God Sharing Society,</p><p></p><p>During this period, Qi Yuan's technique revision was not quiet.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, Shen Wushen would come to Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, Purple Mansion of the Blood Robe Alliance would also come.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, even the Yin Gods who later pledged allegiance to the Original God Sharing Society would come to Seven-Colored Peak to see Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the Divine Methods were published, more and more people came seeking an audience with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan sat in the concrete bungalow, his eyes bearing a profound look.</p><p></p><p>"Adding the techniques Shen Wushen brought this time, I now have six Divine Methods and over two thousand Heavenly Methods... Indeed, Pinduoduo has been a great success in the Cang Lan Realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite excited at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Going out to exterminate clans and search for one's true love, how could it compare to this?</p><p></p><p>Lying at home, techniques came endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Now he could truly be said to have recruited all under heaven.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>There were even many martial arts manuals from the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"These cultivation methods are enough to last for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan examined himself internally.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the game jade slip, a glint flashing in his eyes. "The game has finally finished loading."</p><p></p><p>"But... what does it mean that I died?"</p><p></p><p>In the game, the version of him formed from the innate seed had inexplicably died.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>"What form will I take when I enter the game now? A skeleton?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>He had already given orders earlier that he would be going into seclusion for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society, Original God Sharing Society, Blood Robe Alliance and other factions would continue as before.</p><p></p><p>He had also told Jiang Lingsu about this.</p><p></p><p>"Enter the game!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>In the graveyard, moonlight filtered through gaps in the foliage, forming a bird-like shape on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The dappled light and shadows fell on the tombstone ahead, making it look especially desolate and eerie.</p><p></p><p>The weeds next to the stone tablet were lush. A black beetle was gnawing on a grass stem when suddenly, a centipede-like creature bit the beetle in half.</p><p></p><p>Crunch!</p><p></p><p>Heavy footsteps approached, directly crushing the centipede-like creature.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, surround Mitu Mountain and prohibit anyone from entering!" ordered a middle-aged man wearing a military cap.</p><p></p><p>His face was as if carved from a knife, and his sturdy build contained immense energy.</p><p></p><p>His expression was determined, but also held a hint of uncertainty about the future.</p><p></p><p>More and more soldiers appeared, hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>More and more armored vehicles, as well as various fighter jets circling in the sky.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, this desolate Mitu Mountain was filled with so many people.</p><p></p><p>However, these people did not come to pay respects or sweep tombs.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, snippets of conversation could be heard among the soldiers.</p><p></p><p>"Is it all true?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this is too absurd!"</p><p></p><p>"Is God playing a joke on us?"</p><p></p><p>"The outside world is in chaos now, it's like doomsday!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard from Old Wang that just now, over a hundred people tried to break through the checkpoints and were all killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, they must be lapdogs of the capitalists!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shenkong's military boots made rustling sounds as he stepped on the weeds.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers' conversations reached his ears, and a complex, profound look appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The world is restarting?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this a joke played on us by the Creator?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be some mistake, this is too..."</p><p></p><p>"If it's true..."</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just one day ago, on Gongxing, all humans, whether sleeping, working, or mixing cement at construction sites, heard an cold, emotionless voice in their minds:</p><p></p><p>"The world will restart in 24 hours. An Zhentian, A Xiuci... Qi Yuan... Zheng Xi, a total of 99 people will return to 10 years ago with their memories intact."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this voice appeared in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>Even the deaf heard this message.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gongxing fell into chaos.</p><p></p><p>After all, this message was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>The world would restart?</p><p></p><p>Some people would be reborn 10 years in the past with their memories?</p><p></p><p>This caused huge unrest in various countries of Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Some people didn't take it seriously and didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Others went mad, thinking that since the world was about to restart... couldn't they do all the things they never dared to do before, all the things they had always wanted to do?</p><p></p><p>Order collapsed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Killing, rape, looting, destruction, arson... filled this once civilized society.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, those 99 people who were about to be reborn were completely controlled by the official forces of various countries.</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Yuan Kingdom, there were 35 such people.</p><p></p><p>One of them was on this Mitu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>These 35 people were divided up like fattened pigs among the great families of the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they could control someone who would be reborn with their memories intact, what a great opportunity that would be! The situation in the Qin Yuan Kingdom might change drastically, and the situation on Gongxing might become very different from before.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that the voice they heard was a hoax.</p><p></p><p>The world wouldn't restart, and no one would return to 10 years ago with their memories.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Li Shenkong had received orders from above to surround Mitu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Because according to their investigation, there was one of these "soon-to-be reborn" people in Mitu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, this particular soon-to-be reborn person was somewhat special.</p><p></p><p>"Report, sir. People from the Gongyi family have arrived."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice called out.</p><p></p><p>Li Shenkong's expression immediately became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Yuan Kingdom was jointly ruled by the royal family and the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>Among the Seven Martial Stars, there were 21 powerful families.</p><p></p><p>These 21 families were the true centers of power in the Qin Yuan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Although the Gongyi family had declined and could barely keep their seat among the Seven Martial Stars, they were still part of the Seven Martial Stars after all.</p><p></p><p>At this time, five planes landed on the hastily constructed airfield.</p><p></p><p>A group of over 20 people hurriedly walked over, their faces showing anxious expressions.</p><p></p><p>Li Shenkong quickly went to greet them: "Elder Cai!"</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai glanced at Li Shenkong and nodded, his face showing deep fatigue: "How's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>"We've found the target's grave, but haven't excavated it yet," Li Shenkong answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>The men and women behind Gongyi Cai showed anger in their eyes upon hearing Li Shenkong's words.</p><p></p><p>After all, if what everyone had heard was true, establishing good relations and reaching agreements with the reborn people in advance would definitely be beneficial for their families.</p><p></p><p>But the quota they had been assigned, that reborn person... was dead!</p><p></p><p>How were they supposed to work with that? Everyone present looked displeased.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Gongyi family still had some face. Besides this dead person, there was another reborn person that the Gongyi family could share with other families.</p><p></p><p>So the people who came to Mitu Mountain were only part of the Gongyi family, the less valued part.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!" Gongyi Cai said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they had to see the person's remains first.</p><p></p><p>The task assigned by the family still had to be carried out.</p><p></p><p>Although they couldn't reach an agreement, they still had to place the agreement in the grave.</p><p></p><p>In the minuscule chance that the person in the grave was reborn and took the agreement with them! Although the probability of this was zero.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the group of over 20 people arrived at a desolate tombstone.</p><p></p><p>This tombstone looked like it hadn't been visited for many years, overgrown with weeds.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai looked at it, took some flowers, and placed them in front of the grave.</p><p></p><p>The other Gongyi family members followed suit, offering flowers to this grave.</p><p></p><p>This bleak grave received many flowers on this special day.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a secretary-like person holding a stack of documents slowly spoke: "Name: Qi Yuan, born... 9 years ago, died at 19 years old. </p><p></p><p>Cause of death... cerebral hemorrhage."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

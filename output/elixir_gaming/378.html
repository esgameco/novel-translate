        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The wind blew.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>The speed was very fast, yet also seemed very slow. </p><p></p><p>With an "Ouch!", the white-haired old man fell directly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan retracted his fist and patted his sleeve, with quite the air of a master.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you're as strong as the opponents I faced when I became a Spirit Realm Martial Lord - all defeated in one move! It seems some titled Martial Lords really aren't weaker than ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan offered his assessment.</p><p></p><p>When he was a Spirit Realm Martial Lord, he had fought nearly ten thousand Martial Lords single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>Defeating them in one move, and facing the runner-up of the martial arts tournament also in one move.</p><p></p><p>So in Qi Yuan's eyes, they were equally strong.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man got up: "You rascal, couldn't you have gone a little easier on this old man? Aren't you afraid I'll just lie here and try to extort you?"</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the old man had become quite familiar with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he had trembled in fear for a few years after Qi Yuan the Immortal swallowed a star over a decade ago.</p><p></p><p>But... he had adapted. </p><p></p><p>At worst he'd die, so what the hell!</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid. We signed an agreement before going on stage. Even if there's compensation to be paid, the martial arts tournament will pay it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he walked towards the audience seats.</p><p></p><p>In the audience, the golden canary had been absent for many tournaments.</p><p></p><p>Now, the one cheering for Qi Yuan as his cheerleader was the cat-girl Xie Xinsu.</p><p></p><p>She wore a blue spaghetti strap top, raising little flags with her cat paws.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow!" </p><p></p><p>She cheered forcefully.</p><p></p><p>However, anyone could hear the reluctance and dissatisfaction in her tone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scooped up Xie Xinsu with one hand, unconsciously slipping his hand into her top to pet her.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu's meowing disappeared, her face showing an expression of giving up resistance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly froze: "Why does this feel a bit erotic?"</p><p></p><p>Normally petting a cat without clothes seemed very normal.</p><p></p><p>Slipping a hand into a top to pet a cat felt somewhat erotic.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's better to take it off before petting!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he pulled off Xie Xinsu's top.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At Tianyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes lowered her head. Under the eaves, fine rain fell like pearls. The sect leader wore cyan robes, her black hair falling to her waist.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the rain, her eyes filled with endless hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"The crisis shown by the Tianyuan Stone is getting closer and closer!" The sect leader spoke, her eyes filled with intense wariness.</p><p></p><p>"With that person here, does the crisis still exist?" The woman in tight clothes thought of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Qi Yuan swallowing the sun in one gulp was enough to shake heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if Tianyuan Sect's founder descended to this realm, she would be far inferior.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyuan Stone is a supreme treasure, it absolutely cannot be wrong." The sect leader said.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a gentle voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyuan Stone is a rare treasure in the world, it cannot be wrong.</p><p></p><p>It seems this realm is indeed about to be annihilated."</p><p></p><p>A woman wearing palace robes appeared. Her eyes were quite lively, and she wore a veil on her face, making it impossible to see her features clearly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the woman, the sect leader and the woman in tight clothes hurriedly bowed: "Greetings, Founder!"</p><p></p><p>The woman in palace robes was none other than Yu Mengxian, the descending founder who established Tianyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Mengxian raised her head to look at the sky, her eyes filled with complex emotions: "Without stars reflecting the myriad realms, this must be a strange place."</p><p></p><p>The upper realm was the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The countless stars in the Nine Heavens were the Yang Spirits reflecting the myriad realms, as well as the relatives and subordinates valued by the Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>In all the Nine Heavens, the lower realms and secret realms belonging to them could see the stars reflecting the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>But there were some strange places where the stars reflecting the myriad realms could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian had only heard of such strange places, but had never seen one. This was her first time seeing one.</p><p></p><p>"According to the Tianyuan Stone's indication, the Star-Gathering Realm will be extinguished, and may even affect the Fire Spirit Realm." Yu Mengxian said worriedly, "The calamity cannot be stopped. Only by returning to the upper realm can we escape danger!"</p><p></p><p>All sorts of changes occurring in strange places was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Founder cannot resolve this?" The sect leader asked.</p><p></p><p>In her heart, the Founder was the strongest being in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Forget about me, even the Yang Spirit Heavenly Lord presiding over the holy land I belong to in the upper realm probably... cannot resolve this." When mentioning the Yang Spirit Heavenly Lord, Yu Mengxian's eyes were filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Possessing a magical stone, her progress had been extremely fast, and she was now an Yin Spirit at the mythical level.</p><p></p><p>In the holy land, she had frequently achieved merits, and was even able to meet the Heavenly Lord once, being granted the ability to reflect the myriad realms by the Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>An Yin Spirit able to reflect the myriad realms was no ordinary Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Even in the holy land, she was considered top-tier.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Heavenly Lords of the upper realm cannot resolve this?" The sect leader was dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't there... a Heavenly Lord in this realm?</p><p></p><p>If the scene you recorded back then is true.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Lord is probably even more powerful than the Heavenly Lord in the holy land I belong to."</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian's mind trembled.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma bodies of Yang Spirits were very large, even larger than an entire realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Dharma bodies of ordinary Yang Spirits were only about the size of a normal star.</p><p></p><p>A Dharma body that could swallow a star whole was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"However, such an existence should not fear great calamities.</p><p></p><p>Even if this realm is destroyed, he would not die." Yu Mengxian said.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes heard this and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then, she seemed a bit confused again: "Founder, do you mean he... is still Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Her brother, that brother who had a mental illness, how could he suddenly become so powerful?</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyuan magical stone tells me that he is the Qi Yuan of this realm." Yu Mengxian murmured.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes heard this and breathed a sigh of relief: "That's good."</p><p></p><p>"Can you introduce me to this Heavenly Lord?" Yu Mengxian's attitude was very humble.</p><p></p><p>Every Heavenly Lord was worthy of her looking up to.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, that Heavenly Lord was even stronger than the Heavenly Lord of their holy land.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" The woman in tight clothes quickly said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the park, Qi Yuan held Xie Xinsu, lowering his head to look at the running track, his expression thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"To become a Myriad Dao Martial God, one must master myriad Daos."</p><p></p><p>"This running track... what Dao is this?"</p><p></p><p>He stared at the running track, looking without stopping.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a short-haired woman wearing revealing clothes walked over, her body carrying a slight smell of sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Handsome guy, your cat is quite cute. I like cats too. Can we exchange contact information?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't raise his head, saying softly: "You have a Dao on you too? Oh, I'm not interested in your Dao."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he left holding the cat.</p><p></p><p>The short-haired woman was stunned, her eyes widening. Seeming to think of something, she couldn't help but say: "What a loser!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored her.</p><p></p><p>Now, over these years, he had been using his footsteps to measure the world, comprehending the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>This kind of comprehension was very similar to cultivating immortality.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's ability to see hidden information with his eyes, his comprehension of the Dao was twice the result with half the effort.</p><p></p><p>Even difficult Daos were just average to him.</p><p></p><p>"This humble woman Yu Mengxian pays respects to the Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, holding Xie Xinsu, looked at the woman in palace robes and the woman in tight clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I'm out and about and didn't bring my bank card with me." Qi Yuan quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman in tight clothes said helplessly</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not here to ask for money back."</p><p></p><p>She already understood her brother's thought process.</p><p></p><p>Her mood was a bit relaxed - this brother was still the same as before, he should still be her brother.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and breathed a sigh of relief: "What are you here to see me for then?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian gracefully bowed, then said: "This humble girl is the founding master of the Tianyuan Sect, come from the upper realm. This realm... seems to be on the verge of destruction."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I know a thing or two about that, but I'm not very clear on the details," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yu Mengxian felt it was indeed as she expected. </p><p></p><p>The Tianyuan Stone knew the world was going to be destroyed - how could such a magnificent existence not know?</p><p></p><p>"Does the Heavenly Lord have a way to stop it?" Yu Mengxian asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "Actually I'm not very clear on it either, but well, I have to become the Myriad Dao Martial God, so naturally I won't let this world truly shatter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Yu Mengxian was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>She felt that this Heavenly Lord seemed somewhat unreliable.</p><p></p><p>He also lacked the dignity and mysteriousness of the Heavenly Lord of the holy land.</p><p></p><p>"If this realm shatters, I'm afraid mortals won't be able to survive. I will bring some people to leave this realm..." Yu Mengxian said, glancing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This woman in tight clothes had an intimate relationship with Qi Yuan. If she was going to take her to the upper realm, she naturally had to ask Qi Yuan's opinion.</p><p></p><p>However, taking people to the upper realm was extremely difficult. Even for her, she probably couldn't bring many.</p><p></p><p>"Do as you like, just don't interfere with me," Qi Yuan said carelessly. But then, thinking of something, he suddenly asked, "You're from the upper realm, do you know about the Moon Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the other party was definitely a powerful expert from the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>"This junior knows of it. The Moon Palace is a holy land force in the middle three heavens!" Yu Mengxian replied.</p><p></p><p>The upper realm was divided into nine heavens in total.</p><p></p><p>The lower three, middle three, and upper three.</p><p></p><p>The higher up, the more abundant the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>So the higher the heaven where a holy land was located, the stronger it was.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Palace was located in the sixth heaven.</p><p></p><p>"I have a wife who is a Moon Maiden from the Moon Palace, named Jin Li. Do you know her?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the illusory image of a woman appeared before Yu Mengxian.</p><p></p><p>As radiant as spring flowers, as beautiful as the autumn moon.</p><p></p><p>When she appeared, all the beauty in the world seemed like dust in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian and the tight-clothed woman's looks were completely overshadowed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never seen Jin Li, but he had seen the Jin Li transformed by Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Yu Mengxian's heart suddenly skipped a beat, "This junior saw this Moon Maiden in the Demon Abyss 700 years ago."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's emotions suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of time and space intersecting, of dream and reality.</p><p></p><p>The former Moon Maiden, the later Jin Li, at this moment, seemed so close to him, as if he could reach out and touch her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan also became poetic.</p><p></p><p>"No news for years, a thousand knots of separation sorrow.</p><p>When you saw her, how was she?"</p><p></p><p>"She... should be well in all respects.</p><p>This junior has heard that after this Moon Maiden returned to the Moon Palace, she has been constantly battling in the Demon Abyss, without rest, seemingly to gain more merits and then make a request to the Moon God Sovereign." Yu Mengxian glanced at Qi Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>In the Moon Palace, the status of Moon Maidens was especially unique.</p><p></p><p>They were almost raised as heirs.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maidens of the Moon Palace were not allowed to marry.</p><p></p><p>Once, a Yang God came to the Moon Palace, wanting to marry a Moon Maiden, and was directly driven out of the palace gates by the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Moon God Sovereign had said that Yang God could no longer enter any place illuminated by moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Now, she had many associations.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan sighed. Suddenly he thought of something, "Is there any way for me to contact her from the lower realm?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had already asked the Godless God to send a letter to the Moon Maiden.</p><p></p><p>But the Godless God was in the lower three heavens, and it would take many years to deliver a letter.</p><p></p><p>"In the lower realm... I'm afraid it's very difficult.</p><p>Oh right, this Moon Maiden, favored by the Moon God Sovereign, has stars that reflect across all heavens.</p><p>If she knows of your Heavenly Lord's star, you can move your star next to hers, and she should understand your meaning." Yu Mengxian said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it can be done like that?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean he could move one of his sun golden cores next to Jin Li's star?</p><p></p><p>Then, turn the sun golden core into a "heart" or "love brain" shape, and Jin Li would know he had come? Of course, she might not know.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jin Li didn't know that the sun in the sky was his golden core.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't important.</p><p></p><p>"Which star is hers, do you know?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Lord, please look!" Yu Mengxian waved her hand, and instantly, a star map appeared before Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This one is that Moon Maiden's star."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes fixed on that tiny star, a doting look appearing in his eyes: "So cute."</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu, held in Qi Yuan's arms, kept struggling, meowing.</p><p></p><p>"What's cute about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Lord, please be careful. The Moon God Sovereign is a powerful Yang God. Your star projection must not get too close to the Moon God Sovereign, otherwise it will be seen as provocation!" Yu Mengxian continued to warn.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I understand. Don't worry, I'm a good person, law-abiding, I never break rules." Qi Yuan agreed readily, but in his heart he was thinking about how to use the sun golden core to tell Jin Li he had come. "By the way, do you have any cultivation techniques that can change the shape of your projected star? It's always round, which is strange." Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Changing the sun into a heart shape, Jin Li would definitely know he had come.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, this junior has never heard of such a technique."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I still have too few golden cores.</p><p>If I had a few million, like drones forming words and patterns, I could directly transmit messages across realms."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p></p><p>If he had a few million golden cores, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>He could directly write a few big words in the sky of all heavens and realms using suns.</p><p></p><p>"Be civilized, establish new trends."</p><p></p><p>Mm, the atmosphere of the cultivation world would definitely improve.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian beside him was silent, not quite understanding Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan asked again: "Do you know Ruan Yixi? She's my master, and also my wife, and also from the Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengxian gave Qi Yuan a strange look: "I've never heard of her."</p><p></p><p>She had a feeling that if Qi Yuan appeared in the Moon Palace, he would definitely get beaten by the Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"If I write letters to them, how long would it take you to deliver them?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Probably... several years?" Yu Mengxian answered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the letter-writing matter couldn't be counted on.</p><p></p><p>The Godless God had already helped him send the letter up.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the game returned, after he resolved the great calamity, he could also go to the upper realm to see Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Having always been online friends with Jin Li, never meeting in person, to be honest, Qi Yuan's heart was quite nervous.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that they already had a child, they could barely be considered an old married couple, what was there to be shy about!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough talk. I still need to comprehend the myriad dao. Bye bye."</p><p></p><p>Having obtained useful information, Qi Yuan no longer spoke with Yu Mengxian.</p><p></p><p>He left holding Xie Xinsu.</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero One followed closely behind, just like a loyal servant and little follower.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

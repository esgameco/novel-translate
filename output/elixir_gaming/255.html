        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The door to the private room was violently thrown open.</p><p></p><p>Five cultivators filed in, their faces bearing unfriendly expressions.</p><p></p><p>The leader was the second shopkeeper who had been conversing with Elder Xiang Yun earlier. His expression was calm, as if everything was under control.</p><p></p><p>He was about to speak when one of the men among the Four Divine Flower Monarchs opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"These people aren't very good at doing business. They should at least wait for us to finish consuming and boost the GDP before coming to make trouble," said the speaker, who was Qi Yuan. "They're too impatient, can't accomplish big things this way."</p><p></p><p>They had just mentioned earlier that someone might come looking for trouble, and now it was happening directly.</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper was stunned by Qi Yuan's words, which he didn't quite understand. </p><p></p><p>He spoke unhurriedly: "The Wangxian Tower has lost a treasure, the Linglong Vase. One of our waiters saw that you were responsible. Please come with us."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rubbed his nose: "You should stop talking. Every time you speak, my nose gets longer."</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper frowned. This feeling of not being on the same wavelength in conversation was very unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a rather nervous-looking waiter walked in.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the waiter entered, he immediately fixed his gaze on Qi Yuan and the Hooligan Immortal Master, anxiously saying: "Manager, it was these two! I saw with my own eyes, they stole the Linglong Vase!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the door to the private room opened, and the cultivators outside heard the conversation inside.</p><p></p><p>No matter where, there are always many people who like to watch drama and gossip.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators were secretly paying attention to what was happening in this private room.</p><p></p><p>"They actually stole the Linglong Vase, the treasured possession of Wangxian Tower!"</p><p></p><p>"How bold of them!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, that person seems to be Feng Xie. He's actually come out of seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter... there's more to it than meets the eye."</p><p></p><p>These people were watching the commotion from not far away.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a man in green frowned, his eyes filled with concern: "Wangxian Tower is a property of the Phoenix Palace. This matter... is not so simple."</p><p></p><p>"Ye He, are you saying those people are targeting... Feng Xie?" Another man asked in a deep voice, his expression angry.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the people of Phoenix Palace are getting more and more excessive. Feng Jun is also that person's offspring... but the result..." Ye He spoke, his voice dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>In the Phoenix Celestial Realm, undercurrents surged.</p><p></p><p>The people of Phoenix Palace often secretly oppressed the disciples of Wenfen Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ye He's faction had quite good relations with Wenfen Mountain.</p><p></p><p>He and Feng Xie were also nodding acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Xie was being targeted, and the situation was quite critical.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, anger surged in the eyes of the Great Sun Flame Monarch: "Randomly finding someone to say my two brothers stole the Linglong Vase, can this be considered evidence?"</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper still spoke unhurriedly: "These two cultivators are acting suspiciously. If they want to prove their innocence, they need to hand over their storage bags for us to search!"</p><p></p><p>His words carried arrogance and a tone that brooked no refusal.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he had come to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Where in this world is there such a principle of having to prove one's own innocence?" the Great Sun Flame Monarch said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Although he had long known that someone might come to cause trouble, when it actually happened, he still felt indignant.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he had been in seclusion cultivating on Wenfen Mountain, rarely going out or making friends, for fear of affecting them.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman and the others, he had already expressed this concern to them before meeting in person.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't prove your innocence, what if you're wrongly accused?" At this time, a sarcastic voice came. Elder Xiang Yun walked over, his face bearing a haughty expression. He looked at the Great Sun Flame Monarch with a beaming smile.</p><p></p><p>"Originally I came to Wangxian Tower today to meet with a good friend, but there were no private rooms available on the ninth floor. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, your friend Feng Xie is interesting. By stealing the Linglong Vase, he just happened to free up a spot for me. I should really thank you for this!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Elder Xiang Yun took out a spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>"I'll reward you with this spirit stone, consider it payment for letting me have your private room."</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiang Yun knew how to humiliate people.</p><p></p><p>If it were others, encountering this situation, they could indeed only swallow their anger silently.</p><p></p><p>"I advise you to admit it early, suffer less physical pain. Otherwise... if it implicates the sects behind you, things won't be so simple then." Elder Xiang Yun's attitude was lofty and superior.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world has always been like this, with the strong being respected.</p><p></p><p>If in Cuiyun Continent, the Palace of Light might still be wary of some Yin spirit forces.</p><p></p><p>But in the Phoenix Celestial Realm, Phoenix Palace had no taboos.</p><p></p><p>Faced with true bigwigs, Elder Xiang Yun would be as humble as a servant, but when dealing with those weaker than him, he displayed his arrogance to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Flattering the powerful and bullying the weak, he was most skilled at this.</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper spoke up at this time, his voice indifferent: "If you two admit it and commit suicide to atone for your crime, it won't implicate the sects behind you. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>The few cultivators behind him looked unfriendly, emanating powerful auras.</p><p></p><p>Ye He, watching from not far away, frowned at this sight. He hurriedly came forward: "I can testify that after they entered the room, they didn't go out again. Everything... should be a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>Ye He's appearance was unexpected to everyone.</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiang Yun raised an eyebrow: "Ye He, do you know what you're saying?"</p><p></p><p>Ye He's identity was rather special.</p><p></p><p>When that legendary figure fell, he left behind his daughter, the Great Jasmine Venerable.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also left behind a disciple, who was the ancestor of Ye He's faction.</p><p></p><p>This disciple's attitude towards the Great Jasmine Venerable was not very good, and instead he was somewhat close to Feng Jun.</p><p></p><p>Phoenix Palace's attitude towards Ye He's faction was also quite ambiguous.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just stating the facts," Ye He said, his gaze firm, ready to lend a hand to the Great Sun Flame Monarch.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Monarch looked at Ye He with gratitude in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>To dare to speak up for him at this time, that was truly a friend worth trusting.</p><p></p><p>The second shopkeeper looked at Ye He and slowly said: "The Biluo Sect has always been on good terms with Wenfen Mountain. Ye He, your words can't be trusted. I'd rather believe what my waiter said."</p><p></p><p>"You're going too far!" Ye He couldn't help but say. "This is how you ruin Phoenix Palace's reputation. If Senior Tai Feng were still alive and saw you bullying people like this with your power, he would surely strike you dead!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Tai Feng was the only legendary figure of the Phoenix Celestial Realm who had fallen during the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The few great venerables in the Phoenix Celestial Realm now all had intricate connections with Senior Tai Feng.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor of the Biluo Sect was Tai Feng's disciple.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun of Wenfen Mountain was suspected to be Tai Feng's illegitimate son.</p><p></p><p>The Great Jasmine Venerable of Phoenix Palace was Tai Feng's daughter and heir.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Jasmine Venerable is Senior Tai Feng's own daughter, and Phoenix Palace was also entrusted to her management.</p><p></p><p>If Senior Tai Feng were alive and saw his disciple colluding with outsiders to steal the legendary secret treasures, he would probably destroy your Biluo Sect with one palm!" Elder Xiang Yun said.</p><p></p><p>Phoenix Palace never acknowledged that Feng Jun was Tai Feng's illegitimate son.</p><p></p><p>The Great Jasmine Venerable also didn't recognize Feng Jun as her brother.</p><p></p><p>The few cultivators on the scene were in confrontation, arguing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's eyes widened, his face showing a delighted expression: "You're from Phoenix Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiang Yun was stunned for a moment, then said: "Since you know we're from Phoenix Palace, why don't you commit suicide to atone for your crime?"</p><p></p><p>"It's all a misunderstanding," Qi Yuan said, his eyes</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhong's smile was radiant. "Actually... I can barely be considered half a member of the Phoenix Palace."</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiangyun and the Second Shopkeeper exchanged glances, looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, half a member of Phoenix Palace, and you dare to claim connections?" Elder Xiangyun thought for a moment, not recalling this young man among the second generation of Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>So even if this man was from Phoenix Palace, he must be of low status there.</p><p></p><p>Such a person would be even easier to push around.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan sneered, "It seems you have high positions in Phoenix Palace? </p><p></p><p>Come on, tell me, who are your backers in Phoenix Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiangyun's eyes showed disdain: "My father is an elder of Phoenix Palace, the Venerable Xiangshan! What, am I not qualified to clean house on behalf of Phoenix Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Within Phoenix Palace, besides the Great Venerable Jasmine, there were five Yin Spirit Venerables. Venerable Xiangshan was one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Mere son of an elder, how dare you be so arrogant, do you know... who I am?" Qi Yuan looked at Elder Xiangyun, overbearing and haughty, like a spoiled young master.</p><p></p><p>This aura even shocked Elder Xiangyun.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the illegitimate son of some elder? But even so, he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to know, who is your backer!" Elder Xiangyun sneered.</p><p></p><p>Ye He, standing nearby, was also stunned upon hearing this, not expecting the situation to develop in this direction.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master also had a confused look.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers nearby were watching this scene with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, is this internal strife within Phoenix Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity for that young man. Even if he's an elder's illegitimate son, openly dining with Feng Xie means he's destined for a bad end in Phoenix Palace."</p><p></p><p>No one held out much hope for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Phoenix Palace suppressing Wen Feng Mountain was politically correct.</p><p></p><p>As a result, an elder's illegitimate son gathering with Feng Xie from Wen Feng Mountain, what did this mean?</p><p></p><p>At the lightest, he'd be kicked out; at worst, that elder might even beat him to death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "I'm afraid if I say it, you'll be shocked!"</p><p></p><p>This feeling of having a backer was good.</p><p></p><p>When someone picked a fight, he could directly play the "my father is Zhang Erhe" card, which was sure to work.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan had no father now.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiangyun sneered without speaking.</p><p></p><p>The Second Shopkeeper also had a look of watching a show.</p><p></p><p>"Since you still won't admit your mistake, I'll have to call someone," Qi Yuan said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiangyun looked at Qi Yuan as if watching a joke.</p><p></p><p>The others present also looked excited.</p><p></p><p>"Fight, fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Who knew eating a meal would come with entertainment!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, in this confrontation, Elder Xiangyun is already in an unbeatable position!"</p><p></p><p>Those gathered here for the meeting were either rich or noble.</p><p></p><p>They were all quite clear about the conflict between Phoenix Palace and Wen Feng Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan's backer was also a Yin Spirit, he couldn't compare to Elder Xiangyun.</p><p></p><p>Calling someone over would only be asking for humiliation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly looked up at the Great Sun Flame Emperor: "Is Phoenix Palace in Qinghong City?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>Both Phoenix Palace and Seeking Dao Palace were in Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>Qinghong City was also the first city of the Phoenix Heavenly Domain.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators who saw this scene all chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Not even knowing Phoenix Palace was in Qinghong City, yet claiming to be from Phoenix Palace?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a powerful aura emanated from Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>A strong smell of blood permeated the air at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His robes also turned blood-red at this instant.</p><p></p><p>A voice that seemed able to pierce the heavens exploded in every cultivator's ears at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Jasmine, aren't you secretly in love with me? Now, I, the Blood-Robed Sword God, have come to Wangxian Tower. Won't you come out to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was like a thunderclap, carrying intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, it suddenly swept across all of Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators or ordinary people in every corner of Qinghong City heard this voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"What... Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God has come!"</p><p></p><p>"That god of killing has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The voice resounded, penetrating Seeking Dao Palace and Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>In Seeking Dao Palace, a towering man furrowed his brows, his gaze profound, before finally closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In Phoenix Palace, several elders who heard this voice were all somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because this shout was beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>Logically, even if the Blood-Robed Sword God came... shouldn't he come see Great Venerable Jasmine discreetly?</p><p></p><p>How could it be like this? At this time, deep in Phoenix Palace, a woman in colorful robes, wearing a lightless glazed colorful robe, lay languidly on the bed, her jade body stretched out, looking quite charming. A trace of playful smile appeared in her eyes: "Interesting."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Wangxian Tower, all the cultivators were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Especially Elder Xiangyun, with a face full of shock: "You are the Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>How is this possible!</p><p></p><p>How could the young man before him possibly be the Eastern Lands hegemon, the Blood-Robed Sword God! The Blood-Robed Sword God's reputation was also great in the Phoenix Heavenly Domain.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, when Great Venerable Jasmine rejected Great Venerable Wujun, she mentioned that her heart admired the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Only then did people in the Phoenix Heavenly Domain investigate what kind of person the Blood-Robed Sword God was.</p><p></p><p>Upon investigation, they discovered that the Blood-Robed Sword God was a god of killing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not just an ordinary god of killing! Ordinary Yin Spirit powerhouses who could be called gods of killing at most killed opponents of the same level, or at worst Purple Palace powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God was different. He killed Yin Spirits, Purple Palaces, and even... didn't spare Yuan Dan and Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God's reason for killing was also very simple.</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Flower Society's forum, anyone who slandered him, he would directly go find them, bringing a suona music band, and start killing.</p><p></p><p>Not even sparing Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Blood-Robed Sword God became famous in the Phoenix Heavenly Domain, and even had many fans.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the onlooking cultivators in Wangxian Tower changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"He is the Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"He's actually the Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>"I should probably... maybe... hopefully didn't say anything bad about him just now, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed a talented and handsome man, no wonder Great Venerable Jasmine would fall for him!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Elder Xiangyun's legs couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Second Shopkeeper's forehead was covered in sweat.</p><p></p><p>A man's reputation is like a tree's shadow.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who knew of the Blood-Robed Sword God knew he was a monstrous demon who killed without blinking.</p><p></p><p>He had killed who knows how many Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it he had killed over a hundred Purple Palace cultivators, single-handedly causing the Eastern Lands cultivation world to regress ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan before them, in a blood-red robe, his whole body emanating a thick bloody aura, killing intent condensed into substance.</p><p></p><p>Other than the Blood-Robed Sword God, who else could have such an aura?</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiangyun had thought the other party's background was formidable, but never imagined it would be this formidable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was in a dilemma, his face full of painful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"A misunderstanding... it's all a misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>He really couldn't understand how the mighty Blood-Robed Sword God, a Yin Spirit powerhouse comparable to a Great Venerable, would be sworn brothers with a cultivator like Feng Xie.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

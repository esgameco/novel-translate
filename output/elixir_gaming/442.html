        <h1>Chapter 442</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[The Enlightenment Blood Pill, when taken, can temporarily stimulate enlightenment and enhance bloodline. There are several loopholes, if modified... the effect can be increased threefold.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this information, Qi Yuan furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>"This is good stuff. My brain has been a bit inadequate lately, I can't even win arguments against Sister Niujiao. </p><p></p><p>When I go to the Ultimate Dao Conference, I'll eat this and definitely become much smarter."</p><p></p><p>Enhancing enlightenment and bloodline to boost brainpower in the short term was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"However... this pill can still be optimized..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pill, Qi Yuan prepared to hand it over to his divine infant.</p><p></p><p>His gaze then fell on the Ten Thousand Souls Banner he had picked up from Mona.</p><p></p><p>"This banner violates the natural order, but... the idea is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, his eyes seeing many things.</p><p></p><p>This soul banner required collecting the souls of worldly creatures to strengthen it.</p><p></p><p>With one wave of the banner, heaven and earth would shatter.</p><p></p><p>"Why not refine a Human Emperor Banner based on this?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had been thinking about refining a magical treasure of creation.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had been researching magical treasures of creation during this time.</p><p></p><p>Magical treasures of creation were divided into many types, including auxiliary and combat types.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ultimate Principle, Wall of Ultimate Principle, Demon Well, and Buddha Land all belonged to the auxiliary type.</p><p></p><p>Combat types were relatively rare.</p><p></p><p>Many combat-type magical treasures of creation were artificially modified... refined.</p><p></p><p>For Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables, combat-type magical treasures provided an extremely terrifying boost to combat power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan was just thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Modifying or refining combat-type magical treasures was no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>It required a Great Ultimate Principle realm expert with great fortune, consuming endless years of grinding to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>"For now, I should focus on cultivating the Ancestral Blood Scripture to increase my cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Dao Conference was about to begin, and Qi Yuan needed to rapidly increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he encountered a powerful enemy without the ability to protect himself, he could only cry.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan waved his hand, and the ancestral blood spirit water collected by Little Ziyuan appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was very red, like blood, and had an iron rust smell.</p><p></p><p>"Why does it look a bit like menstrual blood?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't think further about it, but instead received data from the intelligent micro-detection bugs to locate the ancestral blood.</p><p></p><p>If cultivating step by step, Qi Yuan estimated it would take a hundred years to complete.</p><p></p><p>This hundred years referred to the Sixth Heaven realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Fifth Heaven, or worlds with faster time flow, it would take even longer than a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years was too long.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still a young man now. Although he had spent a long time in the game, he was just over twenty in reality.</p><p></p><p>"I'm barely at the Ultimate Principle realm now, I'm still too weak!"</p><p></p><p>"I need to hurry and gain more ability to protect myself!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the ancestral blood spirit water, seeking the path of black magic ancestral blood was a long and arduous journey.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ghost Dominion Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Gloomy and terrifying, dark and eerie.</p><p></p><p>An Ultimate Principle realm expert appeared, with three heads atop his body - an old man, a woman, and a child.</p><p></p><p>These three faces were related to this Ultimate Principle expert's dao.</p><p></p><p>Killing too many of a certain type of person would solidify into one head.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The several Yang Spirits present bowed their heads, expressions respectful.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Faced Celestial Venerable's gaze was frenzied, terrifying yet powerful.</p><p></p><p>He had once killed a Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable, his battle prowess especially shocking.</p><p></p><p>Among the Ultimate Principle realm Yang Spirits in Ghost Dominion Heaven, he was supreme.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirits present mostly dared not meet the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their thoughts were complicated.</p><p></p><p>After all, just now, the Great Ultimate Principle expert from Black Magic Abyss had killed a Yang Spirit from Ghost Dominion Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This made all the Yang Spirits present feel alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Their strength was formidable, but when facing a Great Ultimate Principle expert, it was not enough to escape.</p><p></p><p>Could this be Black Magic Abyss's declaration of war against Ghost Dominion Heaven?</p><p></p><p>Without the Great Ultimate Principle experts emerging, the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable was the actual controller of Ghost Dominion Heaven.</p><p></p><p>They all wanted to know how the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable viewed this matter.</p><p></p><p>"The Banner Master says that after the Ultimate Dao Conference ends, we will go to war with several factions of Black Magic Abyss!" the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable spoke frenziedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present had their expressions change.</p><p></p><p>Because this news was too unexpected for them.</p><p></p><p>How did the Banner Master suddenly become so brave?</p><p></p><p>It was well known that Black Magic Abyss's hard power definitely surpassed Ghost Dominion Heaven's.</p><p></p><p>Going to war over the death of one Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable seemed too childish.</p><p></p><p>After all, friction between such major powers was common, but actual declarations of war were rare.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present were not fools. They instantly sensed that the waters behind this ran deep, and it certainly wasn't so simple.</p><p></p><p>"As for the reason..." The Three-Faced Celestial Venerable narrowed his eyes, "You'll know after the Ultimate Dao Conference ends."</p><p></p><p>He looked at these Yang Spirits with pity and regret in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Cultivated to the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable realm, with lifespans as long as heaven and earth, bodies unharmed even as stars fell.</p><p></p><p>Without powerful enemies, not attempting breakthroughs and encountering the Root Demon Tribulation, they were almost worry-free, with no need to fear perishing.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately... they had encountered Lin Ya Tui.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Banner Master mention Lin Ya Tui, even the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that beings as powerful as Yang Spirits... able to destroy the Heavenly Dao with a wave of the hand, able to devour worlds, were in some sense merely pawns.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Lin Ya Tui, they did not know.</p><p></p><p>Generally, only Great Ultimate Principle experts and some special creatures knew of this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Going to war with Black Magic Abyss, the battle lines may span ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Black Magic Abyss has produced several good seedlings, one Black Sword, one Blood Robe."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning Black Sword, even the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>That one was even singled out by the Banner Master, who wished to kill him as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>His talent... was unparalleled, but acceptable, as the Sixth Heaven did not lack for geniuses.</p><p></p><p>But... his bloodline was very frightening.</p><p></p><p>Especially Black Magic Abyss's top-tier bloodline, combined with terrifying talent, would be a deadly combination.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Master even speculated that individual had a chance to become a Great Ultimate Principle expert who grasped the Supreme Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>This made the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable even more envious and jealous.</p><p></p><p>Great Ultimate Principle experts who grasped the Supreme Ultimate Principle numbered less than two handfuls in the entire Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Their Ghost Dominion Heaven had many Great Ultimate Principle experts, but not one who grasped the Supreme Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>"When the Ultimate Dao Conference begins, Fog Lord, you will be responsible for killing Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>The Three-Faced Celestial Venerable said calmly, killing intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because Fog Lord Celestial Venerable was a perfected Great Celestial Position Yang Spirit, only one step away from the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was going to participate in the Ultimate Dao Conference, with a very high probability of entering the Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>How many years had it been since Black Sword entered the Yang Spirit realm?</p><p></p><p>Was it even 3000 years? In the Yang Spirit realm, he was only considered a newcomer. Sending a perfected Great Celestial Position expert showed how highly they regarded him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Fog Lord Celestial Venerable's expression was calm, his face covered by a layer of mist, making his features unclear.</p><p></p><p>"As for Blood Robe..." The Three-Faced Celestial Venerable looked at everyone, his expression relaxed, "Who wants this small merit?"</p><p></p><p>Killing Black Sword would definitely be a great merit for Ghost Dominion Heaven, even the Banner Master would reward it.</p><p></p><p>As for Blood Robe, it was just a small merit.</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Robe was powerful, but in the eyes of these Yang Spirits, anyone not in the Yang Spirit realm was nothing special.</p><p></p><p>"This old one will personally handle it," Great Joy Celestial Venerable stepped forward, smiling, "Even a mosquito's meat is still meat."</p><p></p><p>"Very well," the Three-Faced Celestial Venerable nodded.</p><p></p><p>Originally he had thought to send a few Mythical realm experts to kill Blood Robe, but that wasn't very reliable.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To be on the safe side, you two can borrow the avatar of the Ten Thousand Souls Ghost Banner to draw them into the strange realm and kill them!" said the Three Aspects Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>With the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable taking action, plus the avatar of the Ten Thousand Souls Ghost Banner, killing two geniuses in the strange realm would be extremely simple. </p><p></p><p>Presumably, the Black Demon Abyss never imagined that Ghost Dominator Heaven would actually dare to retaliate, even declare war.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult as ascending to the blue sky," Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>Then he realized.</p><p></p><p>"These ancient sayings are outdated now. Isn't it quite easy to go up to the blue sky?"</p><p></p><p>There's also the saying "Even if you haven't eaten pork, you've seen pigs run."</p><p></p><p>Now it should be changed to "Even if you haven't seen pigs run, you've eaten pork."</p><p></p><p>"Through my hard work, plus a little Ancestral Demon Blood, I've finally reached the eleventh level of the Ancestral Blood Scripture."</p><p></p><p>During this time, Qi Yuan followed Purple Origin Ancestor's instructions and didn't leave the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, he had many divine infant bodies.</p><p></p><p>When he learned about the whereabouts of some Ancestral Demon Blood from the intelligent micro-detection bugs, he sent divine infants to find it.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Ancestral Demon Blood consumed, he finally entered the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>At the ninth level, Qi Yuan's Ten Thousand Dao Martial God power was comparable to a Principle realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Now at the eleventh level, the increase in combat power was extremely terrifying. </p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan knew he was still far from a Great Principle realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"But now if I encounter a Great Principle expert... I should be able to escape, right?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Both Principle and Great Principle were in the second layer of the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too big.</p><p></p><p>The further one progressed, the gap between small realms could be even bigger than the gap between major realms earlier on.</p><p></p><p>"I need to comprehend a Supreme Principle, otherwise I won't feel safe," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>However, his foundation was too weak.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>His realm level was not high enough.</p><p></p><p>Even if he comprehended a Supreme Principle, he probably wouldn't be a match for those veteran Great Principle experts of the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I'd lose fighting that Tai Huang Palace expert, but I'd win arguing with Sister Ox Horn."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan's mood improved.</p><p></p><p>A Supreme Principle was still very useful.</p><p></p><p>When his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation reached a level comparable to Great Principle, combined with a Supreme Principle, he could probably contend with that Great Principle expert from Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to ask Purple Origin Ancestor how strong Great Principle experts really are," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He still didn't have a clear understanding of Great Principle experts.</p><p></p><p>Conveniently, Purple Origin Ancestor had said he could call him when he reached the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>"Old Deng, are you there?" Qi Yuan removed all formations and called out to the air.</p><p></p><p>It was very quiet, with no response.</p><p></p><p>"Old Deng, I've reached the ninth level of the Ancestral Blood Scripture!"</p><p></p><p>Still no response.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Old Deng is you, Purple Origin Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly remembered he hadn't called the other party by name.</p><p></p><p>He might not have heard.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, time and space in the world seemed to freeze, and Purple Origin Ancestor's faint voice came: "What is it now?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say I could find you at the ninth level? I've reached the ninth level!"</p><p></p><p>"The... ninth level?" Purple Origin Ancestor swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Last time... wasn't it still the seventh level?</p><p></p><p>It hadn't even been a year.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... understandable.</p><p></p><p>"What do you need?" Though shocked inside, he still pretended to be nonchalant.</p><p></p><p>"I want to know... how strong are Great Principle experts, for example... what level are you among Great Principle experts?" Qi Yuan looked at Purple Origin Ancestor seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, why are you asking about this?" Purple Origin Ancestor turned his head, "Among Great Principle experts, this old one ranks in the third tier."</p><p></p><p>"Top three? Pretty strong. How many tiers are there in total?"</p><p></p><p>"...Three tiers."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so you're last place. You don't seem that impressive?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I can still easily defeat you." Purple Origin Ancestor had a very good temper.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>No one else in Purple Origin Heaven would dare speak to him like this.</p><p></p><p>"The third tier is like me, generally having survived three Root Demon Tribulations, with one auxiliary-type Primordial Treasure," Purple Origin Ancestor said.</p><p></p><p>"Root Demon Tribulation?" Qi Yuan heard this term again.</p><p></p><p>"For all Principle realm experts who want to increase their strength, they need to survive Root Demon Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>This is a terrifying tribulation, related to mental state and cultivation, yet unrelated.</p><p></p><p>It has no pattern and is chaotic.</p><p></p><p>As for Root Demon Tribulations, you can think of them as the Lightning Tribulations or Heart Demon Tribulations of ancient times." Mentioning Root Demon Tribulations, Purple Origin Ancestor's eyes held a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>After reaching Great Principle, he had now survived three tribulations. For the next Root Demon Tribulation... he wasn't confident he could pass it.</p><p></p><p>If he tried to pass it, he might die.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying, the Great Principle realm is measured by the number of Root Demon Tribulations survived?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes and no." Purple Origin Ancestor explained, "For example, Penglai Celestial Venerable has only survived one tribulation. My cultivation surpasses his, but in a fight with him, I couldn't even injure him.</p><p></p><p>Surviving tribulations can increase cultivation, but it's not the decisive factor.</p><p></p><p>The decisive factors are Primordial Treasures and the grade of one's Principle."</p><p></p><p>Penglai Celestial Venerable was a newly promoted Great Principle expert of the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened carefully, as this was very important.</p><p></p><p>"However, if I were a Great Principle expert with an offensive Primordial Treasure, I could injure him," Purple Origin Ancestor said, his expression complex. "This is the second tier of Great Principle experts. Offensive Primordial Treasures are too rare, extremely uncommon."</p><p></p><p>Offensive Primordial Treasures were mostly improved from ordinary Primordial Treasures by Great Principle experts who once grasped Supreme Principles, through endless years under great opportunities. They were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In the current Black Demon Abyss, only two Great Principle experts possessed offensive Primordial Treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The first tier, you should also know, are Great Principle experts who have grasped Supreme Principles and possess offensive Primordial Treasures.</p><p></p><p>They... can kill other Great Principle experts!" Purple Origin Ancestor's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered: "I have a question."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"What if a Great Principle expert who has grasped a Supreme Principle doesn't have an offensive Primordial Treasure? And what about a Great Principle expert who doesn't have any Primordial Treasure at all?</p><p></p><p>What tier would the former rank, and what tier would the latter rank?"</p><p></p><p>"If a Great Principle expert who has grasped a Supreme Principle can't obtain an offensive Primordial Treasure, he'd be too ashamed to live and would be dead. That doesn't exist," Purple Origin Ancestor said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Although offensive Primordial Treasures were rare, those Great Principle experts who grasped Supreme Principles were all ancestors of major forces. How could they not obtain offensive Primordial Treasures?</p><p></p><p>As for auxiliary Primordial Treasures, some forces in the Fifth Heaven and higher also had them. If Great Principle experts wanted them, how could they not obtain them?</p><p></p><p>"Are Great Principle experts that fragile?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. "Let's say I have a Great Principle enemy. If I cyberbully him every day and mobilize an army of trolls, could we insult him to death?"</p><p></p><p>With so many divine infants, it would be interesting if he could insult that Tai Huang Palace expert to death.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost..." Purple Origin Ancestor was completely speechless.</p><p></p><p>Can't you understand human speech?</p><p></p><p>PS: There's a red envelope password in the author's note.</p><p></p><p>PS: Sorry, I had some health issues, but I'm starting to resume updates! </p><p></p><p>Mainly, everyone has different writing habits, which may also be related to blood sugar. The author gets drowsy as soon as he eats and can't write, or rather can't maintain high energy to write. It doesn't affect doing other things that don't require much thinking.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I can force myself to write, but... ahem, I already write poorly, so it would be even worse.</p><p></p><p>My state really affects me a lot. Whether I'm focused and serious or not can easily be seen in the plot.</p><p></p><p>So for many days I've been writing on an empty stomach, only daring to eat once a day. This continued for a long time, and my body developed some minor issues.</p><p></p><p>Now I've bought some brown sugar and am striving to change this bad habit!</p><p></p><p>Finally, I sincerely apologize!</p><p></p><p>I'm sending out an Alipay red envelope. Hurry and claim it, gentlemen, but don't share it in groups.</p><p></p><p>The password is "Golden Core is a star", six characters!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

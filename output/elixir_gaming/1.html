        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>The morning bell rang continuously, and all the disciples awoke, their spirits bright and exhaling the refined qi.</p><p></p><p>The sound of morning practice echoed throughout the sect.</p><p></p><p>Full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Color Peak, Qi Yuan was lying on the bed, and the morning bell was particularly jarring to his ears, so he covered them.</p><p></p><p>The wooden cat puppet also opened its mouth appropriately and made a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Time to get up!"</p><p></p><p>"Time to get up!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, stuffing a small dried fish into the wooden cat puppet's mouth, and it immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He changed his position and slept comfortably.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "When the sun is high, I alone sleep; who is the immortal, I am the immortal!" It was a while before Qi Yuan finally woke up.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath of air.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the air from this otherworldly realm is quite sweet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was originally a member of the countless beings on the Blue Star, but half a year ago, he had crossed over to this world.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous world, this world had the extraordinary, the existence of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>By a stroke of luck, Qi Yuan was accepted into the Divine Light Gate and became a disciple of the Seven-Color Peak, the only one.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished his ablutions, got dressed, and left the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, the Sect Master had sent a message, instructing him on some matters.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood on the middle slope, looking up at the peak, towering into the clouds, with immortal qi drifting.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the palace in the clouds and murmured, "Another day longing for the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>The clouds on the peak suddenly rippled and then dissipated in an instant, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master lived on the peak, and a prohibition had been placed, not allowing Qi Yuan to go up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not see the gathering and dispersing of the clouds on the peak, and he went down the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Today was the Divine Light Sect's disciple recruitment ceremony.</p><p></p><p>He was about to represent the Seven-Color Peak, one of the five peaks of the Divine Light Sect, to recruit disciples.</p><p></p><p>The vast Seven-Color Peak had only him, an incompetent disciple, and the sect had some opinions about this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak was powerful, so those opinions could only be kept to themselves.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the current Qi Yuan has also given the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak some opinions, so he planned to recruit some more disciples.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slowly walked down the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the middle slope, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>There was a large tree here, several zhang (about 10 meters) tall, and when looking down from above, [this was a somewhat unusual small grass, but three days ago, the True Lord of Withered Wood and the Grand Empress of the Great Merchant had a secret meeting here.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood under the big tree, and he swept his eyes over the lush, verdant grass on the ground, and a series of words flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, a few days ago when he came here, what his eyes saw was... [This is an ordinary grass, but four days ago, a stray dog urinated on it.]</p><p></p><p>"This grass is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>After entering the Qi Refining stage, Qi Yuan found that his eyes had some problems and could see things that others could not.</p><p></p><p>For example, the first time he looked at the cultivation technique the Sect Master gave him, the "Seven-Color Refining Fire Technique."</p><p></p><p>What he saw was... [This is a jade-grade cultivation technique, with 1,371 obvious flaws, and numerous other flaws.</p><p>Cultivating to the supreme realm will turn one into a certain indescribable resource.]</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan, who saw this information, was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He then went to look at other cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>For the most part, they were similar.</p><p></p><p>Supreme realm?</p><p>Resource?</p><p>Very distant? Not something a small Qi Refining cultivator like him should consider.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his cultivation was also stuck at the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Because, according to what his eyes saw, once he broke through the boundaries, it would confirm his identity as a "resource."</p><p></p><p>So, the current Qi Yuan has been constantly searching for a suitable cultivation technique and working hard for it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sect's main hall, the divine light scattered.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Kong Fulou held a feather duster and sat in the air.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the other peak's senior disciples stood upright.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu looked at the hundreds of new disciples who had just passed the entrance examination, with a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he slowly asked, "Haven't the people from the Seven-Color Peak arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Kang, you know the personality of the senior disciple from the Seven-Color Peak..." a man in golden robes said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu heard this and did not speak further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came, "The senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak, Qi Yuan, has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Following this voice, Qi Yuan, dressed in white robes, appeared before the crowd, his figure upright, with a jade pendant at his waist, walking towards the light.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples of the Divine Light Sect, as well as the new disciples, looked at Qi Yuan with different expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Senior Brother Qi Yuan to come down the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>"He's even more handsome than the rumors say."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, such a graceful person, but..."</p><p></p><p>"But what?"</p><p></p><p>"He has strange behavior, and mental problems!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not really that, it's just that his cultivation is different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>He belongs to the 'Foolish' lineage, and the cultivators of this lineage all have somewhat unique personalities!"</p><p></p><p>"The mental illness of the cultivation world? Best not to provoke him, best not to provoke him."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be fooled by his craziness, he is truly a genius, and many senior brothers and sisters will go to him for advice on cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The disciples below discussed animatedly, and many of them had somewhat strange gazes towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Canglan Realm, there are three things not to provoke.</p><p></p><p>First, not to provoke physicians; second, not to provoke sword cultivators; third, not to provoke 'Foolish' cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Physicians master medical arts and can heal injuries, so cultivators may need their help when injured in battles, so it's best not to offend them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, physicians are usually also adept at refining strange poisons and toxic pills, able to kill people invisibly, so it's best not to offend them.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators have terrifying combat power and decisive actions, so it's best not to provoke them.</p><p></p><p>As for 'Foolish' cultivators, they are rather unique.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of this lineage are devoted to one thing.</p><p></p><p>It could be a sword, a flower, or even a person.</p><p></p><p>This extreme devotion means they may have some mental issues.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators are not easy to provoke, who knows when their mental illness might make them go berserk? And Qi Yuan is one of the 'Foolish' cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, you're a bit late," Kang Fulu said softly.</p><p></p><p>"I slept too late last night," Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>The other peak's senior disciples saw this and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu said, "Now that everyone is here, let's start recruiting disciples."</p><p></p><p>The square was now filled with disciples who had just passed the entrance examination.</p><p></p><p>And the senior disciples of their various peaks were responsible for selecting candidates to be admitted into their respective peaks.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu stepped forward and looked at the hundreds of new disciples below, slowly speaking.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Light Sect is one of the three great cultivation sects in the Great Xia."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to all of you for passing the arduous examinations, and from now on you will be disciples of the Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of young men and women on the square heard this, all somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divine Light Sect is one of the three strongest cultivation sects in the Great Xia.</p><p></p><p>Once they join the sect, they will be considered superior.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was very satisfied with the performance of the crowd, and he continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Light Sect has five peaks, and you may choose one to enter."</p><p></p><p>"This is the senior disciple of the Divine Pill Peak, Zhugeliu."</p><p></p><p>"This is the senior disciple of the Myriad Laws Peak, Xu Yiyi."</p><p></p><p>"This is the senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak, Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"This is the senior disciple of the Struggle Peak, Kuangren."</p><p></p><p>"I am Kang Fulu, the closed-door disciple of the Peak Lord of the Five Light Peak, the son-in-law of the Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect, the culmination of the Five Light Saint Law, the founder of the Little Sunlight Technique, and the foremost senior disciple of the Five Light Peak."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Kang Fulu spoke, and five-colored divine light suddenly appeared on his head, making him look extremely extraordinary and conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Kang Fulu is known as the most eye-catching figure of the Five Light Peak.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

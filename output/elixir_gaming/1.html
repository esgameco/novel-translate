        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>The morning bell rang continuously, waking all the disciples who began to cultivate with vigor, inhaling and exhaling to refine their qi.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of morning practice echoed throughout the entire sect.</p><p></p><p>Full of youthful energy.</p><p></p><p>On Seven-Color Peak, Qi Yuan lay in bed, the morning bell especially grating to his ears. He covered his ears.</p><p></p><p>The wooden cat puppet also appropriately opened its mouth and made sounds.</p><p></p><p>"Time to get up!"</p><p></p><p>"Time to get up!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand and stuffed a small dried fish into the wooden cat puppet's mouth, instantly silencing it.</p><p></p><p>He changed positions and went back to sleep comfortably.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, I alone sleep while the sun is high - who is the immortal? I am the immortal! After an unknown amount of time, Qi Yuan finally woke up leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the air in this other world is quite sweet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was originally one of the countless masses on Blue Star, but had transmigrated to this world half a year ago.</p><p></p><p>Unlike his previous world, this world had supernatural powers and cultivators seeking immortality.</p><p></p><p>By chance, Qi Yuan had joined the Divine Light Sect, becoming a disciple of Seven-Color Peak - in fact, the only disciple.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished washing up, got dressed, and left his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, his master had sent a message with some instructions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood halfway up the mountain and looked up towards the peak, which soared into the clouds, ethereal and misty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gazed at the palace in the clouds and said softly, "Another day of missing Master."</p><p></p><p>The clouds at the peak instantly rippled and then dissipated in a moment, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Master lived at the peak and had set up restrictions preventing Qi Yuan from going up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't see the clouds gather and disperse at the peak. He walked down Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Today was the Divine Light Sect's disciple recruitment ceremony.</p><p></p><p>He was to represent Seven-Color Peak, one of the sect's five peaks, to recruit disciples.</p><p></p><p>The vast Seven-Color Peak had only him, an incompetent disciple, which the sect had some opinions about.</p><p></p><p>Of course, since Seven-Color Peak's leader was powerful, those opinions could only be kept to themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, the current Qi Yuan also displeased Seven-Color Peak's leader, which is why they planned to recruit more disciples.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slowly walked down Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Halfway down the mountain, Qi Yuan stopped.</p><p></p><p>There was a large tree here, several zhang tall. Looking down from above [This is a somewhat unusual small plant, but three days ago, True Immortal Withered Wood and the empress of Great Shang had a tryst on it.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood under the big tree and glanced at the lush green grass on the ground. A string of text floated up in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, when he came here a few days ago, what his eyes saw was...</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary small plant, but four days ago, a wild dog urinated on it.]</p><p></p><p>"This grass is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>After entering the Qi Refining stage, Qi Yuan discovered his eyes had some issues and could see things others couldn't.</p><p></p><p>For example, the first time he looked at the cultivation manual his master gave him.</p><p></p><p>"Seven-Color Fire Refining Scripture"</p><p></p><p>What he saw was...</p><p></p><p>[This is a jade-grade cultivation manual with 1,371 obvious flaws and numerous other flaws.</p><p>Cultivating it to the supreme realm will turn one into nourishment for an unnameable being.]</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan was stunned when he saw this information.</p><p></p><p>He went to look at other cultivation manuals.</p><p></p><p>They were all more or less the same.</p><p></p><p>Supreme realm? </p><p></p><p>Nourishment?</p><p></p><p>Very distant? Not something a small Qi Refining cultivator like him needed to consider.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his cultivation was also stuck at Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Because according to what his eyes saw, once he broke through to the next realm, it would confirm his status as nourishment.</p><p></p><p>So now, Qi Yuan was constantly searching for a suitable cultivation manual, and working hard towards this goal.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sect's main hall, divine light scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>White-haired Kang Fulu held a fly whisk and sat suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the senior disciples from other peaks stood tall.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu looked at the hundreds of new disciples who had just passed the entrance exam, showing a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he slowly asked, "Haven't the people from Seven Colors Peak arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Kang, you know the personality of that senior brother from Seven Colors Peak..." a man in golden clothes said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kang Fulu said no more.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came: "Qi Yuan, senior brother of Seven Colors Peak, has arrived."</p><p></p><p>With this voice, Qi Yuan appeared before everyone in a white robe, standing tall with a jade pendant at his waist, approaching in the light.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples of the Divine Light Sect, as well as those newly admitted disciples, looked at Qi Yuan with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Senior Brother Qi Yuan to come down the mountain!"</p><p></p><p>"He's even three times more handsome than the legend says."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, such a refined and elegant person, yet..."</p><p></p><p>"Yet what?"</p><p></p><p>"Behaves strangely, has mental issues!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's not quite like that. It's just that his cultivation is different from others. He belongs to the 'obsession' lineage. All cultivators of this lineage have unique personalities!"</p><p></p><p>"The mentally ill of the cultivation world? Better not provoke them."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be fooled by his apparent madness. He's a true genius with great insights into cultivation. Many senior brothers and sisters often seek his advice on cultivation matters."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators below discussed among themselves, with many looking at Qi Yuan with strange gazes.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, there are three types of people one should not provoke.</p><p></p><p>First, do not provoke physicians; second, do not provoke sword cultivators; third, do not provoke obsession cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Physicians master medical skills and can heal injuries and save lives.</p><p></p><p>For any cultivator, one never knows when they might be injured in a battle and need a physician to heal quickly, so they don't provoke physicians.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, physicians are generally skilled in refining strange poisons and poison pills, killing invisibly, so it's best not to offend them if possible.</p><p></p><p>Sword cultivators have terrifying combat power and are decisive in killing, so it's best not to provoke them if possible.</p><p></p><p>Obsession cultivators, however, are rather unique.</p><p></p><p>This lineage of cultivators focuses on being obsessed with one thing.</p><p></p><p>It could be a sword, a flower, or a person.</p><p></p><p>Extreme obsession implies some mental issues.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators are not easy to deal with. Who knows when a mentally ill person might suddenly go crazy? And Qi Yuan is a cultivator of the obsession lineage.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Qi Yuan, you're a bit late," Kang Fulu said softly.</p><p></p><p>"I slept too late yesterday," Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the senior disciples from the other peaks remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu said, "Now that everyone is here, let's start recruiting disciples."</p><p></p><p>Currently, on the square were mostly new disciples who had just passed the entrance exam.</p><p></p><p>The senior disciples from each peak were responsible for selecting candidates to join their respective peaks.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu stepped forward and looked at the hundreds of new disciples below, slowly saying,</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Light Sect is one of the three major cultivation sects in the Great Shang."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to all of you for passing the multiple tests. From now on, you are disciples of the Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the hundreds of young men and women on the scene were all somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divine Light Sect is one of the three most powerful cultivation sects in the Great Shang country.</p><p></p><p>Once you join the sect, you become an elite.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was very satisfied with everyone's reaction and continued,</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Light Sect has five peaks. You may choose one to join."</p><p></p><p>"This is Zhuge Miao, the senior disciple of Divine Medicine Peak."</p><p></p><p>"This is Xu Yiyi, the senior disciple of Ten Thousand Methods Peak."</p><p></p><p>"This is Qi Yuan, the senior disciple of Seven Colors Peak."</p><p></p><p>"This is Kuangren, the senior disciple of Battle Peak."</p><p></p><p>"I am Kang Fulu, the closed-door disciple of the Five Lights Peak master, the son-in-law of the Divine Light Sect's leader, the master of the Five Lights Sacred Technique, the founder of the Minor Sunlight Technique, and the head senior disciple of Five Lights Peak."</p><p></p><p>As the white-haired Kang Fulu spoke, five-colored divine light appeared above his head, making him look incredibly radiant and eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>That's right, Kang Fulu, known as the biggest show-off of Five Lights Peak.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

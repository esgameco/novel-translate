        <h1>Chapter 297</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power of the Bird-Killing Fist was such that it could kill a bird with one punch without any problem.</p><p></p><p>"Without using any other techniques, this punch... could almost kill a person of the same weight class," Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>This level of power was actually considered terrifying among martial artists. </p><p></p><p>For example, Wang Shiqiao's close friend Xing Yu had also obtained a martial artist qualification certificate, but even using her innate martial technique, she couldn't kill someone of the same level with one punch.</p><p></p><p>Killing someone with just a punch, and not even to a vital area, was very difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>"However, relying on martial arts alone, I'm still quite far from Yang Shan's level," Qi Yuan quietly analyzed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>In terms of skill, Qi Yuan far surpassed Yang Shan.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of power, defense, and physical attributes, Yang Shan exceeded Qi Yuan by a large margin. </p><p></p><p>For instance, even if Qi Yuan knew how to block, he wouldn't be able to react in time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was referring to Qi Yuan's current physical condition.</p><p></p><p>His body had been cursed, making him even weaker than an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Although he practiced immortal cultivation, so far his physical constitution was only comparable to that of a normal person.</p><p></p><p>"Having reached the seventh layer, it's about time to consume some secret materials."</p><p></p><p>The next day, sunlight filtered through the curtains, scattering fragments of light on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in the living room, eating breakfast prepared by Zero One.</p><p></p><p>As an intelligent robot, Zero One could make simple breakfasts and standard meals.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was eating very lightly - a bowl of plain rice porridge, a few radish buns, and a salted egg.</p><p></p><p>"Next time add more meat, I'm still growing," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Although the house was filled with various medicinal herbs and sea monsters,</p><p>those were cultivation resources, and eating too much of them would be tiresome.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan consumed a lot of energy practicing martial arts every day.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." The robot Zero One received the new instruction and stored it.</p><p></p><p>About ten minutes later, all the dishes on the table were cleaned up by the robot.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes. "Actually, this kind of robot is quite interesting, almost comparable to a puppet."</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, there was puppet crafting, used to create puppets.</p><p></p><p>The crafted puppets were much more intelligent than Zero One.</p><p></p><p>Some high-level magical treasures could even awaken spirituality and develop consciousness.</p><p></p><p>For example... Qi Yuan's daughter Qi Jianjun, from a certain perspective, could be considered a magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Should I modify Zero One a bit? Right now it's... a bit stupid, and its combat ability... is almost zero."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"If I created ten thousand puppets and had them pretend to be humans working in electronics factories, wouldn't I be making tens of millions in net profit every month?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought it wasn't very realistic.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand puppets - how much material would that require?</p><p></p><p>He was also too lazy to make puppets.</p><p></p><p>"Just modifying Zero One is certainly doable.</p><p></p><p>Having some combat ability would be good for guarding the house when I'm not around."</p><p></p><p>The house Kuang Huan gave him was full of useful plants and sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Qi Yuan's cultivation level was too low to create storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, the doorbell rang.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the door opened and Kuang Huan, wearing a black jacket, entered the room.</p><p></p><p>His face bore a respectful expression, nothing like the domineering arms dealer he appeared to be outside.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he was carrying a large box.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, I've brought the secret materials you requested. Please take a look and see if it's enough for your use?"</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, Kuang Huan had no airs about him at all.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Qi Yuan's mysterious and powerful elimination of Zhao Renji was too strange and formidable. After investigating, Kuang Huan discovered that ordinary human methods simply couldn't achieve such a feat.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, during this period, under Qi Yuan's guidance, he had finally made progress in immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Last night, he had even managed to produce a tiny flame from his fingertip.</p><p></p><p>Although this flame wasn't even as big as that from a lighter, and could be extinguished by a single breath,</p><p></p><p>it was still the first time he had personally cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>This joy he kept hidden in his heart, not daring to share it with anyone.</p><p></p><p>Even if others asked, he would say he hadn't succeeded.</p><p></p><p>"Are these the secret materials?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened the box, which contained rows of glass containers.</p><p></p><p>Inside the glass containers were meat products that looked similar to wind-dried beef jerky.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... sea monster meat?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately recognized the main component of the secret materials - it was indeed sea monster meat.</p><p></p><p>No wonder martial artists' cultivation was so expensive.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu spent hundreds of thousands on secret materials every month.</p><p></p><p>If it was sea monster meat, it was indeed worth the price.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi has a good eye. I've also investigated some information about secret materials these past few days.</p><p></p><p>The main component of secret materials is indeed sea monster meat."</p><p></p><p>Kuang Huan had a basic understanding of martial arts before, but not much.</p><p></p><p>He only investigated secret materials after Qi Yuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>The investigation was eye-opening.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the secret materials used in the martial arts world were actually prohibited sea monsters.</p><p></p><p>This also resolved many of Kuang Huan's doubts.</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Yuan Kingdom, ordinary martial artists either became internet celebrities or entered the system, with most in the system joining the navy.</p><p></p><p>Even if the authorities knew about using prohibited sea monsters as secret materials, they wouldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Generally, those who chose to practice martial arts came from families with some money.</p><p></p><p>Using martial arts to stimulate their consumption and circulate wealth was considered a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the largest producer of these prohibited secret materials was some big shot up there.</p><p></p><p>After all, how much money could be made from the secret material business across the entire Qin Yuan Kingdom? It was an astronomical figure.</p><p></p><p>"So martial arts... have a deep connection with sea monsters."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up a piece of dried sea monster and put it in his mouth, chewing slowly.</p><p></p><p>The taste was somewhat like dried fruit meat, salty with a hint of sweetness.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the secret material wasn't simply sea monster meat, but had many additives.</p><p></p><p>"As expected... it's the blood?"</p><p></p><p>After consuming the secret material, Qi Yuan felt the greatest improvement was a slight warming of his blood.</p><p></p><p>Of course, martial artists of this world wouldn't be able to detect this level of warming.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gained a deeper understanding of this world's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"However... everyone's bloodline origin is different. Ordinary secret materials... supplement with all sorts of mixed blood... This can indeed improve martial arts cultivation, but it also... clogs one's own system."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan had mentioned that in ancient times, besides innate martial techniques, powerful martial artists also had innate killing moves.</p><p></p><p>But ordinary people consuming all sorts of messy secret materials led to various bloodlines mixing in their bodies, making their own bloodline impure and unable to form their own innate killing move.</p><p></p><p>With just this simple reasoning, Qi Yuan had deduced seven or eight tenths of this world's martial arts path below the level of innate killing moves.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Kuang Huan listened attentively but didn't understand a thing.</p><p></p><p>"The taste is not bad, quite nutritious."</p><p></p><p>Although the bloodlines were mixed, Qi Yuan still ate the secret materials.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts cultivation was inseparable from secret materials.</p><p></p><p>Without strengthening the bloodline, cultivation would be extremely difficult, and it would be hard to make progress with techniques.</p><p></p><p>To avoid mixing bloodlines, one would have to devour mutated sea monsters like last time, and they had to be mutated sea monsters of the same bloodline origin.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, such sea monsters were hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan thought he would consider purifying his bloodline when he reached the limit of martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although consuming</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The secret object would make one's bloodline "chaotic", but Qi Yuan had the ability to absorb essences, so his blood would not truly become "chaotic".</p><p></p><p>"How's your cultivation going?" Qi Yuan asked狂欢 after eating the secret object.</p><p></p><p>"I can now... produce a wisp of flame!" 狂欢 said excitedly, finally having someone to tell.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a weak little flame appeared in his hand. </p><p></p><p>However, this small flame was extremely feeble.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you finally have a skill. If you fall on hard times, you could make decent money as a magician," Qi Yuan praised sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, those who followed him all had bright futures. Even if 狂欢 lost his job someday, he could still be a magician.</p><p></p><p>"I've further refined your cultivation method. It should work up to Foundation Establishment stage. I need some materials soon, can you prepare them for me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave 狂欢 the next part of the "Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique". He also listed out the materials he needed.</p><p></p><p>This time, besides cultivation resources, he added some materials for making puppets, as well as spirit objects for Foundation Establishment. </p><p></p><p>This world didn't have Foundation Establishment spirit objects, so Qi Yuan would nurture them himself.</p><p></p><p>By his calculations, he would begin Foundation Establishment in just over a month. Within half a year, he would enter Core Formation stage. At that time, he would be able to bring Ning Tao down.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll arrange for people to do it right away," 狂欢 said solemnly, thinking of something. "Mr. Qi, I may not be able to deliver goods in person for a while. Wu Gui country and Yue Lang country are at war again. I need to transport a batch of weapons to support Yue Lang."</p><p></p><p>狂欢's business was arms dealing. In fact, he was also part of the Qin Yuan country's military, helping to sell off some weapons.</p><p></p><p>The current Yue Lang was a country supported by Qin Yuan, and had gone to war with Wu Gui again. </p><p></p><p>Orders had come from above, so 狂欢 might have to stay in Yue Lang for the next few months or even years.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine, as long as I don't lack what I need," Qi Yuan said, unconcerned about these matters.</p><p></p><p>The war between Yue Lang and Wu Gui was not unexpected. </p><p></p><p>The trending topics these past few days had already exposed many of Wu Gui's inhumane acts.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gui and Yue Lang were already at daggers drawn, war was inevitable. </p><p></p><p>Even if the two countries didn't want to fight, Qin Yuan and Gu Wu countries wouldn't allow it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry Mr. Qi, I'll make sure to arrange all the materials you need!" 狂欢 answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's a pity I'm not a demon cultivator and don't have the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls. Otherwise, couldn't I collect many remnant souls from the battlefield?" Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people don't have primordial spirits, they just die. </p><p></p><p>But cultivators can extract and refine remnant souls from dead bodies, summoning them into the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls to use as a magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Banner of Ten Thousand Souls... what's that?" 狂欢 asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... any cultivator who uses the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls is usually an evil cultivator. If you see one, run as far away as you can."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan considered himself lawful good, respecting the law and giving up his seat to old men on the bus. He looked down on evil cultivators in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I'll remember that," 狂欢 wouldn't forget Qi Yuan's advice.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was a legendary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>In the Ming Wu Martial Arts Gym, Qi Yuan was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>By now, he had cultivated the Ming Wu Resonance Fist to the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he first entered the gym, his spirit and energy were much better.</p><p></p><p>When he threw punches, they were fierce and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, the students of Ming Wu Gym sat chatting.</p><p></p><p>Especially Wang Shiqiao, who sat with her legs crossed, smoking a ladies' cigarette, paying no attention to her image.</p><p></p><p>"Rich Lady Xing, lend me some money to spend. I heard you got 170 million in the split!" Wang Shiqiao looked at Xing Yu, her eyes full of envy.</p><p></p><p>Just half a month ago, Xing Yu's 70-something year old husband had finally passed away.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance was divided, and Xing Yu got 170 million.</p><p></p><p>For the students present, 170 million was no small sum.</p><p></p><p>Among the students, besides Xu Tiehua, no one could produce 170 million in cash.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu could be considered a rich lady among the students.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think about my money. I've already decided to donate a school in town," Xing Yu said, a gratified smile appearing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She came from a small town, from an ordinary family.</p><p></p><p>It was called a town, but actually had a smaller population than a village on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>The school was also very run-down.</p><p></p><p>At the time, when Xing Yu was admitted to a top university, the whole town gave many gifts.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that most of Xing Yu's university tuition was paid by the townspeople.</p><p></p><p>University tuition in Qin Yuan country was very high, especially for top universities, at least several hundred thousand a year.</p><p></p><p>Many children from poor families, even if admitted to top universities, couldn't afford to study and had to take out high-interest student loans.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were very kind and helped raise her tuition, which is why Xing Yu was able to attend university.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu was very grateful to the townspeople.</p><p></p><p>So after becoming successful, she didn't forget to support her hometown.</p><p></p><p>This time after inheriting the estate, besides donating a school to her hometown, she also planned to start a company to help the people back home using Tian Yue's resources.</p><p></p><p>"You only have 170 million and you're wasting it like this. Be careful or you'll lose it all in a few years," Wang Shiqiao couldn't help but interject.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm keeping 20 million that I won't touch. If I fail, worst case I'll just be an ordinary person," Xing Yu smiled.</p><p></p><p>To her husband's son, she was a gold digger, shameless and brazen. But to the folks back home, she was undoubtedly very successful and knew how to repay kindness.</p><p></p><p>"20 million isn't enough. The international situation is so complicated now.</p><p></p><p>Yue Lang and Wu Gui are at war again. Those damn Gui Ran people, always up to no good!"</p><p></p><p>"Especially Wu Gui's leader, who threatened to retaliate against us Qin Yuan yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Just Ancient Wu's lapdog, how dare he be so bold!" Wang Shiqiao stubbed out her cigarette. Mentioning the Gui Ran people made her angry, her chest hurt.</p><p></p><p>Last night she had argued with a Gui Ran person online for dozens of posts.</p><p></p><p>It made her so angry she almost wanted to enlist to support Yue Lang.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she was just thinking about it. Actually enlisting was impossible.</p><p></p><p>"You should stop arguing with people online. You won't win anyway," Xing Yu laughed.</p><p></p><p>She was roommates with Wang Shiqiao and knew her personality. One look and she could tell Wang Shiqiao had been arguing online last night.</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to vent. That guy was too disgusting. As a soldier, he actually tortured civilians. Not only was he not ashamed, he thought it was glorious and posted videos to show off!</p><p></p><p>We're all human, how can they be so disgusting?"</p><p></p><p>"They're not ordinary humans. Didn't their leader claim the Gui Ran people are descendants left on Gong Star by Canxing? Their bloodline is noble, how could they see us as their own kind."</p><p></p><p>In the gym, everyone discussed the war between Yue Lang and Wu Gui.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan raised an eyebrow and stopped his movements: "Wang Shiqiao, looks like you're not up to it. If someone cursed me online, I'd reach through the internet and beat them to death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had done this many times.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're so tough. Why don't you help me beat up the person who cursed me last night!" Wang Shiqiao laughed when she heard Qi Yuan speak.</p><p></p><p>"They didn't curse me, so I can't be bothered," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"If you bring me their head, I'll give you a million!" Wang Shiqiao joked.</p><p></p><p>They were all joking anyway, might as well say anything.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

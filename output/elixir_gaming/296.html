        <h1>Chapter 296</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do I look like someone who's sick?" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>The people in this world seemed to have below average intelligence on average, and were also nearsighted.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at him, one could tell he was very smart. How could he be mentally ill?</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan glanced at Qi Yuan and nodded seriously: "You do, and you don't."</p><p></p><p>If he really had a mental illness, how could he have such talent in martial arts? He had only moved here a week ago, but he had watched Qi Yuan progress with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>This speed of improvement would be considered fast even among the martial arts prodigies he knew.</p><p></p><p>"How's your study of the innate martial technique going? Any insights?" Yang Shan changed the subject, returning to the main point.</p><p></p><p>He had to say, he thought quite highly of this young man Qi Yuan, as if seeing his younger self.</p><p></p><p>Although, he himself was not yet 40.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yang Shan's words, Qi Yuan lowered his head in thought, recalling the scene from earlier.</p><p></p><p>Noticing this, Yang Shan's eyes revealed a smile: "The first time I saw an innate martial technique, I was also amazed, thinking it was very mysterious and even had a chance of reaching the supernatural realm... but alas..."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's voice carried a sense of nostalgia for the past.</p><p></p><p>Innate martial techniques only seemed mysterious, but under scientific scrutiny, they were actually... just that.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was very effective in fooling someone like Qi Yuan who wasn't even a martial artist yet.</p><p></p><p>"The core of innate martial techniques... should be bloodline?" At this point, Qi Yuan raised his head, looking at Yang Shan with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was stunned, his heart suddenly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know that?"</p><p></p><p>His face showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Since retiring from the military, this was the first time he had lost his composure like this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's answer was really beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Research on innate martial techniques had never ceased from ancient times to the present.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after so many years of research, there was still no definitive conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Instead, various heresies and cults had emerged.</p><p></p><p>The top martial artists of the current world had joined forces, spending enormous funds, manpower and martial power, to finally unveil a corner of the mysterious veil of innate martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>As a peak martial artist, he had also participated in the research on innate martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>Among the latest research results, innate martial techniques may be related to blood.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, when he learned of this conclusion, Yang Shan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>How could martial arts... be related to blood, which seemed completely irrelevant? At that time, the circle of peak martial artists was all shaken.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this shock was limited to that small circle.</p><p></p><p>This matter had never been leaked out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was just an ordinary orphan of a martyr, he certainly shouldn't know about this.</p><p></p><p>How did Qi Yuan know? He couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>"I saw it," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"You saw it?" Yang Shan looked suspicious, seemingly not quite believing Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"When you used the innate martial technique, your blood was slightly boiling," Qi Yuan smiled, "My eyesight is very good, I'm not nearsighted."</p><p></p><p>"Slightly boiling?" Yang Shan mulled over Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>This slight boiling was probably not just in the blood.</p><p></p><p>When he used the Thunderous Palm technique, his whole body was boiling, not just the blood.</p><p></p><p>Why did Qi Yuan specifically mention blood?</p><p></p><p>Was it a coincidence... or talent? Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>If it was a coincidence, that was fine, but if it was talent... that would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It would mean Qi Yuan was extremely suited for martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He might even have a chance to reach the peak of martial arts, becoming one of the strongest in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Although... he still wouldn't compare to those who had taken high-level gene drugs, but it would still be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Innate martial techniques are manifested when the blood boils to a certain frequency, indeed... it has a bit to do with the supernatural," Qi Yuan said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>He had already understood why martial arts were weak on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>It was because the bloodlines were too diluted.</p><p></p><p>For example, when Yang Shan just used the Thunderous Palm, there was too little blood boiling.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how to break through the limits of martial arts?" Qi Yuan asked Yang Shan.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. If I knew, I wouldn't be here.</p><p>Do you, someone who isn't even a martial artist, know?" Yang Shan became interested.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Qi Yuan became different.</p><p></p><p>If before he saw Qi Yuan as a prodigy with extraordinary talent, now he felt... different.</p><p></p><p>"To break through the limits of martial arts, you need to acknowledge a father," Qi Yuan seriously explained his view, "The martial arts on Gongxing should be called bloodline martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If your father breaks through the martial arts limit and reaches a higher realm, then... your bloodline will also transcend, and your martial arts potential and strength will improve."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan pondered, frowning, and after a long while said: "What you said... I somewhat understand."</p><p></p><p>This kind of inference had also circulated in the circle of peak martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Most believed that the ancients were strong because of their rich bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>People today are weak because certain bloodlines have become diluted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a speculation, not a definitive conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't even break through the martial artist's limit... let alone my father?</p><p></p><p>Although I'd like to lie flat and let my father work hard, this is undoubtedly a fantasy!" Yang Shan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>His father's martial arts talent wasn't even as good as his.</p><p></p><p>Even the peak martial artists in this world with the most hope of breaking through the martial arts limit wouldn't dare to say they were certain of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple, you can acknowledge me as your father. When I break through, your bloodline might transcend, breaking through the martial arts limit!"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was angry.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan just smiled: "It seems your determination to break through the martial arts limit isn't strong enough.</p><p></p><p>I've gained some insights, I'll go back to refine my own martial technique, bye."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan left directly.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan watched Qi Yuan's back, his gaze extremely complex: "Could he really be... a genius?</p><p></p><p>No, he's sick!</p><p></p><p>Even if I acknowledged him as my father, even if he broke through the martial arts limit, my bloodline wouldn't transcend, because we don't have any blood relation!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan felt he had been fooled by Qi Yuan's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>Acknowledging a father wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>And... was breaking through the martial arts limit that easy? Throughout history, how many brilliant martial arts geniuses had appeared, yet none had broken through the limit?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he sent a message to his old friend.</p><p></p><p>"I've met a true martial arts genius, his talent is even greater than mine when I was young by a large margin!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, such a good seedling, when do you plan to take him as your disciple?" The other party replied quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Forget about taking disciples, the old grudges are over, I don't want to cause more disputes." Yang Shan sent the message, then continued with a voice message, "This martial arts genius, just by watching me use an innate martial technique once, deduced that... innate martial techniques might be related to blood boiling."</p><p></p><p>"What? How did he know that? To think there's such a genius!" The other party's voice was a bit cracked, seeming quite excited.</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, he also pointed out a path to break through the martial arts limit. I've thought about it carefully and feel... this path might be feasible."</p><p></p><p>"You're... not making this up, are you? Breaking through the martial arts limit, proposed by a newcomer, how is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>The other party's voice was full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This kind of</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Astonishment, no different than a college student on the Blue Star achieving nuclear fusion just to get into a better school.</p><p></p><p>"It's only theoretically feasible, still needs verification. Do you want to verify it with me?" A smile curled at the corner of Yang Shan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"How do we verify it?"</p><p></p><p>"Acknowledge me as your father. Once I break through the martial arts limit, your bloodline will also transcend." After laying the groundwork for so long, Yang Shan finally revealed his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>About a minute later, the other party sent a 60-second voice message.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan didn't play it, but knew it was likely filled with profanity.</p><p></p><p>"This actually makes some sense. It was that young friend who told me." Yang Shan relayed today's conversation with Qi Yuan to his old friend.</p><p></p><p>"Even if this works, why should I acknowledge you as my father instead of you acknowledging me as yours?!"</p><p></p><p>"Because my martial arts talent is stronger than yours, I have a better chance of breaking through the martial arts limit!" Yang Shan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Right, your talent is stronger, your martial arts talent is better than mine, and your talent for flirting is better too. You're very good at tricking women into bed. As soon as you message a female friend, she'll say she's going to bed and will chat tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Yang Shan's face also reddened a bit. "Still better than you. Back then you left bad reviews for all the takeout restaurants and then confessed to Wang Yan."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's old friend was quite a character when he was young.</p><p></p><p>He used to frantically order takeout from restaurants near the school, immediately leave bad reviews, with the review content being a confession to Wang Yan.</p><p></p><p>This outrageous move caused an uproar at the school.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yan was utterly mortified.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yang Shan knew that was his friend's youthful grudge with Wang Yan. Looking back now, it didn't seem like much.</p><p></p><p>"There's less than three months until the martial arts competition in Tianyue City begins. Should I come take a look and meet this martial arts genius you mentioned? Although what he said seems a bit outrageous, it... does make some sense."</p><p></p><p>Joking aside, when it came to breaking through the martial arts limit, that old friend was very serious.</p><p></p><p>After all, the purpose of their circle's existence was to break through the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll introduce you to him then. </p><p></p><p>Also, don't think about taking him as a disciple. I don't want to drag him into our circle."</p><p></p><p>"What, are you afraid of the Guiran people?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan was silent for a moment: "I'm not afraid, I just find it... disgusting."</p><p></p><p>The Guiran people were the primary ethnic group of the Wugui nation.</p><p></p><p>This country had a unified political and religious system.</p><p></p><p>The religious leader was the true ruler of the country.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the Guiran people and the Qinyuan nation had existed since the last century.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Guiran people were the biggest target for the Ancient Wu nation to attack the Qinyuan nation.</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing, the Qinyuan nation and Ancient Wu nation were the two poles of the world.</p><p></p><p>One could say the Guiran people were the mad dogs of the Ancient Wu nation.</p><p></p><p>The Guiran people often instigated wars and massacred civilians.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Yang Shan's circle of peak martial artists received an order from higher-ups.</p><p></p><p>To hunt down... a priest of the Guiran people.</p><p></p><p>Due to situational limitations, gene soldiers could not enter, so they needed these peak martial artists to act.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Yang Shan and the others successfully killed that priest.</p><p></p><p>But it also thoroughly enraged the Guiran people.</p><p></p><p>Guiran assassins and fanatics frantically carried out suicide attacks to cause trouble for Yang Shan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan also suffered major injuries in that mission, which led him to choose retirement.</p><p></p><p>But the grudge with the Guiran people continued.</p><p></p><p>So, he didn't want to involve Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if Qi Yuan broke through the martial arts limit, could he compare to the Guiran gene soldiers? It's worth noting that while the Qinyuan nation and Ancient Wu nation still cared about appearances and spoke to the people about fairness, freedom, and democracy,</p><p></p><p>The Wugui nation didn't even bother to pretend.</p><p></p><p>And their gene soldiers were even more insane, with greater damage to the human body, but evidently... greater power as well.</p><p></p><p>So, the Guiran gene soldiers... were truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>They really had no regard for their lives.</p><p></p><p>"The Guiran people are indeed quite disgusting, but what can we do?" The other party laughed, with a hint of helplessness in his voice.</p><p></p><p>They were all adults and knew the world wouldn't change based on their personal preferences or will.</p><p></p><p>Even though slavery had not yet been abolished in the Guiran nation, even though they viewed human life as worthless as grass, they still lived quite freely.</p><p></p><p>"The most disgusting thing is, the holy son of the Wugui nation married the daughter of a general from Canxing!" Mentioning this, Yang Shan's eyes showed a rare trace of fear.</p><p></p><p>That was Canxing! Canxing's technology was far more advanced than Gongxing's.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that much of Gongxing's technological development came from Canxing.</p><p></p><p>Without Canxing's bloody suppression back then, Gongxing wouldn't have experienced such rapid technological growth now.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan's grandfather had died on a mission on Canxing.</p><p></p><p>Towards Canxing, he felt both fear and anger.</p><p></p><p>The Wugui nation's connection with Canxing was one of the reasons for their reckless behavior.</p><p></p><p>Regarding their former enemy Canxing, the current world's two poles rarely promoted hostility and hatred, but instead advocated for peaceful coexistence.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, there were many rumors on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>The most widespread was that the upper echelons of both the Qinyuan nation and Ancient Wu nation had actually been controlled by Canxing long ago.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to Yang Shan, these were just baseless rumors.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons were still the same upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Innate martial technique..."</p><p></p><p>In his room, Qi Yuan was pondering his innate martial technique.</p><p></p><p>"The innate martial technique most closely related to bloodline is the most suitable for me, and also the most powerful."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could see information gaps, and he was a powerful cultivator who had slain a Yangsheng.</p><p></p><p>His eyesight far surpassed ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only seen Yang Shan demonstrate the innate martial technique once, his understanding of innate martial techniques already surpassed everyone else's.</p><p></p><p>"So... the innate martial technique of this body's bloodline ancestor is the most suitable for me, and also the most powerful!"</p><p></p><p>A sharp light flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He stared at his own blood, as if seeing through eternity.</p><p></p><p>He saw mutated sea monsters swimming in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>He saw a drop of blood falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his mind cleared, and everything became crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>"Explosive Bird-Killing Fist!"</p><p></p><p>A gleam flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He kept deducing, as if he had received memories inherited from his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The innate martial technique also took shape at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This name... is really lacking."</p><p></p><p>Looking at this formed innate martial technique, Qi Yuan was quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>The technique's name lacked prestige.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't even up to his own naming standards.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my ancestor... had a low level of education, and may have particularly hated birds.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could the awakened innate martial technique be called Explosive Bird-Killing Fist?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>He casually demonstrated the innate martial technique, then frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just possible, he definitely hated birds."</p><p></p><p>This Explosive Bird-Killing Fist looked just like a cat catching a sparrow.</p><p></p><p>Not explosive at all.</p><p></p><p>PS: There's one more update, around 3-4 o'clock.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

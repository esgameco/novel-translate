        <h1>Chapter 478</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Ghost Pass, powerful figures gathered, and a powerful aura would occasionally descend.</p><p></p><p>The starlight of the Stellar Realm seemed to particularly favor the Ghost Pass at this moment, frequently falling into it.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, the originally gloomy and terrifying Ghost Pass became shrouded in immortal mist, as if it were a blessed land of immortals.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "A mountain need not be high, as long as there are immortals, it will be divine."</p><p></p><p>"Shengluo Heavenly Lord, it's been a while, your elegance remains the same." The Abyss Sovereign of the Endless Abyss was an indescribable entity, a being whose end could not be seen with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>His clan resided in the Endless Abyss, one of the most mysterious clans in the Six Celestial Realms.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Abyss Sovereign looked at the newly arrived Shengluo Heavenly Lord, with a faint mist surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>"You old fellow actually deigned to appear?" Shengluo Heavenly Lord was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Sovereign had not shown his face in public since the last Lingyao Molting.</p><p></p><p>"Among the Six Celestial Realms, it has been many years since a great Dao Patriarch has fallen. Old me is here to join the excitement." The Abyss Sovereign replied.</p><p></p><p>The last Dao Patriarch to fall was the Great Sun Radiance Buddha of the Buddha Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yangsheng Celestial Sovereign's gaze momentarily faltered, involuntarily falling on the figure of the Dao Patriarch of the Qiluo Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the three days, the Qiluo Celestial Realm had the strongest power.</p><p></p><p>Within the Qiluo Celestial Realm, there was a Supreme Existence.</p><p></p><p>And this Supreme Existence had a deep connection with the Great Sun Radiance Buddha.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that the Great Sun Radiance Buddha, before attaining enlightenment, had once taken this Supreme Existence as his teacher, having a brief teacher-disciple relationship.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of this karmic connection that the Buddha Realm was able to continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, without a Dao Patriarch to guard it, the Taihuang Palace would have easily destroyed the Buddha Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Patriarch of the Qiluo Celestial Realm had a calm gaze, as if he had not heard the Abyss Sovereign's words.</p><p></p><p>Then the White Dragon Abyss Sovereign spoke, "I heard that a new Buddha Lord has appeared in the Buddha Realm. It seems... this Lingyao Molting may give birth to a new Dao Patriarch in the Buddha Realm."</p><p></p><p>Among the Six Celestial Realms, there were dozens of sacred lands, including the two palaces, three celestial realms, and four abysses.</p><p></p><p>If the Buddha Realm were to give birth to another Dao Patriarch, it would become one of the dozens of sacred lands.</p><p></p><p>"This Lingyao Molting is presided over by the Taihuang Palace. The Buddha Realm... is in danger." The Abyss Sovereign said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, even if the Taihuang Palace presides over the Lingyao Molting, they cannot unjustly kill the innocent!" An old and overbearing voice came, belonging to the Yangsheng Celestial Sovereign of the Dao Patriarch Assembly.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Patriarch Assembly was the hegemon of the previous Lingyao Molting.</p><p></p><p>What the Dao Patriarch Assembly pursued was the Dao Patriarch as clouds.</p><p></p><p>In the previous Lingyao Molting, it was the Dao Patriarch Assembly that balanced things, so the number of fallen Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns was very low.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Banner Lord of the Guiyu Celestial Realm spoke, "The Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor has indiscriminately slaughtered many of my Guiyu Celestial Realm's Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns. When will the Dao Patriarch Assembly uphold justice and execute this Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord's voice was rather yin-yang and sinister.</p><p></p><p>Naturally siding with the Taihuang Palace, he was naturally opposed to the Dao Patriarch Assembly.</p><p></p><p>In this Lingyao Molting, in addition to slaughtering Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns to ascend to the Sole Palace, the second ultimate goal of the Taihuang Palace was to suppress the Dao Patriarch Assembly and become the hegemon of the Six Celestial Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The Dao Patriarch of the Dao Patriarch Assembly coldly snorted, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>To the Dao Patriarch Assembly, the Guiyu Celestial Realm was the cancer of the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Taihuang Palace backing it, the Dao Patriarch Assembly might have already strangled the Guiyu Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the White Dragon Abyss Sovereign looked at the Banner Lord with curiosity in his eyes: "It's a bit strange, how can the Banner Lord be so confident in slaying this Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor? Could it be... that the true body of the Taihuang Palace has descended?"</p><p></p><p>Only a Supreme Existence could slay an ordinary Dao Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord revealed a smile: "The heavenly secrets cannot be divulged."</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Sovereign smiled: "This Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor... just what kind of extraordinary being is he? I'm quite curious."</p><p></p><p>During this period, the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor had turned the Guiyu Celestial Realm upside down.</p><p></p><p>Many great cultivators were alarmed, and there were many speculations about the identity of the Palace Emissary.</p><p></p><p>Some even said that several sacred lands had taken an interest in befriending the Palace Emissary, trying to establish good relations, but unfortunately they had no way to approach him.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... he is an old friend of ours, it's not impossible." Shengluo Heavenly Lord swept his gaze across all present, his eyes profound.</p><p></p><p>The Six Celestial Realms were now in the calm before the storm.</p><p></p><p>With the start of the Lingyao Molting, this accumulating furnace was about to explode.</p><p></p><p>The other Dao Patriarch Yangsheng Celestials also revealed curious expressions.</p><p></p><p>They were quite curious about the identity of the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Banner Lord was still operating his Dao techniques, confirming the location of the Myriad Ghosts Banner.</p><p></p><p>Time trickled by, second by second, and the gathered Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns were chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, there were undercurrents surging beneath the surface.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, suddenly, a sharp light flashed in the Banner Lord's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I've found it!"</p><p></p><p>All the Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns immediately focused their gaze on the Banner Lord, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"He's in... "</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord's pupils flashed with a mix of surprise and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>The direction indicated by the Myriad Ghosts Banner was actually...</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the other Dao Patriarchs were shocked, their faces revealing disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"He's actually in the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? The Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land contains a Holy Light Clan!"</p><p></p><p>These Dao Patriarchs were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, the Abyss Sovereigns and Heavenly Lords present knew deeper inside information.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying thing in the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land was not the Holy Light Clan, but rather the Remnant Robe Ghostly Soul.</p><p></p><p>Both of these were existences they did not dare to provoke.</p><p></p><p>"How could he enter the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Banner Lord, it seems this tough bone is not easy for you to chew on."</p><p></p><p>Some Dao Patriarchs revealed smiles.</p><p></p><p>If it were other bizarre lands, the Banner Lord could directly enter and slay, or even swallow the bizarre land.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land was different. If the Banner Lord entered, it might be him who would die.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Clan and the Remnant Robe were both beings they dared not offend.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord's expression kept changing: "Let's go to the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land. If he doesn't come out, I'll block the exit and let him stay in the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land for the rest of his life."</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord finished speaking, waving his sleeve and heading towards the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land.</p><p></p><p>All the Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns saw this and had various expressions, following him.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Sovereign had a mocking expression on his face, wanting to see how the Banner Lord would break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land was different from other bizarre lands - the entrance was not so easily sealed.</p><p></p><p>A group of Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns went in a grand manner towards the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land, and news also began to spread to the major sacred lands of the Six Celestial Realms.</p><p></p><p>About half a day later, Ziyuan, who received the news, turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor... is actually in the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land... it's over, it's over!"</p><p></p><p>She was panicked and anxious.</p><p></p><p>Was this a coincidence? How could there be such a coincidence! "I hope Bloodrobe Senior Brother is not with the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor in the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she could only comfort herself in this way.</p><p></p><p>After all, now she could not even contact the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>And even if she could, whom could she trust?</p><p></p><p>There were many in the Black Abyss who wished for Bloodrobe Senior Brother's death.</p><p></p><p>Even her Blacksword Senior Brother had been plotted against, let alone Bloodrobe.</p><p></p><p>Now, she could only pray that Bloodrobe Senior Brother was unharmed.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, many Yangsheng Celestial Sovereigns had descended outside the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land for half a day.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord's expression kept changing, but he still had not made a move.</p><p></p><p>The existence within the Heavenly Kun Bizarre Land made him extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Dao Patriarchs and other Yangsheng Celestials all had different expressions.</p><p></p><p>Some were amused.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were some who were worried, and some who were not.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Palace is so arrogant, it turns out he has found a good nest for himself," the Abyss Lord of the Endless Abyss said with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he could resolve the Holy Light Clan and obtain the support of the Remnant Robe, he even wanted to migrate his clan into the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the core region of the Endless Abyss was also in the Celestial Realm, the special creatures in the Celestial Realm were far inferior to the Remnant Robe.</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord's expression changed repeatedly: "The entrance has been sealed, and even the Yin Gods cannot be dispatched, it seems he really is hiding inside!"</p><p></p><p>After arriving here, the Pennant Lord naturally tried to send low-level cultivators into the Celestial Realm to uncover the truth.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they could not enter at all.</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord's mind flashed with an angry expression: "Damn it."</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the dilapidated market near the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Around the market, there were many human gathering points and some cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seeing these people, he became irritated and directly took action.</p><p></p><p>"Sweep away these little insects!"</p><p></p><p>He tyrannically struck in the night, directly crushing the tens of thousands of humans in the vicinity.</p><p></p><p>To him, it was even simpler than swatting a bug.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elders present almost all remained expressionless, without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was, it was only a slight change, without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>To incur the enmity of such a powerful expert like the Pennant Lord for the sake of these ordinary mortals would be unwise.</p><p></p><p>Even the Grand Elder of the Righteous Dao Alliance who upheld the interests of the Yang Gods did not speak up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They were defending the interests of the Yang Gods, not the interests of mortals and low-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And these mortals and cultivators, before they could even react, were slaughtered in their sleep or cultivation.</p><p></p><p>They died without any warning.</p><p></p><p>If there was any luck, it was that they died without pain.</p><p></p><p>"This Palace Emissary... can he really hide in the Celestial Realm forever?" After casually slaughtering those people, the Pennant Lord's anger had not dissipated at all.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had already secretly sent a message to the Tai Huang Palace, seeking a way to break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>"If I were him, I would indeed hide in the Celestial Realm forever," the White Dragon Abyss Lord said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Righteous Dao Alliance also smiled and said, "Pennant Lord, your invitation to the four corners this time was so abrupt. Could it be... that this banquet is going to break the record for the longest duration of the Six Heavens Banquet?"</p><p></p><p>His words were full of sarcasm, which was very obvious.</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord's expression was unsightly, but he did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a familiar figure suddenly appeared at the entrance of the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored armor was like a flowing liquid covering his entire body, like thorny purple crystals, enchantingly horrifying, covering his entire body, only revealing a pair of cold and indifferent eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he held a blood-colored long sword, with various negative energies such as greed, jealousy, and lust... like a hellish black dragon coiling around the blood-colored long sword.</p><p></p><p>He was like a demonic god from hell.</p><p></p><p>No, this evil and sinister aura was even more terrifying than a demonic god from hell.</p><p></p><p>All the Yang God Supremes immediately focused their gaze on that blood-colored figure, with expressions of surprise or curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"So much evil aura... greed, gluttony, and slaughter, this Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Palace was born with original sin!" the Abyss Lord of the Endless Abyss said.</p><p></p><p>"Such a dense evil aura, he indeed deserves to be executed, otherwise living in this world would only bring calamity to all," the Celestial Lord of the Divine Firmament said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Lord narrowed his eyes, curiously staring at the blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>"Such a familiar feeling, is he an old friend?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she could not think of any of her old friends who would fit the identity of the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>"This great demon, Xuan Qi, I, the Pennant Lord, will slay him. Do you have any objections?" the Pennant Lord spoke, his gaze flashing with a sharp light.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder named Xuan Qi of the Righteous Dao Alliance shrugged his shoulders and said nothing further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood-colored figure strode forward, his expression cold and stern: "You are not qualified to try and slay me!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored figure swept his gaze around, sensing the powerful auras, but he showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he raised his long sword in front of him: "Do you all want to attack me together?"</p><p></p><p>These words caused the Grand Elders present to be taken aback, their smiles freezing.</p><p></p><p>"This Palace Emissary is a bit too arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he really thinks he can single-handedly face us?"</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Abyss Lord then smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist, you are mistaken. We are here to watch the show, and your opponent is the Pennant Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord at this time held the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, his face full of killing intent: "You did not walk the path to Heaven, and there is no door to Hell that you must come. Today... you will surely die!"</p><p></p><p>After knowing that the opponent was not a Grand Elder, the Pennant Lord regained his self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had the Breath-Restraining Talisman, and was not worried about the Palace Emissary escaping.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored figure held the long sword, his gaze sweeping over the surrounding ruined town, his expression neither sad nor happy.</p><p></p><p>After about half a breath, he sighed softly: "The atmosphere of the cultivation world... is too bad."</p><p></p><p>Sometimes a casual strike from a powerful expert could end the long and tragic lives of countless beings.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were records, in ancient books they might only be a few lines.</p><p></p><p>Just like "In the great famine, people ate each other."</p><p></p><p>He held the blood-colored long sword, his eyes as cold and indifferent as ever.</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord looked at Qi Yuan, who was emanating an eerie, gloomy, and terrifying aura, and coldly said, "The evil aura around you is even denser than mine. Do you still have the nerve to say such words?</p><p></p><p>Do you think you can just leave anytime and thus dare to provoke me?</p><p></p><p>Today, I will let you know what it means to have a heaven beyond heaven, and a person beyond a person!</p><p></p><p>What it means to be... a Grand Elder!"</p><p></p><p>As the Pennant Lord's voice fell, his hand trembled.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a beam of starlight suddenly surged in the original star realm.</p><p></p><p>And before that, a talisman had fallen with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>The Yang God Supremes present saw this talisman and their expressions slightly changed, some were surprised, and some were as expected.</p><p></p><p>"The Breath-Restraining Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Pennant Lord is so confident, he actually has the Breath-Restraining Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was bathed in the starlight, and the blood crystal armor on his body became even more sinister and enchanting, a deep red.</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed a look of surprise as he looked at the Pennant Lord: "An interesting talisman, falling on me, it just makes me want to hit you more.</p><p></p><p>It seems you really deserve a beating, otherwise why would you put a taunting buff on yourself, letting me hit you?"</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord's expression did not change, holding the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner: "Enough with the nonsense, are you trying to stall for time?</p><p></p><p>Without the ability to escape at any time, you will die today!"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the White Dragon Abyss Lord said indifferently, "Even if he cannot leave, with your strength, Pennant Lord, you should not be able to slay him, right?"</p><p></p><p>The other Grand Elders also had similar doubts and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord looked at the calm Qi Yuan and said with a hint of joy in his voice: "What if he is not a Grand Elder? Without the Grand Elder's Moment, in my hands, he is just a fish on the chopping board!"</p><p></p><p>These words shocked the Grand Elders present.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Palace, who could overturn the heavens, was actually not a Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>"Although you all are speaking quite quickly, can you not waste so much time and just fight?" Qi Yuan lazily spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Pennant Lord's gaze was slightly surprised: "You are not afraid, it seems... you have not witnessed the true power of a Grand Elder!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Pennant Lord did not hesitate at all, holding the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, unleashing a powerful strike that was sweeping across.</p><p></p><p>This strike, coming from the main body, was incomparable to the battles between the Ghost Calamity Supreme and the Ghost Origin Supreme.</p><p></p><p>And with the addition of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, this strike reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a Grand Elder, the Grand Elder's Moment on their body would show cracks!</p>

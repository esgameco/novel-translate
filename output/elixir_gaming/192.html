        <h1>Chapter 192</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many people's gazes fell on him.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods attending the Hundred Flowers Gathering were all from nearby areas and more or less acquainted with each other. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Ye Liuyun were strangers to them.</p><p></p><p>They were curious about Ye Liuyun's attempt to awaken the flower bouquet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Liuyun approached a flower bud that was about to bloom.</p><p></p><p>The flower was a Lingxiang Cui, with an emerald green bud emitting a unique fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Qionghua Great Venerable attained the Dao, she most enjoyed placing a Lingxiang Cui plant at her bedside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun closed his eyes and began to visualize.</p><p></p><p>Around him, many voices of discussion could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"He dares to try the Lingxiang Cui, this person has great courage."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Wu Qian, if I remember correctly, you also tried to awaken the Lingxiang Cui at the last Hundred Flowers Gathering, but failed."</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult. To try the Lingxiang Cui right off the bat, this unknown True God is truly bold."</p><p></p><p>"If he fails, it will be quite embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>After all, most True Gods start by trying the simpler ones.</p><p></p><p>Failing right at the beginning would be rather awkward and somewhat embarrassing for the North Sea Water Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood to the side, watching this scene with interest: "If I were to go awaken the flower bouquet, would I also be questioned like this?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi smiled like a flower: "Who would dare question Godfather?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>This time he was a spectator, and seeing Ye Liuyun being questioned was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Whether in his previous life on Blue Star or in various worlds, such scenes were particularly common.</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't a controlled comment thread, posting anything controversial would definitely attract all kinds of replies.</p><p></p><p>Just like these True Gods discussing among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Today, we'll just watch the show," Qi Yuan said. "Be spectators who discuss and debate, who question or are shocked."</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he didn't know the so-called Qionghua Great Venerable, so naturally he couldn't visualize a deity observation method familiar with her to awaken the flower bouquet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Liuyun in the crowd suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Deity observation method successful!" he exclaimed softly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on him.</p><p></p><p>"Can he awaken it?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Lingxiang Cui blooms, this... reward would be enviable."</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun reached out his hand and placed it on the petals of the Lingxiang Cui.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a shadowy figure appeared in the deity observation method.</p><p></p><p>"Who is... this?"</p><p></p><p>"A True God I've never seen before."</p><p></p><p>That shadowy figure was dressed like a middle-aged man, looking quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"This True God is named Venerable Hengyuan. Before the Great Flood War, Venerable Hengyuan took pleasure in flowers.</p><p></p><p>The Lingxiang Cui was actually found by Venerable Hengyuan from the Celestial Sea and presented to the Qionghua Great Venerable," Ye Liuyun said, with a hint of desolation in his eyes. "Unfortunately, Venerable Hengyuan had feelings for the fallen flowers, but the flowing water was indifferent."</p><p></p><p>Simply put, according to Qi Yuan's understanding, this was a somewhat melodramatic love story.</p><p></p><p>The others who heard this were all somewhat moved: "I never thought there was such a past event."</p><p></p><p>"The Qionghua Great Venerable's beauty was unparalleled in the world, it's normal for her to have some suitors."</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed, sighing about the past events.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Liuyun hadn't visualized Venerable Hengyuan, perhaps no one in the world would have known about this past event.</p><p></p><p>In the deity observation method, the shadow of Venerable Hengyuan reached out and touched the Lingxiang Cui.</p><p></p><p>The originally budding Lingxiang Cui, at this moment, had seven petals break free, the emerald green petals blooming.</p><p></p><p>A rich, unique fragrance wafted over, refreshing the mind and heart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two beams of white light flashed and fell into Ye Liuyun's hand.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at the two beams of white light, their gazes filled with envy or jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also had an envious expression: "I finally understand the feeling of those supporting characters on TV watching the protagonist show off. Two supreme treasures, it really makes one jealous!"</p><p></p><p>Two supreme treasures could create two True Gods.</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan not be envious? This was what he needed most right now.</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand celestial soldiers and generals were still hungry, and Ye Liuyun got two supreme treasures with one move.</p><p></p><p>The other True Gods, as if injected with chicken blood, frantically began to visualize.</p><p></p><p>They didn't care whether the visualized deity observation method was related to the Qionghua Great Venerable or not, they just tried directly to see if they could awaken the flower bouquet with their visualized deity observation method.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the effect was extremely poor. After half an hour of busy work, only three or four flowers had bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those that bloomed were all ordinary flowers, with mediocre rewards.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Hundred Flowers Gathering palace, a beautifully dressed, charming young woman saw this scene and revealed a disappointed look in her eyes: "The Hundred Flowers Gathering gets worse with each session."</p><p></p><p>The charming young woman was the organizer of the Hundred Flowers Gathering, the owner of the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Great Venerable was her master.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, she had been working hard to organize the Hundred Flowers Gathering, inviting guests from all over, with the purpose of awakening her master.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the effect was getting worse and worse.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yao, when will that person you invited, who has some connection with the Phoenix Clan, start visualizing? If I remember correctly, the Third Miss Phoenix also had some connection with Master.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps she can also make a flower bloom."</p><p></p><p>In the past, the charming young woman naturally wouldn't have paid attention to such small matters.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately now, with the effect of the Hundred Flowers Gathering getting worse and worse, she could only pin her hopes on various aspects.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Yao lowered her head and said, her voice tinged with apology: "Palace Master, she is not an ancient god, the ancient god is the man next to her."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?" The charming young woman glanced at Qi Yuan, understanding in her heart that Li Yao was doing a favor for the Phoenix Clan. She didn't dwell on it, just feeling mentally and physically exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, she didn't hold out hope.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Gathering continued.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, more and more ancient gods tried to awaken the flower bouquets.</p><p></p><p>This time, several more supreme treasures appeared, falling into the hands of ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>This made the ancient gods attending the Hundred Flowers Gathering extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>But for the charming young woman, this was just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Li Yao hurriedly came from afar: "Palace Master, it's not good, the Dragon Clan has come to cause trouble again!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the charming young woman's face darkened: "These stupid dragons are truly detestable."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Clan of the North Sea and the Water Tribe of the Qionghua Palace coexisted under the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>There were conflicts between the two.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Water Tribe of the Qionghua Palace who chose to hide in the world and not interfere in worldly affairs, the North Sea Dragon Clan often liked to go out, stirring up trouble, and had a bad reputation.</p><p></p><p>"Stop them, don't let them come and disrupt the Hundred Flowers Gathering!" the Qionghua Palace Master hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a rather arrogant and domineering voice came.</p><p></p><p>"We of the Dragon Clan come with good intentions, to awaken the Qionghua Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If they can participate in the Hundred Flowers Gathering, why can't we of the Dragon Clan?"</p><p></p><p>A man dressed in golden clothes appeared, emanating the aura of a True God.</p><p></p><p>Beside him were six members of the Dragon Clan, all True Gods who had taken one step into heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, these six Dragon Clan members were all at the peak of one step into heaven, with eleven apertures.</p><p></p><p>Among the gods at the Hundred Flowers Gathering, except for a few top True Gods, none were a match for these six Dragon Clan members. Not to mention the man in golden clothes who had taken two steps into heaven.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the seven Dragon Clan members appeared, they attracted the attention of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Palace Master hurriedly stepped forward</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her expression was cold as she said, "You all have gone too far, barging into my Qionghua Palace like this."</p><p></p><p>The man in golden robes looked at the Qionghua Palace Master's voluptuous figure with burning eyes. "Compared to awakening the great Qionghua deity, this is nothing."</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master frowned deeply. "Jin Jiao, why have you really come to the Hundred Flowers Gathering?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, to awaken the great Qionghua deity," Jin Jiao said casually. </p><p></p><p>Rather than awakening, it was more like he had come to look around and find some amusement.</p><p></p><p>"These are all guests of the Hundred Flowers Gathering. Jin Jiao, you'd better behave yourself!" the Palace Master said sternly. </p><p></p><p>With the great Qionghua deity, the Qionghua Palace surpassed the Northern Sea Dragon Clan. However, the great deity had never awakened, so now the Dragon Clan had the upper hand over the Qionghua Palace.</p><p></p><p>Facing Jin Jiao, the Palace Master was powerless and could only try to stop him verbally.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm participating in the Hundred Flowers Gathering to obtain treasures. How could I cause destruction?" Jin Jiao said casually as he walked into the gathering.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the various flower buds before him with an amused expression. "If all these buds were to bloom, it would certainly be an interesting sight."</p><p></p><p>The six True Gods accompanying him couldn't help but comment, "It's a pity there are still so many flowers. This Hundred Flowers Gathering probably won't be able to fully bloom."</p><p></p><p>"Each Hundred Flowers Gathering is worse than the last. I'm afraid that even after ten more gatherings, the flowers here still won't be able to fully bloom."</p><p></p><p>The dragon clan members criticized without restraint.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Palace Master was displeased, but had to admit that what the Northern Sea Dragon Clan said was true.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the chances of the great Qionghua deity awakening were extremely low. </p><p></p><p>Even so, the Palace Master still tried her best to distribute the treasures born from the Northern Sea Divine Eye, all in hopes of awakening the great deity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jin Jiao turned to look at the Palace Master. "Palace Master, since you are unable to awaken the great Qionghua deity, why not consider our Northern Sea Dragon Clan's proposal? Marry me, and we'll lend you our deity-summoning incense. Who knows, it may be able to awaken the great Qionghua deity!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't speak of this again!" The Palace Master's expression turned extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>How could she not know what the Northern Sea Dragon Clan was plotting?</p><p></p><p>The deity-summoning incense could indeed awaken the great Qionghua deity. But the one awakened would not be the Qionghua deity, but the Dragon Clan's own deity! The Northern Sea Dragon Clan's great deity had long since perished, slain by the third young miss of the Phoenix Clan with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The current Northern Sea Dragon Clan had no great deity.</p><p></p><p>So they had set their sights on the Qionghua Palace, intending to substitute their own deity.</p><p></p><p>How could the Qionghua Palace Master tolerate this?</p><p></p><p>Jin Jiao did not get angry, but instead said, "The northern lands are not peaceful now. Without a great deity guarding the Northern Sea Divine Eye, perhaps the three evil deity lords could join forces to break through the Divine Eye's formations. We sea creatures under the Northern Sea Divine Eye need a great deity."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Palace Master remained silent.</p><p></p><p>What Jin Jiao said was true, but how could she allow her master's body to be occupied by an old dragon?</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few more words, they ceased their conversation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jin Jiao seemed to notice something. His gaze fell on Qi Qi, then shifted to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The other six dragon clan members looked at Qi Qi with rather unfriendly expressions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Liuyun's expression turned difficult. He transmitted a message: "Brother Qi, don't get into a conflict with them. If anything happens, let's quickly leave together."</p><p></p><p>He was also of the dragon clan, but one that had conflicts with the Northern Sea Dragon Clan. Now, he could only live in an ancient well.</p><p></p><p>Jin Jiao looked at Qi Yuan with surprise in his eyes. He approached with the six True Gods: "Brother, one look and I can tell you're extraordinary, truly outstanding."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed not to have heard Jin Jiao's words, and instead looked at Zhao Zun beside him: "What's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Zun was looking at the seven people before him. For some reason, an intense fighting spirit welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had felt something similar when seeing Ye Liuyun earlier, but it was very faint. Now, this fighting spirit was several times stronger, his eyes almost glowing red.</p><p></p><p>"This subordinate... is a bit hungry," Zhao Zun swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jin Jiao felt somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the six True Gods guarding Qi Yuan, although their strength was very weak, he would not easily offend them.</p><p></p><p>He said coolly, "This maid of yours, brother, contains the bloodline of the Phoenix Clan. Our Northern Sea Dragon Clan has long been... at odds with the Phoenix Clan. Brother, could you do me and the Northern Sea Dragon Clan a favor? This girl, would you be willing to transfer her to me? Of course, I, Jin Jiao, am not one to take advantage without giving something in return. You may freely choose any three of my eighteen newly acquired concubines to take with you."</p><p></p><p>Jin Jiao's words could be considered quite generous.</p><p></p><p>Among some second-generation gods, exchanging maids and concubines was a common occurrence, not considered a big deal at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's arrogant demeanor, Jin Jiao assumed he was a second-generation noble like himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyebrow twitched as he looked at Jin Jiao: "What level are you to ask for face from me?"</p><p></p><p>This statement left Jin Jiao speechless.</p><p></p><p>It also shocked the other True Gods present.</p><p></p><p>Jin Jiao could be said to have already lowered his stance.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't give him any face at all.</p><p></p><p>Could this Qi Yuan truly be the son of a great deity? Jin Jiao looked at Qi Yuan, his expression somewhat gloomy, but inwardly extremely wary: "Even if you're unwilling to give me, Jin Jiao, face, is there need to humiliate our Northern Sea Dragon Clan like this?"</p><p></p><p>"You offended me by trying to trade your concubines for my goddaughter. Why should I give you face?" Qi Yuan spoke, "Not even as good as a ghost fire youth, truly useless."</p><p></p><p>"You..." Jin Jiao was furious. He didn't quite understand what a "ghost fire youth" was, but he knew the man before him was certainly insulting him.</p><p></p><p>However, the other's identity was unclear, and he wasn't the type of reckless second-generation noble to act impulsively.</p><p></p><p>He decided to first avoid confrontation and clarify the other's identity before taking action.</p><p></p><p>"I, Jin Jiao, will remember today's events!" Jin Jiao said, flinging his sleeve as he prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>The other True Gods found this scene quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Some also felt Qi Yuan was being excessively bold.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the Northern Sea Divine Eye, the home base of the Northern Sea Dragon Clan. If they were determined to detain Qi Yuan, even if he had a great deity backing him, it would be difficult to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>The other True Gods secretly felt that Qi Yuan, accustomed to his second-generation noble attitude and disregard for others, was unwise to place his life in the hands of his enemy's restraint.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately Jin Jiao held back, so the matter seemed to be settled for now.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan looked towards Jin Jiao: "You offend me and then just leave? You really don't take me for a game player, do you?"</p><p></p><p>In reality, one might need to be cautious and consider the consequences.</p><p></p><p>But in a game, of course one would go all out and dominate.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't suffer any grievances.</p><p></p><p>"You seven little mud eels, you can leave, but your divine power stays behind!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, his voice full of threat.</p><p></p><p>With these words, everyone present was shocked.</p><p></p><p>How dare Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, he still dared to provoke Jin Jiao!</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the experts Jin Jiao brought completely outclassed the six True Gods with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The six True Gods around Qi Yuan had very strong auras, but were clearly only at the early stage of Stepping into Heaven, having condensed just a few divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you?" Jin Jiao glared at Qi Yuan, rage surging in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Because I happen to be your nemesis," Qi Yuan said, smiling.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: I was focused on writing the new chapter and forgot to post this one. There will be another chapter around 3 o'clock, my apologies.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 230</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She never expected to receive such an answer.</p><p></p><p>This was the seed of a world, almost equivalent to the accumulation of an entire world.</p><p></p><p>The seed of a primordial world represents infinite possibilities, coveted even by Yang spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Lord... are you sure you don't want to reconsider?" Yang Lian asked, somewhat reluctant to give up.</p><p></p><p>The only one who could likely bring her sister out of the Mortal Heart Realm was probably the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"No need." Qi Yuan said decisively, his form disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Only Yang Lian remained in the alley. She looked at where Qi Yuan had vanished, her gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, powerful figures were gathering outside Flying Mist City.</p><p></p><p>The escape of the Evil God from the Evil God headquarters shocked the world.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons of the Ancient Gods in the Southern Lands also had a heated debate.</p><p></p><p>Those Ancient Gods had different views on the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Some Ancient Gods believed that the Origin Heavenly Lord was the savior of the Mortal Heart Realm, the only lifeline, and must be firmly grasped.</p><p></p><p>Some Ancient Gods thought that the Origin Heavenly Lord's glory was only temporary. Facing two Evil Gods above True God level, the Origin Heavenly Lord had no chance of winning. Only the Myth Plan could offer a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>However, some Ancient Gods believed that the Origin Heavenly Lord was another Evil God, and did not trust or think highly of him.</p><p></p><p>Those who came to Flying Mist City now were mostly Ancient Gods who held the first view.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe was among the crowd, following closely behind his master.</p><p></p><p>The smugness had disappeared from his face, replaced by a layer of resentment: "Those old fogies are really hateful. The Myth-level God Observing Method I worked so hard to visualize... was snatched away by them."</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe decided to come to the Northern Lands with his master to become subjects of the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Some Ancient Gods in the Southern Lands forced Dong Jianghe to leave behind the Myth-level God Observing Method. Those old fogies had said that since the Myth Plan provided resources to help the Chosen One visualize the Myth-level God Observing Method, the visualized method should remain in the Southern Lands.</p><p></p><p>His master consoled him from the side: "Coming to the Northern Lands may be your greatest opportunity in this life. A Myth-level God Observing Method is nothing."</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, a Myth-level God Observing Method could at most allow a Venerable at the second step of Sky Treading to enter the third step overnight.</p><p></p><p>For a Great Venerable, advancing half a step would be considered exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>In terms of potential and cultivation growth, it was not even as good as the Legendary visualized by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Right, the Origin Heavenly Lord once said he would give me benefits!" Mentioning this, Dong Jianghe's mood improved again.</p><p></p><p>All the Venerables in the group chat had come to Flying Mist City this time, and were now gathered here, exchanging ideas.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe's earlier lament was more to show off to the group friends present.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those group friends had long known Dong Jianghe's tricks and were too lazy to respond.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Venerable God Cat looked at Dong Jianghe with a disdainful expression: "So you're only at the first step of Sky Treading, yet you call yourself the Young Heavenly Emperor! I'm at the third step of Sky Treading, wouldn't that make me the Prime Heavenly Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Black Dragon was quite old, and said with a smile from the side: "Among our group, the weakest turns out to be Dong Jianghe!"</p><p></p><p>"I still remember when the Origin Heavenly Lord first appeared, Dong Jianghe even thought he was a divine being who hadn't reached the True God realm. Who knew the Origin Heavenly Lord was actually a Myth!" Venerable Bai Xi sighed from the side.</p><p></p><p>Though not much time had passed, it felt like a lifetime ago.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe was displeased upon hearing this: "Is that my fault? At the time, the Origin Heavenly Lord was like a complete newbie who didn't understand anything, not even the True God realm. Who knew he was playing dumb to fool us!"</p><p></p><p>When the Origin Heavenly Lord first joined the group, he indeed had the attitude of a small newbie, asking all sorts of questions.</p><p></p><p>"Who could have imagined... he was actually a Myth!" Venerable God Cat's eyes showed reverence.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods present also couldn't help but feel admiration upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>A Myth, the only Myth in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible... that the Origin Heavenly Lord we met back then wasn't a Myth?" Venerable Black Dragon spoke up at this time, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods present were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Not a Myth?</p><p></p><p>A divine being? "Venerable Black Dragon, what nonsense are you talking about? How could anyone go from Purple Palace to Myth in one month? Even a Yang spirit's reincarnation couldn't achieve this!" Dong Jianghe didn't believe it at all.</p><p></p><p>He thought the Origin Heavenly Lord was just fishing for information back then.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods present also agreed with Dong Jianghe's words.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Heavenly Lord must have already been a Myth, enduring in silence and accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>When his strength was sufficient, he struck fiercely at the Evil God.</p><p></p><p>"So, we shouldn't make baseless speculations or believe rumors. There are rumors saying the Origin Heavenly Lord is crazy and not very bright. How could the Origin Heavenly Lord cultivate to the Myth level and have such strength if he wasn't bright?" Dong Jianghe continued.</p><p></p><p>"Right, we often interact with the Origin Heavenly Lord in the group chat. How could we not know what he's like?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a world-class Ancient God must be unparalleled in the world. Even the Holy Mother of No Food can't compare."</p><p></p><p>Just then, Great Venerable Dusk appeared, and an ancient, profound aura spread across the scene.</p><p></p><p>All the Great Venerables and Venerables looked towards Great Venerable Dusk.</p><p></p><p>"This aura..."</p><p></p><p>"I sense endless, boundless water!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerables present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>They had a feeling that if Great Venerable Dusk were to attack them, none of them would be a match.</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Dusk before them was simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>A Venerable looked at Great Venerable Dusk, his eyes full of shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He had seen Venerable Dusk before, who was at the second step of Sky Treading like him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had become... a Great Venerable, and not an ordinary one at that.</p><p></p><p>Facing Great Venerable Dusk, he, who also practiced water control techniques, even wanted to bow down and pledge allegiance.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late today. The Heavenly Lord has already retired for rest. Everyone... let's have a meal together first. When dawn breaks, the Origin Heavenly Lord will summon you all." Great Venerable Dusk spoke, his voice refined and amiable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was sleeping on the Crooked Neck Tree with Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Dusk was also very surprised when he first saw this.</p><p></p><p>After all, at their level of cultivation, did they still need to sleep?</p><p></p><p>At the time, someone even secretly asked about it.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Heavenly Lord replied that even True Gods need to eat, so what's wrong with sleeping?</p><p></p><p>Those Ancient Gods were speechless.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods who had rushed over from the Southern Lands were also a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Sleeping?</p><p></p><p>Which True God needs to sleep? This must be to show them who's boss!</p><p></p><p>They were uneasy in their hearts, but also accepted this idea.</p><p></p><p>However, after anxiously having the meal and meeting the Origin Heavenly Lord the next day, they realized they had misunderstood the Origin Heavenly Lord yesterday.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Heavenly Lord was really sleeping.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was bleary-eyed, stretching his neck.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone... has arrived?</p><p></p><p>Very good, almost a thousand people have come.</p><p></p><p>Did you enjoy the meal?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan acted just like a host, looking at these thousand-plus Ancient Gods.</p><p></p><p>"We did!"</p><p></p><p>These Great Venerables and Ancient Gods all sized up Qi Yuan, wanting to see what this legendary Origin Heavenly Lord looked like.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spread his hands, his expression lazy: "My goal is to have feasts everywhere in the Mortal Heart Realm."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Eating, now we've already accomplished most of it."</p><p></p><p>When he first came to the Mortal Heart Realm, he was very hungry. Qingshui Village was destitute, with no food to eat. </p><p></p><p>Only by eating at banquets could he fill his stomach. He didn't want to see anyone else in this world starving like he had.</p><p></p><p>So he extended his empathy to others, wanting everyone in the world to have banquets to eat.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the bitterness and sweetness, his gaze suddenly turning sharp again.</p><p></p><p>"I've always been lazy, too lazy to paint grand visions for you, too lazy to waste words trying to fool you!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan said this, the expressions of the ancient gods present turned strange. </p><p></p><p>East River was also stunned, and couldn't help but send a mental message to the Cat God Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"This Origin Heavenly Lord is really quite unusual!"</p><p></p><p>"You mean to say the Origin Heavenly Lord is crazy, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Cat God Venerable, you're finished. I've recorded your mental message just now. If you don't give me that Stellar Divine Bronze, I'll give this recording to the Origin Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"...Playing mind games with your brother?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, all the ancient gods present felt the Origin Heavenly Lord was a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, shouldn't he at least say some pleasantries? </p><p></p><p>Even if there was no grand vision, painting a small one... would be better, right?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan paid no attention to everyone's reactions.</p><p></p><p>"I only have one requirement for you coming here - become my subjects. </p><p></p><p>If you agree, fill out the form within the time it takes an incense stick to burn.</p><p></p><p>If you don't agree, leave after finishing the banquet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was too lazy to explain a bunch of things to a group of NPCs.</p><p></p><p>When playing a game, explaining things to NPCs is a waste of effort.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Qi Yuan's words left the ancient gods present confused.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't they first discuss and communicate with each other, then decide whether to become subjects? Saying it so directly like this made some ancient gods uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This is too direct!"</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't we first exchange opinions with each other?"</p><p></p><p>"What if we become subjects, but he suddenly stops attacking the evil gods?"</p><p></p><p>"This is too undignified for me. Couldn't we find a private place to discuss this?"</p><p></p><p>Many ancient gods objected to Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>It was too direct and crude, the work too rough, not refined at all.</p><p></p><p>In fact, by coming to the Northern Lands, they had already prepared themselves to pledge loyalty to the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Because only the Origin Heavenly Lord dared to take action against the evil gods, and had a chance of leading them to victory over the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to guess the Origin Heavenly Lord's thoughts, just look at his actions! He attacked the evil gods, slaughtering over ten thousand - he is our benefactor!</p><p></p><p>For this alone, I am willing to become a subject of the Origin Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"I am willing too!"</p><p></p><p>The gathered gods all expressed their views.</p><p></p><p>Basic information registration forms flew down, and many ancient gods began filling in their information.</p><p></p><p>Some gods clutched the forms, conflicted inside, not wanting to discuss further, wanting to wait and see a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>Human nature is like this - even yin gods are no exception.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>Soon, form after form was handed to Qi Qi. About two-thirds of the ancient gods present chose to become Qi Yuan's subjects.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining third, some secretly chose to hand in their forms to Qi Qi when no one was looking. The rest chose to wait and see, or quietly leave.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>In Flying Mist City, Qi Yuan looked at all the ancient gods present, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, not only were there newly joined ancient gods, but also other villagers from Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Gathered together, there were over 4,000 people in total.</p><p></p><p>Among them, 99% were Venerables, with some like Big Black Dog at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, worthy of being my subjects - each of you has spirit!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise them.</p><p></p><p>After all, on Blue Star, except for in the military, gatherings of thousands of people in such settings were mostly listless, like gamers who had stayed up all night in an internet cafe.</p><p></p><p>"With such a mighty army, mobilizing the entire strength of Qingshui Village, how can we not defeat the evil gods?" Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi and the other Qingshui villagers had excitement in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>From starving, freezing villagers on the brink of death, to becoming deities that struck fear in the region.</p><p></p><p>All of this was because of the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to die for the Heavenly Lord!" Village Chief Yu Lu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers from Qingshui Village, as well as from Little Rock Village and Chen Xi Village, all shouted in unison: "We are willing to die for the Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>No matter what, in this moment, they truly seemed willing to die in battle for the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Dusk Supreme and the other ancient gods also seemed infected by the mood, shouting together: "We are willing to die for the Heavenly Lord!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, they did not mention the Mortal Heart Realm, only the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his hand, and the roaring shouts that were like heat waves instantly disappeared, leaving everything extremely quiet.</p><p></p><p>"We have all met by chance. I hope that after the affairs of the Mortal Heart Realm are concluded, everyone will have a bright future."</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm, Qi Yuan also had many subordinates.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, apart from the few he was most familiar with, he didn't know any of the others at all.</p><p></p><p>Those people also didn't share any common goals with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Their goals were to increase their strength and extend their lifespans.</p><p></p><p>In the end, awed by Qi Yuan's innate divine ability, they chose to serve him.</p><p></p><p>There was an element of coercion in it.</p><p></p><p>But the Mortal Heart Realm was different - everyone here shared the same goal.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were also willing to serve Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Lord, when will we... counterattack the evil gods?" Spirit Bell Supreme spoke up, asking what was on most people's minds.</p><p></p><p>He had once been entrusted by the No Food Holy Mother to deliver something to the Origin Heavenly Lord before going to the Sky Pillar.</p><p></p><p>"After... your strengths increase this time, rest for a day, then we can begin the decisive battle!" Qi Yuan's gaze was like a torch.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this plan was the most nerve-wracking and least certain of all the plans he had made.</p><p></p><p>Two Yang Gods... could he really win? He wasn't sure either.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ancient gods present felt excitement rise in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, the power increases of Thunder God Supreme, Dusk Supreme, Fire Lotus Supreme and the others were right before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect to directly enter the Mythical realm like Thunder God Supreme.</p><p></p><p>But gaining a powerful god-observing method and increasing their strength somewhat... was always good.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over everyone, his voice calm: "Everyone... let's set out!"</p><p></p><p>This time, he planned to use the Lost Glow Stick one last time to return to the past, envision more god-observing methods, and help these ancient gods grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that an ancient god could only use one god-observing method. For example, for Thunder God Supreme, Qi Yuan could also envision methods like the Thunder God for him to use, which would also help increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had led people to slaughter over ten thousand evil gods, including four Mythical realm ones.</p><p></p><p>The evil god spiritual power in his possession was unprecedentedly abundant, over a hundred times more than what he had for the previous envisioning.</p><p></p><p>The gods he could envision were also more numerous and more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Those famous and powerful gods - Qi Yuan planned to envision them all in one go.</p><p></p><p>He might even envision... the Three Pure Ones.</p><p></p><p>This would also be Qi Yuan's last chance!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

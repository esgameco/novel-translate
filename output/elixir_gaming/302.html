        <h1>Chapter 302</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as he got home, he saw the cat sprawled limply on the sofa. It seemed weak and exhausted, looking quite miserable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan return, the cat merely glanced at him indifferently, without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>The robot Zero One thoughtfully brought over a cup of hot tea, standing beside Qi Yuan like a dedicated butler.</p><p></p><p>"Followers increased by 4,572, yesterday's earnings were 2,321 yuan."</p><p></p><p>"The goods transported by狂欢 have arrived and are stored in the warehouse."</p><p></p><p>"Seven videos were filmed today, not yet edited. Editing is expected to be completed tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the limits of martial arts, Zero One searched various information online and even infiltrated the national database of Qin Yuan Country, obtaining 145 useful pieces of information. </p><p></p><p>After analyzing and organizing these 145 pieces of information, a conclusion was reached.</p><p></p><p>To break through the limits of martial arts, one needs to go to martial arts ruins.</p><p></p><p>Currently there are 231 martial arts ruins sites around the world."</p><p></p><p>Zero One reported various information.</p><p></p><p>Now it was constantly evolving every day.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said to be stronger than ordinary puppets in the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>It possessed extremely powerful hacking skills, even able to infiltrate Qin Yuan Country's secret database to obtain hidden information.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu, listening to Zero One's voice nearby, felt indignant.</p><p></p><p>This robot was simply inhuman, even more heartless than capitalists. Today it had made her film seven videos.</p><p></p><p>Filming seven videos was one thing, but earning two thousand yuan a day for her, while she ate cat food costing dozens of yuan per pound.</p><p></p><p>No cat toys, no cat tree.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this completely abusing cats? Xie Xinsu hadn't actually realized that she was gradually accepting the fact of becoming a cat.</p><p></p><p>However, hearing the last part, a curve appeared on her little mouth.</p><p></p><p>What era was this, still thinking about practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With Gong Xing about to revive spiritual energy, only those who cultivate immortality like her had a future.</p><p></p><p>Only by cultivating immortality was there hope of attaining the great Dao of longevity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, now that she was a cat, even if she had these thoughts, she couldn't express them.</p><p></p><p>Even if she could express them, why would she introduce the immortal way to this cold, heartless, boorish man who didn't know how to appreciate it? Most importantly, if she could demonstrate other talents, no doubt she would be tormented by this damned robot to film videos.</p><p></p><p>When would this kind of life end?</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts ruins?" Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't obtained such information from Yang Shan.</p><p></p><p>But hearing that this news came from Qin Yuan Country's secret database, Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>Although Yang Shan was at the limit of martial arts, his understanding of martial arts might not be as deep as that of some professors.</p><p></p><p>In a society like Qin Yuan Country, all kinds of powerful people would certainly be thinking about longevity.</p><p></p><p>There must be frighteningly many experiments related to longevity.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for the powerful to focus their attention on martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If martial arts ruins truly held hope for breaking through the limits of martial arts, he would have to go take a look after the martial arts competition ended.</p><p></p><p>Now, there were only three days left until the start of the martial arts competition.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have time to go to martial arts ruins.</p><p></p><p>"It seems your hacking skills are quite impressive, to be able to steal such hidden information," Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>Zero One was his own creation, and the stronger its abilities, the more gratified Qi Yuan felt.</p><p></p><p>"Not just that, almost any information online, if I want it, I can obtain it.</p><p></p><p>While searching online, I also saw many interesting things. I've organized them, and if the master wants to see, I can send them to you," Zero One said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Now it was becoming more and more human-like.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of interesting things?" Qi Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"It's..." Zero One lowered its voice and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became strange: "Spreading pornographic and obscene information is illegal behavior.</p><p></p><p>Moreover... you're not my friend.</p><p></p><p>Only sharing between friends is not illegal."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not accept this file package.</p><p></p><p>It was just some electronic data after all.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary humans, aren't they just made up of various elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc?</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan went to the martial arts gym again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had just started practicing martial arts for a short while when Xu Tiehua came running over to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Qi Yuan, there are only three days left until the martial arts competition. For the team competition, do you want to discuss it a bit?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua was very much looking forward to the team competition.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had money and power, he wanted to become famous.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, fame is also very useful, and some titles and gimmicks can play a huge role.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, we'll meet the night before the competition," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>This response confused Xu Tiehua, but he had good manners and slowly said, "Won't that be too late? The rules for the team competition are somewhat complicated.</p><p></p><p>If we make a strategy first, we might be able to achieve better results."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't the rules of martial arts just about who has the harder fist?" Qi Yuan asked doubtfully, "When the time comes, I'll just knock down all the opponents, won't that solve the problem?"</p><p></p><p>This statement choked Xu Tiehua again.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said wasn't wrong.</p><p></p><p>But this was based on having strong abilities.</p><p></p><p>The four participating members from Ming Wu Martial Arts Gym were not very strong.</p><p></p><p>Especially Qi Yuan, who probably hadn't even obtained a martial artist certificate yet. How could he have the face to say such things?</p><p></p><p>But thinking that Qi Yuan did indeed have a certificate, Xu Tiehua could only helplessly say, "What you say makes sense, but... our abilities are not enough, we need to rely on strategy."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder your abilities are not enough, chatting idly all day. If you practiced martial arts as diligently as I do, would you still worry about lacking ability?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>His body was still practicing punches.</p><p></p><p>Although his progress had slowed after reaching the limit of martial arts,</p><p></p><p>he still persevered in practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words made Xu Tiehua blush a little.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected Qi Yuan to be a true martial arts fanatic.</p><p></p><p>While he had always treated martial arts as a calling card, hearing Qi Yuan's words made him feel somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, practicing martial arts should be done properly," Xu Tiehua decided not to disturb Qi Yuan further.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts... is very interesting," Qi Yuan said softly, looking at Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>Over these nearly three months, practicing martial arts daily, his understanding of martial arts had grown deeper and deeper.</p><p></p><p>He knew that on the path of martial arts, he had not yet even entered the door.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the potential of martial arts in this world was no weaker than the immortal ways of other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts is interesting?" Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Xu Tiehua was slightly stunned in his heart, seeming somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't ask anything further and left directly.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Wang Shiqiao saw this scene and couldn't help but give Qi Yuan a thumbs up: "You're still fierce, daring to talk to Brother Xu like that."</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Tiehua was approachable in the gym,</p><p></p><p>these students still felt full of respect and awe when facing Xu Tiehua.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't imagine directly confronting Xu Tiehua like Qi Yuan did.</p><p></p><p>"I was just telling the truth," Qi Yuan glanced at Wang Shiqiao, "But I am indeed braver than you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile on Wang Shiqiao's face froze.</p><p></p><p>"Your mouth should really be sewn shut with needle and thread," Wang Shiqiao said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you say that to that Gui Ran person?" Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's courage was still as small as ever.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, many of the students present laughed.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Wang Shiqiao had a verbal fight with a military officer from Wu Gui Country three months ago,</p><p></p><p>For the past three months, that officer had been sending private messages cursing at Wang Shiqiao every day.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao couldn't help but curse back every day.</p><p></p><p>They had been insulting each other for a full three months.</p><p></p><p>Of course, only online.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Mutual insults.</p><p></p><p>This incident spread throughout the martial arts school, becoming a joke. That's why Qi Yuan said Wang Shiqiao was timid.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, forget about being cursed online for three months, he would have tracked down the person through the internet and killed them that very day.</p><p></p><p>"If he dares come to Tianyue, I'll definitely teach him a lesson he won't forget!" Wang Shiqiao said hatefully, glaring at Qi Yuan. "This didn't happen to you, so what would you do if it did? Rush to the battlefield and beat up that Guiran officer?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu laughed at this point: "Never mind Qi Yuan, if it were me I would have blocked and blacklisted him long ago, not argued with him for three months. Besides, I wouldn't have gotten into an online flame war with him in the first place."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Wang Shiqiao: "If he dared curse me like that, I'd definitely go kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone can brag!" Wang Shiqiao said loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, on the Shenhua Society forum, someone kept cursing me and framing me. Fortunately, there are still good people in this world, and someone helped me record those people. Then, I traveled thousands of miles and judged each of them one by one. At that time, I didn't even have a certificate of mental illness, yet I dared to do that. Now that I have the certificate, do you think I'd become more timid?" Qi Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Stop bragging, what's this Shenhua Society anyway?"</p><p></p><p>"A cultivation forum!" Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>"Now we're talking about cultivation, this is ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>"If I were making this up, I wouldn't make it so outlandish. The fact that it's so outlandish makes me think it's true," Xing Yu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"If it's true, can I join the Shenhua Society?" Wang Shiqiao asked jokingly.</p><p></p><p>"No, because... your aptitude is too low," Qi Yuan flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had put in a lot of effort, and only with the help of his junior sister Jiang Lingsu, did he manage to join the Shenhua Society. Not just anyone could join the Shenhua Society. Wang Shiqiao's cultivation aptitude was really ordinary, far from being considered a genius.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, afraid I'll expose your lies if I join? Traveling thousands of miles to kill people, have you even been abroad?" Wang Shiqiao laughed loudly, mocking him mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's phone rang.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because not many people knew his phone number.</p><p></p><p>Generally, no one would call to contact him, especially at this time.</p><p></p><p>Now, an unfamiliar number was displayed on the screen.</p><p></p><p>"Hello," Qi Yuan answered the phone.</p><p></p><p>From the other end of the line came an anxious and hesitant voice.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Mr. Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm Kuanghuan's wife. Kuanghuan... he's in trouble. I... I don't know what to do. I've begged many people, but no one can help. Finally... *sobs*..."</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the phone, the woman's voice was choked with emotion.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that she was in a bad state, her mental condition close to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Her speech was not very clear.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes: "Where are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm in... Xinyang..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I'll be there soon."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment and decided to go over anyway.</p><p></p><p>After all, Kuanghuan could be considered his collaborator.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for the past three months, he had been working diligently for Qi Yuan, not requiring Qi Yuan to worry about anything.</p><p></p><p>All sorts of mutant sea monsters and such, he caught them as soon as he was asked.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he was Qi Yuan's representative in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was in trouble, Qi Yuan would still go to help him out.</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Wang Shiqiao leaned in and said, "Did something happen? Do you need our help?"</p><p></p><p>On the phone, Wang Shiqiao had heard a woman crying.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Qi Yuan was dealing with some kind of situation.</p><p></p><p>As people from the same martial arts school and social circle, they considered themselves friends.</p><p></p><p>When something happened, everyone was willing to help each other.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu also asked, "If it's troublesome, you can tell us. We might not have much ability, but there's strength in numbers."</p><p></p><p>The martial arts school was also a social circle, forming a network of related interests.</p><p></p><p>People like them, who were "moderately wealthy," could exert considerable influence by sticking together.</p><p></p><p>"No need, it's just a small matter. A... friend of mine is in trouble, I'm going to check on him," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he sent an instruction to Zero One on his phone, asking Zero One to arrange train tickets for him.</p><p></p><p>"That's good if it's just a small matter," hearing this, Wang Shiqiao breathed a sigh of relief. "Make sure you handle it quickly, don't miss the martial arts competition in three days."</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Qi Yuan nodded, said goodbye to everyone, and left the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a luxuriously decorated villa in Xinyang City.</p><p></p><p>The young woman's face was still stained with tears. At this moment, she was distraught and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Beside her was a burly woman, whose eyes were about to burst with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, to hell with the big picture, to hell with not being able to intervene. My brother was working for them, and now that he's been captured by Wugui, they not only refuse to rescue him or apply diplomatic pressure, but they're even completely disassociating themselves?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the burly woman became very angry.</p><p></p><p>She was Kuanghuan's sister, Kuangxi, but at this moment she couldn't be happy at all.</p><p></p><p>The young woman looked haggard: "I went to see that general, he said that in this matter, he was also powerless."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean powerless? Isn't it just that they're afraid of leaving evidence?" Kuangxi said through gritted teeth. "They're just unwilling to make an effort!"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan had been working for the military of Qinyuan country all along, helping to clear some military arsenal inventory and supporting Yuelang country against Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>This time, there was a mole within Qinyuan country, Kuanghuan was exposed, and was arrested and detained by the military of Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>"But that general said... Kuanghuan's life isn't in danger. He said as long as we wait patiently, Wugui country will send Kuanghuan back in three years at the earliest. I begged other people, and most of them said the same thing." The young woman mentioned this with helplessness in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She came from a relatively ordinary background, and without Kuanghuan, she found it difficult to handle these big issues.</p><p></p><p>Even Kuanghuan's superior generals were unwilling to help her, and she had no other options.</p><p></p><p>She went to many of Kuanghuan's good friends, but the answers she got were all similar.</p><p></p><p>These people were unwilling to get involved in this matter, mostly comforting her to be patient, saying that if she waited for a while, Kuanghuan would definitely be released.</p><p></p><p>However, she couldn't be at ease until she saw Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of trash. When my brother was around, they were all fawning over him. Now that he's in a bit of trouble, they treat us like we're plague-ridden?" Kuangxi became more and more angry as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Thankfully, there's that Mr. Qi. He's willing to come here. I wonder if he has any way to rescue Kuanghuan." The young woman was now treating Qi Yuan as her only lifeline.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... who is he?" Kuangxi showed a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>She wasn't clear about who Qi Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>"He is..." the young woman hesitated for a moment, "someone my husband greatly admires."</p><p></p><p>"Someone my brother admires? Could he be from some big family?" Kuangxi was puzzled, then disappointed.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, even if someone from a big family intervened, it would be of no use.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a game between two major countries.</p><p></p><p>Even small nobles like them could be sacrificed at any time.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that Mr. Qi was willing to come, Kuangxi still felt a bit comforted.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was of no use, at least his attitude was there.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 147</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How come they're all Mysterious-level techniques, hmm..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's actually a Heaven-level technique!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. </p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen a Heaven-level technique.</p><p></p><p>This Heaven-level technique was obtained from Qian Yuan's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>It was called "Seven Elements Dark God Technique".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very excited.</p><p></p><p>His "Qi Yuan Scripture" had been stagnant for a while. If he could get a Heaven-level technique, the gains it brought him might be able to advance the progress of the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>"I really want to go back and build him a tomb... forget it, the people from the Light Palace will discover it when they return, and they'll help build one for him then. I'll just consider it as if I built it."</p><p></p><p>"I've hit the jackpot, sure enough old geezers are better at dropping gold coins!"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, to be selected as my ideal love, I need to set a few hard rules, otherwise even trash like Broken Wolf can become my ideal love, it's too low-class.</p><p></p><p>First, they need to be old, the older the better. </p><p></p><p>Second, their cultivation level needs to be high, the higher the better.</p><p></p><p>Third, they need to have little lifespan left, old men are easier to die."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly scanned through the technique, then flew towards Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Night gradually fell, and Xu Tongchen quietly waited outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how strong the person that fellow cultivator wants to kill is, does he need my help?"</p><p></p><p>"What if he dies out there?"</p><p></p><p>"The enemy shouldn't be too difficult to kill, right?"</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Xu Tongchen's mind.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't stay outside for too long, Huang Tu wouldn't allow it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Huang Tu had secretly left spies to watch him.</p><p></p><p>Towards Huang Tu and the Light Palace, he felt extremely disgusted, but was powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>"You're still here?" Just then, a crisp voice came.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen hurriedly looked over and saw that familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>The Solar True Fire within his body also started to burn hot at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator, have you finished killing the person?" Xu Tongchen asked.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Qi Yuan and saw that his clothes were neat and his aura was stable.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that the enemy killed must have been very weak.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, finished killing, they were all old men, very easy to kill," Qi Yuan said casually. He looked at Xu Tongchen, "Follow me into the dwelling for a chat."</p><p></p><p>He was also quite interested in the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen didn't hesitate and followed Qi Yuan into the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator, may I take a look at your Solar True Fire?" Qi Yuan got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>This confused Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he the one who was supposed to be finding out information from this person?</p><p></p><p>But thinking that he was the one asking for a favor, he didn't conceal it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, bringing it out wasn't a big deal for him.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, then said: "Be careful, don't let the Solar True Fire hurt you."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Tongchen spoke, he began to use his Dao technique.</p><p></p><p>Only to see, within the cave dwelling, a round golden core appeared.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura emanated from the golden core.</p><p></p><p>"Your golden core is a bit too small, it can't withstand attacks," Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The golden core he had formed was at least Earth-rank upper grade... In Cuiyun Continent, it was almost impossible to find a golden core of higher grade than his.</p><p></p><p>But... it was evaluated as being a bit small.</p><p></p><p>He suppressed his thoughts. Above the golden core, a wisp of flame leapt out.</p><p></p><p>The flame was very small, only about the size of a candle flame, but the aura on it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that even if a Nascent Soul was ignited by this fire, it would feel unbearable.</p><p></p><p>The Solar True Fire was dark inside and bright outside, emitting a strong golden light. It constantly flickered in front of Qi Yuan, as if wanting to break free from Xu Tongchen's golden core and leap onto Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen could sense the eagerness of the Solar True Fire and its affinity towards the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This also made him look at Qi Yuan with more affection and fervor.</p><p></p><p>[Solar True Fire, a divine ability fire, those with affinity can comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>This fire can devour all flames under heaven.</p><p></p><p>The sun possessing Solar True Fire can devour all stars.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the last sentence, Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he became overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the Heterogeneous Fire of a certain Yan?</p><p></p><p>Has his lucky encounter finally come?</p><p></p><p>If he comprehended the Solar True Fire and sent it to his stellar golden core, wouldn't that mean his stellar golden core could feast in that universe? He looked at Xu Tongchen with burning eyes: "Why don't you give me this fire?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This was too blatant, right? He became wary: "This fire cannot be given away."</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me, and you can name any condition.</p><p></p><p>Do you have any enemies? I'll help you kill them.</p><p></p><p>Do you have any ideal love? I'm best at pursuing people." Qi Yuan said quickly.</p><p></p><p>He was the embodiment of justice, he wouldn't forcefully rob or kill people for treasures without reason.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "This fire really cannot be given away."</p><p></p><p>The Solar True Fire was the foundation of his existence, of course he couldn't give it to someone else.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was something he had comprehended himself, similar to a divine ability, how could it be given to others?</p><p></p><p>"Look at your Solar True Fire, it almost sees me as its father," Qi Yuan stared longingly at the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was helpless and didn't dwell on this topic: "Sir... do you know why this situation is occurring?"</p><p></p><p>This was also something he didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, when near this person, he could feel that the Solar True Fire within his body burned more vigorously.</p><p></p><p>His Solar True Fire was constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Because... I am the sun," Qi Yuan answered matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"If I comprehend your Solar True Fire daily, would I be able to comprehend my own Solar True Fire?" Since he couldn't forcefully take it, Qi Yuan tried to solve the problem of obtaining Solar True Fire from another angle.</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible. Back then, it took me twenty years of comprehension before I comprehended the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>If I bring out the Solar True Fire for you to observe for half an hour every day, and if your talent is high, you should be able to comprehend it in about twenty years as well," Xu Tongchen answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's proposal was very outrageous, but he patiently answered.</p><p></p><p>"How about this, I'll use your Solar True Fire for comprehension every day, and in return I'll help you kill people?" Qi Yuan asked, "I'm really good at killing people. As long as they deserve to die, I won't let a single one go."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen felt that the person in front of him was... truly strange.</p><p></p><p>Killing people? The ones he wanted to kill but couldn't, Qi Yuan probably couldn't kill either.</p><p></p><p>The ones he could kill, he had already killed himself.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for fellow cultivator to be so polite. Bringing out the Solar True Fire near you is also beneficial for me. For this period of time, I'll come see fellow cultivator every day," Xu Tongchen ultimately chose not to take advantage of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it was his personality.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, due to the Solar True Fire, he felt very affectionate towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then it's settled. You'll come see me for half an hour every day.</p><p></p><p>Before I comprehend the Solar True Fire... I'll have your back in the future." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen smiled: "Then I hope fellow cultivator comprehends slowly, so you can have my back for a longer time."</p><p></p><p>Of course he was joking.</p><p></p><p>Against the Light Palace, even Nascent Soul powerhouses couldn't protect him.</p><p></p><p>Let alone this strange cultivator in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my talent is already comparable to a high school genius class. Comprehending Solar True Fire won't be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>His star was still at the golden core stage, shouldn't comprehending Solar True Fire be a piece of cake? "Come, let me see what exactly this thing is."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked seriously at the Solar True Fire that was brought out.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Qi Yuan hung his head dejectedly: "It's too difficult."</p><p></p><p>After comprehending for half an hour, he hadn't comprehended anything.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen smiled: "This is normal for fellow cultivator."</p><p></p><p>His Solar True Fire had grown a bit more robust.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'll come again tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>Over ten Nascent Soul cultivators had gathered, with the Third Palace Master at the lead.</p><p></p><p>The phoenix eyes of the Third Palace Master Zi Yan were calm, making it impossible to discern her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Qian Yuan died in the Light Palace, what do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Nascent Soul cultivators present all had slight changes in expression.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan's strength was considered top ten even in the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>He was also the one in the Light Palace with the highest chance of advancing to late-stage Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>But he ended up dying in the Bright King Palace, at the hands of the Blood-robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Five Nascent Soul cultivators in a row, the strength of this Blood-robed Sword Immortal... must have reached late-stage Nascent Soul," an elder mentioned, his eyes filled with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Light Palace, only the three Palace Masters were at late-stage Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qian Yuan had immense potential, yet he was killed just like that. This Blood-robed Sword Immortal truly doesn't take our Light Palace seriously? If he dares to come, we'll all attack together, along with the three Palace Masters, we'll make sure he comes but doesn't leave!" an elder said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Having been high and mighty in the Light Palace for so long, it was the first time they felt the threat of death. The Light Palace elders present were all very angry.</p><p></p><p>"Killing Elder Qian Yuan without leaving any survivors, this Blood-robed Sword Immortal has completely torn apart all pretenses with our Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>It's either he dies, or we perish."</p><p></p><p>The over ten Nascent Soul cultivators present had almost reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>The Light Palace was the hegemon of Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Genius Battle was about to take place in Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>If their Light Palace's reputation was intimidated by a single late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator,</p><p></p><p>How could the Light Palace establish a foothold in the Eastern Lands?</p><p></p><p>The Third Palace Master Zi Yan spoke: "Nascent Soul cultivators in various regions should all be more careful during this period, don't go out alone.</p><p></p><p>If you discover news of the Blood-robed Sword Immortal, just report back to the palace. I will personally go to suppress him!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" The Nascent Soul cultivators present all agreed.</p><p></p><p>The Light Palace had over sixty Nascent Soul cultivators in total.</p><p></p><p>How could the Blood-robed Sword Immortal, a single Nascent Soul cultivator, possibly</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Could he contend with over sixty Purple Mansion cultivators? After the difficult slaying of Elder Qian Yuan and four other Purple Mansion cultivators, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's current condition was certainly not very good.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they were judging by normal standards, which wasn't wrong. </p><p></p><p>The only mistake was that Qi Yuan was not a normal person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, the Third Palace Master Zi Kui ordered: "Send word that Huang Tu should prioritize the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle. He doesn't need to return for his master's funeral."</p><p></p><p>Achieving a top 20 ranking in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle was crucial.</p><p></p><p>Second only to the Hundred Nations Blood War.</p><p></p><p>It was even more important than killing the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Xu Tongchen came to the entrance of Qi Yuan's cave dwelling. He was very worried.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu's master had perished, and Huang Tu was in a rage today.</p><p></p><p>Even when going out, Xu Tongchen was extremely cautious to avoid getting caught up in trouble.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword Saint's slaughter of three Purple Mansion cultivators from the Light Palace filled Xu Tongchen with admiration.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to know what kind of great cultivator would dare to attack a behemoth like the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>Many factions in the Emerald Continent had long harbored complaints about the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was not optimistic about the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's future.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Light Palace was simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>A late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator could not shake the Light Palace's position.</p><p></p><p>If he insisted on clashing with them, the Light Palace might suffer heavy losses, but the Blood-Robed Sword Saint would likely perish.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, I'm here," Xu Tongchen called out from outside the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're here. Come in."</p><p></p><p>The cave opened, and Xu Tongchen entered to see a weary-looking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put down the jade slip containing cultivation techniques and slowly said to Xu Tongchen: "Fellow Daoist Tongchen, you may need to wait here for a while. I need to go out for a bit to kill someone... oh, no, I mean to see my true love."</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He felt Qi Yuan was truly strange.</p><p></p><p>Killing someone the first time they met.</p><p></p><p>And now going out to kill again.</p><p></p><p>"The person I'm killing this time isn't far, I'll be back soon. Make yourself at home in the cave," Qi Yuan said before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Only a helpless Xu Tongchen remained.</p><p></p><p>He felt this Qi Yuan was far too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Who knew how many enemies he had to kill, saying he was going out to kill someone as soon as they met.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the forest, Qi Yuan wore a blood-red robe, his long hair flowing, looking handsome and otherworldly.</p><p></p><p>Standing under a giant tree, no one would take him for a Purple Mansion powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Did you bring the suona horn?" Qi Yuan slowly asked Li Yeyi behind him.</p><p></p><p>"I did." Li Yeyi looked at Qi Yuan's excessively young face and replied nervously. </p><p></p><p>He never imagined that yesterday... the Blood-Robed Sword Saint had really killed all five Purple Mansion cultivators from the Bright King Palace.</p><p></p><p>This kind of terrifying strength would rank in the top five even in the Emerald Continent.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Lands, he would probably be in the top 100, a truly famous figure.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint had suddenly emerged from the Hundred Nations, and no information about him could be found.</p><p></p><p>They only knew he came from the Divine Flower Society and had a grudge against the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>"You learned to play it, right?" Qi Yuan looked at Li Yeyi.</p><p></p><p>"In reply to Your Excellency, I practiced all night and learned it," Li Yeyi answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, when I go to kill the Purple Mansion cultivator from the Light Palace later, you play music for me," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He was a Heavenly Dao Foundation and Constant Star Golden Core cultivator after all.</p><p></p><p>When fighting, he needed a Purple Mansion cultivator to play music to match his status and level.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency... shouldn't we consider this more carefully?" Li Yeyi couldn't help saying, "Your Excellency just killed five Purple Mansion cultivators yesterday. Why not rest and recover before taking action again?</p><p></p><p>This time, Your Excellency's whereabouts are likely to be exposed. If surrounded by the Light Palace, it will be difficult for Your Excellency to escape."</p><p></p><p>"What, are you going back on your word from yesterday?" Qi Yuan glanced at Li Yeyi, a faint smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Yeyi's heart skipped a beat, feeling he was facing some kind of demon god.</p><p></p><p>"No... everything will be as Your Excellency commands," Li Yeyi dared not say anything more.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was also very curious how this expert managed to kill Purple Mansion cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that Purple Mansion cultivators were very difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was a huge difference in the quality of their innate divine abilities, or they happened to be mutually restraining.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, fights required depleting a Purple Mansion cultivator's innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. This time my true love is the isolated Mei Yang," Qi Yuan said before his form turned into a rainbow of light.</p><p></p><p>Li Yeyi hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had already given up.</p><p></p><p>The Light Palace was going to secretly deal with him anyway.</p><p></p><p>He might as well follow the Blood-Robed Sword Saint and do something big.</p><p></p><p>A quarter hour later.</p><p></p><p>In Phoenix Arrival City.</p><p></p><p>Mei Yang of the Light Palace looked at the message from his sect, a cold expression on his face: "So it's actually a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. This Blood-Robed Sword Saint... is somewhat troublesome."</p><p></p><p>But thinking of the three Palace Masters and the Light Palace's guardian treasures,</p><p></p><p>The worry in his heart completely disappeared: "But it's just the desperate struggle of a cornered beast."</p><p></p><p>"Elder, should we return to the sect now?" a Divine Infant steward carefully asked.</p><p></p><p>"We haven't finished collecting the hearts of 300 yin-born male children yet, why rush back?</p><p></p><p>Are you worried about the Blood-Robed Sword Saint? He just destroyed the Bright King Palace, he's probably still recovering his energy somewhere.</p><p></p><p>He won't show up, and even if he does, he'll only expose his hiding place," Mei Yang analyzed reasonably.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Divine Infant steward said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a desolate and tragic suona horn sound rang out in Phoenix Arrival City.</p><p></p><p>Mei Yang frowned.</p><p></p><p>Purple Mansion?</p><p></p><p>"Which fellow Daoist has come to my Phoenix Arrival City? This poor Daoist is Mei Yang of the Light Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Yang flew towards the sky, looking in the direction of the sound.</p><p></p><p>His pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw a Purple Mansion cultivator in black robes playing the suona horn, and a man in a blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>"Blood... Blood-Robed Sword Saint..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, a strong sense of crisis struck.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, he immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>Although he had analyzed a lot, saying the Blood-Robed Sword Saint wouldn't take action for now, that the Blood-Robed Sword Saint hadn't recovered his energy yet.</p><p></p><p>But appearing before him, he knew that now he could only run.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan frowned: "Why does it feel like the sound of a police siren scaring someone away?"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the sword on Qi Yuan's back unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>"The Light Palace has committed many evils, their crimes deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>"I, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, shall punish them on behalf of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>The innate divine ability of the Void Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Attraction was quickly unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The frantically fleeing Mei Yang's form suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have fallen into a demonic realm.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of negative emotions filled his soul.</p><p></p><p>"No... my Light Palace is the true leader of the righteous path!"</p><p></p><p>"They all deserve to die, deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't come after me!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Yang lost his mind, becoming deranged in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The suona horn sound suddenly became high and intense.</p><p></p><p>Li Yeyi looked at Mei Yang, fear showing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword Saint's innate divine ability... how could it be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It was the most terrifying innate divine ability he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't a divine ability, it was clearly the bewitchment of a demon god!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I still need to strike another blow. How boring," Qi Yuan looked at the dazed Mei Yang.</p><p></p><p>His innate divine ability could only make Mei Yang's heart demons run wild for a while, unable to truly kill Mei Yang.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to deliver the final blow.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand gently pushed forward.</p><p></p><p>Mei Yang, a Purple Mansion cultivator, thus tragically perished.</p><p></p><p>It happened extremely quickly, not even three breaths.</p><p></p><p>Li Yeyi watched this scene, his legs trembling uncontrollably under his black robes.</p><p></p><p>How could Purple Mansion cultivators be killed like this? Weren't they supposed to... slowly compete with innate divine abilities? He looked at the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, the fear in his heart growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the person is killed, the storage bag is taken, we'll meet again next time." Qi Yuan glanced at Li Yeyi before his form disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Yeyi also quickly fled. How could he dare to stay here.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night had fallen. After seeing Xu Tongchen off from the cave dwelling, Qi Yuan felt very helpless.</p><p></p><p>"The Solar True Fire is really difficult. I still have no clues even now."</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan wasn't discouraged.</p><p></p><p>You can't be too hasty with everything.</p><p></p><p>As long as he made a detailed plan, he would be able to comprehend the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>He stopped thinking about the Solar True Fire and opened the jade slip from the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>He had received many friend requests, which he didn't accept. Instead, he posted again on the forum.</p><p></p><p>[Bored, killed a Purple Mansion cultivator to liven things up for everyone.]</p><p></p><p>After posting, he switched to his main account.</p><p></p><p>"Rogue Immortal Lord, how much longer until you arrive?"</p><p></p><p>"Still on the way, ran into some trouble. Should be there in less than ten days."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, I'm waiting for you to introduce me to prodigies and broaden my horizons. </p><p>Do you think at the Prodigy Banquet, someone will look down on my poor background and try to humiliate me?"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Heavenly Lord, just don't reveal your identity," Rogue Immortal Lord was very afraid of Qi Yuan exposing his identity.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, Huang Tu would definitely capture Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense." Qi Yuan pondered for a moment, agreeing with Rogue Immortal Lord's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a poor man pretending to be rich. If I fall in love at first sight with some female prodigy at the banquet, what will happen when they discover my poor background?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

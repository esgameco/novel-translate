        <h1>Chapter 475</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A commonplace sword strike once again pierced through the shattered body of Dao Buer.</p><p></p><p>If the first strike had extinguished Dao Buer's physical form, then this second strike had shattered his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>This strike from Qi Yuan contained the full force of a Great Dao Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Although he was incapable of injuring an ordinary Great Dao Sovereign, effortlessly slaying one was no problem.</p><p></p><p>In Dao Buer's shattered pupils, an expression of incomprehension and disbelief was etched.</p><p></p><p>"You are not... a Great Dao Sovereign, so why...?"</p><p></p><p>Over the years of verbal battles with Qi Yuan, Dao Buer had secretly probed the depths of Qi Yuan's abilities. How could Qi Yuan so easily and swiftly slay him?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you lost, your memory seems a bit lacking." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"I was never a Great Dao Sovereign to begin with, I am... the Purple Palace!" As the words left his mouth, Qi Yuan's hand trembled.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Dao Buer's towering and powerful physical form and divine soul were utterly crushed.</p><p></p><p>Until his dying breath, Dao Buer's face remained etched with an expression of incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>He could not fathom how Qi Yuan's words, which he felt were sincere, could be true. Could his opponent really be from the Purple Palace? How was that possible?</p><p></p><p>"I... have been slain by one from the Purple Palace!" </p><p></p><p>With his last vestiges of life, he let out a furious roar before instantly fading into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the cultivators within the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land stared with eyes wide in disbelief, no less than Dao Buer himself.</p><p></p><p>"Is that it? He's dead?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had thought this would be an earth-shattering battle that would even affect them. After all, Dao Buer had directly absorbed all the spiritual energy within the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land.</p><p></p><p>This had left them in a weakened state. </p><p></p><p>They had expected a cataclysmic battle that would tear the heavens and earth asunder. </p><p></p><p>Yet, it had ended in a mere instant kill!</p><p></p><p>And the one slain was the Saint Light Clan's esteemed figure.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators then turned their gaze towards Liu Xi, their expressions tinged with regret.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, Fellow Daoist Liu Xi, if you had served that esteemed figure in the past, your future prospects would have been boundless."</p><p></p><p>"Could this terrifying power be that of the legendary Great Dao Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>Since they had chosen to enter the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land, they had naturally conducted thorough investigations on the Saint Light Clan. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not have dared to venture in.</p><p></p><p>That this figure could slay the Saint Light Clan's Solar Deity was simply... horrifying!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Xi's expression remained calm as he serenely replied, "There are countless choices in this world, who dares to claim that every choice they make is the right one? At least I'm still alive, and that's a gain."</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi remained carefree and readily accepted the situation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, high in the heavens, Qi Yuan looked at the tattered robe of the departed soul, his gaze fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>He was actually somewhat curious about what scheme Dao Buer had been planning with that tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, why don't you come to my place and stop wandering outside, I'll give you a... home!" Qi Yuan called out to the tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>This tattered robe seemed to be no ordinary thing.</p><p></p><p>He was not interested in what Dao Buer had been plotting, but he was very interested in the essence of this tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>If he could incorporate it into his Imperial Scepter Banner, it would undoubtedly propel the refinement of his Imperial Scepter Banner to new heights.</p><p></p><p>The tattered robe, aimlessly drifting in the void, once again paused.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up as he quickly said, "Don't worry, I won't charge you any rent, and I'll provide you with food and lodging!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gritted his teeth, unwilling to let this opportunity slip away.</p><p></p><p>The tattered robe had no physical form, but Qi Yuan felt as if a pair of eyes were staring at him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tattered robe make no other move, Qi Yuan gritted his teeth again, "I'll even provide you with social insurance and a double pension!"</p><p></p><p>This time, he was really going all out.</p><p></p><p>After all, facing this tattered robe, Qi Yuan even sensed a hint of threat.</p><p></p><p>The tattered robe looked at Qi Yuan, and a sense of desolate grandeur suddenly permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to hear a mournful voice from the depths of the underworld, the ancient past.</p><p></p><p>"Without forging the light, there is no seeing the light."</p><p></p><p>As the vast voice faded, the tattered robe's figure had disappeared from Qi Yuan's sight.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red hue in the sky also vanished at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The tattered robe's figure had disappeared, and Qi Yuan did not know where it had gone.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was puzzled, for in his hand, a small, pearl-like round granule had appeared.</p><p></p><p>On this shimmering little pearl, there was a single drop of blood stain.</p><p></p><p>[The embryo of light, stained with ominous blood.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Ancient Mirror of the Heavenly Profound appeared in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he had observed it with his eyes, it also seemed to be stained with ominous blood.</p><p></p><p>"This ominous blood... what kind of blood is it?"</p><p></p><p>"And... why did this tattered robe suddenly give me the embryo of light? Could it be that my offer of social insurance and double pension really moved him... but why didn't he come with me, could it be... he doesn't need the lodging?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered for a long time but could not figure it out.</p><p></p><p>He shouted into the void, "Hey, old man, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>Alas, there was no response from the void.</p><p></p><p>"'Without forging the light, there is no seeing the light,' what could this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan contemplated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the embryo of light in his hand suddenly burrowed into the depths of Qi Yuan's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "It's burrowing into my divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>He shook it out, his face filled with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"This thing can even burrow into the divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, most treasures are simply stored in a spatial pouch or placed in the dantian or underworld, rarely entering the divine soul directly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this is a powerful treasure, but... I don't know what its use is yet?"</p><p></p><p>For the time being, Qi Yuan could not discern the purpose of the embryo of light.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the trip to the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land... is temporarily over, I should head back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>In the Ghost Pass, there were still a bunch of moonlight beauties who didn't like to bathe waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but my right eyebrow has been twitching lately... could it be that I'm about to encounter danger?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Ghost Monarch has a method to target me?"</p><p></p><p>"No, with the Ghost Monarch's strength, he's not qualified!"</p><p></p><p>"So the most likely possibility is the Celestial Palace, could it be that my superb acting skills are useless, and the Celestial Palace has... discovered me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan contemplated.</p><p></p><p>Although he had been hiding since coming to the Upper Realm, if one were to carefully investigate, they would surely find some clues.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm not afraid. Even if the Celestial Palace comes after me, I'm in the right!"</p><p></p><p>"Their sun's light shining into my dwelling, infringing on my sacred private property!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a grave crime!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not worried.</p><p></p><p>He had many retreat options.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land was actually a qualified retreat for him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Dao Buer, even that tattered robe would be able to intimidate the Great Dao Sovereigns, preventing them from daring to venture into the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was different, his conscience was clear, so he boldly entered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dilapidated market district.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yun yawned, feeling life was utterly dull.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder how that Celestial Lord is doing?" Tian Yun sighed, thinking of that black-robed figure.</p><p></p><p>Luan Shi sat next to Tian Yun: "Don't think about it too much, how he is has nothing to do with us."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a calm voice suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, may I... come in?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the dwelling, a black-robed figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tian Yun's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Luan Shi also became extremely vigilant, her eyes filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"It's... it's that esteemed senior." Tian Yun stammered.</p><p></p><p>Then, she and Luan Shi exchanged a glance and said, "Esteemed one, please come in!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the black-robed man appeared.</p><p></p><p>This black-robed man was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After delivering the stone tablet, Qi Yuan had left the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land.</p><p></p><p>He did not immediately rush to the Ghost Pass, but instead came to visit Tian Yun.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the stone tablet and the others, Qi Yuan had discovered that Tian Yun and the others shared the same bloodline, with Tian Yun's bloodline being even more potent.</p><p></p><p>And this bloodline seemed to have a deep connection with that tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>In order to unravel the mystery of the embryo of light, Qi Yuan had come to visit Tian Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed senior... have you come from the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land? What business do you have with this humble one?" Tian Yun sat upright, her expression anxious.</p><p></p><p>Luan Shi also stood by the side like a scolded junior.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>How could this person have come from the Heavenly Profound Bizarre Land? </p><p></p><p>According to the timeline, he should have been captured by that Saint Light Clan long ago, so why was he still alive?</p><p></p><p>"On the purest yin ghost night, I encountered a tattered robe, and he seems to have a deep connection with you all." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tian Yun and Luan Shi's breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Luan Shi spoke, her voice desolate: "According to the ancient records of our clan, that tattered robe is... the Human King of our Heavenly Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, the Human King?" Qi Yuan paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>To have the title of Human King, he must have been a great hero of the people, or the sovereign of a realm.</p><p></p><p>No wonder that tattered robe did not want to accept his lodging offer, for he was merely a Human King, and staying in the Imperial Scepter Banner would be overstepping his bounds.</p><p></p><p>"He once spoke a sentence to me that I did not understand, so I've come to ask you about it." Qi Yuan stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"The Human King... spoke?" Luan Shi looked at Qi Yuan with shock, seemingly finding it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>The Human King's remnant soul had existed for countless millennia, yet in all these years, had he ever spoken a single word?</p><p></p><p>"He told me, 'Without forging the light, there is no seeing the light.' What does this mean?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luan Shi's expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>She believed that this mysterious figure had truly made the Human King's remnant soul speak.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head and said in a desolate voice, "In our Heavenly Clan, there is a record that in the ancient past, under the Human King's leadership, our Heavenly Clan... was extremely prosperous and flourishing, even not inferior to the current Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Luan Shi had an expression of great pride.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Clan had once had a brilliant civilization, a world without equal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"One day, darkness descended, and the celestial race was plunged into darkness, unable to see the heavens!" As Luan Aunt mentioned this, there was a deep sense of sorrow in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Human King led the host of gods to the frontlines, resisting the darkness... But alas, the darkness was too strong, and the celestial race ultimately could not withstand it, with the entire race annihilated, except for a small group who fled and came to the Heavenly Expanse Realm."</p><p></p><p>Luan Aunt's voice sounded weary.</p><p></p><p>She had never experienced the past turmoil of darkness, but she had often heard the clan members mention it since childhood.</p><p></p><p>Their ancestors had once been glorious as well.</p><p></p><p>"Initially, the Human King received a prophecy that only by forging a Radiant Treasure could the darkness be broken and the light be seen again!" Luan Aunt said slowly, "But alas, the Radiant Treasure was merely a legend, and despite the clan's collective efforts, they were unable to create the Radiant Treasure, and the celestial race was thus destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and immediately had more associations.</p><p></p><p>If this were true, then the Seed of Light must be the prototype, the semi-finished Radiant Treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Between the Radiant Treasure and the Extraordinary Treasures, which is stronger?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Luan Aunt paused momentarily, then shook her head: "The events are too distant for me to know, but... the legendary Radiant Treasure should surpass ordinary Extraordinary Treasures, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how to forge the Radiant Treasure?" Qi Yuan really wanted to forge the Radiant Treasure using the Seed of Light.</p><p></p><p>However, the forging techniques he had learned in the Heavenly Expanse Realm seemed useless.</p><p></p><p>"I do not know," Luan Aunt shook her head.</p><p></p><p>These things had long been lost.</p><p></p><p>"I see, if you all could have forged it, you wouldn't be in this situation now," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had more or less figured out the purpose of the Seed of Light.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... it is useless to him in his current state.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now, thank you, goodbye." Qi Yuan came quickly and left just as fast, but before leaving, he reminded them, "The Holy Light Sect in the Heavenly Expanse Realm has already been destroyed, and the Holy Light Clan's Dao Master has been slain by me. You can return to the Heavenly Expanse Realm anytime without danger."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure then dissipated and disappeared, leaving the bewildered and astonished Luan Aunt and Tian Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Luan Aunt, is what this senior said true? That was... the Sun God of the Holy Light Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Could he be a Supreme Lord? No, even if he were a Supreme Lord..."</p><p></p><p>"What is his true identity?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord opened his eyes, with a curious expression, and looked towards the distant Taihuang Palace Envoy, unable to help but ask, "There is already a Supreme Lord... preparing to ally with the Taihuang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Taihuang Palace Envoy had inadvertently revealed this fact during his exchange with a few Grand Dao Lords.</p><p></p><p>Using a pig's brain, it was clear that it was not unintentional, but rather intentional.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace was flexing its muscles.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace Envoy smiled, "In addition to one Supreme Lord, there are also a few Pennant Lords of that level who are aligning with us."</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord took a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew that with the start of the Rinkasei, many major powers would be drawn to the Taihuang Palace, this speed was beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>It seems that those major powers in the Six Heavens, no matter how unwilling they were, had long since speculated on the outcome of this Rinkasei.</p><p></p><p>"So you don't need to worry, as long as the Black Abyss battle is successful, this Rinkasei will definitely ensure that you, the Ghost Dominating Heaven, will have no worries!" The Taihuang Palace Envoy boasted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Ghost Sin Celestial Lord's expression became gloomy: "Unfortunately... that Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace has been lurking outside, we cannot... lay a hand on the Ghost Pass!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the Ghost Sin Celestial Lord felt a sense of frustration.</p><p></p><p>They, a group of Sun God Celestial Lords, had actually been forced to cower and unable to emerge, and had to rely on the Pennant Lord's Myriad Ghost Soul Banner to save the day.</p><p></p><p>If this got out, he didn't know how the other fellow Dao Masters would ridicule them.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace Envoy also had a frustrated look in his eyes: "That guy is too slippery, truly arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The last time, the grand scheme against the Black Abyss had been shattered.</p><p></p><p>He naturally hated the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace to the core, especially last time when the latter threatened him on his way out, causing him to not dare stray too far from these two Grand Dao Lords.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knows if the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner of the Pennant Lord is truly flawless.</p><p></p><p>"But you can rest assured, once the Rinkasei begins, we of the Taihuang Palace will confirm his location, and then... it will be his time of death."</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace Envoy said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace had many hidden enemies.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace, there was also a Ten-Day Celestial Lord who had disappeared without a trace, and another... the Taihuang Palace Envoy had only heard some rumors about, seemingly from the lower realm, a certain Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What this Qi Yuan had done, he did not know, only that he was also on the list of those to be killed.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, we are willing to flank the battle!" The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord spoke up.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the one who would attack the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace would naturally be a powerhouse at the Pennant Lord level, or even a Supreme Lord in person.</p><p></p><p>So, their flanking was just to watch the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace die a miserable death.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the more arrogant he is now, the more tragic his death will be." The Taihuang Palace Envoy said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a message suddenly reached his ears, and a look of wild joy appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha..."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord were slightly taken aback: "Senior Envoy, is there some good news?"</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace Envoy saw this and said indifferently, "It's not exactly good news, just about an acceptable one."</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord drew closer, wanting to know what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard the Taihuang Palace Envoy say, "The news just received is that the old Abyss Master of the Black Abyss has finally become impatient and is willing to offer tribute to the Taihuang Palace. He also stated that in this Rinkasei, he will not be an enemy of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>It seems he is also a smart one, he should have learned a lot of information."</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace Envoy said happily.</p><p></p><p>Although this time they did not succeed in killing the Black Sword or slaying the Grand Dao Lords of the Black Abyss, forcing the Abyss Master of the Black Abyss to submit could also be considered a success.</p><p></p><p>"Just let Black Abyss go?" The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord couldn't help but say, somewhat dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this battle against the Black Abyss, the Black Abyss had suffered almost no losses, while they, the Ghost Dominating Heaven, had suffered greatly.</p><p></p><p>If the Black Abyss was allowed to pass through the Rinkasei intact, the Ghost Dominating Heaven would suffer a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Black Abyss dares to be an enemy of yours, how could we of the Taihuang Palace let them off easily?</p><p></p><p>Merely retreating without paying a price, how could the Taihuang Palace agree to that?" The Taihuang Palace Envoy said.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord exchanged a glance and whispered, "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Taihuang Palace Envoy extended two fingers: "At least this number, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>He spoke, his expression arrogant, as if he held the power of life and death over all beings.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Two fingers, representing two Grand Dao Lords.</p><p></p><p>They, as such existences, would one day also be treated as expendable pawns, truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"We only need to sit in the Ghost Pass and wait leisurely for the Rinkasei to begin, that Abyss Master should know what to do." The Taihuang Palace Envoy said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord took a deep breath, feeling even more terrified of the Taihuang Palace's power.</p><p></p><p>To have obtained the permission of the Unique Palace, and become the host of this Rinkasei.</p><p></p><p>Even a powerful force like the Black Abyss, under the might of the Taihuang Palace, had to tuck its tail and fight for survival.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Rinkasei will be an easy affair." The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord smiled, "With the Black Abyss surrendering, apart from the Dao Lords and the Moon God Palace, who else dares to foolishly resist?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and that Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace is just a jumping grasshopper, easily crushed by a casual hand..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! The words had not yet faded when a huge rumbling sound suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Ghost Sin Celestial Lord and the Ghost Origin Celestial Lord immediately tensed, and a terrifying thought suddenly arose.</p><p></p><p>How could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>With the Pennant Lord personally laying the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, how could the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace enter?</p><p></p><p>However, a familiar voice suddenly came next.</p><p></p><p>"So these are the Sun God Celestial Lords at the Dao Lord realm, it takes two sword strikes to kill them!"</p><p></p><p>All the Sun God Celestial Lords looked over, and saw a blood-armored man holding a blood-colored long sword in the void.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a corpse was quietly floating.</p><p></p><p>This corpse was none other than a Dao Lord realm Sun God Celestial Lord! A star in the Stellar Realm also quickly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>This was a Dao Lord realm Sun God Celestial Lord! The number of such Dao Lord realm Sun God Celestial Lords in the Ghost Dominating Heaven was absolutely not many, only about a dozen or so! "Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace, you... how did you get here?"</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord roared angrily, his powerful spiritual energy surging towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Origin Celestial Lord was about to step forward to attack, but was pulled back by the Taihuang Palace Envoy: "Don't go, protect me!"</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace Envoy was terrified.</p><p></p><p>He was the Dao Lord.</p><p></p><p>If the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor's Palace targeted him, it was likely that a single sword strike would kill him.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Origin Celestial Lord saw this and felt helpless and angry, but dared not go against the wishes of the Taihuang Palace Envoy, and remained in place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cold and hoarse voice came from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"If you hand over my Human Emperor Banner, this lord will give you a dignified end, otherwise... don't blame me for coming to hunt you down every day!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not engage in a battle with the Ghost Sin Celestial Lord, but instead flew away, easily slaying a distant Sun God Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Sun God Celestial Lord's Myriad Soul Banner was also taken into his possession.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Ghost Sin Celestial Lord was furious, letting out a roar: "How did you get in! Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, suppress him!"</p><p></p><p>With his shout, the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner spanning the entire Ghost Pass stirred.</p><p></p><p>An unfathomably vast power immediately pressed down on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Feeling this power, a greedy look appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because, he only needed to lightly grab it, and he could take away the illusory Myriad Ghost Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>But he had to restrain himself.</p><p></p><p>Because he didn't like to stir up small troubles, he wanted to stir up a big one! So, faced with the suppression of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, Qi Yuan's face showed a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, is all you can do use the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner to suppress me? Unfortunately, this level of Myriad Ghost Soul Banner is not enough to suppress me!"</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, gentlemen!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clapped his hands, and instantly disappeared from the sight of the many Sun God Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens above, the aura emanating from the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner was ominous and terrifying, enough to make even the Grand Dao Lords uneasy.</p><p></p><p>But alas, it could not keep Qi Yuan here.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial Lord's face was as gloomy as could be: "How... how did he get in!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's spirits lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I have some guesses about my bloodline!" </p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman looked at Qi Yuan with some surprise: "What guesses?"</p><p></p><p>In their previous conversation, she had already revealed that Qi Yuan's body contained the bloodline of the Black Demon Abyss, and it was not weak.</p><p></p><p>"I think... I might be a long-lost ancestor of the Black Demon Abyss!" Qi Yuan said in a lowered voice.</p><p></p><p>Purple-robed woman: "..."</p><p></p><p>She was silent for a long time, before finally looking at Qi Yuan seriously: "I finally understand why you offended the Tai Huang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>What a foul mouth, it's a wonder he's lived this long.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Jiang Lingsu couldn't help but cover her mouth and laugh when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>Now someone finally shared her feelings.</p><p></p><p>Back then, at the Divine Light Sect, she had already recognized how formidable her senior brother's mouth was. </p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't speak, he was a peerless handsome man, but once he opened his mouth, it was over.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I offended the Tai Huang Palace, it's that they provoked me!</p><p></p><p>I've always kept a low profile and never actively cause trouble!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman smiled, then said: "Hold out your hand, let sister feel it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand suddenly retracted: "You're openly sexually harassing me?"</p><p></p><p>"To check your bloodline and record it. The ancestor might be able to tell something." The purple-robed woman said nonchalantly. </p><p></p><p>As she approached Qi Yuan, the markings on her arm flickered.</p><p></p><p>Different flickers represented different bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The closer she got, the clearer it became.</p><p></p><p>She would record the flickering and show it to the ancestor. The ancestor might be able to tell what bloodline it was.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman explained her thoughts to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, and asked reflexively: "Does this kind of flickering consume your energy?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman paused slightly: "No."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes widened: "Isn't this a perpetual motion machine then?! Haha, I've discovered perpetual motion, I'm going to be rich!"</p><p></p><p>When the two got close, it would light up without consuming energy - if this wasn't perpetual motion, what was?</p><p></p><p>"..." The purple-robed woman fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Then Qi Yuan looked at the purple-robed woman: "Do you want to cut off your hand and sell it to me? This is absolutely the greatest discovery in the immortal realm in hundreds of thousands of years!"</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about inventing perpetual motion made Qi Yuan very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" The purple-robed woman cursed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... Although inventing perpetual motion would be an eternal achievement, I'm not the type to morally blackmail others, so I won't sacrifice you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no right to make decisions for others.</p><p></p><p>He only killed people.</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking about it, he still stretched out his arm.</p><p></p><p>In case it detected that he really was a long-lost ancestor of the Black Demon Abyss, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Demon Abyss was a major power in the Sixth Heaven, with strong strength.</p><p></p><p>If even the Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable of the Black Demon Abyss was his grandson, the one from Tai Huang Palace who wanted to make a move against him would have to be wary.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman ignored Qi Yuan's frivolous words and placed her hand on Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the black markings flickered, eerily beautiful.</p><p></p><p>She quickly recorded this flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Recorded it?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman looked at Qi Yuan and said in a crude voice: "Got aroused."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan: "...How vulgar!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha!" The purple-robed woman laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>She had always been straightforward.</p><p></p><p>"Sister's leaving. Oh right, sister knows you don't want to be her concubine, so she left a little gift for you at the Black Demon Abyss stronghold. Remember to pick it up.</p><p></p><p>Sister's going up first. Sister will wait for you in the Sixth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the purple-robed woman's figure disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very speechless: "People from the Sixth Heaven... their quality isn't very high either!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu also said through gritted teeth: "This person is too... vulgar!"</p><p></p><p>The scene she had imagined, where her stunning beauty would attract second-generation rich kids to chat her up, did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was someone teasing her senior brother.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat in the Miluo Realm, occasionally going fishing, occasionally studying techniques, perfecting the Golden Core chapter of the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>As for the Yin Spirit path, Qi Yuan had not yet started to improve it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he needed to discuss the Dao with others and understand the essence of the Yin Spirit before he could start creating his own technique.</p><p></p><p>During these days, Qi Yuan's fishing results were quite fruitful.</p><p></p><p>Well, including the Mochi Heavenly Venerable, a total of four fish.</p><p></p><p>These four fish were all carefully selected by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If they disappeared for a short time, no one would notice.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan was very considerate - he left inflatable dolls pretending to be them in their caves.</p><p></p><p>No one would discover it in the short term.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a small episode in this - Qi Yuan ate the fish near his nest.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other fish were too difficult to catch. In the end, he really didn't want to come back empty-handed, so he caught the Yang Spirit from the Demon Luo Sacred Tower where he was staying.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if these things were revealed, the entire Demon Luo clan would be shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Stay for ten more days, then pack up and head to the upper realm!" Qi Yuan's eyes were filled with anticipation and joy.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would go to the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's birthday was coming soon.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought randomly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, at the entrance of the Miluo Realm, a white figure was frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu's eyes revealed a look of despair.</p><p></p><p>She had been lurking in the Fifth Heaven for ten thousand years, but unexpectedly was exposed by a spy. Now, the Yin Spirits of the Demon Luo clan were chasing and trying to kill her.</p><p></p><p>There was no chance of survival in the Demon Luo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>So she frantically fled into the Miluo Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Yin Spirits behind her were in hot pursuit, and she was seriously injured without much immortal energy left.</p><p></p><p>She would probably be caught before long.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of her mission, Hong Yu was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>The auras she had collected over fifty thousand years of undercover work had not yet been transmitted back to the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>If she died here, her years of effort would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Her white clothes stained with blood, she fled quickly, fully opening her divine realm, reaching an extreme speed.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you running, demoness!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you come make trouble in our Demon Luo clan, you're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>This chase attracted the attention of many cultivators gathering Miluo light in the Miluo Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing that it was the Demon Luo clan capturing a cultivator, they all avoided it to prevent getting into trouble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a voice transmission fell into Hong Yu's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the southwest, towards the red Flame Mountain there."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Hong Yu was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Was this... someone reaching out to help her? Or... a trap? But now, she had no way out alive. If she didn't trust it, she could only die.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, she went directly towards the Flame Mountain in the southwest.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, where are you running!"</p><p></p><p>Five Yin Spirits chased after her frantically.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu gritted her teeth and plunged directly into the red Flame Mountain.</p><p></p><p>That familiar voice fell into her ears again.</p><p></p><p>"Keep going forward, come to my side, remember to conceal your aura."</p><p></p><p>The owner of the voice also left a mark, seemingly to guide her.</p><p></p><p>"Sen... Senior?"</p><p></p><p>She was a bit dazed. Wouldn't this bring trouble to the senior? But then suddenly, a violent</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tremors began.</p><p></p><p>Behind her, the Flame Mountain suddenly erupted. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, the world became scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan chasing her from behind was quickly engulfed by the flames.</p><p></p><p>This Flame Mountain was the Flame Mountain of the Miluo Realm. The power of its volcanic eruption was not just ordinary fire - even Yin spirits could not take it lightly.</p><p></p><p>The Yin spirits pursuing Hong Yu were also stunned by this explosion.</p><p></p><p>By the time they emerged from the Flame Mountain, Hong Yu's figure was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is she? She actually escaped!"</p><p></p><p>"Chase after her! She's injured now, she can't run far!"</p><p></p><p>These Yin spirits dispersed in all directions as streaks of light, searching for Hong Yu.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed. Inside the tent, Hong Yu had a puzzled look as she gazed at the Black Magic Abyss cultivator in front of her. She lowered her voice and said, "Thank you for your help, senior!"</p><p></p><p>In truth, Hong Yu's heart was full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss was vast, but part of it was also hostile to the Moon God Palace, even engaging in war.</p><p></p><p>Yet a cultivator from the Black Magic Abyss had saved her.</p><p></p><p>"You're from the Moon God Palace?" </p><p></p><p>The man who saved Hong Yu was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had detected the aura of the Moon God Palace on Hong Yu.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained part of the Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable's memories, he was most familiar with the aura of the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Hong Yu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence, I have a wife who's also from the Moon God Palace. Do you know her?" Qi Yuan asked enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hong Yu somewhat understood why he had saved her.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask which senior from the palace she is?"</p><p></p><p>"Her name is Jin Li. She's a Moon Maiden of the Moon God Palace," Qi Yuan said without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu swallowed and blinked her eyes: "It's actually a Moon Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>She was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Moon Maidens held a special status in the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Moon Maidens were groomed to be future palace masters of the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Moon Maidens almost enjoyed the treatment of Yang spirits.</p><p></p><p>With high treatment naturally came high responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Moon Maidens were not allowed to marry, nor could they have husbands.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan's words made her doubt their truthfulness.</p><p></p><p>If the upper echelons of the Moon God Palace learned that a Moon Maiden had married, the Moon Maiden's fate would be very tragic.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen her? Is she happy in the Moon God Palace? How is she doing?" Qi Yuan asked three questions in succession.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu shook her head: "This junior has been undercover in the Fifth Heaven for tens of thousands of years and has never seen her."</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of the Moon Maiden having a husband, she had to keep it to herself. Otherwise, if the higher-ups of the Moon God Palace found out, that Jin Li Moon Maiden would meet a very tragic end.</p><p></p><p>"I have another wife in the Moon God Palace. Her name is Ruan Yixi. Do you know her?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu: "..."</p><p></p><p>She was having trouble keeping her composure.</p><p></p><p>So you're treating the Moon God Palace as your harem?</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of her!" Hong Yu said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was very disappointed: "It seems I'll have to go find my wives myself."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hong Yu spoke up: "Senior, now that my injuries have improved somewhat, this junior will take her leave and not stay with you, to avoid bringing you trouble."</p><p></p><p>Her injuries were still very serious, but if she stayed here and the Moluo clan came to search and found her, it would implicate Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. I'm now a member of the Black Magic Abyss, I'm not afraid of the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>You're a colleague of my two wives, just stay here at ease. There's no problem at all!" Qi Yuan said boldly.</p><p></p><p>Having someone from the Moon God Palace was a good thing. When he reached the Sixth Heaven, he could also go find Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, without someone to guide him, if he rashly entered... he might not be able to get in.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Hong Yu hesitated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voices of Moluo clan cultivators came from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed one, our Moluo clan is currently pursuing a fugitive. May we request that you come out and allow us to search your dwelling?"</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan cultivators outside the tent were very polite.</p><p></p><p>After all, a cultivator from the Black Magic Abyss resided here.</p><p></p><p>If it were cultivators from other holy lands, they would have already charged in.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu was a bit nervous, her body tense, ready to take action at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, you filthy swine! Don't enter this Daoist's dwelling!"</p><p></p><p>"What, you think this Daoist would harbor a criminal?!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite the actor.</p><p></p><p>He directly played the role of an arrogant, self-important Black Magic Abyss cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And the Moluo clan cultivators ate it up.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after Qi Yuan's shout to get lost, the Moluo clan cultivators outside became even more hunched, their faces showing fawning smiles.</p><p></p><p>"We've disturbed you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>"It was our mistake!"</p><p></p><p>These Moluo clan cultivators took a deep look at Qi Yuan's tent before leaving one after another.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Moluo clan cultivators leaving, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh: "This Black Magic Abyss identity is really useful."</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't know much about why the Moluo clan feared the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Although he had searched the souls of Yang spirits like the Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But searching the soul of a Yang spirit was different from searching ordinary cultivators' souls. Qi Yuan had only obtained part of the memories.</p><p></p><p>Unless he went to the Star Realm and swallowed the Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable's star.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why the Moluo clan fears the Black Magic Abyss?" Qi Yuan casually asked Hong Yu.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten days, he would ascend as the Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer fish for information.</p><p></p><p>He might as well chat and learn more about the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hong Yu hesitated for a moment before saying softly: "This is related to the Moluo clan's treasure of creation."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Qi Yuan's spirits were roused.</p><p></p><p>Although the Gate of Ultimate Principles was the number one treasure of creation in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it couldn't increase his combat power at all, and using it was very time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>"The Moluo clan's treasure of creation is called the Moluo Well!" </p><p></p><p>"What, a well?!" Qi Yuan's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu was a bit dazed, not knowing what was wrong with a well.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter, senior?"</p><p></p><p>Then she heard Qi Yuan say: "The well at my home seems to have been stolen too, carried away by someone. The Moluo Well couldn't be my family's well, could it?!"</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Myriad Differences had been stolen by someone walking out with the door, but it had been found.</p><p></p><p>The well had been carried away from home, and there was still no trace of it.</p><p></p><p>He found that Moluo clan's Moluo Well very familiar, somewhat resembling his family's well.</p><p></p><p>"...Senior is quite humorous." Hong Yu smiled, though she was actually a bit speechless inside.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was absent-minded, his head full of thoughts about his family's well.</p><p></p><p>However, he still maintained his rationality: "Continue speaking, I'm listening."</p><p></p><p>Hong Yu said: "The Sixth Heaven is currently the highest heaven in the immortal realm, and also the most suitable place for Yang spirit Heavenly Venerables to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Sixth Heaven has many great holy lands.</p><p></p><p>Yang spirit Heavenly Venerables from the five lower heavens, if they don't have a holy land, will mostly enter the Sixth Heaven and choose to join a holy land.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Magic Abyss in the Sixth Heaven is a most special holy land. It does not recruit any Yang spirits without 'Black Magic Abyss' bloodline!"</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Heaven of the immortal realm had a pyramid structure.</p><p></p><p>The Yang spirits below all wanted to enter the Sixth Heaven to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Heaven was a treasure trove for Yang spirit Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that for Yang spirit Heavenly Venerables, the cultivation speed in the Sixth Heaven was several times that of the lower heavens.</p><p></p><p>This gap could not be made up by differences in time flow.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, many Yang spirits flocked to the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>But... the Sixth Heaven... did not welcome other Yang spirits.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he kills, it will be a wrongful killing, and the Buddha's heart will be tarnished.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't kill, he will forget his original intention, and the Buddha's heart will be incomplete. </p><p></p><p>Either way, Shang Yanran will achieve her goal and take advantage to seize the Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought through all this and was speechless inside.</p><p></p><p>This Destiny Stone, always toying with fate, was too timid.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he wouldn't care about the consequences and would directly swallow the Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Not even daring to swallow the Great Sun Golden Lotus, how could it call itself the Destiny Stone? However, at this moment, Qi Yuan was also caught in a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>If he let Baize remember that he was the Great Demon, the Flowing Wind Realm would be completely finished.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't expose that Shang Yanran was a demon woman and the spirit of the Destiny Stone, Shang Yanran's goal would be achieved.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shang Yanran looked at Baize, her eyes full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"Join forces with me, kill the Great Demon, and the world will be at peace; if you don't kill..."</p><p></p><p>In Baize's clear eyes, turbidity appeared.</p><p></p><p>That was the mark left on his Buddha heart by the Destiny Stone ten thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, looked at the hundred thousand supreme beings, and revealed a pained expression in his eyes: "I..."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>On one side was his master, on the other side were all living beings in the world.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Baize and said loudly: "Baize, I'll teach you one last time.</p><p></p><p>All the troubles in the world come from not forgetting.</p><p></p><p>Forget everything, and there will be no troubles."</p><p></p><p>Baize's Buddha heart wavered again.</p><p></p><p>One last time? Could it be that his master was going to sacrifice himself for all living beings like last time?</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was stunned, then overjoyed in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's eyes narrowed, she stared blankly at Qi Yuan without speaking.</p><p></p><p>But her eyes said it all.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme beings looked at Qi Yuan like this, which made Qi Yuan feel somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Did everyone think he would sacrifice himself to save the world?</p><p></p><p>When did his character become so noble?</p><p></p><p>But then, he turned to Shang Yanran: "I will also teach you one last time.</p><p></p><p>Toying with people's hearts and fate has no future. Only by mastering power can you win people's hearts and control fate."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, hearing this, Shang Yanran's pupils contracted, and fear suddenly arose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Did the Blood Lord... know something?</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly know?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said loudly: "Shang Yanran, don't you know who the real demon woman is?"</p><p></p><p>For the first time, panic appeared on Shang Yanran's face, and she said anxiously: "You can't say it!"</p><p></p><p>If it was said, the Buddha would remember everything.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus would burn everything to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm would be finished, and so would she!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored her words.</p><p></p><p>People's hearts? Schemes? Fate?</p><p></p><p>Without power, one could only toy with these disgusting things!</p><p></p><p>What bullshit, just a clown, he would directly flip the table!</p><p></p><p>Such a big boss, really had no class!</p><p></p><p>"Shang Yanran, you are the demon woman, you are the spirit of the Destiny Stone!"</p><p></p><p>"Baize, you are the Buddha, you were once the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Everything that happened in the Mirror of Ten Thousand Demons was your entire life!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan announced the facts without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>His voice echoed in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, and everyone was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was terrified: "No, we'll die, we'll die, I want to leave here, leave here!"</p><p></p><p>She was really panicking!</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Wind Realm was finished!</p><p></p><p>Even the Demon Realm connected by the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons would be destroyed because of this.</p><p></p><p>She, who had always toyed with fate and people's hearts, was now exposed, like a real clown, without any demeanor of a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Baize's eyes, endless emotions were spreading.</p><p></p><p>Countless memories poured in like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>On the Heartless Lotus, a terrifyingly extreme aura was spreading.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran wanted to flee, but was blocked by Qi Yuan's sword: "Where are you going? Hurry back to Gotham City, Batman is waiting to beat you up!"</p><p></p><p>"Madman, you're a madman, a complete madman!" Shang Yanran was exasperated.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to escape, but couldn't leave at all.</p><p></p><p>On Baize's body, a chaotic aura was constantly spreading.</p><p></p><p>On the Heartless Lotus, various terrifying emotions were accumulating.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran looked at the Heartless Lotus, finally revealing despair in her eyes: "It's over, it's all over, we're all going to die, the Flowing Wind Realm is really finished!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was raving madly, her previous confidence completely gone.</p><p></p><p>On the scene, the hundred thousand supreme beings all looked at Baize, and fear and dread appeared in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They had a premonition that something terrible was about to happen!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Blood Lord, you are the real sinner, you made Baize remember his past, the Great Sun Golden Lotus is the sarira of the Great Sun Light Buddha, once tarnished, it will burn everything in the world! Hahaha the Gate of Ten Thousand Distinctions is closed, no one can leave, hahaha everyone will die!" Shang Yanran glared fiercely at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was all him, all him.</p><p></p><p>The sinner of the world.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Baize opened his eyes, and his eyes were blood red.</p><p></p><p>Everyone who saw Baize felt intense fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Baize's eyes fell on Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, there was sorrow, helplessness, but more chaos.</p><p></p><p>He remembered all his past.</p><p></p><p>He would be unable to control himself and become the true Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>The tarnished Great Sun Golden Lotus also began to burn everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." A trace of clarity appeared in Baize's eyes, and he sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether he hated Qi Yuan for exposing all this, or was thinking of something else.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, in another hundred breaths, this world will be completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Sun Golden Lotus starts burning, it cannot be stopped." Shang Yanran was completely insane at this point, "Blood Lord haha, in this battle, there are no winners, all are losers!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts were heavy and fearful.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, Qi Yuan seemed excessively calm.</p><p></p><p>"Who says there are no winners?"</p><p></p><p>"In this game, if I kill you, I pass the level!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he looked at Baize who was turning demonic: "Baize, do you remember what I just taught you?</p><p></p><p>Only by forgetting can there be no troubles in the world."</p><p></p><p>In Baize's chaotic eyes, a trace of clarity remained: "Master, this disciple is useless, I simply cannot forget.</p><p></p><p>I cannot forget those I slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>I cannot forget those who died from their heart demons breaking out.</p><p></p><p>This disciple is a sinner, this disciple is the Great Demon!"</p><p></p><p>"If you can't forget, I'll help you forget!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't forget, why not beat Baize into senile dementia, wouldn't that make him forget?</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist, I'll help you forget!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra was deployed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's face bore a cold smile: "Forgetting is just self-deception!"</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Baize completely followed Qi Yuan's instructions and did not resist.</p><p></p><p>When the essence of the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra fell on his body.</p><p></p><p>Another trace of clarity appeared in Baize's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he seemed to have some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The bodhi tree has no trunk, where can dust alight.</p><p></p><p>Why his master had a second essence divine ability, and why it was still this kind of ability, he did not think about it, nor did he give himself additional troubles.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes full of Buddha nature: "Master, before forgetting everything, I will end her."</p><p></p><p>His grudges with the demon woman and the Destiny Stone would also truly end.</p><p></p><p>Baize made his move, at this moment, the power he displayed far surpassed that of a great supreme being.</p><p></p><p>A crazed expression appeared on Shang Yanran's face: "Why, what exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand why the burning of the Great Sun Golden Lotus had slowed a bit.</p><p></p><p>What exactly had the Blood Lord done to Baize?</p><p></p><p>"All evil spirits in the world, all inauspiciousness, will be forgotten."</p><p></p><p>Baize's palm fell on Shang Yanran.</p><p></p><p>That palm strike surpassed great supreme beings, surpassed everything.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan was moved when he saw it.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't withstand that palm strike.</p><p></p><p>With one palm, evil spirits were destroyed, and the Destiny Stone finally shattered.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's final expression was insane: "Once the Great Sun Golden Lotus starts burning, it cannot be stopped, everyone will die!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, she perished here.</p><p></p><p>A helpless expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This time passing the level, the supreme beings killed a hundred thousand supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>The big boss was killed by Baize, was he here to be a bystander? But this feeling of slacking off felt really good.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran, like the demon woman from tens of thousands of years ago, once again perished at the hands of the great Buddha.</p><p></p><p>[No Return City dungeon cleared, rewards obtained.]</p><p></p><p>The game's prompt sounded.</p><p></p><p>[Reward 1: Obtained 99 key fragments.]</p><p></p><p>[Reward 2: Can name the key once.]</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran's demise meant the North-South battle was completely over.</p><p></p><p>The task of guarding No Return City was also finally completed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also received the long-awaited task rewards.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, he didn't have time to focus on the rewards, but looked at Baize instead.</p><p></p><p>If Baize continued to turn demonic, the Great Sun Golden Lotus would burn this realm to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone would die.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Shang Yanran, in Baize's eyes, madness and clarity coexisted.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the hundred thousand supreme beings behind Qi Yuan, then at the continuously burning Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Deep emotions flowed in his eyes as Baize said: "Master, even if I forget everything.</p><p></p><p>But what happened in the past still occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus will still burn eventually.</p><p></p><p>This realm... will still be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was right.</p><p></p><p>Unable to leave this realm, even if entering the realm of ten thousand demons.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus would still burn both realms to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even without the Great Sun Golden Lotus, as long as the demonic evil remained within those hundred thousand supreme beings, the Flowing Wind Realm would eventually be completely destroyed one day.</p><p></p><p>"That's because you haven't forgotten thoroughly enough," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>If his innate divine ability reached the level of engraving, he could make Baize forget even more.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Baize's true form was simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even if he opened his mind and allowed Qi Yuan to use the Great Forgetting Sutra, he still couldn't truly forget completely.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, deep down, Baize was still unwilling to forget.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus was continuously burning, and all the supreme beings present revealed fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>They sensed an intense threat.</p><p></p><p>This Great Sun Golden Lotus would burn the sky and everything to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Baize glanced at the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, his long narrow eyes full of helplessness: "Even if I forget, I can only maintain the Great Sun Golden Lotus for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years... this realm will still be burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Unless this humble monk comprehends true forgetting.</p><p></p><p>Even the Fate Stone Tablet could plunge this humble monk into oblivion, how could this humble monk possibly comprehend true great forgetting?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, Qi Yuan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>The game was about to be cleared, and he was also about to leave this world.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus would burn this world to ashes, but it couldn't reach the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Baize: "How about giving me the Great Sun Golden Lotus?"</p><p></p><p>A look of astonishment flashed in Baize's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Qi Yuan say: "I want to condense a golden pill, and the Great Sun Golden Lotus looks quite good."</p><p></p><p>Baize's eyes were even more confused.</p><p></p><p>Now, whoever took the Great Sun Golden Lotus would die first.</p><p></p><p>"If Master wants it, then take it," Baize replied. He didn't know what his master wanted to do, but whatever his master wanted to do now, he wouldn't stop him.</p><p></p><p>The relic left by the Great Sun Bright Buddha had become the culprit for destroying the world.</p><p></p><p>Even if he forgot the reality that he was a great demon, Baize still felt extremely guilty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Great Sun Golden Lotus, a fierce look flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Time was running out, he was about to clear the game and leave this realm.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep look at the Canary in her black long dress.</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat different from before, even more cold and alluring.</p><p></p><p>The Canary's eyes were always fixed on the figure in the blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his eyes, she understood his meaning.</p><p></p><p>She smiled, instantly full of charm: "Blood Pearl, no matter when, I'm always willing to accompany you, always willing to... wait for you."</p><p></p><p>Just like at Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, the black veil on her face fell away, and her flawlessly white left cheek finally came into Qi Yuan's view.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the "demon" character on it, looked at Ning Tao's incomparably beautiful face, and remembering what he had said before, he said: "The Canary has always been the most beautiful in the Eighteen Mountains."</p><p></p><p>She was never ugly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Canary finally couldn't hold back, just like at the ends of the earth before. She pounced on Qi Yuan, her legs tightly wrapped around Qi Yuan's waist, her petite and delicate body hanging on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Canary, his eyes smiling.</p><p></p><p>This damn game really wanted to send an electronic wife!</p><p></p><p>He looked towards that Great Sun Golden Lotus and suddenly opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The continuously burning Great Sun Golden Lotus now entered Qi Yuan's stomach.</p><p></p><p>Scorching hot, burning, incinerating everything...</p><p></p><p>Yet there was no fear on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>An endless terrifying aura seemed about to tear Qi Yuan apart.</p><p></p><p>Now, he felt incredibly powerful, yet also felt like he might explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The Canary hugged Qi Yuan, quiet as a little bird, saying nothing.</p><p></p><p>Being gazed at by countless people, she felt no shyness in her heart, but rather cherished this moment immensely.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the blood-red long sword and suddenly looked back at the hundred thousand supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"The world's heart demons are all illusory."</p><p></p><p>"Forget the heart demons, and they cease to exist!"</p><p></p><p>Empowered by the Great Sun Golden Lotus, Qi Yuan's voice spread throughout the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and the entire Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"All demonic evils in the world, obey my decree, forge this sword together!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Canary with his left hand and raised the blood-red long sword towards the sky with his right.</p><p></p><p>This sword was forged from all the sources of evil in the world.</p><p></p><p>This sword was also the artifact formed by Qi Yuan stripping away his life as a great demon.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in a sense, this sword was the source of all evil in this realm.</p><p></p><p>This sword was also engraved with the heart demon inducement of the Void Realm Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's action was to engrave all the heart demons of this realm onto this sword!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Baize smiled calmly: "I'll lend Master a hand!"</p><p></p><p>Countless Buddhist lights spread over the blood-red long sword.</p><p></p><p>A huge blood-red long sword appeared in the sky above the entire Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Pride, greed, sloth...</p><p></p><p>Endless emotions spread over the blood-red sword.</p><p></p><p>Vast Buddhist chants also echoed throughout the Flowing Wind Realm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In No Return City, Yuan Qi looked up at the giant sword in the sky, a smile appearing on his face, yet looking extremely desolate: "Guardian..."</p><p></p><p>In the hundred and eight thousand cities, all cultivators now looked up at the sky, their eyes filled with confusion, or release.</p><p></p><p>In streets and alleys, countless people looked at the blood-red sword, at a loss, and prostrated themselves.</p><p></p><p>Countless heart demons flew towards the sky at this moment, merging into that blood-red long sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body grew hotter and hotter, white mist constantly evaporating.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red long sword, having absorbed endless heart demons, appeared even more demonic, like an unparalleled fierce sword, a demon sword! One swing would be enough to move the world.</p><p></p><p>A look of relief appeared on Baize's face as he looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>If this matter was settled, he would not return to the Buddha's realm, but remain in this realm for all lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not know how his master would ultimately deal with that Great Sun Golden Lotus.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan endured the burning pain in his body and glanced at the Canary, his eyes showing some reluctance: "I have to go..."</p><p></p><p>The Canary hugged him tightly, and after several breaths finally said unconsciously: "This young miss... is asleep."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Canary's closed eyes, her long eyelashes trembling slightly, as if she had really fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, he finally said: "This time, I won't seek you at the end of time."</p><p></p><p>There was another sentence Qi Yuan didn't say.</p><p></p><p>But... you might have poor memory and sometimes forget me.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly sleeping Canary smiled, a shallow dimple appearing under the "demon" character.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Canary and glanced at everyone, including the Northern Demon Thirteen Fiends who had entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to awaken him.</p><p></p><p>Everyone also looked at that figure like a blood sun, their eyes filled with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi forced a smile: "If there is reincarnation, Master, remember my name Ling Yayi."</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the Blood Lord was going to do.</p><p></p><p>But he knew the ending would definitely be parting.</p><p></p><p>He Wu's gaze was desolate, silent.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme was even more exaggerated, a supreme being actually with tears in his eyes: "Blood Lord... wuwuwu..."</p><p></p><p>A key appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>This was the key rewarded for guarding No Return City.</p><p></p><p>[Please name the key.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, a trace of determination flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Key of Ten Thousand Differences!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, he named this key the Key of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, smiling: "Now, you are the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences!"</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Differences that everyone saw could be different.</p><p></p><p>It could be the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, or the Gate of Ten Thousand Fiends.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a door appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>On the door were various strange symbols, among which was a symbol that anyone who looked at it once would not remember there was such a symbol.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Canary, carrying the long sword, and flew towards that door.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Differences!</p><p></p><p>He inserted the key in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Click.</p><p></p><p>A large door opened.</p><p></p><p>Vast, desolate, profound, dark aura swept out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't see anything. He held the Canary and plunged into that darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Differences closed instantly.</p><p></p><p>The hundred thousand supreme beings, like a hundred thousand soldiers in a city respectfully sending off the dragon king, shouted in unison: "Respectfully sending off the Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't hear these voices, as he had already left the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on tight!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted, holding the Canary with one hand and the long sword with the other.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if he had fallen into an endless deep sea.</p><p></p><p>His body and his soul were suffering endless rejection.</p><p></p><p>As if something was squeezing him.</p><p></p><p>"I build my foundation with the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>He held the long sword and shouted.</p><p></p><p>The chaos ahead finally split open, and what entered Qi Yuan's eyes was endless, vast starry skies.</p><p></p><p>There were many stars, boundless, very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>A sky full of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>He looked over.</p><p></p><p>[This is a star, it doesn't have a name yet.]</p><p></p><p>This was a real star, not a projection! Qi Yuan was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"This... isn't the 'universe' where the Azure Waves Realm is located?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus was extremely hot, as if it would burn everything to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Yet Qi Yuan's heart was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, extorting the Heavenly Dao is still somewhat useful!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

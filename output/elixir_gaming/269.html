        <h1>Chapter 269</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The offspring of a Yang God? How useless?"</p><p></p><p>The father of the man with his back turned was indeed a Yang God. </p><p></p><p>And the man with his back turned was a second-generation rich kid, living a life of debauchery.</p><p></p><p>Being a second-generation rich kid was one thing, but he was also extremely lecherous.</p><p></p><p>In the sacred land where his father resided, many women and even men fell victim to his misdeeds.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his father's protection, this second-generation rich kid grew bolder and bolder.</p><p></p><p>Somehow he learned that the Moon Goddess was the most beautiful woman in the Middle Three Heavens, so he spoke of her with vulgar words.</p><p></p><p>This news somehow reached the ears of the Moon Goddess.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess, from several heavens away, directly took action and annihilated him.</p><p></p><p>His father spent an enormous price and used the Yang God's artifact, the Ancient Mirror of Kun, to save a strand of his remnant soul and nurture it.</p><p></p><p>However, his father also feared the Moon Goddess finding out about this, so he threw the Ancient Mirror of Kun into the lower realm. By coincidence, it ended up in the Azure Waves Realm after a roundabout journey.</p><p></p><p>"The upper realm is so complicated?"</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the memories of the man with his back turned, Qi Yuan gained quite a bit of understanding about the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The upper realm was not a single world, but a collective term for countless worlds.</p><p></p><p>Sacred lands presided over by Yang Gods ruled over several, or even up to thousands of worlds.</p><p></p><p>Some worlds in the upper realm were not even as powerful as the Azure Waves Realm in terms of strength.</p><p></p><p>Based on the density of spiritual energy, the upper realm was divided into nine levels of heaven.</p><p></p><p>The lower three levels, middle three levels, and upper three levels.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the man with his back turned didn't have many memories of the upper three levels, only knowing that it was a land of constant warfare.</p><p></p><p>The higher the heaven, the stronger the power of the sacred lands.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Palace... the force Jinli belongs to..." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that by killing the man with his back turned, he would hear news of the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess was the strongest being in the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what connection Master has with the Moon Palace," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Master Ruan Yixi had left behind the Moon Token, which was the credential of the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that Master Ruan Yixi had deep ties with the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... Master is Jinli?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan speculated, but then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Given Jinli's personality, if she knew it was him, she would have likely come to see him already.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, it seems I have an inextricable connection with this Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Man with your back turned, when I go to the upper realm and clean up the atmosphere there, I'll start with your father.</p><p></p><p>I'm a good person, I can't bear to see white-haired people sending off black-haired ones, so I'll have to let you reunite."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure flashed, and he came out of the Ancient Mirror of Kun.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the ancient mirror before him, squinting his eyes: "If I take this ancient mirror, doesn't that mean... if I go to the upper realm and get close enough, the father of the man with his back turned would be able to sense me?</p><p></p><p>I can't throw away this mirror!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Mirror of Kun was also a powerful treasure that could nurture the soul.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the man with his back turned wouldn't have survived.</p><p></p><p>"I could put the divine infants into the ancient mirror, perhaps... my former self would awaken."</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, all the innate divine spirits had become his divine infants.</p><p></p><p>They were themselves, and they were also Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Currently, they were in a dormant state, unable to exert their full power.</p><p></p><p>When they officially awaken, they would be able to regain their strength.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if Qi Yuan appeared in the upper realm and was given enough time, these divine infants could even break through to the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>These divine infants were divine infants with growth potential.</p><p></p><p>"Collect." Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ancient Mirror of Kun shrank and entered his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to return to Blue Star now, I'd definitely be an amazing doctor, able to perform all kinds of transplant surgeries!"</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan thought of something - he didn't understand medical principles, hadn't even taken an exam, so even if someone was sick, he wouldn't know what illness they had.</p><p></p><p>But this was easy to solve.</p><p></p><p>"If I were a doctor, I'd just tell every patient they have kidney deficiency!"</p><p></p><p>After all, telling someone they have kidney deficiency is never wrong.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt pleased with his own cleverness.</p><p></p><p>"Go in," At this time, Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>As if hearing his command, five thousand divine infants all dove into the ancient mirror.</p><p></p><p>The ancient mirror also entered Qi Yuan's dantian at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Mirror of Kun had the effect of nurturing souls, so Qi Yuan put the divine infants in to nurture them.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Qi Yuan looked at the Yin God corpse of the Phoenix Palace, frowning: "Phoenix Domain... is too miserable, all the Yin Gods are dead.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean... it's time for a feast?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The people of Phoenix Domain had a feast to attend, but he had to go to the Dark Sun headquarters and couldn't even eat a feast.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Unknown world.</p><p></p><p>A female doctor in a white coat looked at the young man before her, her tired eyes showing a trace of sympathy: "Qi Yuan, remember to take your medicine on time."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sick, I won't take medicine," said Qi Yuan, who had transformed from an innate seed, without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a kind robot spoke: "This is candy, not medicine. You're not sick."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Qi Yuan sit down, his face showing a smug expression. Suddenly, he seriously examined the eyes of the female doctor in front of him, staring at her eyes without moving.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the female doctor suddenly felt a sense of pressure, as if facing those legendary great figures.</p><p></p><p>The young man in front of her suddenly said, "I'm not sick, but you are."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the female doctor's face, not taking Qi Yuan's words seriously: "How is sister sick?"</p><p></p><p>"You've been having nightmares recently!"</p><p></p><p>The female doctor's hand, which was writing, paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Was it a coincidence? Recently, she had indeed been having nightmares.</p><p></p><p>This had also led to her recent poor condition.</p><p></p><p>She thought it was because of too much work pressure lately.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of dream did sister have?" the female doctor asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>She didn't take Qi Yuan's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan's parents were expecting him, they encountered a powerful being, causing brain damage to him while he was still a fetus.</p><p></p><p>Combined with being raised in a robot-socialized environment, lacking paternal and maternal love, his personality had become particularly strange, with severe delusions.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the words of a mentally ill person couldn't be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>How would he know what dreams she had? The dreams she had these past few days were also incredibly strange and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>She had never imagined she would have such dreams.</p><p></p><p>"You dreamed of a... big red bird, its feathers were all plucked, bloody, in the deep dark sky, it kept flying and flying... but its voice was... joyful!" Qi Yuan's voice was very calm.</p><p></p><p>The female doctor was startled: "What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>She was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Because her dream was exactly as Qi Yuan had described! That bloody bird kept crying out, seemingly very joyful in its voice.</p><p></p><p>The cry was also very strange.</p><p></p><p>According to the pronunciation, it was very similar to the words "chong qi" (重七).</p><p></p><p>She hadn't paid attention before, but now hearing Qi Yuan say this.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... things weren't as simple as imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Chong qi" could also mean "restart"? "Inflate"? Or "dote on wife"?</p><p></p><p>"That's why you're sick!" Qi Yuan sat in the chair, his face</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A faint smile.</p><p></p><p>The female doctor was extremely shocked inside.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know how Qi Yuan could know about her dream.</p><p></p><p>But... wasn't Qi Yuan just an ordinary person?</p><p></p><p>Although there were quite a few elites among his classmates, he was just an ordinary mental patient.</p><p></p><p>"What illness do I have?" the female doctor couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"You have... kidney deficiency!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"..." The female doctor was left speechless.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, she shouldn't have had any hopes for a mental patient.</p><p></p><p>With doubts in her heart, the female doctor gave a few instructions to the robot and left Qi Yuan's home.</p><p></p><p>In the spacious room, only Qi Yuan remained. No, there was also a robot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>His home was a standard three-bedroom apartment, left behind by his parents who died in battle.</p><p></p><p>His room was over 20 square meters, with only a bed, a computer, and a wardrobe. It was very simple, without many possessions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he clutched his head and crouched on the ground: "Restart!"</p><p></p><p>In his mind, an image of a bird flying across the sky appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his pupils seemed to be bloodshot, filled with red veins.</p><p></p><p>The blood vessels became more and more numerous, thicker and thicker. His eyeballs looked like they were about to bulge out, almost bursting, extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Blood marks also appeared under his eye sockets.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan realm, Qi Yuan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Innate Seed... why does it feel like its condition is not good... it's not going to die, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Now he couldn't sense what was happening to the Innate Seed in the game world.</p><p></p><p>Once he went over, he would be able to fully accept everything there.</p><p></p><p>The increase in strength in that world, reflected on his real body, would no longer be as little as before.</p><p></p><p>But now he felt that the condition of the Innate Seed was not very good, its life force extremely fragile, as if it was about to die.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness entered the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the loading of the new game world was not even halfway done, the game icon had not fully appeared.</p><p></p><p>This time, the game icon was somewhat different from before.</p><p></p><p>This time's icon seemed to show a skinned bird.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Innate Seed hasn't died by the time I enter the game, or it's all over." Qi Yuan just sighed.</p><p></p><p>The game was still loading now, he couldn't influence it.</p><p></p><p>So it was best not to worry about it for now, and deal with Dark Sun first.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Phoenix Palace's corpse, no longer hesitating, and returned to Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you're back so soon?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, the Seven Injuries Elder looked surprised.</p><p></p><p>How long had Qi Yuan been gone? He was back already.</p><p></p><p>Didn't anything happen in Phoenix Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Something happened in Phoenix Palace!" Qi Yuan spoke with a stern expression, his eyes showing regret. "Great Venerable Jasmine colluded with a mysterious expert and killed all the invited Yin Gods!</p><p></p><p>When I arrived, that mysterious expert tried to use the same trick to ambush me! But I killed him instead, and I also killed Great Venerable Jasmine! Now, Phoenix Palace is full of Yin God corpses. Find some people to deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke quickly, briefly informing the Seven Injuries Elder about what happened in Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Seven Injuries Elder's heart was hit by huge waves: "They're all dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, all dead. It's a pity, I have to go to Dark Sun and can't attend their banquet. Remember to hold a banquet for them, make it grand and impressive."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder fell silent, many thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had some doubts about what Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Jasmine hooked up with a mysterious expert? In this world, there were only so many experts, where did so many mysterious experts come from? He even suspected that it was because these people offended the Blood Robe Sword God last time, and were wiped out by him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he became even more fearful of the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>This was something that a killing god like the Blood Robe Sword God could do.</p><p></p><p>After instructing the Seven Injuries Elder, Qi Yuan also ordered Wind Lord in Seeking Dao Palace to arrange for Great Wisdom True Lord to be invited to Light Swan City.</p><p></p><p>By now, Qi Yuan had obtained enough cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>He planned to continue deducing the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Regarding the path of the Purple Palace, he had a clear idea.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already become a Supreme Being in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>But as the saying goes, three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he should still borrow Great Wisdom True Lord's clever brain, it might bring him unexpected benefits.</p><p></p><p>After everything was arranged, Qi Yuan looked at the lively scene of Seeking Dao Palace preparing for the banquet, feeling very sad inside.</p><p></p><p>This banquet... he wouldn't be able to attend.</p><p></p><p>But he wasn't stupid either. Before leaving, he secretly hid a pork knuckle to eat on the way to Dark Sun headquarters.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Profound Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>Seeking Dao Palace branch.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred Yin God projections sat within.</p><p></p><p>The strength of these Yin Gods was mostly at the Great Venerable level, with the weakest being Yin Gods who had taken three steps to ascend to heaven.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods almost encompassed all the Yin God representatives of the forces in Seeking Dao Palace's area.</p><p></p><p>The Cang Lan Realm had thirty-three domains, and Seeking Dao Palace's location covered twenty domains.</p><p></p><p>Except for domains like the Central Heavenly Domain where Seeking Dao Palace had not set foot, they had branches in all other domains.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the overall Palace Master of Seeking Dao Palace wore purple robes, looking quite otherworldly.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, what do you think of the Original God Sharing Conference?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Seeking Dao Palace Master had refused Blood Robe Sword God's desire to collect all the methods under heaven.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the great calamity was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Even if the cultivation methods were poisonous, so what? A mere Great Venerable dared to challenge the great calamity?</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to challenge it, that was fine, he could even praise him for his courage.</p><p></p><p>But to get involved, collect all the methods under heaven, and exchange them for methods in the Original God Sharing Conference, he couldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Dark Sun had already sent the Lei Family Four Generals to kill the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Seeking Dao Palace Master naturally believed that the Blood Robe Sword God wouldn't survive this calamity, so the Original God Sharing Conference's desire to collect all the methods under heaven was just a fantasy. He casually sent an envoy to dismiss it.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, things developed beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God actually killed the Lei Family Four Generals!</p><p></p><p>Each of the Lei Family Four Generals was a peak expert who had taken six steps to ascend to heaven, but they were still killed by the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God's strength was beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Without mythical figures appearing, the Blood Robe Sword God was already the strongest in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>So later, when Qi Yuan sent Great Venerable Wu Jun to contact Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Seeking Dao Palace Master gave him face and contacted many leaders of major forces.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword God has strength comparable to mythical figures. Since he dares to move against Dark Sun, he must have confidence." An old man spoke up, smiling kindly. "This old man is willing to join the Original God Sharing Conference and provide some minor methods to help the Blood Robe Sword God."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the Blood Robe Sword God doesn't know how terrifying Dark Sun is.</p><p></p><p>Although this is not the Central Heavenly Domain, Dark Sun also has mythical figures stationed there!</p><p></p><p>This old man will not get involved in this muddy water." The speaker was the overall President of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Association headquarters was also stationed in the Profound Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Divine Flower Association President spoke, the atmosphere in the venue became slightly tense, especially for the several Great Venerables from the Profound Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

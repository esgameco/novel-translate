        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Twenty outstanding talents gathered, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Except for Ling Jiao, the other talents at least showed outward respect towards Qi Yuan, and were also very curious about which Yin God's descendant this strange man was.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Eastern Land, there were only a handful of Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the powerful Wind Orchid appeared, with the Wind Moon Fairy following behind him. Her figure was graceful, with white gloves covering her nails and fingers.</p><p></p><p>The gathered talents all looked towards Wind Orchid with respect in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Wind Orchid!"</p><p></p><p>These talents naturally showed respect to a Purple Palace powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Wind Orchid nodded, glancing at Qi Yuan who was carrying a turtle shell on his back, with a strange look in his eyes. He cleared his throat and said: "You are all outstanding talents of our Eastern Land, carrying important responsibilities for your sects. Let me briefly introduce the situation on the Wangyue Continent to you all."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, twenty jade slips fell into everyone's hands.</p><p></p><p>The jade slips contained detailed information about the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>"On the Wangyue Continent, including us, there are now three forces. They are the natives of the Wangyue Continent, the Moluo clan, and us. The natives of the continent are not worth mentioning. As for the strength of the Moluo clan... it's very strong. However, we of the Eastern Land have reached an agreement with the Moluo clan that forces of the fifth rank and above will not take action," Wind Orchid explained.</p><p></p><p>The fifth rank referred to the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>"Who are our opponents on the Wangyue Continent?" asked Gu Xiaoyao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also glanced at Gu Xiaoyao at this point. </p><p></p><p>This was a perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, someone even he was wary of.</p><p></p><p>"Among the three forces, the Moluo clan is the strongest. We will... temporarily form an alliance with the natives of the Wangyue Continent. Of course, in reality, both are our opponents."</p><p></p><p>The people present nodded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked at the jade slip, gaining a better understanding of the complex situation on the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Canglan Continent and the Moluo clan were gradually swallowing up the territory of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>"On the Wangyue Continent, three Venerable Ones have already established strongholds, with many Divine Infant cultivators guarding them," Wind Orchid continued. "Remember, you must not make enemies of them."</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Eastern Land only had those three Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Continent was discovered and occupied by those three.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Land's outstanding talent competition offered twenty spots to distribute some benefits to other major forces in the Eastern Land.</p><p></p><p>These twenty people entering the Wangyue Continent would, firstly, gain experience; secondly, clarify the state of the Wangyue Continent; and thirdly, gain more say based on their contributions on the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, they were working for those three Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>Those who performed well would receive more rewards, and their sects could send more people to occupy some territory, used to avoid the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The twenty talents responded in unison.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, everyone, enter the Wangyue Continent!" Wind Orchid finished.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a door appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of those present fell on that door, including Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>There was a look of surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was his first time... reaching another world through such means.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Gu Xiaoyao spoke.</p><p></p><p>The gathered people all entered that door one after another.</p><p></p><p>What met their eyes was a burst of white light.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt their vision become a sea of white, unable to see anything clearly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a feeling of the world spinning came over them.</p><p></p><p>This sensation lasted for a full dozen breaths.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes were full of anticipation, with a hint of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if this Wangyue Continent was the world he had once stayed in.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't know if he could see his old acquaintances here.</p><p></p><p>On the Wangyue Continent, what year was it now?</p><p></p><p>The white light dissipated, replaced by a dry, intense heat.</p><p></p><p>It felt like a wave of hot air sweeping over them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present felt the extreme heat.</p><p></p><p>The place they had appeared was like a desert.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Wangyue Continent?"</p><p></p><p>"It's quite hot!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone had different expressions, full of curiosity about this unknown world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ling Jiao glanced at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "Some people are wearing such thick clothes in this heat, do they really think this is still the Canglan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>In the Canglan Realm, spiritual energy filled the world.</p><p></p><p>As long as one's spiritual power was abundant, spells could theoretically be used endlessly.</p><p></p><p>But the Wangyue Continent was different.</p><p></p><p>This was not the same world as the Canglan Realm; there was no spiritual energy in this world.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in their dantians was limited, and once used up, it was difficult to replenish.</p><p></p><p>Even with spirit stones, absorption was more troublesome than in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>So they were very economical with the spiritual power in their dantians, trying not to use it if possible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were being very frugal, not using spells to make the place cooler.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, however, didn't respond to Ling Jiao.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he hadn't heard Ling Jiao's words at all.</p><p></p><p>He crouched down, looking at a withered small plant on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his finger and touched that small plant.</p><p></p><p>As he touched it, something amazing happened.</p><p></p><p>The withered plant on the ground seemed to have been nourished by spring rain.</p><p></p><p>The originally withered yellow branches and leaves became tender and full of life at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the desert, one, two, three small plants appeared continuously, growing wildly.</p><p></p><p>At Qi Yuan's feet, the dry desert instantly transformed into a patch of green.</p><p></p><p>These small plants stretched out their leaf buds, as if saying "hello" to Qi Yuan like the garden plants in Wang Duoyu's manor.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene, in the world of mortals, would be enough for those mortals to view it as a miracle.</p><p></p><p>However, for the gathered talents, it felt strange.</p><p></p><p>Especially that Ling Jiao, whose eyes held a cold smile: "Wasting spiritual power on such trivial matters, how interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Great Wisdom True Lord then said: "This fellow Daoist is willing to consume his own spiritual power just to save a withered plant. This shows his character and is worth befriending."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally stood up and looked at Ling Jiao: "If not used for this, should spiritual power be used on you?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Jiao gritted her teeth, about to retort.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice came, interrupting the argument between Qi Yuan and Ling Jiao.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has arrived. This old man is True Lord Falling Wood, and I have been waiting here for some time. Greetings to you all!"</p><p></p><p>A Divine Infant cultivator appeared, with a neutral expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, True Lord Falling Wood!" The gathered talents all showed great respect to this Divine Infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After all, those who had come to the Wangyue Continent now were all subordinates of those three Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me, everyone. As it happens, representatives from seven forces on the Wangyue Continent have come to our stronghold seeking an alliance. You can choose to ally with these forces on your own to jointly deal with the Moluo clan," the Divine Infant cultivator True Lord Falling Wood said, also explaining the current situation to the gathered talents.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were seven kingdoms near this stronghold.</p><p></p><p>These seven kingdoms were resisting the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>With their strength, they naturally couldn't face the Moluo clan, so they were seeking cooperation with the cultivators from the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You call it an alliance?" Ling Jiao's eyes showed a light smile. "It's nothing more than ceding territory to seek help. These natives of the Wangyue Continent are truly weak."</p><p></p><p>The bargaining chips offered by these natives were to cede some territories to them in exchange for their help.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the gathered talents all sighed inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>In this world, weakness was a sin.</p><p></p><p>Because of their weakness, the Wangyue Continent could only struggle to survive between two terrifying enemies.</p><p></p><p>However, their struggle, their humiliating concessions, seemed particularly amusing in the eyes of others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mood at this moment was exceptionally calm.</p><p></p><p>The words of others seemed not to have reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the azure sky, whispering in his heart: "Twenty-one days, is it?"</p><p></p><p>When he stepped onto the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this was his Wangyue Continent, his home.</p><p></p><p>His body, his divine soul, was regaining control of this world.</p><p></p><p>And to fully take control, to become the Heavenly Dao of this world, the time needed was twenty-one days.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the stronghold, representatives from the seven kingdoms gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were not very good.</p><p></p><p>After all, coming here, on the surface, was to seek help and achieve cooperation.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, they would be signing treaties that surrendered rights and humiliated their countries.</p><p></p><p>If their countries perished, that would be another matter.</p><p></p><p>If their countries survived, they would become sinners for all time.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi wore a monk's white robe, his face handsome, with the only regret being that he was bald, without a single hair on his forehead or eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his face also carried deep worry.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that twenty young talents from major forces in the Canglan Realm have come to ally with us. Do you have any information about them?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What about the information?" Luo Xi asked.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the strength, background, and methods of those forces was very important for them.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know," an elderly man shook his head and said, looking at Luo Xi, "Your Fengui country is unwilling to cede territory. I'm afraid this cooperation can only end up being in vain."</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi's expression darkened: "Fengui only has three cities. Of the ten great generals in the country, eight died defending against the Moluo clan. </p><p></p><p>How can we, the later generations, casually hand over the land that our ancestors protected with their blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Without offering some real benefits, how can those foreigners sincerely help us?" the old man sighed.</p><p></p><p>They also knew how important territory was.</p><p></p><p>However, facing national destruction, they naturally had to make concessions to get through the current crisis first.</p><p></p><p>"The king said she would rather be a slave than cede territory!" Luo Xi lamented.</p><p></p><p>How could they hand over the land their ancestors protected with blood? The representatives of the seven countries present had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the geniuses from our Canglang Realm have arrived."</p><p></p><p>Following the elderly voice, </p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoyao, Jiang Ya, Qi Yuan and others entered the large tent.</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the seven countries all stood up, with respectful expressions on their faces: "Greetings to you all!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi raised his head and looked at the twenty young people before him, his gaze becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because these twenty young people all gave him an extremely terrifying feeling.</p><p></p><p>He was probably no match for any one of them.</p><p></p><p>Is this the foundation of the Canglang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Are just twenty young people all so powerful? Not only Luo Xi had a solemn expression, but the others were also the same.</p><p></p><p>Luomu Zhenjun spoke at this time, briefly introducing each other, and then said: "You can discuss the following matters yourselves."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ling Jiao spoke: "My maternal grandfather is a Yin God, and my father is the master of the Water Cloud Palace, the number one power in the Water Immortal Continent, possessing Yin God artifacts.</p><p></p><p>I have only one requirement in choosing a partner - the area of territory given must be large.</p><p></p><p>If it's too little, I'm not interested."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ling Jiao spoke, she displayed her domineering personality.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, in facing the Moluo clan, I should take the lead. I don't want some people giving me orders!"</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the seven countries were shocked by the first half of Ling Jiao's words.</p><p></p><p>That was a Yin God, a legendary sixth-rank powerhouse! But hearing the second half, their expressions became difficult.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Ya also spoke: "Our Ascending Heaven Pavilion doesn't have high demands for territory, just one city to settle in is fine, but... we need cultivation techniques, the more the better."</p><p></p><p>Several of the seven countries' representatives were quite moved.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Great Wisdom Zhenjun couldn't help saying: "Is that old man Wutian still collecting cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ya glanced at Great Wisdom Zhenjun without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Back then, old man Wutian had taken a liking to Great Wisdom Zhenjun and wanted to accept him as a disciple, but was rejected by Great Wisdom Zhenjun, who said there was no future in following old man Wutian.</p><p></p><p>This caused a stir in the Eastern Land at the time.</p><p></p><p>After all, old man Wutian was the number one figure below Yin Gods in the Eastern Land, and countless geniuses begged to become his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom Zhenjun, who refused old man Wutian and was unwilling to be his disciple, was truly the first of his kind.</p><p></p><p>On the scene, these geniuses from the Eastern Land all stated their identities, backgrounds, and respective demands.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan marvel.</p><p></p><p>Those who could enter the top twenty of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings all came from major powers.</p><p></p><p>Even the Seven Words Sect that Xu Tongchen came from had a Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Unlike him, who was just from a village-level cultivation sect where Spirit Infant cultivators were the strongest.</p><p></p><p>The crowd on the scene continued to discuss and negotiate.</p><p></p><p>Ling Jiao, who demonstrated powerful background and strength, naturally received the most attention from the seven countries' representatives.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to cooperate, of course willing to work with the strongest.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Moluo clan was too powerful. If the allies were too weak, it would be too much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>Facing the seven countries' representatives, Ling Jiao's expression was arrogant: "Three cities? That's for beggars! Even three cities in the Canglang Realm I wouldn't look at, let alone the broken cities of your Wangyue Continent."</p><p></p><p>She could still communicate amiably with other geniuses, but for natives, she had no patience and was high and mighty.</p><p></p><p>The old man who spoke earlier had an embarrassed expression. Being mocked like this, he could only swallow his anger and dared not retort.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>Most of the seven countries' representatives had reached cooperation agreements with the geniuses present.</p><p></p><p>These dozen or so geniuses had arrogant expressions, with smug looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they were very satisfied with this negotiation.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the seven countries' representatives all had very heavy expressions.</p><p></p><p>Even though cooperation was reached, the dark clouds on their faces did not dissipate at all.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan, who had been silent, looked at the bald man with curiosity in his eyes: "Do you know about the South Qian Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The bald man before him was not a monk.</p><p></p><p>It was a side effect that appeared after entering the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area and cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Qi Yuan controlled the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area, he set rules within it.</p><p></p><p>Doing push-ups, pull-ups and so on would make one stronger.</p><p></p><p>But correspondingly, the side effect was hair loss.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Xi before him had obviously cultivated in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luo Xi's eyes showed a strange look: "This junior doesn't know."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed. He said, "When you have time, take me to see your Fengui."</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi's face lit up, but then he said: "In response to Your Excellency, our Fengui only has three cities, we cannot... cede territory to you."</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had tried to cooperate with other geniuses.</p><p></p><p>But the conditions he proposed, no one was willing to agree to.</p><p></p><p>"What use do I have for your cities?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile, "Aren't your cities already mine?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi's expression changed slightly, not understanding what Qi Yuan meant.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Ling Jiao couldn't help saying again: "Thick clothes, thick skin, are you forcibly seizing?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to look at Ling Jiao.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the Wangyue Continent, he felt his strength increasing every moment.</p><p></p><p>Although this increase would probably completely disappear not long after leaving the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>But on the Wangyue Continent, this strength truly existed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's leopard guts returned.</p><p></p><p>"How am I forcibly seizing?" Qi Yuan was very aggrieved, "The Wangyue Continent is my home, I have the deed!</p><p></p><p>Even if they give me cities, I don't want them, after all they're already mine, what do I need those cities for?"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses on the scene looked at each other, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya also looked at Qi Yuan strangely, not knowing why, she felt this person carrying a turtle shell on his back seemed familiar.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Great Wisdom Zhenjun asked with curiosity: "Fellow Daoist, is this Wangyue Continent really your home?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded forcefully, "Absolutely true!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, so this is your home.</p><p></p><p>In that case, doesn't that mean our previous transactions should be void? Fellow Daoist, how about this, my backers and I will help you resist the Moluo clan, and you rent some houses in your home to me." Great Wisdom Zhenjun pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>If these words came from others' mouths, people would find them bizarre and incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>But Great Wisdom Zhenjun could easily understand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a long time before saying: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom Zhenjun had given him a lot of help, he was willing to do him a favor.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Jiao couldn't help but laugh lightly: "How amusing, you really think the Wangyue Continent is yours?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan finally looked at Ling Jiao: "I won't rent my home's houses to you, get lost."</p><p></p><p>Ling Jiao was furious, she felt she had no business arguing with an idiot. She didn't speak again.</p><p></p><p>The crowd on the scene also didn't take Qi Yuan's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>They just treated Qi Yuan as a madman.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan continued: "If anyone else wants to rent a house, tell me now. I'm going to Fengui right away, I don't have time to chat idly with you."</p><p></p><p>The others on the scene were even more bewildered.</p><p></p><p>This turtle shell man really thought he was the owner of the Wangyue Continent?</p><p></p><p>"It seems no one else is willing to rent." Qi Yuan looked at the representatives of the seven countries, his voice ethereal, "Children, your agreements with them are void. In a moment, I'll go see who dares to act wildly in my home!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words seemed to have a magical quality.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Wangyue Continent looked at Qi Yuan and felt a sense of closeness, as if sons meeting their father.</p><p></p><p>"Void?" The old man's eyes were confused.</p><p></p><p>The others also had struggling expressions, fierce battles going on in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, void! The Wangyue Continent is my home, if unwelcome guests come, I will personally drive them out!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, void!" For some reason, that old man felt a powerful force compelling him to say these words.</p><p></p><p>"Ours are void too!"</p><p></p><p>"So are ours!"</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the seven countries spoke up one after another, wanting to void the agreements they had just negotiated!

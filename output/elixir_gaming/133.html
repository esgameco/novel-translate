        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the short Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Today's update will likely be at midnight.</p><p></p><p>I've provided a direct translation of the brief text provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions about the translation.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for providing that excerpt. However, the Chinese text you shared is actually just a short phrase that appears to be an apology, not a full excerpt from a novel. The text translates to:</p><p></p><p>"I can only write in front of the point, I apologize again!!!"</p><p></p><p>This seems to be a message from someone apologizing for not being able to provide more text or content. Without a longer passage from the novel, I'm not able to provide a full translation of an excerpt. If you have a longer section of Chinese text from the novel, I'd be happy to translate that for you. Let me know if you need any other assistance!</p>

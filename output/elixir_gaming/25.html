        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu wore a long blue dress, her scarf fluttering like a green snake woman. </p><p></p><p>Her lively eyes still carried a hint of weariness. She brushed the hair from her temples and took a deep breath: "It seems I lost a piece of Junyuan jade yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the Shenguang Sect can't buy it.</p><p></p><p>I'll just have to make do with something else."</p><p></p><p>Junyuan jade was a spiritual jade that could emit a mysterious fragrance and clear the mind when ignited.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, the puppet had cleaned the room and thrown the remaining piece into the trash.</p><p></p><p>Normally, she wouldn't have minded.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Shenguang Sect, where replacements couldn't be found.</p><p></p><p>She decided to go to the trash heap and retrieve that piece of Junyuan jade.</p><p></p><p>She came to the trash heap, covering her mouth and nose with her sleeve, ready to summon the puppet to find the piece of Junyuan jade.</p><p></p><p>But... the trash heap.</p><p></p><p>"Who's been through it?"</p><p></p><p>She stared at the trash heap, stunned.</p><p></p><p>The trash heap usually contained her daily garbage and the remnants of some spiritual items.</p><p></p><p>Like the Junyuan jade.</p><p></p><p>She never expected the outdoor trash heap to have been rummaged through.</p><p></p><p>She thought of something, and a talisman appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>This talisman, called the Perception Talisman, was one of the many talismans Jiang Lingsu possessed, created by a Deity Infant Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>She usually kept it by her bedside to serve as an early warning.</p><p></p><p>Since the trash heap had been disturbed, she immediately took out the Perception Talisman and looked for clues on it.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the talisman, there was a faint pattern.</p><p></p><p>"Around the hour of the Ox last night? Was there a living being lingering outside my room for about an incense stick's time?"</p><p></p><p>Through the residual information on the Perception Talisman, Jiang Lingsu knew that there had been a living being lingering outside her room for a significant amount of time the previous night.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no malicious intent, as the Perception Talisman had not sounded an alarm, otherwise she wouldn't have been able to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu frowned as she looked at the trash heap: "On the Seven-Colored Peak, there are only the Sect Master, myself, and the Senior Disciple Brother.</p><p></p><p>Other ordinary animals wouldn't trigger the Perception Talisman's response.</p><p>At least it had to be a being with spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Lingsu looked towards the neighboring thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the appearance of her Senior Disciple Brother when he had eaten spiritual food, and a strange emotion arose within her.</p><p></p><p>Sigh...</p><p></p><p>She thought about it for a while, then returned to her own room.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Jiang Lingsu came to the courtyard outside Qi Yuan's place.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Disciple Brother, are you awake?" Jiang Lingsu called softly.</p><p></p><p>"What is it, Junior Sister?" Qi Yuan had changed into a white robe, looking quite handsome and elegant. Today was the Foundation Establishment Assembly, so he had gotten up earlier than usual.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's appearance, Jiang Lingsu felt her heart at ease.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the sight of beauty always lifts one's mood.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Disciple Brother, may I trouble you with something?" Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what is it?" Qi Yuan was very enthusiastic. The cultivation manual jade slips and spiritual food his Junior Sister had given him previously had made him quite grateful.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Disciple Brother, do you know if there are any special or mysterious people in our sect?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had initially focused on Sect Master Alun Yishe on the Seven-Colored Peak as the one who could withstand calamities.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Lingsu felt she could identify some other potential candidates as well.</p><p></p><p>"Special people?" Qi Yuan pondered, then his eyes lit up. "I know one person who is quite special."</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" Jiang Lingsu's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>"Me!" Qi Yuan pointed to himself.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Her Senior Disciple Brother was indeed quite special, after all... cultivators of the Foolish Path often had somewhat abnormal minds.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu felt a bit deflated, feeling that seeking help from her Senior Disciple Brother was not very reliable. But recalling the morning's events,</p><p></p><p>she took out a storage bag: "Senior Disciple Brother, here are a thousand spirit stones as your reward. Please help me look into some special people, there will be more rewards to come."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the storage bag and blinked his eyes: "Sister disciple, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu did not expect her senior brother to ask this way.</p><p></p><p>But then she thought, the Chizhi lineage is only a little silly, not stupid.</p><p></p><p>She said the reasons she had prepared before: "Before I came to the Shenguang Sect, I met a diviner who told me that there is a special person in the sect, who is my benefactor, so I want to find out who that person is."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard Jiang Lingsu's words and suddenly blurted out:</p><p></p><p>"Believing you is no better than believing I am Qin Shi Huang."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu: "???"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued: "I'll take care of this matter."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see different information.</p><p></p><p>Finding a special person would be the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>"Does that person have any other characteristics?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu lowered her head: "His strength should be extremely strong, or his talent is very high. Oh yes, it's possible that it's not a person!</p><p></p><p>Please help me, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu left Qi Yuan's courtyard after saying this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the storage bag and looked at the thousand spirit stones inside.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that this was the first time he had seen such a large sum of money.</p><p></p><p>However, his heart was not very disturbed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he murmured, "Why did my sister disciple send me spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>It seems that the sister disciple really wants him to help.</p><p></p><p>But these spirit stones, they look like a gift to him.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the sister disciple has seen through my inner stubbornness and wants to tear off my disguise? To keep me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a sudden inspiration.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he did not dwell on it, but turned his gaze to the kitchen knife tied in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Sister disciple, you have seen through my stubbornness, have you also seen it, knife?"</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife lay on the ground, motionless.</p><p></p><p>"What should I name you?"</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife still did not move.</p><p></p><p>"Knife?"</p><p>"Vegetable knife?"</p><p>"Cai Cai?"</p><p>"Knife Knife?"</p><p>"Demon Sword?"</p><p>"Sky Sword?"</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife finally had some reaction, looking like it was shivering.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly grabbed the kitchen knife, with a puzzled look in his eyes: "Is this having spiritual intelligence? How come it's not as smart as my little classmate Ai."</p><p></p><p>Little classmate Ai, even if you let her fart, she at least knows to call her classmate Xiao Du to fart.</p><p></p><p>This kitchen knife, it looks like it has spiritual intelligence, but it's no different from not having it.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, it's normal.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan holding the knife, he felt that his combat power had increased a layer.</p><p></p><p>"Eight slashes in the summer, can it kill a few Foundation Establishment cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this is the Seven-Color Peak, not suitable for practicing the sword.</p><p>And he still needs to represent the Shenguang Sect to attend the Foundation Establishment Conference, he has no time to practice the sword.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment Conference finally began.</p><p></p><p>And this Foundation Establishment Conference, because of the Grade One Foundation Establishment treasure, the Yellow Flower Fruit, the sects from the Great Merchant Kingdom that came were not weak.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Feihua from the Moyu Gate has arrived!"</p><p>"Sect Master Fenguang from the Suspended Mountain has arrived!"</p><p>"Prince of Changshan has arrived!"</p><p>"Patriarch Bai from the Heishan Sect has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>With the announcement of the child, outside the gate of the Shenguang Sect, multicolored clouds gathered.</p><p></p><p>One by one, spiritual boats descended from the sky and landed in front of the gate of the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, in a white robe, the wind blowing through his clothes, making a rustling sound, he looked at the guests from the various sects arriving, with a scholarly smile in his eyes: "Welcome, everyone, to my Shenguang Sect to attend the Foundation Establishment Conference!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was quite reliable.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

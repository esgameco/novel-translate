        <h1>Chapter 577</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her beautiful face was flushed with redness, and the area in front of her chest was... standing proudly.</p><p></p><p>She seemed like a shy young girl.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect that after backstabbing someone, she would be caught red-handed.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm quite reserved too."</p><p></p><p>"If the Cosmic Spirit Sea wasn't so dangerous, I would dress more modestly."</p><p></p><p>A sense of innocence and charm were both surging within this Female Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I can't compare to you old drivers who have lived for billions of years."</p><p></p><p>He could see at a glance that the Female Realm Lord's blushing was fake.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't think that just because you look good, you can act coy." The Female Realm Lord said dissatisfiedly, no longer covering her face and revealing a slightly immature face. As she spoke, she moved her long legs to cross them, blocking the view below.</p><p></p><p>In her every movement, Qi Yuan saw elements of innocence, sexiness, hotness, mature lady, young girl, and wife.</p><p></p><p>This was the terrifying power of a Realm Lord - in a single thought, she could manifest a myriad of appearances that struck to the heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was different from Shen Lingxuan's Mysterious Yin Body. Shen Lingxuan's was unconscious, while this Realm Lord's was conscious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this Realm Lord, Qi Yuan unconsciously thought of Shen Lingxuan. Unfortunately, after leaving the Divine Wood Universe, he had not seen Shen Lingxuan again.</p><p></p><p>But Shen Lingxuan was a Destined One, a manifestation of the rules of his teacher Ruan Yixiao. After the collapse of the Dark Sky, her safety should be assured.</p><p></p><p>"No need to act, I've always been tender." Qi Yuan was still young, only around a hundred years old. At this age, it was the perfect time to return to the Blue Star and receive retirement benefits every day.</p><p></p><p>"Really? Show me?" The Female Realm Lord revealed a playful expression, her gaze lowering.</p><p></p><p>"You..." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless again, and his figure directly disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..." A bell-like laughter rang out from the Cosmic Spirit Sea, coming from that Female Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan's figure stopped, muttering to himself: "As a young man outside, I must indeed protect my own safety. There are too many ruffians among these aliens."</p><p></p><p>The key was, he didn't have the eloquence of Niujiao Sister, and on top of that, his skin was thin, unable to match these ancient monsters who had lived for countless billions of years.</p><p></p><p>Without further interaction with these people, Qi Yuan continued forward.</p><p></p><p>That Female Realm Lord, watching Qi Yuan from afar, had now changed her appearance again, occasionally whistling at him.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, don't persist, just take off your clothes."</p><p>"Don't worry, your big sister has integrity and won't take any photos."</p><p></p><p>It seemed she had discovered Qi Yuan's weakness and was using this appearance to approach him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have not heard her at all.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say he would take off his clothes at the 200th layer? Now it's the 300th layer." The Boar Realm Lord spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The prediction was wrong, but he will definitely take off his clothes at the 500th layer!" The Female Realm Lord said confidently, "After all, that one person could only reach the 499th layer without taking off their clothes, and now they've been stuck there for a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning that person, the Female Realm Lord's face showed a look of reverence.</p><p></p><p>That person, and she were both at the Myriad Beings Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>But the gap in their strength was extremely large. </p><p></p><p>It could be said that she had some strength in the Myriad Beings Realm, while the other was a major powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>If that person wanted to kill her, it would probably only take a year.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for not taking off their clothes, the Female Realm Lord felt that the other could have reached the 700th layer.</p><p></p><p>Taking off clothes to reach the 700th layer, and stopping at the 499th layer without taking off clothes, both were signs of a powerhouse's strength.</p><p></p><p>At the Myriad Beings Realm, a powerhouse level, perhaps they would step into the Opening Heaven Realm anytime.</p><p></p><p>The Opening Heaven Realm and the Myriad Beings Realm, though only one realm apart, the difference in strength was enormous.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Lord does not emerge, the Fourth Layer of the Sun God does not appear, the Opening Heaven Realm has already stood at the end of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"You really think highly of him." The Boar Realm Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Not too highly, last time didn't someone enter the 500th layer without taking off their clothes, and then get invited to join the Myriad Transformations Academy?" The Female Realm Lord said.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Myriad Transformations Academy, the Boar Realm Lord's expression changed slightly, his eyes filled with deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>They, these Realm Lords, were already the top geniuses of various universes.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Realm Lords who had joined the Myriad Transformations Academy, the gap was still too far.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that the Myriad Transformations Academy was founded by multiple Dao Lords, recruiting and absorbing countless true supreme geniuses from universes, worlds, and realms.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that joining the Myriad Transformations Academy was a great temptation for these Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>The transition from the Myriad Beings Realm to the Opening Heaven Realm was a threshold.</p><p></p><p>This threshold, some people could not cross even after a million universe eras.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this person... is also an extraordinary genius, trying to attract the attention of the Myriad Transformations Academy?" The Boar Realm Lord murmured.</p><p></p><p>The Female Realm Lord paused, as if she had thought of something: "Could it be that this is really the case? Now, the Willow Fluff Realm Lord has been stuck at the 499th layer for a hundred years, and the people of the Myriad Transformations Academy have been paying attention to her.</p><p></p><p>If he enters the 500th layer while still wearing clothes, the Myriad Transformations Academy... will definitely invite him!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the Female Realm Lord's face showed an excited and joyful expression: "Isn't that to say, once he crosses the 500th layer and attracts the Myriad Transformations Academy, he will start taking off his clothes?"</p><p></p><p>"..." The Boar Realm Lord didn't want to talk to this Female Realm Lord anymore.</p><p></p><p>"You, you don't understand romance. Good-looking boys are the most precious treasures in this world, you should take a look instead of not looking."</p><p></p><p>"I like looking at sows." The Boar Realm Lord retorted dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the void, Qin Thirty-Seven and Qin Nüyuan were sitting around bored, as wine fell from the sky and was occasionally poured into their mouths.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how long it will take the Willow Fluff Realm Lord to step into the 500th layer."</p><p></p><p>"What, are you concerned about her?" Qin Nüyuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you hear what Big Brother said? This Willow Fluff Realm Lord's identity is a mystery, not one of the known beings in our universe." Qin Twenty-Seven said.</p><p></p><p>Their Big Brother was an official member of the Myriad Transformations Academy, different from them as external members.</p><p></p><p>"The universes in the world are as vast as the stars, beings from unknown universes are normal, what's there to be surprised about?" Qin Nüyuan didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"It's different." Qin Twenty-Seven didn't say more, pretending to be a riddle master.</p><p></p><p>Because, he actually didn't know much either.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Qin Nüyuan snorted coldly, her gaze falling on the Cosmic Spirit Sea, "Look, there's another one not wearing clothes, probably also wanting to join the Myriad Transformations Academy."</p><p></p><p>"A bit too smart." Qin Twenty-Seven smiled, "But unfortunately, the reason the Myriad Transformations Academy will recruit the Willow Fluff Realm Lord is more because of her origins."</p><p></p><p>He naturally felt that Qi Yuan was an opportunist. Knowing that the Myriad Transformations Academy was paying attention to the Willow Fluff Realm Lord, he imitated the Willow Fluff Realm Lord by wearing clothes and entering the Cosmic Spirit Sea to step into the 500th layer.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that the recruitment standards of the Myriad Transformations Academy now were much higher than before.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qin Twenty-Seven suddenly stood up: "The Willow Fluff Realm Lord has finally stepped into the 500th layer, time to get to work."</p><p></p><p>Qin Nüyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as the Willow Fluff Realm Lord stepped into the 500th layer, countless gazes fell upon her.</p><p></p><p>"She has finally stepped into the 500th layer!"</p><p>"So strong!"</p><p>"Among the Myriad Beings Realm powerhouses, she is definitely one of the strongest."</p><p>"Most importantly, the Myriad Transformations Academy will invite her!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst these fluctuating whispers, a vast voice transmitted from the void into the Cosmic Spirit Sea, echoing for millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Transformations Academy specially invites the Willow Fluff Realm Lord to join, does the Willow Fluff Realm Lord agree?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Twenty-Seven stood in the void, conveying the message to the Willow Fluff Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Realm Lords, including those powerhouses, all had envious expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The Willow Fluff Realm Lord said calmly, pausing slightly on the 500th layer.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Female Realm Lord's eyes were filled with envy: "Sure enough, the Willow Fluff Realm Lord has joined the Myriad Transformations Academy, that handsome young man should also be able to join the Myriad Transformations Academy at this opportunity, right?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already reached the 498th layer.</p><p></p><p>At first, he had walked very fast.</p><p></p><p>Later, he found that the advancement of each layer was unique.</p><p></p><p>Once you crossed this layer, there would be no more.</p><p></p><p>So he deliberately slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Slowly feeling and improving his true spirit.</p><p></p><p>Although the true spirit improvement was not much, Qi Yuan was not greedy, even a mosquito's meat was still meat.</p><p></p><p>At this time, more and more Realm Lords also noticed Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Willow Fluff Realm Lord's gaze also fell on Qi Yuan: "Actually 499th layer, and still wearing clothes, could it be?"</p><p></p><p>She formed a guess in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other Realm Lords also had the same idea, their faces filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that today, we will be able to see two Realm Lords join the Myriad Transformations Academy!"</p><p></p><p>"That's the Myriad Transformations Academy, rumor has it that a Dao Lord will descend to the Myriad Transformations Academy to lecture every era!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Twenty-Seven's eyes revealed a playful expression as he murmured: "Too bad."</p><p></p><p>Just then, under the gaze of everyone, Qi Yuan stepped into the 500th layer.</p><p></p><p>The Willow Fluff Realm Lord's expression tightened: "He's stronger than me!"</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, he's aiming for the Myriad Transformations Academy.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who would wear clothes?</p><p></p><p>Hurry up and take off your clothes!" That Female Realm Lord's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>The other Realm Lords had envious expressions, while some looked at Qin Twenty-Seven.</p><p></p><p>The Divinely Beautiful Realm Lord's gaze was moved: "He's actually so strong!"</p><p></p><p>However, something unexpected happened - Qin Twenty-Seven did not issue an invitation.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"Why didn't the Myriad Transformations Academy invite him?"</p><p>"Didn't they just invite the Willow Fluff Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>A group of Realm Lords discussed in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Qin Twenty-Seven spread his hands, showing an innocent expression.</p><p></p><p>He murmured in a voice only he could hear: "This shortcut method doesn't work anymore."</p><p></p><p>That Female Realm Lord was also puzzled: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the outside world's...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The discussion, Qi Yuan did not hear or pay attention to.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that the true spirit can be forged in this way."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it's just scratching the surface."</p><p></p><p>"I'm already familiar with it, I need to speed up, I've been in for a while, I need to go back and eat soon, otherwise Sister Ling Su's dishes will get cold."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought this way.</p><p></p><p>His speed suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred and ten layers.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred and twenty layers! "Could it be that five hundred layers are not enough, he is speeding up, wanting to enter deeper layers, so that the ever-changing school will recruit him?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be."</p><p></p><p>"How many layers are enough?" Not a few domain lords had different thoughts as they looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Qi Yuan's footsteps stepped into the six hundredth layer.</p><p></p><p>In the void above, Qin Twenty-seven's face showed a surprised expression: "He is actually so strong?"</p><p></p><p>He was a little hesitant.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned above, this shortcut method is not accepted.</p><p></p><p>But the other party entered the six hundredth layer with his clothes on, which was absolutely excellent.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, why hasn't the ever-changing school recruited that person yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Strange."</p><p></p><p>"Six hundred layers are still not enough, isn't that ridiculous?"</p><p></p><p>Being watched by many people, Qin Twenty-seven also felt a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He was a little speechless, and also a little frightened.</p><p></p><p>This well-dressed handsome man was too outstanding.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't take long before Qin Twenty-seven's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"He actually stepped into the seven hundredth layer with his clothes on, this... I need to report to the higher-ups."</p><p></p><p>The other domain lords were also moved.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Liu Xu domain lord.</p><p></p><p>She entered the five hundredth layer and was recruited by the ever-changing school.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this person who reached the seven hundredth layer was not accepted, she felt like she had taken a back door, and was somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>However, before their shock subsided, wave after wave of shock came.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand layers!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible, he stepped into the one thousandth layer with his clothes on!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Boundary, he must be in the Heavenly Boundary!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, how can there be a stranger in the Heavenly Boundary in this universe?"</p><p></p><p>All the Heavenly Boundary experts were terrifying existences who had been famous for many eras.</p><p></p><p>But the one in front of them was completely unknown to everyone.</p><p></p><p>This was very strange.</p><p></p><p>"Which universe is he from?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is he exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"Although there are many domain lords in each universe, Heavenly Boundary experts are truly rare, and having ten of them is already very impressive."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why doesn't he take off his clothes, this is a handsome Heavenly Boundary man!" The female domain lord gritted her teeth, her focus was different from the others.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, a terrifying aura descended.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer wore a white robe with golden edges.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person, the surrounding domain lords' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"A formal member of the ever-changing school!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually from the ever-changing school!"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people showed envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>Only the female domain lord just wanted him to "take off".</p><p></p><p>The white-robed, golden-edged man descended, and Qin Twenty-seven and Qin Yuannv hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed, golden-edged man looked over the universe spirit sea, and when he saw the person enter the one thousandth layer, his eyes showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he at the seven hundredth layer?</p><p></p><p>How did he reach the one thousandth layer? This is a big shot! He was also a little frightened.</p><p></p><p>"This senior, with your clothes on, you have entered the one thousandth layer, your strength is extraordinary, and I specially come to invite you to join our ever-changing school!" Finally, this member of the ever-changing school issued the invitation, with an extremely humble attitude.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the domain lords all showed envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>If one could not enter the ever-changing school by entering the one thousandth layer with clothes on, then the other domain lords had no chance.</p><p></p><p>"The ever-changing school, what is that?" Qi Yuan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the people around were stunned and very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't know the ever-changing school?"</p><p></p><p>"Then why did he enter the universe spirit sea with his clothes on?"</p><p></p><p>"There is actually someone in this world who doesn't know the ever-changing school."</p><p></p><p>Many domain lords murmured.</p><p></p><p>The female domain lord was also dumbfounded, not expecting this to be the result.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you guys stop gossiping behind my back!"</p><p></p><p>"I wear clothes because I keep myself clean and uphold male virtues!"</p><p></p><p>"And not knowing the ever-changing school is very normal, my junior sister doesn't know, my daughter doesn't know, and many people don't know."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>These words left the domain lords present at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Uphold male virtues? And the domain lord who said there was someone in this world who didn't know the ever-changing school really wanted to explain, this person refers to the domain lords. But he didn't dare to explain, he was afraid of being beaten to death by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was a Heavenly Boundary expert.</p><p></p><p>In one universe, having ten of them is already considered a lot.</p><p></p><p>The member of the ever-changing school was also at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he offended this senior by not inviting him at the five hundredth layer? Or was it that his strength was too weak and he was not qualified to invite this senior? "The ever-changing school is..." He thought for a while, preparing to answer.</p><p></p><p>But he saw Qi Yuan shaking his head: "Let's not talk about it for now, my junior sister is calling me back home for dinner."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Jiang Ling Su didn't call him.</p><p></p><p>It was just time for dinner.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared at that moment, leaving a group of domain lords looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was still wearing the short skirt with a high waist.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the previous times when she dressed very tightly, today the azure ribbon around her chest had slid down a bit, revealing a large expanse of snow-white and smooth skin, with a deep cleavage.</p><p></p><p>No need to squeeze, the milky white skin dazzled the mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, sigh, you're almost an old maid now." The little girl sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although she was only six years old, she was a cultivator and knew a lot.</p><p></p><p>"You little girl, what do you know?" Jiang Ling Su blushed, her heart a little flustered, "This young lady is still young and beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>"Your niece and granddaughter can bully me, sister, what about you?" The little girl delivered a fatal blow, frantically stabbing.</p><p></p><p>"You're not eating today!" Jiang Ling Su was angry and chased her sister out.</p><p></p><p>She was so angry that her towering chest trembled.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the full table of dishes, she was a little lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother..."</p><p></p><p>She murmured, still a little flustered.</p><p></p><p>What is her relationship with Big Brother?</p><p></p><p>If it was before, she might have felt sweet.</p><p></p><p>But recently, with Ning Lao and Jin Siju, and Jinli moving to the Seven-Color Peak, occasionally she heard Jinli's reserved panting, Ning Lao's suppressed sweet talk, her heart was not at ease.</p><p></p><p>She and Big Brother have not yet broken through the last barrier.</p><p></p><p>She was very anxious and insecure.</p><p></p><p>Is it that Big Brother doesn't like her like this?</p><p></p><p>Or is it that she doesn't have Jinli's exquisite shoulders and delicate collarbones, or Ning Lao's snow-white skin, or...</p><p></p><p>But she is also very white.</p><p></p><p>Before, she didn't care about the last barrier.</p><p></p><p>But everyone else has broken through the last barrier, and she hasn't.</p><p></p><p>Comparing, her heart naturally became unbalanced, anxious and insecure, afraid that she is not the one Big Brother likes.</p><p></p><p>Setting aside these issues, she is also a person with desires.</p><p></p><p>This time, after a hundred years of separation, she has already been very bold, wearing very revealing clothes in front of Big Brother.</p><p></p><p>Covering her own chest, Jiang Ling Su's beautiful eyes were worried.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, sensing something, she hurriedly stood up: "Big Brother, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>She turned her back to Qi Yuan, gritted her teeth, and pulled the ribbon on her chest down a little further.</p><p></p><p>More of the round and full half-spheres burst out.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's eat, the dishes today are good." Qi Yuan glanced around, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you see who made them!" Jiang Ling Su waved her small pink fists, saying proudly.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, her fist was grasped by a large hand.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was stunned, even though she was already in the Purple Palace, her heartbeat was racing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"How about trying something different today?" Qi Yuan's voice was as clear as ever.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's head was a little dizzy, as if she realized something, but she still couldn't quite believe it: "What to try?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?" Qi Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's face suddenly turned red, her heart racing like a frightened deer: "Whatever Big Brother wants to try, I'll try."</p><p></p><p>She clutched the hem of her clothes, her beautiful eyes seeming to be about to drip blood.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a smile, his hand falling on the azure ribbon, gently tugging.</p><p></p><p>Snow-white, smooth, exposed to the air.</p><p></p><p>Towering, upright, impossible to grasp with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan leaned in, his lips and teeth gently caressing.</p><p></p><p>The girl's snow-white breasts were not as soft and plump as a mature woman's, but upright and tender, crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's delicate body trembled, not daring to move at all.</p><p></p><p>The partially unbuttoned long skirt fell to the ground, still showing a voluptuous and curvaceous figure.</p><p></p><p>The full parts were full, the sparse parts were sparse. </p><p></p><p>The slender waist, contrasting with the towering fullness above and the plump below, was extremely sexy.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's body twisted, her sexy waist curves were extremely beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Everything flowed naturally.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm... Big Brother..." Jiang Ling Su half-sat on the table, her face flushed, fine beads of sweat on her snow-white back, she didn't dare to lean back for fear of knocking over the vase on the table.</p><p></p><p>She was no longer the previous practice-stage girl, even when sweating, she didn't have the same odor as before.</p><p></p><p>The girl's thoughts were very complicated, wanting Big Brother to get closer, but her hands unconsciously pushed outward, as if she couldn't quite bear it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the girl's whole body went limp like mud, panting heavily, her hands supporting the snow-white: "If Big Brother wants to, ..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I'm not done eating yet!" Qi Yuan firmly refused, starting to savor from the connection between the lower half-sphere and the abdomen.</p><p></p><p>There are so many dishes on the table, it would be a waste not to savor them properly. It's just that this dish is so big and round.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

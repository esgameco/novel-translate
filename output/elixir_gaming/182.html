        <h1>Chapter 182</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The elderly man with graying hair revealed a shocked expression in his eyes, followed by fear.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected his companion to be so bold as to directly threaten with words in a moment of madness. </p><p></p><p>He was even more surprised that the ancient god before them had directly killed his companion.</p><p></p><p>This was severing ties with the Ancient God Alliance!</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>"What? Do you want to observe divine law like him?" Qi Yuan looked at the gray-haired elder with an amused expression.</p><p></p><p>The elder looked at his companion's corpse on the ground and said resignedly: "The fault was his, he deserved death. But Your Honor's actions have severed ties with the Ancient God Alliance. In the future... you will not be able to join the Alliance."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the elder had hoped that ancient gods like Origin Venerable would join the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Now with the evil gods pressing in step by step, the ancient gods were already in decline.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even so, the ancient gods were still fighting for power and unable to truly unite.</p><p></p><p>He had always admired gods like Origin Venerable who dared to take action against the evil gods, and wanted to truly absorb them into the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Within the Alliance, there were still quite a few gods who wanted to do real work.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested in joining any Ancient God Alliance," said Qi Yuan, looking up at the sky. </p><p></p><p>Far to the north, an unknown true god had just fallen.</p><p></p><p>"Five towns in Flying Desolation City are completely under the rule of evil gods. Those five evil gods are all purple mansion late stage or perfected divine beings. Origin Venerable must be careful," the gray-haired elder warned kindly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lowered his head. </p><p></p><p>He was also aware of this information.</p><p></p><p>The power levels in this world seemed a bit high, and these new gods were also very strong.</p><p></p><p>For him now, sweeping through these five towns of evil gods would indeed be somewhat troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Your Honor should be especially wary of the evil god in Fierce Wind Town. He is no ordinary purple mansion perfected being!"</p><p></p><p>"Is he Wang Wei's purple mansion perfected?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The gray-haired elder was stunned, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning. He could only continue: "He has already condensed half a divine aperture!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between yin spirits and purple mansion beings was that yin spirits wielded divine power.</p><p></p><p>The serval with half a divine aperture could already be considered a demigod.</p><p></p><p>He was already able to wield divine power.</p><p></p><p>"So strong?" Qi Yuan's eyes revealed an astonished look.</p><p></p><p>He glanced up at his own stellar golden core, feeling a bit more secure.</p><p></p><p>"Without becoming a true god, it's impossible to defeat him!" said the gray-haired elder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Now relying on his origin divine ability, he could easily kill ordinary late stage purple mansion beings.</p><p></p><p>But... condensing half a divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>The origin divine ability would be almost ineffective.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer instantly kill him like he had dealt with other ancient gods before.</p><p></p><p>Unless he also advanced to purple mansion and reached level 60, but he was only in his 30s now.</p><p></p><p>Only by summoning the stellar golden core could he easily kill instantly.</p><p></p><p>But in this game, Qi Yuan still wanted to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Before figuring out this game, he didn't want to casually summon his stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any yang spirits among the evil gods?" Qi Yuan asked at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Yang spirits? You mean above true gods?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times during the Great Flood War, there was one being above true god who participated in battle among the new gods." Mentioning this, the gray-haired elder's face was full of sighs. "It was precisely because that being above true god participated that the Mortal Heart Realm was greatly defeated."</p><p></p><p>"What happened to that being above true god?"</p><p></p><p>"Unknown." The gray-haired elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned in thought upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had already learned about the Great Flood War through the chat group he entered during contemplation.</p><p></p><p>That was the war when evil gods invaded the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gods as generals, purple mansion beings as soldiers, killing until heaven collapsed and earth split.</p><p></p><p>Nearly 90% of the true gods in the Mortal Heart Realm perished.</p><p></p><p>This was the war that broke the backbone of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the world greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>Without special treasures, those at the peak of purple mansion could no longer step into true godhood.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan felt that to deal with the serval, there was no need to summon the stellar golden core or Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>There was no virtual realm here, yin spirits fought directly in the physical realm.</p><p></p><p>Summoning would be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village was still too weak now.</p><p></p><p>He should now emulate the ancients - store up grain in large quantities and slowly proclaim himself king.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still had many methods to observe divine law.</p><p></p><p>"You may go," Qi Yuan did not kill this elder.</p><p></p><p>He always distinguished clearly between gratitude and grudges.</p><p></p><p>This gray-haired elder had not offended him, so he would not kill him.</p><p></p><p>He was not the kind of compatriot who would kill someone's entire family at the drop of a hat!</p><p></p><p>After the gray-haired elder left, Qingshui Village was especially busy in the following days.</p><p></p><p>More and more people came to the village suffering from the plague, but fortunately under Little Snow's leadership, the earth gods worked tirelessly, and the plague slowly improved.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Qi Yuan was continuing to write the "Qi Yuan Sutra" in the temple when suddenly he heard a girl sobbing.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at the maid Little Snow in the distance with a puzzled expression: "What's wrong, did someone bully you?"</p><p></p><p>The maid Little Snow's eyes were red. Seeing Qi Yuan, she rubbed her eyes and quickly said: "No, I just thought of my dead parents."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?" Qi Yuan glanced at the maid Little Snow.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, it's fine, I'll keep Little Snow company," said Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she grabbed Little Snow and left.</p><p></p><p>When the two were far from the temple, the maid Little Snow's eyes were red: "Miss I'm sorry, I couldn't hold back. The people of Jinshi Town... are too miserable!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the tragic state of Jinshi Town, Little Snow's eyes were full of grief.</p><p></p><p>To find out the source of the plague, she had secretly snuck into Jinshi Town herself, but the scene she saw was horrific beyond words.</p><p></p><p>When she first came to Qingshui Village, she had passed through Jinshi Town.</p><p></p><p>Jinshi Town was still a relatively peaceful and tranquil small town then.</p><p></p><p>Now... corpses lay on the ground with no one to collect them.</p><p></p><p>Every household's doors were tightly shut, as if waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>It had become a town that was like hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>"With godfather just starting out and lacking manpower, we can't help Jinshi Town now." Qi Qi's eyes held deep worry.</p><p></p><p>The plague in Jinshi Town was clearly man-made.</p><p></p><p>So... who did it?</p><p></p><p>Obviously, it was those evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village's strength was very powerful now, but still unable to clash with the remaining five towns.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was afraid the maid Little Snow would leak information about Jinshi Town, causing unnecessary trouble for her godfather.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now, Qingshui Village should not lightly take up arms.</p><p></p><p>It needs to develop slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I understand. I won't tell the master about this matter."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan in the temple opened his eyes: "How many evil god powers?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>In Jinshi Town, five new gods gathered.</p><p></p><p>Shilang had a smug smile in his eyes as he looked at the miserable scene before him, very satisfied with his handiwork.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shilang's methods are extraordinary. When the Plague Lord descends, there will surely be great rewards. Perhaps Brother Shilang can also take a leap and become a true god!" A new god in yellow robes spoke up, his words full of flattery.</p><p></p><p>The slender woman beside him parted her red lips: "I heard that Qingshui Village has a way to cure the plague. I wonder how Brother Shilang will deal with it? When will we go kill them?"</p><p></p><p>"Tao'an, you only know about fighting and killing. Brother Shilang is tolerating Qingshui Village simply because it's not good to deal with those new village gods." An old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Shilang was different from these late Purple Palace stage divine beings. Shilang had already condensed half a divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>In the new god camp, Shilang already had quite a few followers.</p><p></p><p>However, those village gods were still there, and he couldn't send his followers over.</p><p></p><p>That's why he tolerated Qingshui Village's rampant killing.</p><p></p><p>These new gods also knew Shilang's thoughts, which is why they hadn't made a move against Qi Yuan, just to give Shilang face.</p><p></p><p>"Let him be arrogant for a while. When Brother Shilang makes his move, Qingshui Village will be destroyed in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"Mourning, playing the suona, having feasts... It's become a bit of a circus."</p><p></p><p>"Given his courage, he really seems to dare to make a move against us."</p><p></p><p>"Laughable. We haven't made our move yet. Does he really think he's some divine being?"</p><p></p><p>The new gods present all spoke mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shilang smiled without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he said, "Don't miss tomorrow evening's children's banquet."</p><p></p><p>"How could we miss it when Brother Shilang invites us?"</p><p></p><p>"We must go, we must!"</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've tasted such delicacies."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Village, inside the temple.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Xu Youping and said casually, "Tell Lord Ruoyu, thank him for his kindness. I'll remember it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Youping breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He had come on Lord Ruoyu's orders to remind the Origin Lord to keep a low profile recently, and to leave Qingshui Village if possible.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that this deity of Qingshui Village would be as stubborn as the legends said, but unexpectedly today he was so easy to talk to, not refuting anything.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, do you know the source of the plague in Jinshi Town?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping hesitated for a moment, then answered, "It should be related to the newly received god. That new god is called Taipest.</p><p></p><p>When He descends, the stronger the plague in the area, the faster His divine power recovers.</p><p></p><p>So, these plagues should be spread by the five town evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Origin Lord, you should just pretend you don't know about this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Xu Youping leave the temple.</p><p></p><p>In the empty temple, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Xiao Jia's petite figure appeared, quietly leaning on Qi Yuan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia, which deity do you think I should visualize with these evil god powers?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes seeming to say, it's all up to you.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Xiao Jia's waist and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The rain had cleared, but the plague continued.</p><p></p><p>It had only been half an hour since the maid Xiao Xue had been sobbing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness entered the chat group again.</p><p></p><p>The plague was getting worse, and it seemed the Earth God alone couldn't cure it completely.</p><p></p><p>He thought about visualizing another deity.</p><p></p><p>According to the current evil god power, it should be enough.</p><p></p><p>At this time in the chat group, there was a joyous atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what a young Heavenly Emperor is?" The group owner Dong Jianghe was again giving pointers in the group. "I just visualized another rare three-star! To be honest, I don't know where my limit is.</p><p></p><p>When my memory fully recovers, I'm afraid of myself!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop boasting, you're not even a hair of the Origin Lord!" The personality of the Divine Cat Lord was also quite lively.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Lord is here. You're not planning to visualize a new god again, are you?" Dong Jianghe asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"There's a serious plague in my domain recently..." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"In that area?" Hearing this, Dong Jianghe felt relieved. It seemed the level visualized shouldn't be high, so he could continue his bragging rights for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the usually sleeping and steady Black Dragon Lord appeared in the group: "The Heavenly Treasure Lord hasn't appeared for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, now that you mention it, it has been a while. Last time he said he wanted to give the Origin Lord a treasure that could break through to true godhood."</p><p></p><p>"I still wanted to take him as my adoptive father."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Divine Cat Lord suddenly asked: "Origin Lord, a few days ago, did you feel any true gods fighting in the north of your territory?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately recalled the pillar of light that pierced the sky a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." He answered.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence in the group. The Black Dragon Lord said: "Origin Lord, the battle you saw back then was probably the Heavenly Treasure Lord fighting with evil gods. Unfortunately."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the group became somber.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Treasure Lord, rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Treasure Lord, rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>"Origin Lord, the northern lands are fallen territory. You should leave if you need to.</p><p></p><p>Last time when the Heavenly Treasure Lord wanted to give you the supreme treasure, it was probably because he saw he was in a desperate situation and didn't want the treasure to go to waste, so he gave it to you."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Treasure Lord knew early on that new gods would move against him. With his strength... he could have left." A group member sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone present understood that the Heavenly Treasure Lord didn't leave because he couldn't abandon his subjects.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, a good friend of the Heavenly Treasure Lord defected to the new gods and is now in Lu Country?</p><p></p><p>He should have seen the Heavenly Treasure Lord?" Qi Yuan murmured questioningly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Origin Lord, why are you asking about this?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just asking."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he plunged headfirst into the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>The vast visualization mountain came into view, and Qi Yuan looked at the evil god power in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Treat the plague?"</p><p></p><p>"Wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"Killing those who spread the plague is the right solution!"</p><p></p><p>He decided to change the deity he was visualizing.</p><p></p><p>Many people were trying to persuade him, stop him. If he really backed down, would he still be Qi Yuan? (End of chapter)</p>

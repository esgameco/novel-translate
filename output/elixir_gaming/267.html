        <h1>Chapter 267</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman looked at the sky and suddenly froze: "Did the sun just flicker?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor also felt puzzled. </p><p></p><p>Weren't the two suns in the sky the golden core of the Origin Venerable?</p><p></p><p>The sun flickered but didn't fall towards the Azure Waves Realm, unlike last time.</p><p></p><p>Where did this stellar golden core... fall to?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure what's going on either," the Great Sun Flame Emperor said honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you concerned about the sun in the sky?" Wind Lord spoke up at this point, seeming displeased.</p><p></p><p>Right now, the Blood-Robed Sword God was engaged in fierce battle with the Lei Family Four Generals in the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet his grandson was preoccupied with whether the sun in the sky flickered or not.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well tell his grandfather that the sun in the sky was the Blood-Robed Sword God's golden core, could he?</p><p></p><p>Even if he said it, probably no one would believe him.</p><p></p><p>Besides, it was better not to reveal the Origin Venerable's true strength.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder in the distance had a complex look in his eyes: "The battle... should be decided soon, and our fate will be sealed as well."</p><p></p><p>Right now, he really wanted to take the jade slip and run.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was a divine technique, one that could make an old tree like him bloom again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many gazes turned towards the location of the Dao-Seeking Palace, waiting for the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a ripple in space, and all the great cultivators looked over.</p><p></p><p>They saw a rift appear in the sky, and a handsome man in a blood-red robe emerged, his eyes filled with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the figure of that man, almost everyone's gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>"It's him!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God has come out!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? The Lei Family Four Generals were able to destroy the Blazing Flame Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>All the Yin Gods were shaken.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>Each of the Lei Family Four Generals was a Step 6 Heaven Treader.</p><p></p><p>For the Blood-Robed Sword God to defeat them... this was beyond their imagination.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder also narrowed his eyes, then suddenly chuckled: "Good thing this old man didn't run."</p><p></p><p>A thousand miles away, curiosity also appeared in the eyes of the Jasmine Venerable: "How did he win?"</p><p></p><p>From within an ancient mirror, a voice came from a silhouette: "He ended the battle in nearly 500 breaths. His strength is only so-so."</p><p></p><p>If he were a Mythical being, he could have ended the battle in less than 30 breaths.</p><p></p><p>He had a better grasp of the Blood-Robed Sword God's true strength now.</p><p></p><p>"However..." the silhouette in the ancient mirror changed his tone, "his body... is very tempting. I also want to obtain his secrets."</p><p></p><p>"When will Master obtain his corpse? Playing with him might be quite interesting for Master." Jasmine Venerable licked her lips with her fragrant tongue, exuding an alluring aura.</p><p></p><p>Living in such an environment, Jasmine Venerable's personality had long since become twisted.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a few days..." the silhouette in the ancient mirror murmured.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Venerable's eyes were full of anticipation: "The Blood-Robed Sword God's body and Master's soul, what extreme pleasure that would be!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan was unaware of her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could punch people through internet cables, but he wasn't omniscient. Otherwise, if he knew Jasmine Venerable's thoughts, he would definitely annihilate this lowly woman.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the various people from the Dao-Seeking Palace and said softly: "The Lei Family Four Generals have been dealt with. Martial Lord Venerable, please help me contact the other parts of the Dao-Seeking Palace and tell them... my Original God Sharing Association wants to unite the heroes of the world, collect all the techniques under heaven, eradicate the Dark Sun, and overthrow the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Collecting techniques was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>Even fly meat was meat, and Qi Yuan wouldn't be picky.</p><p></p><p>Excitement appeared in Martial Lord Venerable's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The outcome of this battle was not beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God already had strength comparable to a Mythical being, so wasn't defeating the Lei Family Four Generals a piece of cake? "Alright!" Martial Lord Venerable responded.</p><p></p><p>With the Blood-Robed Sword God's achievements, the Dao-Seeking Palace might change their minds and support the Original God Sharing Association.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder now stood to the side with Wind Lord and the others, his thoughts active.</p><p></p><p>The way they looked at Qi Yuan was also different from before.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan looked towards the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman, the Great Sun Flame Emperor and the others, and couldn't help but sigh: "I've discovered that not only does the atmosphere in the Azure Waves Realm need to be rectified, but the atmosphere in the Upper Realm also needs to be rectified."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" The Great Sun Flame Emperor was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder was also puzzled. Upper Realm? For people in the Azure Waves Realm, the Upper Realm was just a legend.</p><p></p><p>No Yin God from the Azure Waves Realm had ever ascended to the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>God-No-God nodded seriously at this point and said: "The atmosphere in the Upper Realm is indeed not good. Cultivators there are too aggressive. Sometimes I just casually say something, and people want to fight me to the death."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were confused, especially the Seven Injuries Elder, who looked at God-No-God with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment: "It seems our views are somewhat similar. By the way, what did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"A few years ago, my senior brother's dao partner gave birth to a child. I just said, 'Your son doesn't look like you, he looks a bit like me,' and then... sigh." God-No-God sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others were speechless.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Seven Injuries Elder commented: "You deserved to be beaten."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered seriously, and after a long time said: "The aggression is indeed a bit much, but he also trusted his dao partner too little. By the way, how's your relationship with his dao partner?"</p><p></p><p>"Very good, she's my childhood sweetheart. Otherwise, how could I have been by her side when she gave birth?" God-No-God answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer a matter of trust or distrust.</p><p></p><p>People with low EQ... should just stay mute!</p><p></p><p>Setting aside the facts of what God-No-God said, the aggression in the Upper Realm was still severe.</p><p></p><p>"If I go to the Upper Realm, I must rectify its atmosphere to some extent," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you can't go to the Upper Realm. Why not pass on your dao lineage to me? I, God-No-God, will definitely ascend to the Upper Realm and carry on your will to rectify its atmosphere," God-No-God said passionately, his face full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Qi Yuan was angry.</p><p></p><p>A dao technique fell on God-No-God's mouth, and he suddenly couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt much calmer.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the old men all liked to cover mouths, it felt so good to cover mouths.</p><p></p><p>"Who says I can't rectify the Upper Realm's atmosphere if I can't go there? A disciple of the Supreme Radiance Palace was babbling today, and what happened? Wasn't he still killed by my two golden cores!" Qi Yuan furiously berated God-No-God.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Venerable's eyes widened: "Killed by golden cores?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered that during the battle earlier, the star in the sky had flickered.</p><p></p><p>So... this was the Origin Venerable using golden cores to kill people.</p><p></p><p>"Just now?" The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman looked up at the sky. "You can hit the Upper Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wind Lord and the Seven Injuries Elder were completely baffled, having no idea what they were talking about.</p><p></p><p>"My golden cores illuminate all heavens, of course they can hit the Upper Realm," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman was speechless.</p><p></p><p>She had heard her grandfather say that illuminating all heavens was just illumination.</p><p></p><p>How could one take out stars and casually hit people with them?</p><p></p><p>"Give me coordinates, and I can punch people through internet cables."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at everyone present and slowly said: "In three days, I will go to the Ghostly Heaven Domain and personally destroy the Dark Sun!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan announced another terrifying piece of news.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder's face changed drastically: "Fellow Daoist wants to</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Going to Dark Sun... that won't do, there must be god-level powerhouses in Dark Sun!"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if the Blood-Robed Sword God wiped out the Lei family's four generals, he would get carried away. </p><p></p><p>So he quickly spoke about how powerful Dark Sun was.</p><p></p><p>"That's exactly why I said three days later," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>For him, the most important thing right now was to complete Shen Wushen's task.</p><p></p><p>To him, the cultivation methods of the upper realm were the most enticing.</p><p></p><p>Secondly were the cultivation methods of Dark Sun and other places in the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He was going to continue completing Shen Wushen's task.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, all the Yin Gods in Phoenix Sky Domain were quite embarrassed. </p><p></p><p>First, the Blood-Robed Sword God easily wiped out the Lei family's four generals, which was beyond their expectations. Second, divine methods appeared in the Original God Sharing Association, which made these Yin Gods very tempted.</p><p></p><p>Those were divine methods, legendary divine methods!</p><p></p><p>Even as Yin Gods, if they obtained a divine method for reference, they could definitely quickly increase their own strength.</p><p></p><p>When facing great calamities, they would also have more means of self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the divine methods are too expensive, we simply can't afford to exchange for them!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget exchanging, we don't even have jade slips!"</p><p></p><p>"I regret not keeping the jade slips instead of returning them to the Original God Sharing Association!"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods were full of regret.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God is about to set off to destroy Dark Sun, what do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods now only dared to discuss in hushed tones in private, no one dared to face the Blood-Robed Sword God directly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Blood-Robed Sword God was a terrifying powerhouse who could kill the Lei family's four generals. He killed people like scything weeds, so they simply didn't dare to see the Blood-Robed Sword God again.</p><p></p><p>"If the Blood-Robed Sword God dies in Dark Sun... that would be great," one Yin God said darkly.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, they would only need to destroy the Original God Sharing Association to obtain the divine methods within.</p><p></p><p>Many Yin Gods had different thoughts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood-Robed Sword God was an ordinary Yin God, they might have already ganged up to attack him and seize the divine methods.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood-Robed Sword God's strength was simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>A day passed, and the Seeking Dao Palace was as usual.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was dejected, still gagged.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun Dazun went to contact various Seeking Dao Palaces.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder was constantly in contact with some old friends, raising funds for cultivation methods and exchanging for divine methods.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Long Can's figure appeared again. He looked at the Seven Injuries Elder with a complex expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard about the Phoenix Palace Appointment?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." The Seven Injuries Elder narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood-Robed Sword God defeated the Lei family's four generals, undercurrents surged in Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun suddenly invited all the Yin Gods to gather at Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>According to the information the Seven Injuries Elder received, these people seemed to be preparing to unite and "force" the Blood-Robed Sword God to hand over the divine methods.</p><p></p><p>"They're quite bold. I'm very curious who gave them the courage," the Seven Injuries Elder answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Gods on the Original God Sharing Association's side naturally wouldn't attend the Phoenix Palace Appointment.</p><p></p><p>"I can't be bothered to attend this gathering either," Long Can said.</p><p></p><p>Being in Phoenix Sky Domain, he had also received an invitation.</p><p></p><p>However, his current idea was to accumulate points with the Seven Injuries Elder to exchange for that divine method.</p><p></p><p>As for the Phoenix Palace matter, he couldn't be bothered to get involved.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that Jasmine Dazun is willing to bring out divine treasures, and integrate with other Yin Gods to pay a huge price to exchange for divine methods," the Seven Injuries Elder muttered, thinking of something, but didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Three days quickly passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched his body. All the tasks Shen Wushen had given him had been resolved.</p><p></p><p>After about a few hundred breaths of time, Shen Wushen appeared beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"All tasks completed, hurry back to the upper realm to help me exchange for a divine method," Qi Yuan said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>For him, obtaining a divine method was equivalent to being able to condense at least three Stellar Golden Core pills.</p><p></p><p>The gains from one divine method advancing the "Golden Core Chapter of the Qi Yuan Scripture" were at least three Stellar Golden Core pills.</p><p></p><p>So to say, he wasn't searching for cultivation methods, he was condensing Golden Core pills.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you saying anything, don't you want to trade with me anymore?" Qi Yuan asked puzzled, "I even took time to improve your cultivation method a tiny bit."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh... I forgot you can't speak."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had gagged Shen Wushen for three days in one go.</p><p></p><p>With one of his techniques, Shen Wushen could finally speak.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, I'm about to return to the upper realm. You're going to Dark Sun headquarters with life and death uncertain, pass on the cultivation methods to me..." Shen Wushen had been gagged for so long, now that he could speak, he was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Qi Yuan hurriedly gagged Shen Wushen again.</p><p></p><p>It was quite ridiculous that this Shen Wushen had managed to live until now.</p><p></p><p>"This technique will only last three days, it will be lifted after three days. The jade slips are all here, hurry back to the upper realm!" Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to say more to Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen took the jade slips, looking at Qi Yuan with words unsaid, his heart full of grief.</p><p></p><p>If this Qi Yuan died in Dark Sun, such a legacy being cut off would truly be heartbreaking.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan wouldn't let him speak, so he was helpless. He could only hope that Qi Yuan would survive this Dark Sun trip. It wouldn't be too late to die the next time they met.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen left.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sky: "Hmm, it's time to go take a look at Dark Sun."</p><p></p><p>But just then, a message came from the Seven Injuries Elder.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, Jasmine Dazun is holding the Phoenix Palace Appointment at Phoenix Palace today, inviting you to attend! Right now, Jasmine Dazun is waiting at Seeking Dao Palace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned, his face showing delight: "Is she preparing to confess to me?"</p><p></p><p>"...Fellow Daoist, be careful, there may be a trap," the Seven Injuries Elder said honestly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "What nonsense are you talking about, my left eyebrow has been twitching, this means something very auspicious is about to happen.</p><p></p><p>This indicates she's preparing to confess to me, to give me the divine treasures.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, it seems I misunderstood her, she's a good woman."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Left eye twitching means wealth, right eye twitching means disaster.</p><p></p><p>Going to Phoenix Palace, his left eye kept twitching.</p><p></p><p>Wealth coming to him, wasn't that the divine treasures? How could he obtain the divine treasures?</p><p></p><p>Very simple, Jasmine Dazun giving them to him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly figured out the key points.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, if Jasmine Dazun confesses to me, should I accept?" Qi Yuan asked the Seven Injuries Elder.</p><p></p><p>He was very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to accept.</p><p></p><p>But well, he seemed to have been urging Jasmine Dazun to confess to him for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this like a playboy, stringing Jasmine Dazun along?</p><p></p><p>The Seven Injuries Elder was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a coquettish voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Is Fellow Daoist Blood-Robed Sword God free? This humble one wishes to invite Fellow Daoist to Phoenix Palace for a chat."</p><p></p><p>Jasmine Dazun stood in front of the palace, wearing a golden gauze skirt. Her slender waist was covered in sheer gauze, the skin of her lower abdomen was white with a rosy tinge, imprinted with various strange demonic patterns. Above her navel was adorned with decorations, looking quite alluring.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure flashed, appearing in front of Jasmine Dazun: "Are you finally going to give me the divine treasures?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

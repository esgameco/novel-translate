        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The game interface is gone?</p><p></p><p>A sense of alert flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly went into Tian Jue, but he found that he couldn't return to Tian Jue.</p><p></p><p>"So, once I'm out of the forbidden land and the absolute land, I no longer have the game interface?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean I'm no different from the NPCs?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He soon accepted this reality.</p><p></p><p>"Without the game interface, I can still destroy the evil demons from the outside world!" Qi Yuan remembered the words of a certain senior and no longer thought about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"The only regret is that I can no longer contact Jinli."</p><p></p><p>"I hope there won't be any clich√©d mistaken identity scenes, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had heard many stories about blind dates and mistaken identities.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaojia." Qi Yuan called softly while holding Xiaojia.</p><p></p><p>Xiaojia obediently shrank and finally turned into a bridal dress tattoo on Qi Yuan's chest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also put on the faceless mask he obtained from the Ugly Clothes Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Now he, in his black blood armor and wearing the mask, looked like a demonic imperial guard in the palace.</p><p></p><p>His figure also shrank at this moment, turning into the appearance of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"Now I look like a big villain."</p><p></p><p>The faceless mask can temporarily block the perception of the evil demons from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The predecessor of the Ugly Clothes Demon King was a talented genius.</p><p></p><p>Such a talented young man was disliked by the evil demons from the outside world. The blood and flesh hook fell from the sky, extracting his blood and flesh, leaving only a human skin.</p><p></p><p>The Ugly Clothes Demon King had the faceless mask, so he could isolate the perception of the evil demons from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he stepped into the clothes and hat forbidden area polluted by the evil demons from the outside world, and rashly broke through into the celestial domain, and his blood and flesh were extracted by the blood and flesh hook.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan is now a 99-level expert, and when he walks in the human world, he will be noticed by the evil demons from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>So he put on the faceless mask on his face.</p><p></p><p>He held the big treasure sword and looked up towards the southeast.</p><p></p><p>A huge ancient Qi Chun tree came into view.</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of miles away, oh, it's a pity that there is no spirit boat here, and I can't make one either. It's useless, so I can only go on foot."</p><p></p><p>The game world and the real world are two different worlds.</p><p></p><p>In the game world, the martial dao is deified.</p><p></p><p>In the real world of the Aolan Realm, it is the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods in the game world, even if cultivated, will not become resources.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in the real world, they cannot be cultivated, nor can they be referenced to supplement the Qi Yuan Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The first time Qi Yuan tried to reference the cultivation methods in the game world, he scared himself.</p><p></p><p>He was very doubtful at the time, wondering if he had a problem with his brain and had a mental illness, actually trying to cultivate the cultivation methods in the game.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, to the ancient Qi Chun tree, the Moon Imperial Dynasty, to meet!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned into a blood-red afterimage and headed towards the ancient Qi Chun tree.</p><p></p><p>But after a while, Qi Yuan suddenly fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the desert, there were some human corpses hanging on the stumps of the withered trees, about fifteen in number, looking like dried corpses under the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>The bodies were all small, seemingly children.</p><p></p><p>Vultures were tearing at the flesh, just like rotten meat in a garbage dump.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's appearance, the vultures flapped their wings and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these "tender", thin, and dried corpses. According to his estimate, the older ones might be around eleven or twelve years old, and the younger ones were probably three-month-old infants, and there were many of them.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they were cruelly killed and exposed in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>He glanced up at the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's so hot, it's not good to be exposed like this."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Qi Yuan's hand, all the wooden stakes sank and were buried in the sand.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary mortals, the cause and effect are all gone after death.</p><p></p><p>"This world is not as beautiful as Jinli said."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'm just standing in the dark for now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, and flew up into the sky again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he flew very high, high above, as if not to be disturbed by the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>There are too many things in the world, right and wrong are hard to distinguish, or perhaps, what is right, what is wrong?...</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It's about a few hundred miles away from the ancient Qi Chun tree.</p><p></p><p>Below is a town, and Qi Yuan stopped there.</p><p></p><p>He came to this town for two things.</p><p></p><p>The first is to ask for directions and inquire about the location of the Moon Imperial Dynasty; the second is to rest well, have a meal, and simply change clothes.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city wall, there was a long queue.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood at the end of the queue.</p><p></p><p>In front of Qi Yuan was a fat and chubby man.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards the city, which was written as Kunwu City in large characters.</p><p></p><p>There were hundreds of people queuing outside the city.</p><p></p><p>The sun was high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The fat man in front wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his attire, he was either rich or noble.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood quietly, his gaze turning to the other side of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>There, there was another queue entrance.</p><p></p><p>That entrance was different from the one Qi Yuan was currently in, with fewer people, which could be considered a privileged entrance.</p><p></p><p>But this privilege was not what Qi Yuan thought it was, it was not the privilege of the nobility.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was... all elderly people over the age of fifty or sixty.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city gate, they didn't need to queue, they could enter directly.</p><p></p><p>"Respecting the elderly and loving the young, the people of Kunwu City are really virtuous," Qi Yuan couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the fat man in front of Qi Yuan heard this and turned around: "Friend, you don't seem to be a local, right?"</p><p></p><p>He turned around and saw Qi Yuan's mask, his eyes narrowed, as if he was startled, but he soon recovered: "Your previous words were only half right."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Which half?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The part about respecting the elderly is right, but the part about loving the young is wrong," the fat man said. "In this Kunwu City, as long as you are over fifty years old, you don't need to work, and you can get the necessities of life.</p><p></p><p>If you are sick, the doctors in the medical hall will make house calls and won't charge a penny; if..."</p><p></p><p>The fat man's eyes revealed a lecherous smile.</p><p></p><p>"The girls in the brothel will also come to your door, and they won't charge a penny either.</p><p></p><p>All the living expenses of these old people are covered by the government."</p><p></p><p>"That good?" Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>This can be considered a great harmonious society, right? And after the age of fifty, you don't have to do any work and can enjoy the good life.</p><p></p><p>This sounds even better than on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, there are still a lot of people who haven't retired even at the age of sixty, and some people don't even have a retirement pension, just barely surviving in their old age, and when they get sick, it's the end.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was right, this world is indeed beautiful, and Qi Yuan has also discovered a good point.</p><p></p><p>The old people enjoying their twilight years is a pretty good social system.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I'm only thirty-five this year, I have to wait fifteen more years, and I don't know if I can even live that long," the fat man sighed, his tone gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"What was the half I was wrong about?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The half that was wrong is..." the fat man lowered his voice, "loving the young."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>"Not only do they not love the young, but anyone under the age of fifty is also unloved," the fat man said in a neurotic tone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The fat man continued, "In Kunwu City, age is the greatest power.</p><p></p><p>As long as you are over fifty years old, you can enjoy all the privileges.</p><p></p><p>But if you are under fifty, hehe."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the fat man paused and let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Those who live, are even worse than wild beasts."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Qi Yuan's gaze swept over the people in the queue in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He noticed a woman holding a child, and the woman's expression was numb. The child in her arms had already lost its breath and was a cold corpse.</p><p></p><p>"For example, the young, if they show any disrespect to their parents, especially those over fifty, do you know the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>"What consequences?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>It is generally not right for children to be disrespectful to their parents.</p><p></p><p>"They will die!" the fat man said grimly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was shocked when he heard this: "Kunwu City is so chaotic, are all the residents here mentally ill?"</p><p></p><p>He felt that he might need to change to another city to ask for directions.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he didn't give way to the elderly, he might be killed directly. "Do you see the woman in front?" the fat man pointed to the woman holding the child.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"The child she's holding died yesterday," the fat man said, with a look of regret on his face. "Her child was weaned late, and accidentally bit her while drinking milk at night.</p><p></p><p>She mentioned this to some other women as casual conversation.</p><p></p><p>Those women gossiped about it, and the news reached the government.</p><p></p><p>Her child... was executed for not respecting filial piety!</p><p></p><p>Now she can still hold the body of her child, but in a while, even the body will be gone."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the woman, and she was tightly hugging the child, her expression numb.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young man, since you are not yet fifty years old, you should be more low-key in the city, especially when encountering the elderly, you should show them respect," the fat man reminded him cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I need to leave this place," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This Kunwu City was different from Jinli's description.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he got lost and went to the wrong place?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the game interface was gone, and he couldn't contact Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the fat man smiled wryly, "Where can you go? The surrounding hundred cities are all like this."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, hearing this, showed a puzzled expression: "If it were just one city, I could still understand the forceful suppression. But if it's a hundred cities, doesn't anyone resist?"</p><p></p><p>The young and middle-aged were the mainstay of this world. But now, the young and middle-aged in this city were all suppressed, which sounded particularly unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"Resist?" The fat man smiled bitterly, "When the Black-Robed Guards appear, even the strongest warriors have to die. What can we resist with? Although we live cautiously, at least we have the hope of living to fifty, and that's worth it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan made a mental note of the name "Black-Robed Guards" upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The queue in front was moving forward, and more people were coming from behind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crowd, the fat man didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something: "I've been killing for hundreds of years at the Ascension Platform, I'm the oldest elder, I'm the top-tier privileged class!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately found a reason to convince himself.</p><p></p><p>"Screw the queue!" </p><p></p><p>He was ready to take the elders-only passage.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, Qi Yuan rejected the idea.</p><p></p><p>"I look too young, they definitely won't believe me."</p><p></p><p>"I'm from the Divine Realm, screw the queue!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly snuck into the city without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>After entering the city, Qi Yuan wore a mask and walked among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>On the street, peddlers were hawking their wares, various finished medicinal materials, and some pastries.</p><p></p><p>In the restaurants, the steaming baskets were emitting a hazy white mist, and Qi Yuan could smell the heavy aroma of old white noodles from afar.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, and the peddlers, attendants, and shop managers on the street were all young people, without a single elderly person.</p><p></p><p>The people strolling on the street were mostly old men. Many white-haired old men were being supported by their young sons, who looked at them with filial piety.</p><p></p><p>It was a true feeling of parental love and filial piety.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, Qi Yuan felt a sense of distortion.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dwell on it further and headed straight for the restaurant, ordered a meal, and changed into a new set of clothes.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan left the restaurant, he sighed, "Ah, I'm still too thin-skinned. Although I'm old enough, I still paid for the meal instead of freeloading."</p><p></p><p>"The food here doesn't taste good, I wonder how Jinli's cooking is."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Jinli's crispy sweet duck tastes, it must be delicious."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I haven't sent her a message in so long, she won't think I'm not coming, will she!"</p><p></p><p>"I need to hurry and find out the location of the Seven-Month Town in the Moon Emperor Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, if I see her later and we hit it off, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that if two people who had been chatting online for a long time and got along well finally met in person, and their looks weren't too bad and they didn't have any obvious flaws, there was a high probability that they would take a liking to each other.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even seen her yet, what am I thinking about!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left the restaurant and went to a shop called Kunwu Windvoice.</p><p></p><p>This was the shop the waiter had told him about when he was eating at the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>It was a shop that sold information and had a lot of influence in Kunwu City.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, esteemed guest, please come in," a melodious voice came from the shop.</p><p></p><p>A tall woman with a black veil covering her face came out of the shop. Qi Yuan noticed that she was a Monarch-level cultivator, and when she saw his mask, her body had a slight reaction, but it quickly disappeared, hidden very well.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, "I want to buy a map of the surrounding area."</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman responded, "Please wait a moment, esteemed guest."</p><p></p><p>She turned and went back into the shop, opened a drawer, and spread out a map in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is the guest satisfied?" the veiled woman asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit puzzled. Where else would one do business like this? In this martial arts world, cultivators would remember a map after just a glance, so it had no value.</p><p></p><p>However, he still took a look at the map, and his expression became puzzled: "Is this map really covering all the realms around the Ancient Qi Cypress?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the veiled woman nodded affirmatively.</p><p></p><p>"Why is there no mention of the Moon Emperor Dynasty or the Seven-Month Town?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the veiled woman hesitated for a moment: "I've never heard of the Moon Emperor Dynasty or the Seven-Month Town."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit confused. Could this person be deceiving him? Or did Jinli deceive him? Or did he remember it wrong?</p><p></p><p>"However, I have heard of the Moon Emperor Clan, I don't know if that is related to what you are looking for," the veiled woman said.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Emperor Clan?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Although the Moon Emperor Clan and the Moon Emperor Dynasty differed by only one character, the gap was quite large. The Moon Emperor Clan, even if they established a country, would still be the Moon Emperor Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon Emperor Clan has twelve lakes, each with a branch of the clan living by the lakeside. I don't know if this is related to the Seven-Month Town you mentioned," the veiled woman explained.</p><p></p><p>"Where are they?" Qi Yuan quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>If one coincidence could be overlooked, but two in a row, that indicated a problem.</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman hesitated for a moment before speaking: "The Moon Emperor Clan refuses to follow the laws of the Hundred Cities, and they are currently at war with the Hundred Cities. Going there now would be dangerous and could implicate the innocent.</p><p></p><p>The laws of the Hundred Cities are the Filial Piety Laws. The Hundred Cities demand that the Moon Emperor Clan also follow the Filial Piety, and those who defy the superiors will be executed!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the location?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's here," the veiled woman marked the location of the Moon Emperor Clan on the map, "The Seven-Month Lake is just a few miles from the main trunk of the Ancient Qi Cypress."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the information," Qi Yuan said sincerely, "I don't have enough silver and gold on me, but I see that you are a Monarch-level cultivator, so I will gift you this cultivation technique. If you cultivate this, you may have a chance to break through to the Supreme Monarch realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then took a piece of paper from the shop and, with a few flicks of his hand, a cultivation technique appeared on the paper in just a dozen breaths.</p><p></p><p>This technique was a common one from the memory of a Divine Realm expert. It was just right for the veiled woman in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman took the cultivation technique, her eyes widening in excitement as she examined it. This technique was of an extremely high level and very suitable for her. If she cultivated it, she would be able to become a Supreme Monarch in no time.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to express her gratitude, but by the time she looked up, Qi Yuan had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Senior?" she wanted to say something, but ultimately didn't.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths later, an old woman lifted the curtain and walked out of the shop.</p><p></p><p>The old woman, with a face full of wrinkles and an aged appearance, asked, "Little Lian, did you find out the origins of that person?"</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman, Little Lian, frowned, "His strength is at least at the Supreme Monarch realm, or even..."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm?" the old woman knitted her brows.</p><p></p><p>"If he's from the Divine Realm, he may have come out of the Forbidden Area," Little Lian said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Or he could be just a lure set up by the Hundred Cities Alliance," the old woman said.</p><p></p><p>Little Lian's expression fell, "We haven't had contact with the great figures in the Forbidden Area for nearly a thousand years. The Black-Robed Guards' power is growing stronger and stronger. Can we really win?"</p><p></p><p>"Our purpose for existing tomorrow is to slay the Black-Robed Guards and restore a bright, clear sky to the world! Little Lian, don't worry, the Black-Robed Guards act against the Heavenly Dao, and they will be struck down by Heaven's wrath!" the old woman's eyes gleamed with ferocity.</p><p></p><p>Her son, her daughter, her husband, had all died at the hands of the Black-Robed Guards. She was irreconcilable with them.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Little Lian nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>"Little Lian, close the shop, we're going to the Moon Emperor Clan," the old woman decided.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity for us to observe the battle between the Hundred Cities Alliance and the Moon Emperor Clan, and see if that masked man is truly a great figure from the Forbidden Area, or just a lure set up by the Black-Robed Guards," the old woman said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The moon rose above the branches.</p><p></p><p>The lake water was shimmering, and Jinli was sitting on the blue stones by the lakeside.</p><p></p><p>She would occasionally look up with a disappointed expression, then regain a hopeful look.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Qin stood not far away, seeing Jinli's demeanor, she sighed softly, not knowing what she was sighing about.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Aunt Qin's ear, "Aunt Qin, it's been a while."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the ethereal and melodious voice, Aunt Qin's body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>"Is that you? High Priestess!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

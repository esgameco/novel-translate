        <h1>Chapter 410</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Holding Little Bride in his arms, Qi Yuan personally fed her quite a few snacks.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride's wedding dress became increasingly solid, but the aura around her remained unchanged. </p><p></p><p>Many complex emotions flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride was of the royal bloodline of the Wedding Dress clan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had seen many others from the Wedding Dress clan before.</p><p></p><p>Those Wedding Dress clan members could speak and transform into human form.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride was different, seeming to only exist in the form of a wedding dress.</p><p></p><p>Even with Qi Yuan's current Yang Spirit level of combat power, he was unable to change Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a Yang Spirit was already terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Though unable to make a stone truly awaken consciousness on its own, it was effortless to awaken consciousness in an insect or fish.</p><p></p><p>"There are many talented people in the Upper Realm, perhaps someone could make Little Bride speak," Qi Yuan gazed at Little Bride eating snacks with a doting expression.</p><p></p><p>Yang Spirits of the Great Principle level existed in the Upper Realm, perhaps they would understand the issue with Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>After about half an hour, Little Bride stopped absorbing blood crystals, apparently full.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look at... the Strange Land. We should also prepare to go to the Upper Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Catastrophe had fallen, transforming into a Strange Land within the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite curious about that Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>However, since awakening, he had been busy devouring the Three Thousand Realms and hadn't gone to see the Strange Land yet.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths of time, Qi Yuan appeared in the Strange Land holding Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi also appeared at this moment, her face somewhat pale, clearly her injuries had not yet healed.</p><p></p><p>She had also been severely injured in the battle against the Three Thousand Catastrophes.</p><p></p><p>Although she and the other Netherworld deities had worked together to separate the Canglan Realm from the great battle, the fight between the Three Thousand Catastrophes and Four Thousand Yang Spirits took place within the Purple Palace, and was still too intense.</p><p></p><p>If it had been outside the Purple Palace, so much wouldn't have happened.</p><p></p><p>"The fragments from the fallen Catastrophe transformed into this Strange Land. </p><p></p><p>From my daughter's investigation, this Strange Land... is somewhat similar to chaos, it's a kind of energy.</p><p></p><p>This energy... could perhaps be utilized to support the operation of the Netherworld." Qi Qi told Qi Yuan of her discoveries.</p><p></p><p>During this time, she had been staying in the Strange Land, researching it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Father had entrusted the management of the Netherworld to her, so she needed to investigate thoroughly when an unknown area appeared.</p><p></p><p>"It can be utilized?" Qi Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Qi nodded vigorously, her eyes flashing with joy, "When Father revived the shattered mountains and rivers of the Canglan Realm, as well as the dead living beings, it wasn't actually creating them out of nothing, it consumed a lot of the Netherworld's energy.</p><p></p><p>This energy mostly came from the Mountains and Rivers Brush, as well as the relocated Wuguicheng, Jiupan Mountain and others, and some came from you, Father.</p><p></p><p>The Strange Land formed from the Catastrophe is actually quite precious energy, able to revive even more."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Qi spoke, she waved her hand and grabbed a handful of the special energy from the Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>"In the battle against the Catastrophe, Father had 327 divine embryos shattered.</p><p></p><p>If left to heal on their own in the Netherworld, it might take tens of thousands of years, and the Netherworld's energy wouldn't be enough to revive them all.</p><p></p><p>But using this energy is different! With just a third of the energy here, Father's shattered divine embryos could walk out of the Netherworld again, and it would only take a year.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if more energy was consumed, they could awaken in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's face was excited.</p><p></p><p>She knew very well what this meant.</p><p></p><p>If such a Netherworld existed in the Mortal Heart Realm,</p><p></p><p>What would the Ancient Gods fear in facing the New Gods? What would they fear in battle? They could even grow stronger through battle, fighting more and more fiercely.</p><p></p><p>This was simply the strongest logistical base.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan also rarely used his brain: "So you're saying, three Catastrophes are enough to revive one divine embryo, a ratio of about 3 to 1?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi nodded: "That's right."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, then immediately became extremely pained: "Aiya, I was too extravagant and wasteful before. All those past loves of mine, died for nothing, alas... if they had died in my Netherworld and turned into energy, they would have continued to contribute even after death. That would truly be 'some people die, but they still live on'!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was full of regret.</p><p></p><p>Back then with so many past loves, why did he just kill them and not care?</p><p></p><p>He should have taken their corpses too.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were Qi Yuan's past loves in life, they should be Qi Yuan's past loves in death too.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, wouldn't it fail to live up to Qi Yuan's reputation for deep affection.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi wanted to laugh, but she was professional and didn't actually laugh: "What Father says makes sense, the corpses of slain enemies all have great use.</p><p></p><p>However, the Catastrophes are special, three Catastrophes can gather enough energy to revive one Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Yang Spirits, it may take more."</p><p></p><p>"Even a mosquito's meat is meat, how could I be so heartless as to waste any past love!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in addition to the music team, the mourning team, and the banquet, we also need a corpse collection team!</p><p></p><p>Alas, I was so foolish before, why did I let those gentle and lovely past loves, who were just a bit old and didn't like to bathe, be exposed in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were eaten by wild dogs and pecked by eagles, how painful and wasteful that must have been!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, when we go to the Upper Realm, I must carry forward the traditional virtues of frugality and thrift, and let every past love fulfill their value even after death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi didn't speak, she was all too familiar with her godfather's personality.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Mortal Heart Realm, what Ancient God had ever thought of going to eat the New Gods' banquet?</p><p></p><p>Godfather had thought of it, and even done it.</p><p></p><p>Led by Qi Qi, after patrolling the Netherworld with Little Bride, Qi Yuan's form arrived before the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ten Thousand Differences could be any door in the world.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by purple qi, the Door of Ten Thousand Differences transformed into the Door of Great Principle, enough to drive any Yang Spirit mad.</p><p></p><p>If opened, it could lure Yang Spirits into the Netherworld, and then surround and attack them.</p><p></p><p>If they died, dying in the Netherworld wouldn't be a waste.</p><p></p><p>"What if we lure in a Great Principle level being?" Qi Yuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>He still had no concept of how powerful Great Principle level beings were.</p><p></p><p>He dared to take on one of those Principle level true Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>If too many came, he felt he would be finished.</p><p></p><p>As for Great Principle level... they were likely even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"So, I need to optimize this trap. Going through the Door of Ten Thousand Differences shouldn't just enter the Netherworld, otherwise my Netherworld could be wrecked."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, again rarely using his brain.</p><p></p><p>"Could Father move the other end of this door to the void between spaces? That way if we encounter an unbeatable enemy, we could put them in the void between spaces." Qi Qi made an appropriate suggestion at this time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan had a flash of inspiration. He got a bit excited: "Goddaughter, you truly have inherited my genetic talent, your intelligence is almost comparable to Great Wisdom True Lord, you've given me an idea!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's words gave Qi Yuan many hints.</p><p></p><p>Back when he was in the Flowing Wind Realm, he had used the Key of Ten Thousand Differences to open the Door of Ten Thousand Differences and arrived in a dead universe.</p><p></p><p>So, could he also use the Door of Ten Thousand Differences to return to the universe of his Solar Golden Core?</p><p></p><p>Could the other end of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences be set in that universe?</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>A crazed look flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he created a Black Hole Golden Core and aimed the other end of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences at the black hole.</p><p></p><p>Could a Great Principle level Yang Spirit who entered... come out? If not, they would be hit by hundreds or even thousands of Solar Golden Cores as soon as they entered.</p><p></p><p>These Solar Golden Cores were real stars, not the illusory reflections that illuminated the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>The power would likely... be even greater.</p><p></p><p>"If they're too strong, just banish them to the other end of the universe. Yang Spirits are very fast, but it would probably still take a long time to traverse the entire universe!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was truly a genius.</p><p></p><p>If the Door of Ten Thousand Differences could really help him reach his own universe.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered an unbeatable</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Enemy, directly escape through the Door of Myriad Distinctions into one's own universe, then close the Door of Myriad Distinctions.</p><p></p><p>How could the opponent pursue? Of course, this method would probably work against ordinary powerful beings, but if they were too strong, Qi Yuan might not even be able to enter the Door of Myriad Distinctions before perishing.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Door of Myriad Distinctions, took out the Key of Myriad Distinctions, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Door of Myriad Distinctions, you know where I want to go!" Qi Yuan took a deep breath, inserting the key into the Door of Myriad Distinctions once again.</p><p></p><p>With a click, the Door of Myriad Distinctions opened, emitting an ancient, profound, and desolate aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embraced Xiao Jia, his right eyebrow not twitching as he directly stepped into the Door of Myriad Distinctions!</p><p></p><p>"This place... indeed..." Qi Yuan's eyes finally lost their calm.</p><p></p><p>Looking out, there was an endless river of stars as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>Profound, vast, ancient.</p><p></p><p>The star realm of the Nine Heavens seemed not even a ten-thousandth of its size and age.</p><p></p><p>Fixed stars were burning, suns were exploding.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's eyes contracted sharply.</p><p></p><p>On the distant shore, a girl in a black dress seemed to hold the mandate of heaven in her mouth, her words like imperial edicts.</p><p></p><p>Stars wandered in her skirt, becoming decorations upon it.</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine force gushed forth as she seemed to be capturing a huge fixed star.</p><p></p><p>Her face was somewhat pale, beads of sweat rolling down her jade-like face as she gritted her teeth, her hand suddenly contracting.</p><p></p><p>The scorching fixed star burned, turning the sleeve in her hand to ash before reforming.</p><p></p><p>Her jade hand tightly grasped the fixed star as if wanting to refine it into a golden core.</p><p></p><p>However, the fixed star was too enormous, making the girl's figure appear extremely petite in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, a pained look flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was helping him form golden cores.</p><p></p><p>If he did it himself, the speed would be too slow.</p><p></p><p>With Ning Tao's help, the speed could be greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Tao, let me assist you."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, his Dharma body also suddenly manifested.</p><p></p><p>A huge blood-colored figure appeared, and when the black-dressed girl on the distant shore saw this, her eyes revealed an irrepressible look of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Husband!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the golden canary that had been fanning also revealed a look of secret delight in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure appeared, standing shoulder to shoulder with Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>The huge fixed star was burning madly.</p><p></p><p>It had no consciousness, but its enormous mass represented resistance.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge fixed star was larger than the Dharma body of an ordinary Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Even a minor Celestial Rank Yang Spirit would likely have their Dharma body dispersed if suddenly struck by such a fixed star.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Core chapter of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" was operating frantically.</p><p></p><p>Under the control of Qi Yuan and Ning Tao, the huge fixed star kept rotating and changing, until finally... it condensed into a golden core.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma body also dispersed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Two soft bodies crashed into Qi Yuan's embrace at this moment, tender lips passionately seeking.</p><p></p><p>Flames burned, the fire in their hearts even more intense, clothes burned away without reforming.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao and the golden canary's previous meetings with Qi Yuan were mostly projections and avatars.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was their true bodies truly meeting Qi Yuan for the first time.</p><p></p><p>However, when spring passion climbed into Ning Tao's beautiful eyes, she pushed Qi Yuan away.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... you must leave quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The golden canary looked at Qi Yuan, its eyes also full of intense reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the space-time of this universe is anchored to husband. Where husband is, a day on earth is a hundred years in heaven. But with husband appearing here, the space-time is probably similar to the Azure Waves Realm. The longer husband stays, the more time is wasted, and the fewer golden cores can be condensed. Facing the Supreme Radiance Palace, there will be one less chance." Ning Tao explained seriously.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the high temperature of the stellar golden core, her excessively snow-white tender skin flushed red.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt somewhat heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>He understood that Ning Tao wanted to condense more stellar golden cores before Qi Yuan faced the Supreme Radiance Palace, to give him a better chance.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled, with infinite charm: "Your servant controls the years and time, what I lack least is time to reunite with husband, why must husband act this way."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary also nodded vigorously, smiling like a flower: "Hehe, if this young lady misses you, I can go down to play with you anytime."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao leaned over and lightly kissed Qi Yuan's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"We are legally married husband and wife, no matter what dangers or difficulties we encounter, we should face them together! In the Flowing Wind Realm, husband helped me. Now, it's my turn to help husband.</p><p></p><p>Husband's enemies are my enemies!</p><p></p><p>How can I let husband face great enemies alone, shouldering everything by himself, while I enjoy myself at ease? If I am hurt, husband will be distressed; if husband is hurt, how can I not be distressed? I, Ning Tao, am not only the most beautiful girl in the world, but also husband's wife, family who rely on each other."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Ning Tao embraced Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded forcefully, his voice carrying some emotion, "My luck has been a bit too good."</p><p></p><p>"Meeting each other, both our luck has been very good."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving that end of the universe, Qi Yuan cast aside all emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Damn Supreme Radiance Palace, going too far!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan looked towards the ten suns in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Now, Ning Tao had obtained the divine methods of the Buddha Realm and was working overtime to produce stellar golden cores.</p><p></p><p>Now, almost one or two divine methods were equivalent to one stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>This time visiting Ning Tao, she had already accumulated many stellar golden cores, but had not projected them into this world or reflected them across the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would arouse the vigilance of the Supreme Radiance Palace, which would not be very good.</p><p></p><p>Ten suns, just right.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go to the upper realm."</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>To truly go to the upper realm, he had several paths he could take.</p><p></p><p>The first path was through the void interstices.</p><p></p><p>However, the location reached in the upper realm by this path was random.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens were so vast that even a Yang Spirit might not be able to traverse it all in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>So this path was not feasible.</p><p></p><p>The second path was through the transmission array in the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>There was a transmission array in the lair of the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of transmission would lead directly to the Supreme Radiance Palace, which was too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan did not yet have a clear understanding of Yang Spirits at the Great Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>He, a weak Purple Palace cultivator, was probably no match for that person of the Supreme Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>The third path, the transmission formation of the Moon-Gazing Continent, was also not feasible at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun had returned from fishing and told Qi Yuan that the transmission array from the Moon-Gazing Continent to the Moon God Palace was closed for unknown reasons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan also did not know that this was closely related to the Moon God Sovereign being injured recently.</p><p></p><p>The fourth path was to go to the Buddha Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the fifth path was Qi Yuan's top priority in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That was to go through the Moon-Gazing Continent to the lower realm where the Black Magic Abyss was located, and ascend to the Fifth Heaven where the Mara clan was.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss, located in the Sixth Heaven, was a special force no less than the Supreme Radiance Palace, with complex internal forces, some of which had disputes with the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Mara clan had two fathers, one was the Black Magic Abyss, and one was the Supreme Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>However, the Black Magic Abyss was too arrogant and placed great importance on bloodlines, so although the Mara clan had always fawned on the Black Magic Abyss and was similar in bloodline to some extent, the Black Magic Abyss was almost unwilling to pay attention to the Mara clan.</p><p></p><p>This was why the Mara clan gradually drew closer to the Supreme Radiance Palace, looking for a new father.</p><p></p><p>"First go take a look around the Mara clan, part of the enemies in the Magic Abyss where Jin Li is now are the Mara clan."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

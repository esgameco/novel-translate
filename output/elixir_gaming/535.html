        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The water curtain formed a continuous sheet, the slanted eaves seemed to have transformed into mountains and rivers, and the rain curtain became a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>In the vast coastal city, on the wide streets, due to this heavy downpour, there were few people around.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p></p><p>In the heavy rain, a thin old horse walked slowly, the rain splashing into its eyes, yet it still kept them wide open and alert.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng led the horse, his footsteps splashing water all around.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the heavy rain, his voice tinged with a reminiscent tone.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years ago, even in a torrential downpour, there were still unspoken rules in this world, but people still believed that the rules would prevail over the unspoken ones.</p><p></p><p>Alas, after a hundred years have passed, not only have the unspoken rules surpassed the rules, the rules themselves... have become a joke." Liu Sheng's voice sounded aged.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed born a groom.</p><p></p><p>The son of an official becomes an official, the son of a merchant becomes a merchant, and the son of a groom also becomes a groom.</p><p></p><p>His family had been grooms for generations, and unsurprisingly, his descendants would also continue to be grooms.</p><p></p><p>However, luckily, when he was young, he encountered the divine descent.</p><p></p><p>All professions in this world, no matter how noble or humble, are equal.</p><p></p><p>If you lie down, then lie down.</p><p></p><p>But as long as you make an effort, have the desire to improve, then you can achieve success.</p><p></p><p>Being a good groom, Liu Sheng also became the first model "groom", just like the grandfather of Wang An, a model laborer.</p><p></p><p>He gained "power" and "voice".</p><p></p><p>He could also be relatively freer, entering the path of the Imperial Guard.</p><p></p><p>You must know that in the past, an ordinary groom, where would he have the qualifications to cultivate?</p><p></p><p>Cultivation, becoming an Imperial Guard... this was a privilege only for the rich and the officials.</p><p></p><p>"At first, this old man always felt... that the world is bustling, all for the sake of profit, does this world truly have such a selfless and impartial divine being?" Liu Sheng chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>It is understandable for the common people at the bottom to blindly believe in the divine descent.</p><p></p><p>As an Imperial Guard, he probably realized long ago that the so-called divine being is nothing more than a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Even if the divine descent is completely selfless, it likely still has its own desires.</p><p></p><p>Even if it is a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>But the owner who created this divine artifact, that Sheng NÃ¼... must have her own demands, right?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, do you think this world can truly be as fair and equal as the divine descent had hoped for?" Liu Sheng turned his head, looking at Chen Kang Bao and Qi Yuan on the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, catching the rainwater: "If you talk about reality... it may be difficult, but this is a game, anything is possible."</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng was slightly taken aback, then bitterly smiled.</p><p></p><p>The once divine descent has ultimately shattered.</p><p></p><p>Now, there is another Imperial Guard in control.</p><p></p><p>What path this Imperial Guard will take, and what thoughts he has, Liu Sheng did not know.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Demon Gods, excluding this old man, the other six are the King of Distant Pacification, the King of Mountains and Rivers, the Drunken King... as well as the Demon Emperor, the Fifth Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The strongest is the Fifth Extraordinary, who has been in seclusion for the past hundred years.</p><p></p><p>There are rumors that he has already approached the peak power of the divine descent!" </p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng said, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>He also did not know how powerful the current divine descent could still be.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, all are equal in my eyes, he is no different from you." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Sheng's body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>He led the horse, holding the reins, weaving through the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>The rain kept getting heavier, showing no signs of stopping.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sheng sat in front of the carriage, waving the whip, the carriage speeding through the rain curtain.</p><p></p><p>The torrential downpour could not hinder the carriage's pace.</p><p></p><p>Leisurely, leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, in the middle of Dingbo State, passersby saw a carriage traveling from south to north, crossing the Hengduan Mountains, with a heavenly-level demonic spirit causing trouble, but the groom on the carriage used his finger as a sword, easily slaying it, shocking all the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, a carriage crossed the Wuding River, entering Xianle State.</p><p></p><p>Howling gales, swirling sands.</p><p></p><p>Xianle State is located in the southeastern-most part of the Luosha Kingdom, with a predominantly desert terrain, bordering the Great Feng.</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Phoenix City, where the divine descent once fell, was located in Xianle State.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the Great Feng and the Luosha Kingdom have frequently battled, with the Luosha Kingdom losing more than winning, already ceding seven cities.</p><p></p><p>These seven cities are all located in Xianle State.</p><p></p><p>On the official road, the dust was rising.</p><p></p><p>Li Wan was dressed in men's clothing, her face smeared with some mud, making her look even more like a man.</p><p></p><p>She was riding a horse, glancing at the carriage beside her, a hint of curiosity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their group of seven people were heading to Xianlong Prefecture through the official road.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Li Wan saw this carriage and became curious.</p><p></p><p>This official road was not safe, for a carriage to dare to travel alone, the carriage owner's strength must not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Li Wan was confident in herself, and also thought that having one more person would be safer, so she went to ask if they could travel together.</p><p></p><p>The carriage owner did not refuse, which surprised Li Wan, as the carriage owner looked too young, appearing no more than twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the old man constantly eating buns is a powerful expert? With this thought, Li Wan said, "In the past, even though Xianle State was located in the southeastern-most part of the Luosha Kingdom, its economy was the most prosperous, and you could see endless merchant caravans on this official road every day."</p><p></p><p>Li Wan's family had been merchants for generations.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the merchant caravans from the Luosha Kingdom would depart from Xianle State, heading to the Great Feng and other countries.</p><p></p><p>The commercial activities here were the most thriving.</p><p></p><p>"Sadly, now, you can't even see a single demonic beast on this road." Li Wan laughed.</p><p></p><p>"It's better without any demonic beasts, the journey will be safe." The burly man said, a large sword hanging at his waist, his chest exposed due to the hot weather.</p><p></p><p>"Don't raise any flags." At this time, Qi Yuan in the carriage spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, even if we encounter demonic beasts, it's no problem, we have Uncle Li, right?" Li Wan laughed.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li was a mid-rank Imperial Guard, considered a powerful expert in the region.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li puffed up his chest proudly, his gaze falling on the carriage, remembering something, and tentatively asked, "Young master, are you going to Xianlong Prefecture to visit relatives or...?"</p><p></p><p>"To kill someone." Qi Yuan replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li was taken aback, then glanced at Li Wan and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they saw Qi Yuan as extraordinary, and wanted to try to befriend him seriously.</p><p></p><p>In that way, the Li family would also gain more friends and more connections.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Qi Yuan's straightforward response, without any pretense.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that he was constantly embroiled in trouble, the kind of person not worth getting deeply involved with.</p><p></p><p>Li Wan heard this, feeling a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to Xianlong Prefecture for?" Qi Yuan casually asked.</p><p></p><p>He was socially awkward, not good at initiating conversations.</p><p></p><p>If others asked him what he was going to do, he would ask back.</p><p></p><p>Li Wan was silent for a while, then answered, "To break off an engagement."</p><p></p><p>"You?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but laugh, "The one breaking off the engagement wouldn't happen to be surnamed Xiao, would it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Wan shook her head: "No."</p><p></p><p>She was a bit curious, what's wrong with the surname Xiao? "As long as it's not, then the game hasn't been stitched together too much."</p><p></p><p>The bad news is that it's been stitched together too much, the good news is that it's all been stitched.</p><p></p><p>"??" Li Wan was puzzled, she continued, "It's the surname Shi."</p><p></p><p>"Shi?" Qi Yuan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the originally horse-riding Uncle Li's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, there are Great Feng cavalry up ahead!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly pulled the reins, looking up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>But one look, his face showed tension and anger.</p><p></p><p>"Up ahead, there are three thousand Great Feng cavalry, they... are capturing our Luosha Kingdom's civilians!"</p><p></p><p>Up ahead, the dust was flying, three thousand cavalry roaming around, shouting and cursing.</p><p></p><p>The cavalry formed an encirclement, with over a thousand Great Feng civilians trapped inside.</p><p></p><p>Those who walked slowly were whipped.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They went down.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of crying and struggling continued.</p><p></p><p>Some people were whipped on the back and fell to the ground, never to get up again.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li's face was filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>The armies of the Great Feng often came to Xianle Prefecture to raid the grain fields.</p><p></p><p>Generally, they would just steal some food or abduct some women.</p><p></p><p>It was rare to see them kidnapping large numbers of commoners and selling them as slaves.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Li Wan looked at the huge cloud of dust rising in the distance, her hand gripping the hilt of her knife, the veins bulging like vines.</p><p></p><p>"We have to take a detour, otherwise if these cavalry discover us, we won't be able to escape!" Uncle Li said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The other burly men all nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although they were furious, they were helpless. </p><p></p><p>How could they, a small group, fight against three thousand cavalry? That would be suicide.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Chen Kang suddenly whipped his horses, and the carriage sped forward.</p><p></p><p>Li Wan saw this and hurriedly said, "Young master... what are you doing? It's dangerous up ahead."</p><p></p><p>She rode her horse, wanting to chase after him, but was deeply conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li was also stunned, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>Chase after him? They didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>The owner of that carriage... was he seeking death? Or was he one of the Great Feng?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a calm voice came from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to save them."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"No buts, because the Arbiter has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"The Arbiter?" Li Wan's brain was racing, "Are you from the Arbitration Hall?"</p><p></p><p>Only that could explain it.</p><p></p><p>But even if he was from the Arbitration Hall, how could he withstand three thousand cavalry? </p><p></p><p>Among those three thousand, there might be a Heaven-level Imperial Soldier leading them.</p><p></p><p>They had no time to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li was also anxious, worried for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed that someone among the cavalry had noticed the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of riders wielding whips charged towards it, their faces twisted with ferocity and mockery.</p><p></p><p>"So someone dares to come, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"A few more slaves, worth quite a bit of money!"</p><p></p><p>But their smiles soon froze.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vast and majestic voice resounded across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The world is without light, but the Arbiter has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Wielding the light, dispelling the darkness."</p><p></p><p>"If there is injustice, call upon the Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>The voice boomed, echoing far and wide.</p><p></p><p>The horses neighed incessantly, rearing up.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned by this sudden, magnificent voice.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Who's putting on this act?"</p><p></p><p>The riders were perplexed, some with fear on their faces, gripping the reins and scanning their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the Loshad commoners trapped in the middle had various expressions.</p><p></p><p>An old woman seemed to have realized something, her face filled with fervent excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Arbiter... the Arbiter God has returned!"</p><p></p><p>"If there is injustice, call upon the Arbiter... the Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>A young man had tears in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Memories from his childhood resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>Grandma had once told him the story of the Arbiter God, and said that if he encountered injustice, he could call out the Arbiter's name, and the Arbiter would stand up for him.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, as a child, he had called the Arbiter's name many times, but the Arbiter never appeared.</p><p></p><p>As he grew up, he realized the Arbiter might be dead, or perhaps just a myth.</p><p></p><p>The childhood belief in the legend was so laughable.</p><p></p><p>But now, this voice...</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, at the surrounding cavalry, and suddenly shouted with all his might, "Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>Now he was facing injustice! Now he had heard the divine voice! If not now, when would he call the Arbiter?</p><p></p><p>"Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>His voice stirred the others.</p><p></p><p>The commoners uncovered their old memories.</p><p></p><p>"Arbiter!"</p><p>"Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>Whether young or old, they all stood up and cried out "Arbiter".</p><p>Because they had heard that to summon the Arbiter, one must stand and call out.</p><p></p><p>The voices surged like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>The horses were startled, neighing, and the riders' faces showed fear and confusion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a blood-red glow descended from the sky, turning the entire land crimson.</p><p></p><p>Everyone instinctively looked up at the heavens.</p><p></p><p>There, a towering figure nearly two hundred meters tall stood majestically in the sky.</p><p></p><p>No, it was not a terrifying giant, but an awe-inspiring deity!</p><p></p><p>Clad in blood-red armor with scales, its expression was cold and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>It stood silently.</p><p></p><p>For any mortal, the sight of this colossal, fearsome form would immediately inspire terror and dread of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Many commoners fell to their knees.</p><p></p><p>But in that moment, the young man who had first cried out "Arbiter" stood tall, looking at the dreadful, imposing figure, and bellowed, "Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>Those two words expressed all the grievances and injustices he had endured in his life.</p><p></p><p>And then, the fifty-zhang-tall majestic figure moved.</p><p></p><p>It simply swung a fist.</p><p></p><p>This punch was in response to the young man's cry.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to stand still.</p><p></p><p>This was the punch of a deity.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, the three thousand cavalry were flung about, men and horses tumbling.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this terrifying divine might, the three thousand cavalry were as fragile as ants.</p><p></p><p>Not just three thousand, even thirty thousand would be no match for this dreadful punch.</p><p></p><p>All the commoners were shocked, overjoyed, and filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Many knelt down, bowing their heads and chanting, "Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>"Stand up!" </p><p></p><p>"You need not kneel before me!"</p><p></p><p>"The Arbiter does not require worship!"</p><p></p><p>This divine voice had a magical effect.</p><p></p><p>The commoners in the area all rose to their feet, looking up at the towering figure.</p><p></p><p>Although there was still fear in their eyes, they persisted in keeping them wide open, invigorating their spirits, gazing intently.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Li Wan's body trembled, her upper and lower jaws chattering from the shaking.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li... is He the Arbiter God?"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li's burly stomach was drenched in sweat, and his leg muscles were quivering as he looked at the majestic figure.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose... He must be."</p><p></p><p>"The Arbiter... has returned." Li Wan's voice was complex.</p><p></p><p>She looked far away at the slowly advancing carriage, her emotions complicated.</p><p></p><p>The young master in that carriage... the one she had just been chatting with... was he the Arbiter God?</p><p>Or did he wield the mightiest divine instrument in the world... the Arbiter?</p><p></p><p>"The sky of Loshad... is about to change." Uncle Li sighed deeply, his voice complex, unsure if it was joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, some people hope for change, but could it really get worse than now?</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, some people don't like change, feeling that the present is good enough.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Uncle Li understood that no matter what he wished for or disliked, the sky of Loshad had ultimately changed.</p><p></p><p>"If there is injustice, call upon the Arbiter!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li stood up straight, his back upright.</p><p></p><p>In his youth, he had also called out "Arbiter".</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

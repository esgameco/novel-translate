        <h1>Chapter 282</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>Jun'an Residential Complex.</p><p></p><p>The sound of motorcycles roaring through the streets echoed, with sharp explosive noises occasionally ringing out.</p><p></p><p>On the bed lay a man with a pale, bloodless face. Only his eyes were bloodshot, giving him a fierce appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Restart..." </p><p></p><p>The man trembled, feeling the world grow dark around him.</p><p></p><p>His hand inadvertently touched his phone, pushing it off the bed.</p><p></p><p>The expected thud didn't come. A delicate white hand caught the phone steadily.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the phone screen seemed to light up, showing an unread text message.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the innate seed on the hospital bed, identical to himself.</p><p></p><p>He wore a strange expression: "Quite ill... could it be kidney deficiency?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know much about medicine. </p><p></p><p>To him, all illnesses were kidney deficiency.</p><p></p><p>The innate seed also looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled then.</p><p></p><p>The pale man on the bed transformed into a drop of blood, merging into Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a flood of memories swept over him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes showed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a world similar to Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the technology is much more advanced than Blue Star!"</p><p></p><p>"And... the universe!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pulled back the curtains and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was bright, with stars barely visible.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan could still see quite a few stars.</p><p></p><p>"My Golden Core didn't come?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, his Solar Golden Core had not appeared in this universe, not even as a shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Is the universe this world is in not the same as the Cang Lan Realm?"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he had a feeling that if he cultivated this body to the Yuan Dan realm, then... the projection of his Solar Golden Core would appear in this world.</p><p></p><p>By that time, Ning Tao should be free.</p><p></p><p>He could then summon Ning Tao down here.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the spiritual energy now in his dantian, it was enough to sustain Ning Tao's presence in this world indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>Playing a game alone isn't as fun as playing with two people, right?</p><p></p><p>"But... is this body of mine weak as water?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>After merging with the innate seed, he inevitably inherited the seed's condition.</p><p></p><p>Now he looked just like a sick person, and one without much time left to live.</p><p></p><p>[Qi Yuan, afflicted by an unknown curse, body severely weakened, only about 11 months of life expectancy remaining.]</p><p></p><p>This was the hidden information his eyes saw.</p><p></p><p>"A curse?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the female doctor's dream.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, that terrifying blood-soaked bird.</p><p></p><p>Was the curse on this body of his from that bird?</p><p></p><p>"I also heard that bird's cry before the world restarted. It seems that bird is quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, he naturally couldn't think about such distant matters.</p><p></p><p>Looking at himself, he wanted to exercise, but even walking left him short of breath - a complete weakling.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so weak right now."</p><p></p><p>Just then, the game's prompt sounded.</p><p></p><p>[Main quest: Become stronger, become a true Human Dao Martial Lord, Spirit Dao Martial Lord, and reach the realm of Myriad Dao Martial God!]</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Dao Martial God?" Qi Yuan was stunned, "Is this game's quest about martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>This world's technology level was higher than Blue Star's, even capable of interstellar travel.</p><p></p><p>Above Arch Star, there was another planet called Brilliant Star.</p><p></p><p>This planet also had humans, and its technological civilization was a notch above Arch Star's.</p><p></p><p>On Arch Star, besides technology, martial arts also existed.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's memory, the martial arts on Arch Star were somewhat similar to those in the mortal world of the Cang Lan Realm, but not entirely the same.</p><p></p><p>A martial arts expert who could leap ten meters was considered quite skilled.</p><p></p><p>On Blue Star, the long jump record was close to nine meters.</p><p></p><p>So, the abilities of martial arts experts were limited.</p><p></p><p>Especially as technology advanced and various high-precision weapons appeared, martial arts gradually devolved into a niche sport.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat similar to the game of Go in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One, tell me about the Human Dao Martial Lord, Spirit Dao Martial Lord, and Myriad Dao Martial God," Qi Yuan spoke, his voice quite weak.</p><p></p><p>Zero One was the robot in Qi Yuan's home, also his guardian.</p><p></p><p>This body's parents had died on a mission to Brilliant Star, earning considerable military merits.</p><p></p><p>So they had left Qi Yuan a decent inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A three-bedroom apartment in the city center, plus an expensive robot.</p><p></p><p>The cyberpunk-style robot pushed open the door, shaped similar to a human.</p><p></p><p>Although it was an intelligent robot, it was really just a big step up from the artificial stupidity on Blue Star. As for awakening its own consciousness, that was nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Dao Martial Lord is a martial arts legend that appeared 1,370 years ago.</p><p></p><p>Historical records state that at that time, the Moro Kingdom held a martial arts conference, gathering heroes from all over the world to engage in warfare. The strongest became the Human Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that whoever wins 100 consecutive martial arts conferences and holds the title of Human Martial Lord for 100 years can be called the Human Dao Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>No information found on Spirit Dao Martial Lord or Myriad Dao Martial God."</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero One connected to the entire network, able to search and organize almost all information available online.</p><p></p><p>"Are there still martial arts conferences now?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Zero One answered truthfully, "The next martial arts conference will begin in nine months and seventeen days."</p><p></p><p>"So I have to fight and become the Human Martial Lord for 100 terms to complete one-third of the task?" Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"What if... 100 years is too long, what if the Qin Yuan Kingdom falls during this time, if Gong Star is gone... how will I complete the task?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>After all, the relationship between Can Star and Gong Star had never been good.</p><p></p><p>There was even a great war 70 years ago.</p><p></p><p>There have been frictions in recent years as well.</p><p></p><p>If another war breaks out and the Qin Yuan Kingdom falls, what should be done without martial arts conferences? Qi Yuan thought about it but didn't dwell on it, since it was still far off.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One, I want to practice martial arts, how do I get started?" Qi Yuan still wanted to see what martial arts were like in this world.</p><p></p><p>After all, previous tasks always had a big boss.</p><p></p><p>This task surprisingly didn't have one.</p><p></p><p>He was also quite curious about the martial arts of this world.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry master, your physical condition is extremely poor, it's not recommended to practice martial arts," Robot Zero One gave a reasonable response.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan now looked as pale as a drowned ghost, gasping for breath after walking one step.</p><p></p><p>"What if my body gets better, how can I practice martial arts, how do I get started?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Zero One robot bluntly replied.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, master has Type A3 mental disorder and cannot obtain martial arts qualifications."</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Yuan Kingdom, the actions of mentally ill people were already restricted.</p><p></p><p>Mentally ill people practicing martial arts? Martial arts schools wouldn't dare teach them.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they taught a mentally ill person and they beat someone up, what would happen? Qi Yuan was speechless, he looked at the certificate by his bed: "I'm not sick."</p><p></p><p>"Zero One understands master's troubles, please accept reality.</p><p></p><p>In fact, mentally ill people receive many benefits in the Qin Yuan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Not only can they receive monthly subsidies, but they also enjoy special rights in some matters."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned, "Mental illness actually has so many benefits, doesn't that mean I can pretend to be mentally ill?"</p><p></p><p>He already had a mental illness certificate, so pretending to be mentally ill shouldn't be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>The only worry was that his acting skills weren't good enough to make it convincing.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One, how much cash do I have at home now?" Qi Yuan asked at this point.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed too weak now.</p><p></p><p>If he rashly attempted martial arts, he might die here.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan's idea was to first enter the path of immortality, solve his physical problems, or summon the projection of the Solar Golden Pill.</p><p></p><p>Once he had the ability to protect himself, he would then pursue martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"There are still 137,254 Qin Yuan currency," Zero One answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, buy me some things..." Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to start cultivating immortality, and to progress quickly, he needed to use external objects.</p><p></p><p>He told Zero One the materials he needed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your classmates will come to see you at 4:10 this afternoon," Zero One reminded.</p><p></p><p>After graduation, the class monitor entered the system. As Qi Yuan was a descendant of martyrs, after falling seriously ill, the monitor organized some old classmates to come visit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the time on his phone, there was about an hour left until 4:10.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm fine now, I can handle some guests.</p><p></p><p>You can go buy the materials."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the order, Zero One left the room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched Zero One's background, his eyes showing a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Cang Lan Realm, Fan Xin Realm, Liu Feng Realm, and even Wang Yue Continent all use the same language.</p><p></p><p>It's strange that there are other languages on Gong Star."</p><p></p><p>PS: Busy plus sick, sorry sorry, owe seven chapters, will make up next month.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

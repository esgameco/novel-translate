        <h1>Chapter 499</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's eyes gleamed, "I've been pursuing Miss Li, but she's been indifferent to me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan coughed and assumed a profound expression. "Before making a plan, we need to first understand the other party's strengths and weaknesses. Can you evaluate Miss Li and yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"Miss Li is as beautiful as a flower, with peach blossom eyes that are especially alluring. She wears a thin veil on her shoulders, appearing and disappearing, drawing attention."</p><p></p><p>"As for me... I'm a man, and Miss Li finds me too weak."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Qi Yuan now understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, recalling his past with Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>"To break this impasse, we need to try online romance!"</p><p></p><p>"Online romance?" Shen Lingfeng blinked, feeling the term was rather profound.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he's my brother-in-law, he even knows such impressive words.</p><p></p><p>"In online romance, the other party can't see you, so your image is entirely based on their imagination. </p><p></p><p>In this case, you just need to create an image of someone with high emotional intelligence, gentle and humorous. Without seeing you, they'll naturally imagine you as tall and imposing.</p><p></p><p>But looking at you, you seem a bit slow-witted, so you probably don't even have a Nokia phone. In that case, you should write letters."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan earnestly shared his experience.</p><p></p><p>Compared to real-life, the threshold for online romance is much lower.</p><p></p><p>After all, in real life, you might end up with a "see-the-light-and-die" situation, where the story ends before it even begins.</p><p></p><p>Online is different - it's easy to captivate someone, as their perception of your appearance and charm is entirely based on their own imagination. </p><p></p><p>And what they imagine is unlikely to be worse than reality. This is the advantage of the "white moonlight" - even the real person can't surpass the imagined one.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's eyes widened, "That makes sense. Throughout history, many talented scholars and beauties have found love through letter-writing."</p><p></p><p>He then furrowed his brow in thought, "But... I don't know how to create the image that Miss Li would like?"</p><p></p><p>"Simple, use some high emotional intelligence quotes and some witty, charming love words. That's sure to touch her heart." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Didn't that rich young master from the past also like to say romantic words?</p><p></p><p>"Let me help you come up with some witty love lines."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan proceeded to share a series of creative, humorous love phrases.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng was greatly impressed and inspired by these lines, feeling they were true gems of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao also gave a thumbs up, praising Shen Lingfeng's brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a sense of pride, like the protagonist on TV who impressed everyone with his poetic talents after transmigrating.</p><p></p><p>"But remember, writing letters is just the first step. The second step is... the net!</p><p></p><p>That's the true essence of online romance!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, please go on!" Shen Lingfeng listened attentively, as if hearing the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to explain his plan, encouraging Shen Lingfeng to write letters to multiple women across the city, rather than just pursuing Miss Li.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng was conflicted, struggling internally with the decision.</p><p></p><p>The excerpt then shifts to describe the situation at the Shen family manor, where the family patriarch Shen Wanshan is gravely concerned about the threat posed by the powerful water spirit Luo Tong at Eshan Lake. The water spirit has merged with the lake, causing great distress and destruction. Even the top-ranked Martial Cultivators sent by the Heavenly Sect were unable to subdue Luo Tong. This poses a serious threat to the Shen family and the surrounding region.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Weilong Xuanyuan was damaged and they couldn't find a craftsman to repair it. </p><p></p><p>"The Weilong Xuanyuan is a near-heavenly artifact, even top-tier Earth-grade craftsmen would have difficulty repairing it. It would probably require a Heaven-grade craftsman!"</p><p></p><p>"Ninguo doesn't even have a Heaven-grade military commander, let alone a Heaven-grade craftsman!"</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult!" The Shen family was a powerful clan, relying on the backing of the Tian Sect. They naturally didn't want any problems to arise with the Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this family council meeting, most of Shen family's military commanders and craftsmen gathered, all with worried and concerned expressions regarding Luo Rong Shuijun.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Sect Master has ordered that a craftsman conference be held near Yeshan Lake to discuss the repair of the Weilong Xuanyuan. </p><p></p><p>All the craftsmen and apprentices in our family who have talent and unique ideas, go with me to Yeshan Lake."  Shen Wanshan said.</p><p></p><p>"But... what if we craftsmen gathered at Yeshan Lake, and Luo Rong Shuijun stirs up a storm and drowns us all, what do we do then?" Chen Xianwei expressed his concerns.</p><p></p><p>He was a guest elder of the Shen family, a Mysterious-grade craftsman. Even the county magistrate of Ninghe County would have to treat him with respect.</p><p></p><p>The number of craftsmen was far fewer than the number of military commanders. </p><p></p><p>As one of the top three families in Jining Prefecture, the Shen family had seven Earth-grade military commanders, but only one Earth-grade craftsman.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Tian Sect will surely ensure our safety. The Fire Blaze Craftsman will also be going, with him there, what do we have to fear?" Shen Wanshan said.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Fire Blaze Craftsman, Chen Xianwei's face showed reverence. </p><p></p><p>The Fire Blaze Craftsman was among the top ten in Ninguo in terms of forging prowess. </p><p></p><p>With such a powerful figure going, the Tian Sect must have made preparations, so their safety was assured.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if any craftsmen will be able to repair the Weilong Xuanyuan this time!" Someone exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"If it can't be repaired, and one day Luo Rong Shuijun stirs up a huge storm, what will we do then?"</p><p></p><p>The group was full of worry and concern for the future.</p><p></p><p>"You all don't need to worry too much, even if Jining Prefecture is flooded, the flood waters won't reach our Fengshan Commandery." The Shen family's Madam comforted them at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Water?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice full of confusion but also excitement rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Mother-in-law, is this the bathwater you wanted?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll bring it over right away!"</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open with a bang, and a stunningly handsome young man appeared, carrying a large basin filled with steaming hot water.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the hall, he became the focus of everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Expressions of surprise, confusion, dazedness, bewilderment, and shock - they were all there.</p><p></p><p>This was the son-in-law, Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>What was he doing carrying a basin of water? Wait, was he going to pour the bathwater for the mother-in-law?</p><p></p><p>Their gazes involuntarily shifted to the Shen Madam, their expressions strange.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Madam's face flushed red, like a blooming flower: "Qi Yuan, what are you doing?!"</p><p></p><p>She spoke word by word, her mood very unsettled. </p><p></p><p>She really wanted to crawl into a hole right now.</p><p></p><p>"Giving you a bath, of course?" Qi Yuan blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone staring at him, he slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"As a son-in-law, I'll surely be looked down upon, bullied, and even the servants won't give me a proper look."</p><p></p><p>"In the Shen residence, I have to endure humiliation, cook soup for my wife, and pour bathwater for my mother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>"The water is here now, mother-in-law, do you want to bathe and change?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at his mother-in-law expectantly.</p><p></p><p>But he saw her face flushed red yet icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, Qi Yuan, get out!" Shen Wanshan couldn't hold back his anger.</p><p></p><p>"Not bathing now?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No bathing!" The Shen Madam responded coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Call me when it's time to bathe, I'll pour the water right away." Qi Yuan left as quickly as he had come.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wanshan looked at his wife and slowly asked, "Is he... truly insane?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." The Shen Madam sighed deeply, "From his words, it seems he has suffered a lot of cold shoulders and hardships since joining our Shen family... Even in his madness, he still remembers to... to..."</p><p></p><p>The rest of the words she couldn't bring herself to say.</p><p></p><p>"If Qi Dage saw his son like this, ah..." Shen Wanshan's face showed melancholy, then turned grim, "Order the servants, find out which ones have bullied and mistreated him since he joined the family, punish the guilty, dismiss the rest!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Family Master." An elder responded.</p><p></p><p>"But, in his current mad state, it's better than before... when he was constantly causing trouble. It's just... hard on Xuan'er." The Shen Madam's voice couldn't help but sound sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>Before, Qi Yuan's character was bad, and he was weak and unambitious. </p><p></p><p>Not only that, even when she wanted to help, she couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Now, his personality seemed to have improved, the previous problems were gone, but he was insane.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know if this was good or bad.</p><p></p><p>"I heard there was a major incident in Ninghe County?" Shen Wanshan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood of Thorns appeared, and 87 Anomalous Spirits appeared in Hongyan Stronghold, but they were all slain by a strong man wielding a crude gun!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood of Thorns actually appeared!"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Blood of Thorns, everyone present felt fear.</p><p></p><p>This was an evil cult, mysterious and powerful, not only active in Ninguo, but in other regions as well.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Madam relayed the intelligence she had obtained to Shen Wanshan.</p><p></p><p>"Claiming to be a deity?"</p><p></p><p>"His spiritual attacks were ineffective against the Anomalous Spirits?"</p><p></p><p>"The Anomalous Spirits cultivated by the Blood of Thorns are adept at spiritual attacks. Even if they were only Yellow-grade, 87 of them gathered together, I imagine it would take considerable effort to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Where did this genius come from?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wanshan mentioned it briefly, then paid it no further mind.</p><p></p><p>Just another genius.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he would have the Shen family investigate that person's identity, and try to establish a connection.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the crisis at Yeshan Lake, he had no time to bother with such minor matters.</p><p></p><p>For him, finding a powerful craftsman was more important.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Dage were still alive, with his talent, he might have been able to repair the Weilong Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he felt melancholic: "Chen Xianwei, go teach Qi Yuan for a while, see if he has any talent for being a craftsman."</p><p></p><p>He didn't want Qi Yuan to remain mad and aimless.</p><p></p><p>Nor did he want the Qi family's legacy to be severed.</p><p></p><p>"Me? Teach him?" Chen Xianwei was bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Teach a madman to be a craftsman? </p><p></p><p>How was he supposed to do that? He felt very bitter about this.</p><p></p><p>It would be easier to teach a mute to sing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, by bringing the bathwater in and playing the role of son-in-law Qi Yuan, I've made some progress."</p><p></p><p>"It seems this son-in-law Qi Yuan has long wanted to wash his mother-in-law's feet!"</p><p></p><p>"Besides pouring bathwater for the mother-in-law, what else does son-in-law Qi Yuan want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Get trampled on the ground by Shen Lingxuan? Lick her toes?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget the toes, other areas could be considered."</p><p></p><p>"Being a son-in-law is too difficult, it's better to just be a kitchen knife, just need to focus on cutting vegetables."</p><p></p><p>"Level up, level up, kill the Anomalous Spirits!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

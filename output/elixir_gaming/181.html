        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wolf demon walked out of the temple, his eyes cold and emotionless.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!" The temple guard captain approached, his face respectful.</p><p></p><p>"How are the villages below?" the wolf demon asked.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been busy dealing with the plague.</p><p></p><p>The temple guard's expression turned serious: "The villages... just today, they all fell into the hands of Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the wolf demon was somewhat surprised: "This Origin Celestial Lord is very bold."</p><p></p><p>Although the Origin Celestial Lord's conquest of these village gods was deliberately tolerated by the wolf demon,</p><p></p><p>Even with his tolerance, other ancient gods wouldn't dare to act like this.</p><p></p><p>For example, the ancient god Ruoyu of Shisha Town had always kept a low profile, like a quail, never provoking the new gods.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, shall I take some guards to capture him?" said the temple guard captain.</p><p></p><p>In Kuangfeng Town, there were over thirty Purple Palace cultivators among the temple guards.</p><p></p><p>The temple guard captain didn't take the Origin Celestial Lord seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>As long as they made a move, tiny Qingshui Village would surely be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The wolf demon's gaze sharpened as he recalled the terrifying aura he had sensed that day.</p><p></p><p>"Do not confront Qingshui Village for now!"</p><p></p><p>He felt there might be a true god hiding nearby.</p><p></p><p>He'd better keep a low profile for now.</p><p></p><p>Wait for that new god to descend, and let the new god deal with that ancient true god!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the temple guard captain nodded and said: "Recently, those people in Jinshi Town have been restless.</p><p></p><p>It seems because my lord hasn't made a move against Qingshui Village, quite a few people in Jinshi Town want to go to Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, Nangong Wuji had attacked the deity of Jinshi Town and killed him.</p><p></p><p>Now Jinshi Town was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Several village-level new gods below were fighting for power.</p><p></p><p>Many villagers wanted to go to Qingshui Village to seek refuge with the recently prominent Origin Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Ignorant commoners with limited vision." The wolf demon sneered contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>In his view, these ordinary people were like frogs in a well, only able to see the small patch of sky at the well's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Other new gods, and even ancient gods, didn't all look at the Origin Celestial Lord as if he were already dead?</p><p></p><p>"Well, don't they want to go to Qingshui Village?" The wolf demon's eyes flashed. "Secretly distribute the contents of the bottle to those who want to go to Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>The temple guard captain took the bottle, his eyes mischievous: "As you command!"</p><p></p><p>The contents of this bottle were the source of the plague.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, people from the five great families had visited the new gods of various towns for this very thing.</p><p></p><p>"Let them live for a while longer for now, but... don't let them live too comfortably!" the wolf demon said cruelly.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he returned to the temple.</p><p></p><p>The temple guard captain then left the temple, heading towards Jinshi Town.</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>It had only stopped briefly at noon, but by evening it was pouring again.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan and the others who were feasting, the meal was the same as usual, eaten with the same gusto.</p><p></p><p>But for the people of Jinshi Town, it only made their mood more gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the fate of Jinshi Town, the townspeople were divided in their opinions.</p><p></p><p>Some chose to flee and leave Feihuan City, some chose to stay in town, and quite a few were preparing to seek refuge in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>The next day, blood-red light once again illuminated the earth.</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting carried his sister back from the doctor's clinic.</p><p></p><p>He was tall, nearly two meters in height, and had always been a man of few words.</p><p></p><p>Their parents had died early, and he and his sister relied on each other to survive.</p><p></p><p>Back in the house, Wei Ting looked at his sleeping sister without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>He lifted up the back of his sister's clothes.</p><p></p><p>What met his eyes were dense black spots, with pus surrounding each black spot.</p><p></p><p>It looked very disgusting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the petite girl woke up and said in a weak voice: "Brother, am I going to die?"</p><p></p><p>"No, you won't." Wei Ting's voice could hardly be called gentle, it was dry and flat.</p><p></p><p>His eyes caught something, and he quietly pulled down his own sleeve to cover the black spots on his arm.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, don't lie to me, the doctor said I have the plague and can't be saved." The girl forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting had discovered his sister was feeling unwell last night.</p><p></p><p>At first, he had only brewed some medicine.</p><p></p><p>But in the middle of the night, he found that the spiritual energy in his sister's body seemed to be gnawed at by something.</p><p></p><p>Her whole body was covered in dense black spots.</p><p></p><p>Her aura had also become weak.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly took his sister to the town's clinic.</p><p></p><p>What he saw there was a cruel scene.</p><p></p><p>Outside the clinic were many patients like his sister.</p><p></p><p>He even saw several corpses.</p><p></p><p>One of them he knew well - it was the uncle from next door.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he and his little sister had decided to leave Jinshi Town for Qingshui Village. The uncle's family had chosen not to go, but had given Wei Ting some spiritual materials for cultivation to take to Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>But at the clinic, he saw the uncle's corpse.</p><p></p><p>The doctor told him his sister had contracted the plague and couldn't be cured. He told Wei Ting to take her home and find a place to bury her.</p><p></p><p>Before burying her, he should remember to use magic to isolate her.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, it's just a small illness, you'll get better." Wei Ting had never been good with words, nor at expressing his emotions.</p><p></p><p>Even when his parents died, he had silently buried them without shedding a single tear.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, let's go to Qingshui Village. I don't want to die in a place with evil gods." The girl grasped Wei Ting's hand.</p><p></p><p>She had deliberately added a layer of magic to her hand, just to avoid infecting Wei Ting.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Wei Ting pulled up his sister's clothes, picked up Wei He, and set off towards Qingshui Village in the heavy rain.</p><p></p><p>Between Jinshi Town and Qingshui Village were several villages with evil gods.</p><p></p><p>So Wei Ting walked very carefully, not daring to boldly fly through the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the heavy rain, he saw many townspeople from Jinshi Town like himself, secretly making their way to Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Among them, quite a few had extremely weak auras, as if they had contracted the plague.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly Wei Ting's foot went numb and his head buzzed. He felt the flesh on his back suddenly explode.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what's wrong?" Wei He asked worriedly, sensing something was off with her brother.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing." Wei Ting felt his spiritual energy becoming increasingly difficult to circulate, and his consciousness was becoming hazy.</p><p></p><p>However, he still gritted his teeth and increased his speed, rushing towards Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the rain was too heavy, with the water curtain connecting together, his vision became even more blurred.</p><p></p><p>His broad chest tightly held Wei He, as he pressed on through the heavy rain towards Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, he saw the crowd ahead and felt the stone in his heart drop.</p><p></p><p>The taut string in his heart loosened, and his body suddenly went soft. He fell in the wind and rain, his body splattered with mud.</p><p></p><p>He also fell into unconsciousness. In his last moment of awareness, he saw a group of people hurriedly walking towards him.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Wei Ting's consciousness awakened. With his eyes closed, he heard gentle voices conversing nearby.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, these people who came from Jinshi Town all carry the plague. The situation is very critical."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, the plague these people have is terrifying. It can corrode spiritual energy. Why don't we... drive them away..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wei Ting's heart tightened. He wanted to open his eyes, but he was too weak. He couldn't even lift his eyelids.</p><p></p><p>"Since they've come to Qingshui Village, they naturally count as my Origin Celestial Lord's people. </p><p>If they're sick, we'll treat them." The man speaking was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, population meant labor force.</p><p></p><p>There was also quite a bit of talent among the people of Jinshi Town.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he would need to visualize many immortals and gods. The people of Qingshui Village alone certainly wouldn't be enough.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, their plague is very serious... incurable." The doctor from Shi Family Village frowned as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Now, doctors from nearby villages had gathered together, but were at a loss regarding this plague.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised an eyebrow: "Call Xiao Xue here, and the other... Earth Gods."</p><p></p><p>He had appointed villagers who had visualized the Earth God as Earth Gods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was a bit curious why he was calling Xiao Xue.</p><p></p><p>However, she still hurriedly went to call Xiao Xue as Qi Yuan had instructed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was examining Wei Ting, a strange look in his eyes: "Strong build, he's a big fellow."</p><p></p><p>When Wei Ting had arrived, he was holding his sister in his arms.</p><p></p><p>According to others, they had tried to loosen Wei Ting's hands to take out the little girl in his arms, but were unable to do so.</p><p></p><p>He was holding her too tightly.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Xiao Xue and a group of Earth Gods arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, you called for me?" Xiao Xue's eyes showed curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, use your innate divine abilities to see if you can dispel the plague from these people." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Earth God deity actually had quite a few powers.</p><p></p><p>Dispelling plagues was one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" The maid Xiao Xue was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>She rarely used her innate divine abilities, having only used them twice before, both times for farming.</p><p></p><p>"Give it a try." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qi Qi showed a surprised expression: "Godfather, can Earth Gods treat illnesses too?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She found it increasingly difficult to understand this Earth God.</p><p></p><p>If it was just about farming, it seemed even more powerful than the Great Venerable Youlong, which was inconceivable. </p><p></p><p>Now, he could even cure diseases, which was truly ridiculous - it was like ridiculous's mom opening the door for ridiculous, ridiculous to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that the deities of the Blue Star were more useful.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xue immediately began to use her innate divine ability according to Qi Yuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi immediately said: "Please, heavens, dispel the plague and protect the people of my godfather's fief!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xue closed her eyes, and all the Earth Gods imitated her.</p><p></p><p>A moment passed, and Xiao Xue opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>There was now a drop of water on her jade-like hand.</p><p></p><p>This drop of water was clear and transparent, as if it could dispel all illnesses in the world.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xue flicked her hand.</p><p></p><p>The water droplet immediately dispersed, turning into countless tiny particles that fell into the bodies of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes immediately looked towards Wei Ting.</p><p></p><p>The other doctors also looked at the plague-ridden people of Jinshi Town.</p><p></p><p>"The black spots... are disappearing!"</p><p></p><p>"Their bodies are improving!"</p><p></p><p>"Their spiritual energy also seems to have improved quite a bit!"</p><p></p><p>The doctors discussed excitedly, all very surprised.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed and said: "As expected, since it's not a deity specifically in charge of plagues, the treatment effect is a bit worse. They'll need another round of treatment to fully recover."</p><p></p><p>The doctors nearby were speechless when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was also at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>This is what he calls a poor effect?! She felt that her godfather's words were enough to make countless doctors ashamed.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Qi thought of something and her eyes lit up. She suddenly said: "Godfather, I've realized that all of Xiao Xue's divine abilities involve asking for help from the heavens. Doesn't that mean... I can ask the heavens to turn me into a Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit exasperated with Qi Qi: "What are you trying to do, exploit a loophole?!"</p><p></p><p>The Earth God's divine ability connects heaven and earth, it's not a wish-granting machine!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Ting finally regained some strength. He opened his eyes and looked at his sister whose complexion had become rosy.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Qi Yuan, stood up, and clasped his fists in salute: "Thank you, Origin Venerable, for saving our lives. From now on, Wei Ting's life belongs to you, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting was usually taciturn, so saying this many words at once was rare for him.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," Qi Yuan waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers from Jinshi Town also woke up at this time and expressed their gratitude to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how did you contract this plague?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was actually very curious.</p><p></p><p>This was the world of immortal cultivation after all, how did these people suddenly get infected with a plague for no apparent reason?</p><p></p><p>And it wasn't just an ordinary plague.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know."</p><p></p><p>"It rained heavily yesterday, but when we woke up this morning we suddenly found black spots on our hands."</p><p></p><p>"Overnight, many people in town got the plague. Many died, we don't know why!"</p><p></p><p>The townspeople of Jinshi all had puzzled expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Some looked extremely sad, because people they knew had died.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Wei Ting clenched his fists as he remembered the corpse of his neighbor.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't know how they had contracted the plague.</p><p></p><p>But this plague had almost killed his sister.</p><p></p><p>This was absolutely unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>If he ever found out who was responsible, he would never let them off for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>"For now, let's focus on treating the patients. We'll deal with other matters... later."</p><p></p><p>For several days in a row, Jinshi Town seemed to have turned into a living hell.</p><p></p><p>Every day, more corpses were discovered in secluded corners.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, one could see a thin little girl carrying the corpse of her brother, walking home with blank eyes.</p><p></p><p>The news that Qingshui Village could treat the plague also spread quickly, and more and more residents of Jinshi Town rushed to Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two Purple Palace cultivators who had come from afar also arrived at Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>These two were members of the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The leader was an old man with white hair and beard, accompanied by a short man.</p><p></p><p>They both looked ordinary and unremarkable, easily blending into a crowd unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it seems Fehuang City is doomed," the old man spoke, his voice tinged with helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"It probably won't last three years," the short man judged. "It's a pity that Ancient God Yuan never awakened. If he had joined our Ancient God Alliance, there might have been a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>"The Huang family said there's an Ancient God with good potential here. Since we're passing by anyway, why don't we try to recruit them into our Ancient God Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The two conversed as they walked into Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, they had already investigated the background of the Origin Venerable. When they learned that he had two high-level God Observation Methods, both felt he was a promising talent.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Just then, the earth in front of them shifted.</p><p></p><p>A petite woman emerged from the ground, looking at the two warily.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man said with a smile: "We've come from afar to pay a visit to the Origin Venerable. We mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? I'll go inform him." The petite woman, who was of course Xiao Xue, suddenly vanished.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed. In the temple.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two envoys from the Ancient God Alliance and slowly said: "I appreciate your goodwill, but... I won't leave Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attitude was very firm, which caught the two Ancient God Alliance envoys off guard.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man wanted to try one more time: "Would the Ancient God Venerable really not reconsider?"</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the short man's eyes flickered: "We hear that the Venerable has created two God Observation Methods. Would you be willing to sell them to our Ancient God Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Not for sale. I'm keeping them for my own use," Qi Yuan refused without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the short man put on a sympathetic expression: "Fehuang City is destined to fall. Such God Observation Methods... may be lost to the world. I implore the Venerable to consider the common people and make a copy of the God Observation Methods for us, to prevent this legacy from being lost."</p><p></p><p>The short man's thinking was simple.</p><p></p><p>This deity of Qingshui Village was so stubborn, unwilling to leave Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>These two high-level God Observation Methods would surely be lost if left in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Such a waste - it would be better to give them to him.</p><p></p><p>If he brought them back, it would count as a great achievement.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Qi Yuan's gaze turned unfriendly: "Speaking like that is quite impolite."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man hurriedly grabbed the short man, wanting to say something.</p><p></p><p>However, the short man seemed not to notice Qi Yuan's displeasure and loudly said: "Our Ancient God Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>But halfway through his sentence, he suddenly stopped and quickly turned around, looking up at the northern sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked in that direction.</p><p></p><p>In the far north, a dazzlingly bright pillar of light suddenly descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>That pillar of light was at least thousands of miles away from Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>But the light was extremely bright.</p><p></p><p>Domineering, destructive, terrifying aura swept out, as if it would obliterate the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man's expression became solemn: "True Gods are battling!"</p><p></p><p>This was an Ancient God fighting a New God!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another pillar of light also shot up from the ground, with an unstoppable momentum.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the pillar of light from the sky, this pillar was obviously much weaker.</p><p></p><p>However, it still resolutely went to resist.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan squinted, watching the two pillars of light collide.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As the pillars made contact, Qi Yuan felt the world seem to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The pillar from the sky was clearly stronger.</p><p></p><p>It directly annihilated the pillar from the ground.</p><p></p><p>The pillar of light crashed into the earth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't see what happened next, but he could guess.</p><p></p><p>The city under that pillar of light... was probably gone.</p><p></p><p>The power levels in this world were very high, and the world was much more "sturdy" than the Azure Mist Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, a single strike from a Yin God could still completely erase a city.</p><p></p><p>"An Ancient God has fallen, alas." The white-haired old man sighed, his eyes full of grief.</p><p></p><p>The pillars of light just now were from a New God and an Ancient God battling.</p><p></p><p>When the two True Gods clashed, the Ancient God fell, and the city it protected turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the short man looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with a manic gleam: "Did you see that? This is what happens when you stay in a fallen area - living day to day, not knowing when you might die! Origin Venerable, only by coming with us to join the Ancient God Alliance do you have a chance of survival! Just give me your two God Observation Methods, and I'll recommend you to join the Ancient God Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The short man was somewhat frenzied at this point, or perhaps... trying to take advantage of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man beside him saw this and his expression changed drastically. He wanted to stop his companion.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw Qi Yuan's face turn cold as a blood-red longsword left its sheath.</p><p></p><p>"Those who dare threaten me... have not yet been born!"</p><p></p><p>With a sharp slash of the sword, the short man fell, following closely behind the Ancient God and the city it had protected.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to Iron Pillar for the 7,000 reward!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong's eyes flashed with a complex expression: "I can't see through him."</p><p></p><p>Ku Mu True Lord heard this and his eyes flashed with a moved expression.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong came to the Divine Light Sect, and previously there was only one person he couldn't see through, and that was the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak, Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>Now, there is another one, Qi Yuan? "So, was it Qi Yuan who killed the Broken Wolf?" Ku Mu True Lord stroked his beard, "His talent seems to have already barely grasped the threshold of the pinnacle geniuses, and he is also worthy of us focusing on cultivating him!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong chuckled lightly: "What if he doesn't want your cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Ku Mu True Lord heard this and was suddenly at a loss for words, then he said, "I will provide him with the resources he needs for cultivation, and help him smoothly advance to the Divine Infant realm!"</p><p></p><p>"That kid has always said he is laying the foundation of the Heavenly Dao, what if he wants to refine a Celestial Pill? Can you also provide him with the resources?" Elder Xuan Chong's words left Ku Mu True Lord speechless.</p><p></p><p>"To win over that kid, you have to give him what he needs. </p><p></p><p>For example, he seems to always want to enhance his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Those stockpiles you have, don't just keep them all, you have no hope of entering the Purple Palace in this life, so it's better to give those things to him.</p><p></p><p>Then explain the situation clearly, and everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Ku Mu True Lord fell silent.</p><p></p><p>That was his foundation, if he lost it, the probability of him stepping into the Purple Palace realm in this life would truly approach zero.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking, he was hesitating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My dear, are you afraid of me and dare not see your little darling wife?"</p><p></p><p>Not long after Qi Yuan finished eating the soul-dividing pill given by Elder Xuan Chong, he heard the voice in the game.</p><p></p><p>This time the voice was clearer, as if someone was speaking right next to his ear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ning Lao's voice made Qi Yuan angry.</p><p></p><p>It was like two people cursing each other online.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait, if I see you, I'll definitely hang you up and beat you!"</p><p></p><p>That Ning Lao, she was quite cute at first, always acting coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>Recently, she seems to have become particularly arrogant, constantly provoking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao's jade-like body was sprawled out, her snow-white jade-like cheeks hidden behind a black veil, her slender jade-like figure vaguely visible under the black dress.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, she smiled coquettishly: "My dear, your servant is waiting for your arrival."</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, she didn't get a response.</p><p></p><p>She put on an outer garment and walked out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>Several women in uniform uniforms came over, their eyes filled with reverent expressions.</p><p></p><p>Two of them with an aura of supreme power walked up: "Madam Palace Master, we have finally brought the Soul-Locking Jade after a hundred years of effort."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, they handed the Soul-Locking Jade to Ning Lao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao took the Soul-Locking Jade, her smile growing even more.</p><p></p><p>"My dear... this time, let's see where you can run?"</p><p></p><p>The Soul-Locking Jade was a precious treasure of the Flowing Wind Realm. </p><p></p><p>Its only function was to forcibly lock the divine soul of a powerful expert using the traces they had left behind.</p><p></p><p>Ning Lao had always wanted to find the owner of that voice.</p><p></p><p>Over the millennia, towards that voice, she had initially felt fear, gratitude, and a hint of dependence, and later it became even more complicated.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, the owner of the voice was most likely also a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>And she, Ning Lao, was among the best of the supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>She was not afraid of any supreme expert! "My dear, this time, I will lock you in the Demonic Egg.</p><p></p><p>I will temporarily seal your memories, and when the egg shell breaks, I will stand before you and tell you... that I am your mother."</p><p></p><p>The owner of that voice had, from the beginning in the young Ning Lao's heart, had a somewhat fatherly sentiment.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to do the opposite.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to imprison him by her side, nagging him every day.</p><p></p><p>After all, he always ignored her whenever he finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Soul-Locking Jade, Ning Lao began her plotting.</p><p></p><p>Locking the divine soul of a supreme expert with the Soul-Locking Jade was not a simple task.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and in the Flowing Wind Realm, a black mountain peak like a sharp sword pierced the sky.</p><p></p><p>On top of the mountain peak, there were palaces and pavilions, and figures moving about.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the dark world was illuminated by two beams of light.</p><p></p><p>Above the mountain peak, in the sky, two lantern-like eyes appeared.</p><p></p><p>Through those lantern-like pupils, one could vaguely see the ferocious countenance of a huge creature.</p><p></p><p>But what was hidden in the darkness, its form was unknown.</p><p></p><p>The huge pair of eyes swept across the world.</p><p></p><p>A vast voice came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Palace Master of the Heaven Heart Palace?"</p><p></p><p>In the Heaven Heart Palace, Ning Lao seemed to always be wearing the same black dress, without any changes.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Demonic Crocodile." Ning Lao appeared in the void, the wind blowing her dress, making her seem especially thin in the empty space.</p><p></p><p>"The South-North Decision has been officially signed, leave your name."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a touch of emotion flashed in Ning Lao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She never expected that the South-North Decision would finally be signed.</p><p></p><p>Since the day she was born, she had heard the voice of the South-North Decision.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was finally being signed.</p><p></p><p>This world would also determine the true victor.</p><p></p><p>The victor...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They are the masters of the world.</p><p></p><p>The losers, all shall be executed!</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her slender jade hand and left her name on the decision between the South and the North.</p><p></p><p>The giant demonic crocodile in the sky closed its eyes at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The world once again became dark.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao stood in the void, suddenly remembering that voice. She sighed inexplicably: "My husband, which camp are you in?"</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the forces are roughly divided into two camps.</p><p></p><p>The first camp, known as the Demon Subjugation, is called the Demon Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The second camp, known as the Demon Extermination, is called the Demon Slayers.</p><p></p><p>The two can be said to be completely incompatible.</p><p></p><p>When they meet, it is a battle to the death.</p><p></p><p>"The decision between the South and the North, the ten thousand and eight thousand cities, I don't know how long they can hold out." Ning Tao, dressed in a black dress, was born in the territory of the Demon Cultivators, and was also in the North of the decision between the South and the North.</p><p></p><p>"My husband, if you are a Demon Slayer, I must tie you up well, otherwise if you go against the demons, what if I get hurt?" </p><p></p><p>The general trend of the world is that the Demon Cultivators are stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Slayers, perhaps, will completely disappear into the mist of history.</p><p></p><p>This world will be a world where Demon Cultivators and Demonic Evils coexist.</p><p></p><p>This world will also be a world of madness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan accompanied Xiao Jia to lie on the board in the courtyard, sunbathing together.</p><p></p><p>Because Xiao Jia liked to lie on the board, Qi Yuan thoughtfully transformed the recliner into a board.</p><p></p><p>The two lay in the sunshine, feeling extremely comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia was still as silly and clumsy as the one Qi Yuan had seen in the game, stumbling as she walked.</p><p></p><p>The two had been separated for so many years, yet it was as if they had never been apart.</p><p></p><p>Outside the wooden house, Jiang Ling Su was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, she saw the special living being that Qi Yuan had brought back revive.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a foreign race.</p><p></p><p>There are many foreign races in the Azure Waves Realm, which is not surprising.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Jiang Ling Su was that the foreign races are usually proud and rarely interact with the human race.</p><p></p><p>The foreign race that Qi Yuan had brought back seemed to be like his little wife.</p><p></p><p>No matter where Qi Yuan went, the one named Xiao Jia, the foreign race, followed him like a little follower.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, tell me, how did you trick Xiao Jia into your hands?" Jiang Ling Su finally couldn't help but ask her question.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you think... I'm handsome?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He had conquered Xiao Jia with his good looks.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su heard this and was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother was indeed handsome, but as soon as he opened his mouth... it made people speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what is her background?" Jiang Ling Su was a little curious.</p><p></p><p>Her Kun Qian Mirror could not detect Xiao Jia's strength.</p><p></p><p>This was a very strange thing.</p><p></p><p>"She is the wife I married with a grand wedding." Qi Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to say, then don't say it." Jiang Ling Su said sourly, glaring at Qi Yuan and returning to her own thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a white crane flew in and landed in Qi Yuan's wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the huge white crane, Xiao Jia seemed very happy and got up to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xuan Chong's efficiency is not bad, the Soul Splitting Pill has been refined so quickly."</p><p></p><p>He took the gourd from the white crane.</p><p></p><p>The gourd was full of Soul Splitting Pills, a total of a hundred.</p><p></p><p>And the quality of these hundred Soul Splitting Pills was much better than the ones Elder Xuan Chong had given him before.</p><p></p><p>"With so many Soul Splitting Pills, it should be enough to raise my spiritual power to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, right?"</p><p></p><p>This middle stage of Foundation Establishment, of course, was not compared to ordinary cultivators, but Qi Yuan's own middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>He held the Soul Splitting Pills, the fragrance wafting.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia also took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to eat some candy?" Qi Yuan was very generous, taking out the Soul Splitting Pills.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia turned her head away and didn't look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot you don't have a mouth, you can't eat anything."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, and poured the Soul Splitting Pills into his own mouth.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan..."</p><p></p><p>In the market of the Divine Light Sect, a middle-aged man with a blank expression was drinking tea in silence.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The man's name was Luo Jing, a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Bright Palace.</p><p></p><p>He had secretly come to the Great Merchant with the Broken Wolf, plotting the Great Merchant.</p><p></p><p>At first, it was so glorious.</p><p></p><p>That Eighteenth Prince's beautiful princess had also become his plaything.</p><p></p><p>But the Broken Wolf had entered the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm and disappeared, and he was very likely to have perished.</p><p></p><p>Now he didn't dare to go back to the Bright Palace, nor did he dare to escape.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the mark left on him by the Broken Wolf's master would make him pay the price.</p><p></p><p>"This time, entering the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, Qi Yuan is the weakest.</p><p></p><p>I must capture him and find out the truth of what happened in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, otherwise I won't be able to explain it!"</p><p></p><p>These days, Luo Jing had been hiding in the market of the Divine Light Sect, quietly waiting for the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when that figure appeared, a fierce look flashed in Luo Jing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to blame, blame that you are the weakest!"</p><p></p><p>If it were Kang Fu Lu, he would need to put in some effort, but Qi Yuan would not!

        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, a burly man reeking of alcohol was punching and kicking an old man. Finally, the burly man snatched some broken silver coins from the old man's embrace and kicked the old man before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched, unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, look again." The elder waved his hand, and the scene changed.</p><p></p><p>The same burly man who had beaten the old man was now extremely filial towards him, carefully feeding him, pouring tea, helping him urinate, and wiping his body.</p><p></p><p>"It is because we have promulgated the law of filial piety that people in the world have begun to become filial. So we have come here to save the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan calmly smiled: "This is just a sham filial piety."</p><p></p><p>The elder, not hurried, said, "Young friend, do you know that if you had abolished the law of filial piety, the man in the scene would have killed his father that day. The responsibility for all this would fall on you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the elder with suspicion: "Is it your head or my head that has a problem? A demonic entity from another realm is actually starting to morally blackmail me?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Hearing this, the elder showed a helpless expression. "Young friend, we do not wish to be your enemy. But everything I said is true. We really are here to save this world."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not speak, he was on alert.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the elder continued:</p><p></p><p>"We fish and devour the flesh and blood of the masses, really out of necessity. Because... once we return to our proper rest, we will turn into terrifying demonic scourges. </p><p></p><p>Demonic scourges have no rationality and will only slaughter any living being they see. The strength of the demonic scourges will reach the fifth realm and wreak havoc on the world. </p><p></p><p>The appearance of any demonic scourge will plunge this world into ruin, and no one can stop it. </p><p></p><p>So we had no choice but to fish in the human world, consume flesh and blood, in order to extend our lifespan a little, so that the world would suffer less disaster."</p><p></p><p>The elder's face showed a sorrowful and compassionate expression, seeming truly concerned for the world.</p><p></p><p>"After we came to this realm, we also feared bringing disaster to this world. </p><p></p><p>So we specifically came to the Realm of Extremes. </p><p></p><p>Here, one day is ten years in the outside world. </p><p></p><p>The talents and martial artists that appear in the outside world in ten years are enough for us to replenish our lifespan. </p><p></p><p>The demonic scourges will not truly appear. </p><p></p><p>I do this with a heavy heart. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would we stay in this Realm of Extremes instead of going directly to the human world?"</p><p></p><p>The elder pleaded earnestly. </p><p></p><p>What he said seemed to make sense. </p><p></p><p>Once their lifespan was exhausted, they would turn into demonic scourges. </p><p></p><p>And the strength of the demonic scourges, from what he said, would be even stronger than them. </p><p></p><p>If there were one or two of them in the world, the human world would truly fall into calamity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stared into the old man's eyes and suddenly said, directly pointing to the key issue: "Since you will turn into demonic scourges after returning to your proper rest, how did you deal with the demonic scourges in the world you came from? Or how did you prevent the demonic scourges from appearing?"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the old man's gaze froze upon hearing this, and a painful expression appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the law of filial piety and the old man's words, Qi Yuan immediately understood. He looked at the old man and said word by word: "If returning to your proper rest leads to the appearance of demonic scourges, doesn't that mean..."</p><p></p><p>"You are not returning to your proper rest, so demonic scourges will not appear!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words brought painful memories to the old man.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he raised his head and looked at Qi Yuan, his expression agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know? I have been fighting for my family since I was seventeen years old. I have shed blood for my family, I have mined seventeen secret silver mines for my family, and I have even faced attacks from peers of the same level, with more than seven hundred large and small injuries on my body.</p><p></p><p>But why, why, when I am old, with only a few years left before death, are my family members discussing how to kill me? </p><p></p><p>They have even invited people from the Exorcism Association."</p><p></p><p>The old man was hysterical.</p><p></p><p>"They are the children I love the most, the ones I raised with my own hands. </p><p></p><p>And what do they want to do? I just want to return to my proper rest, is that wrong?</p><p></p><p>If it were you, would you accept such a fate?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, extremely agitated.</p><p></p><p>"What a boring setting." Qi Yuan looked at the old man and slowly said, "You are just a villain, the big boss I should slaughter. I'm not interested in how much suffering you've endured or how much injustice you've faced.</p><p></p><p>Even if you turn into a pitiful, weeping beauty lamenting your miserable and forced life, I won't be overwhelmed by empathy, nor will I be particularly interested.</p><p></p><p>What I'm most interested in is using my great sword to chop off your dog's head!"</p><p></p><p>After all, he's just a big boss, so just kill him directly.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face turned gloomy: "Are you sure you want to be our enemy? Have you prepared for the consequences of doing so?"</p><p></p><p>The old man did not want to fight Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because their condition was not good. </p><p></p><p>If they fought, their lifespan would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's strength was far beyond the group of heavenly deities.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I want to be your enemy, but it's destined that I will defeat you bastards!</p><p></p><p>I am the young man who slays evil dragons!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said and immediately attacked! "You're courting death!" The old man was furious.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're all old fogeys, while I'm young and vigorous!" Qi Yuan had already found the weakness of these demonic entities from another realm.</p><p></p><p>Their lifespan was not much. </p><p></p><p>And now, all the black-robed guards had been slain.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qi Yuan blocked the only entrance to the Realm of Extremes, these old fogeys would not be able to replenish their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan would continue to fight them.</p><p></p><p>These demonic entities from another realm would then be unable to return to their proper rest.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this method is easy to think of, but that doesn't mean anyone can do it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished speaking, holding his great sword and standing at the bronze gate, the only entrance to the Realm of Extremes.</p><p></p><p>He lazily looked at the crowd: "Those from the heavens return to the heavens, those from the human world return to the human world, I'll come and act as the South Heaven Gate Guardian!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood with his sword, blocking the gate.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, several cold voices came from the depths.</p><p></p><p>"Overestimating your abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I want one-tenth of his flesh and blood."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, how dare he block us in the divine domain!"</p><p></p><p>As the voices fell, five powerful figures suddenly appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These five figures had terrifying auras, similar to the scholarly and refined old man.</p><p></p><p>They gathered with the scholarly and refined old man, pressing towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these six people, holding his treasure sword, his eyes filled with puzzlement: "Is this all the demonic entities from another realm? This boss is too easy to defeat, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The scholarly and refined old man let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky of the Realm of Extremes suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up and saw countless glowing eyes in the sky, silently staring at him.</p><p></p><p>However, the owners of these eyes seemed to be in a special state and unable to act rashly. </p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's view, they were likely in a dormant state.</p><p></p><p>Once the dormant state was broken, their lifespan would be depleted much faster.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sight made Qi Yuan shudder involuntarily: "So you've brought a team, haven't you? A team of big bosses?"</p><p></p><p>A team of big bosses? </p><p></p><p>This was too much! Qi Yuan immediately felt discouraged.</p><p></p><p>"It's not too late to beg for mercy now!" The old man spoke, looking at Qi Yuan coldly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't care, though he felt discouraged, he still spoke firmly: "It seems that today I will do a little 'old man killing'!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held his sword, blocking the gate of the Realm of Extremes.</p><p></p><p>The six 119-level experts simultaneously attacked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical power!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan activated his own great skill.</p><p></p><p>He strengthened his body, doubling his own qualities.</p><p></p><p>Slashing Heaven Sword Technique! He swung his sword, and the six old experts felt a great threat.</p><p></p><p>They retreated in succession.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>"I have to use my origin power!"</p><p></p><p>These six experts suddenly displayed the same ability as the scholarly and refined old man before.</p><p></p><p>"The more origin power we use, the less lifespan we have left. We can no longer hold back, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The six experts attacked again, this time all using their strongest techniques.</p><p></p><p>Facing the attacks of these six experts far surpassing his own strength, Qi Yuan was unafraid.</p><p></p><p>In the Ascension Platform, Qi Yuan had experienced countless battles, some of which involved simultaneously facing three thousand experts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>His combat experience had reached a superb level.</p><p></p><p>He held his sword, attacking while defending!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>A sword strike, and the air rippled with blood energy.</p><p></p><p>The six experts' blood and qi surged.</p><p></p><p>However, the white-haired old man suddenly laughed loudly: "Meat, the meat is so delicious! It was worth it to forcibly use my origin power, it was worth it!"</p><p></p><p>Somehow, he now had a bloody piece of meat in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at his chest, and there was a bloody wound that he didn't even know when it appeared.</p><p></p><p>He was injured.</p><p></p><p>The blood was dripping.</p><p></p><p>On the first day he arrived, he was already injured.</p><p></p><p>The old man held the piece of meat, his eyes filled with greed. </p><p></p><p>He stuck out his snake-like tongue and swallowed Qi Yuan's piece of flesh.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he widened his eyes, looking at Qi Yuan: "No taste!"</p><p></p><p>The other five demonic entities from another realm also froze, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"His flesh and blood are not flesh and blood at all, they cannot replenish our lifespan!" The white-haired old man was furious, "What are you?"</p><p></p><p>He had just used so much origin power, and his lifespan had been greatly reduced again.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to seize a piece of Qi Yuan's flesh to supplement himself.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Qi Yuan's flesh had no taste.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the six demonic entities: "My flesh and blood have no taste, that's great."</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel surprised, but also normal.</p><p></p><p>He raised his sword, looking at the six demonic entities: "I'm young and vigorous, I'll outlive you old fogeys!"</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that he couldn't log off and secretly eat a braised pork rice, or else he would have even more energy.</p><p></p><p>"No, ordinary methods can't hurt him.</p><p>I don't have much time left, I have to kill him and replenish my flesh and blood.</p><p>Everyone, don't hold back any longer, use your origin power to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He!" the old man with the appearance of a child exclaimed urgently.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly using the primal source, his lifespan in the Abyss was almost depleted, with only a day left.</p><p></p><p>"You bunch of old fogeys, come at me?" Qi Yuan held his sword, undaunted even in his injured state.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Six powerful experts, after eliminating the old man with the appearance of a child, simultaneously unleashed primal source attacks against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body was covered with five more wounds.</p><p></p><p>The blood flowed. He had sustained serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's my turn!"</p><p></p><p>Death Radiance! Heavenly Sword Art! Tyrannical Might!</p><p></p><p>The three most powerful techniques were unleashed simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan targeted the old man with the appearance of a child.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, no!" Faced with this sword strike, the old man with the appearance of a child was in excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>As a fellow divine realm expert, he was no match for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only by using the power of the primal source could he evade this strike.</p><p></p><p>But he was reluctant to use it.</p><p></p><p>That would mean certain death for him.</p><p></p><p>He chose to resist with the strength of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he was not necessarily weaker than Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But... the sword shattered him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the dead old man, his entire body covered in blood, and grinned, "The hunt begins!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining five demonic beings from the outer realms looked at Qi Yuan with a hint of fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>If they were trapped here, they had no way to replenish their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>They came from the same realm, belonging to the same source, and could only sustain themselves by devouring each other's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast sound echoed from the distant heavens.</p><p></p><p>"We have broken through the seal, even at the cost of our lifespan, to slay this vicious predator!"</p><p></p><p>Twelve terrifying experts appeared, emanating an extremely formidable aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, though covered in wounds, looked at these experts with unwavering determination.</p><p></p><p>"Come, I am young and strong, unafraid of you old fogeys!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Years passed, a century had gone by in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The once-mighty Alliance of a Hundred Cities had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Only a few elders and warriors still mentioned the name of the Alliance of a Hundred Cities.</p><p></p><p>Some said that the Alliance of a Hundred Cities was a living hell, where evil demons devoured people every day.</p><p></p><p>There was a swordsman with no face, leading a young girl, who used a blood-red dragon sword to single-handedly destroy the hundred cities and slay the demonic lair.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these rumors, some young men expressed disbelief. According to the tales, the Alliance of a Hundred Cities had nearly a hundred supreme overlords, how could they be slain by a single supreme overlord?</p><p></p><p>Others, however, were greatly excited, donning faceless masks and carrying treasured swords, claiming to be the Faceless Sword Deity.</p><p></p><p>Many changes had occurred in the mortal realm, and information about the Faceless Sword Deity became increasingly scarce.</p><p></p><p>Near the ancient Qichu Cypress, a kingdom called the Moon Empire was gradually established.</p><p></p><p>And at that time, in a wooden hut by the shores of Lake Seven, a young girl with a pale complexion curled up, her eyes filled with concern, "Master... are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Over these hundred years, she had not matured or grown, still appearing as a seven-year-old.</p><p></p><p>When the master had departed, he had slain the demonic beings from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>She had inscribed a lunar mark on the master's arm.</p><p></p><p>The lunar mark was insignificant, but it could take on a portion of the master's injuries.</p><p></p><p>The amount of injury she could bear was related to her and the master's respective strengths.</p><p></p><p>If she were as strong as the master, she could take on half of his injuries.</p><p></p><p>But after a century of arduous cultivation, she was not even a hundredth or a thousandth as strong as the master, so the injuries she could bear were far less than a fraction.</p><p></p><p>Yet, she could feel the excruciating pain every day.</p><p></p><p>It had been continuous, unending.</p><p></p><p>The master's strength was far beyond hers, so what kind of suffering and injuries must he be facing? The lunar maiden curled up, her face pale, and continued her diligent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>If she were stronger, the pain the master endured would be lessened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, a bunch of old fools, still hesitating, wanting to live?" </p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Abyss, Qi Yuan sat on the steps.</p><p></p><p>He was covered in blood, like a living embodiment of blood.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they would see that there was not a single intact piece of flesh on his body.</p><p></p><p>His body was riddled with wounds, even his eyeballs were half-shattered.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he still stood guard at the door, his face bearing a crazed grin.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Responding to him were the cold voices of the demonic beings from the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan responded with a single "kill" word, drawing his sword and unleashing it like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Empowered by the Death Radiance, he fought with ever-increasing fervor, like an invincible god of death.</p><p></p><p>It was thanks to the Death Radiance, a powerful skill that could absorb blood, that he was able to persist for so long.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, facing the attacks of so many higher-level old fogeys, he would have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>Over the past several days, he had replaced eight hundred of the old fogeys in the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>That's why he had the audacity to be so arrogant! This was an assault by thousands of demonic beings from the outer realms against Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>No, this was Qi Yuan single-handedly taking on a massive boss.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>If he didn't go berserk, he wouldn't survive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fought alone against hundreds of demonic beings from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>These demonic beings held nothing back, unleashing their primal source attacks without restraint, most of which landed on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that if they didn't resolve this troublesome individual, they would all perish.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, facing these numerous attacks, was not the least bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>Years of tempering had ingrained his combat experience into his very bones.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was severely wounded, even though he was constantly being grievously injured.</p><p></p><p>Even though he appeared on the verge of collapse and falling at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He still gripped his sword, killing more and more.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're all becoming more and more useless!"</p><p></p><p>"When I first arrived, every primal source attack could land on me.</p><p></p><p>But now, one-third of your primal source attacks can't even hit me!"</p><p></p><p>"And can you still evade my sword?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan laughed as he swung his treasured sword, struggling to slay another demonic being from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>A massive amount of experience flooded into him.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't use it to level up.</p><p></p><p>But the feeling of gaining something every time he killed someone was highly addictive to him.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the heavens, at the decreasing number of eyes.</p><p></p><p>He shouted loudly, "No way, no way, 2,700 old fools can't defeat me, a young lad?"</p><p></p><p>The demonic beings from the outer realms looked at Qi Yuan's state with terror in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's body had not a single intact piece of flesh.</p><p></p><p>More than half of his flesh had been torn away, exposing his stark white bones.</p><p></p><p>Flesh was the source.</p><p></p><p>With such horrific injuries, even they could not endure.</p><p></p><p>All the demonic beings from the outer realms felt a heavy weight in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, countless years had gone by in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>The coffin lid was overturned.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of terrifying figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>These were the divine realm experts who had been slumbering in the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, the people from the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land arrived at the Five Elements Forbidden Land through a teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Yinxiang looked at the group and coldly said, "The Demon Slaying Assembly... has begun."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky, where they saw the celestial phenomenon of the Heavenly Wolf devouring the Moon.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wolf devouring the Moon signified the start of the Demon Slaying Assembly.</p><p></p><p>This was the time when the demonic beings from the outer realms were at their weakest.</p><p></p><p>It was also the best opportunity for them to face the demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Lord of the Robe Faction?" Funeral Flower Immortal swept her gaze across the group and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judge replied calmly, "He's likely gone to the mortal realm to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Slaying Assembly is about to begin, and he hasn't returned yet?" Funeral Flower Immortal's expression became complex, "Could something have happened?"</p><p></p><p>The others had various expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, we have all been marked by the demonic beings from the outer realms, so if we leave the forbidden land, we will be lured and devoured by the blood and flesh."</p><p></p><p>"We cannot leave, and those outside cannot enter, so we cannot know the Lord of the Robe Faction's current situation. Could something really have happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, he might have fled in the face of battle, afraid." A yin-yang strange voice suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, don't make unfounded speculations." Funeral Flower Immortal spoke up, glaring at the person, "The Lord of the Robe Faction may have been delayed, let's wait for one more day."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you making unfounded speculations as well?" </p><p></p><p>"This is a reasonable inference!" Funeral Flower Immortal retorted, glaring coldly at the person.</p><p></p><p>The person, obviously fearing Funeral Flower Immortal, did not speak further.</p><p></p><p>The group fell silent and did not voice any more opinions on the matter.</p><p></p><p>They waited in place, discussing the affairs of the Demon Slaying Assembly.</p><p></p><p>A day later, they still had not seen the arrival of the Lord of the Robe Faction.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judge looked at the celestial signs and slowly spoke, "Let's wait one more day."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's entire body had not a single intact piece of flesh, even his bones were not complete.</p><p></p><p>His slender finger bones tightly gripped the sword as he thrust it, piercing the heart of the crazed demonic being from the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the last demonic being, a smile appeared on his blood-and-flesh-covered face.</p><p></p><p>"Is it finally over?"</p><p></p><p>After so many days, he had finally eliminated all the demonic beings from the outer realms in the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, some demonic beings even cried and begged, asking to be adopted as his son.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paid no heed, killing them all without mercy.</p><p></p><p>He stood guard at the bronze gate, sword in hand, not allowing any demonic being from the outer realms to leave.</p><p></p><p>Those driven to madness also unleashed their powerful abilities, countless attacks landing on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>His injuries were extremely severe.</p><p></p><p>His heart was also extremely weary.</p><p></p><p>All these days, he had been killing without rest, afraid to stop.</p><p></p><p>Because if he stopped, he knew he might never wake up again.</p><p></p><p>Even now, after slaying all his enemies, he remained tense, keeping his mind in an excited state.</p><p></p><p>Half his body leaned against the bronze gate, his eyes cold.</p><p></p><p>"The fragments of the Heavenly Dao are finally in my hands."</p><p></p><p>He also knew that he would face the greatest challenge he had encountered since arriving in this game.</p><p></p><p>The game was not over yet.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother looked at the position where Qi Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>What she saw was merely emptiness. </p><p></p><p>As if there was no one there at all.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed like an illusion, not truly existing.</p><p></p><p>"We've met once in the future?" The Foodless Holy Mother said without joy or sorrow, murmuring, "Just once?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan didn't say more.</p><p></p><p>That was the first time he had seen the Foodless Holy Mother, witnessing her death.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well say that right after meeting her for the first time, she died.</p><p></p><p>That would be too emotionally insensitive.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother looked at Qi Yuan, suddenly smiling brightly: "I see."</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if her doubts had been resolved, or everything had been confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that you're not one to smile by nature?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>After meeting the Foodless Holy Mother once before, Qi Yuan had met many of her followers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had learned more about the Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>In their descriptions, the Foodless Holy Mother was not only the number one person in the Mortal Heart Realm with astonishing combat power, but also naturally disinclined to smile and particularly true to her word.</p><p></p><p>"How can anyone naturally dislike smiling?" The Foodless Holy Mother asked in return, "Am I supposed to smile at just anyone I see?"</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother wore a pink round-necked short jacket on her upper body, and a more vibrantly red long skirt embroidered with flowers on her lower body. Her black hair fell to her waist, and her pretty face once again showed a charming smile, brightening even the pitch-black night.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the records are all lies," Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the records, the Foodless Holy Mother was described as serious and not smiling, detached from worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>Probably all that was deification by later generations.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Foodless Holy Mother before him, Qi Yuan felt there was something strange about her, as if she was hiding some secret.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has curiosity. Aren't you afraid that I was just lying to you earlier? After all, the fact that I've seen you in the future is something no sane person would believe," Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the future Foodless Holy Mother saw him, she didn't show any sign of recognizing him.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan very curious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Foodless Holy Mother he met later was not the same as today's Foodless Holy Mother? Or perhaps she had been kicked in the head by a donkey and lost her memory.</p><p></p><p>"If you believe it, it exists. If you don't believe it, it doesn't. Belief or disbelief is not important," the Foodless Holy Mother spoke, her voice like a tinkling mountain spring.</p><p></p><p>"...Your level is a bit high. I'm just a normal person, full of curiosity," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dwell on this topic.</p><p></p><p>His encounter with the Foodless Holy Mother was just a chance meeting.</p><p></p><p>She was destined to fade into the mists of history.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't change history, nor did he have the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he asked, "Have the Evil Gods... appeared in the Mortal Heart Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother's gaze suddenly became sharp. Even though they were not in the same space-time, Qi Yuan seemed to feel a bone-chilling coldness, like an unsheathed ice sword.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"They are the great enemies of the Mortal Heart Realm. Among them are one or two Yang Gods," Qi Yuan told the Foodless Holy Mother the information from the future.</p><p></p><p>He thought that if the Mortal Heart Realm got this information, perhaps they could slightly change their fate.</p><p></p><p>However, even if they changed... it might not make much difference.</p><p></p><p>The gap in hard power is not something that can be dealt with just by being prepared in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Foodless Holy Mother's expression didn't change much, as if she had just heard about two small insects.</p><p></p><p>This puzzled Qi Yuan, and he couldn't help saying, "You don't think that everything I said before was a lie, do you?"</p><p></p><p>If the Foodless Holy Mother thought this way, then her previous reactions would be very normal.</p><p></p><p>She probably thought he was some kind of fortune teller.</p><p></p><p>"How much of what you've told me is true, and how much is false?" The Foodless Holy Mother looked in Qi Yuan's direction, as if trying to stare into his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you really don't believe me." Qi Yuan shrugged, too lazy to explain.</p><p></p><p>He had no need to make others trust him.</p><p></p><p>He and the Foodless Holy Mother were just casual acquaintances after all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't ponder on those things anymore, he went straight to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"What did you mean earlier when you said the Sky Pillar was breaking?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Can visualization also cause the Sky Pillar to break? Wasn't the Sky Pillar... broken by the impact of a Yang God?</p><p></p><p>"The Visualization Mountain is a projection of the Sky Pillar, and the two have a great connection. </p><p></p><p>The Sky Pillar is not stable now. If you forcefully visualize again, it might not be able to bear the burden and break," the Foodless Holy Mother explained.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan frowned: "It can be like that?"</p><p></p><p>He had never heard this information before.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the towering Sky Pillar and murmured, "This Sky Pillar is too fragile. It can't even withstand visualizing the Thunder Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>What would happen if he continued to visualize and broke the Sky Pillar with his visualization?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a sudden idea.</p><p></p><p>If so, wouldn't that change history? The Sky Pillar would not be broken by the Yang God's impact.</p><p></p><p>"If the Sky Pillar breaks, the Mortal Heart Realm will fall into an irredeemable state," the Foodless Holy Mother seemed to hear Qi Yuan's thoughts, and she lightly spoke of the dangers of the Sky Pillar breaking.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Sky Pillar be repaired?" Qi Yuan looked at the Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to visualize other people.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Pillar couldn't really break.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple," said the Foodless Holy Mother. "Eat."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"When I broke through to the Great Venerable realm, my body transformed into the Sky Pillar, becoming one with it.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Pillar is me, and I am the Sky Pillar," the Foodless Holy Mother spoke, her voice calm.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan, and then made him feel a bit guilty: "Doesn't that mean I just broke one of your bones with my visualization?"</p><p></p><p>When he visualized the Thunder Ancestor and cracks appeared on the Visualization Mountain, if it was reflected on the Foodless Holy Mother's body, it meant the Foodless Holy Mother was injured.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother gave Qi Yuan a white-eyed look with her almond-shaped eyes: "To repair the Sky Pillar is not difficult, I just need to... eat something, and the Sky Pillar will become stable again."</p><p></p><p>"That simple?" Qi Yuan was surprised and found it incredible. He blurted out, "I'll treat you to a meal!"</p><p></p><p>In the past, of course, he couldn't really treat the Foodless Holy Mother to a meal, but he could return to Qingshui Village and bring the Foodless Holy Mother's spirit tablet to future feasts to invite her to eat.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he definitely wouldn't say these things out loud.</p><p></p><p>That would be too emotionally insensitive and might get him beaten up.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother glanced at Qi Yuan, seeming to recall something: "It's been a long time since I've eaten anything."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded. The Foodless Holy Mother indeed didn't eat.</p><p></p><p>Her way emphasized that when a person is born, they are most perfect and flawless. Breathing air, drinking water, and eating food pollute oneself, as all things have poison.</p><p></p><p>"Then you should eat quickly!" Qi Yuan urged.</p><p></p><p>Only when the Foodless Holy Mother ate would the Sky Pillar be repaired.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became a bit anxious: "Have you developed anorexia?"</p><p></p><p>"Sort of."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you cultivating immortality? How can you get anorexia? Worst case, cut open your stomach and stuff food in!" Qi Yuan offered suggestions for the Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the red dress looked at Qi Yuan. Her hand grasped the edge of her pink short jacket, lifting it slightly to reveal snow-white skin. The woman's waist was very narrow, with a beautiful waistline.</p><p></p><p>She coldly looked at Qi Yuan: "You want to do the cutting?"</p><p></p><p>"Just kidding," Qi Yuan laughed.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't that perverted.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to eat something?" Qi Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and continued, "A person died today in Liujia Village a thousand miles away. Do you want to attend the funeral feast?"</p><p></p><p>He was making this up.</p><p></p><p>But surely someone had died a thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>After all, people die every moment in this world.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly hearing about the feast, the frost on the Fasting Holy Mother's face dissipated. "You make it for me to eat."</p><p></p><p>"You're making things difficult for Panghu!" Qi Yuan said helplessly. "I only know how to make two dishes - one is stir-fried ice cubes with cold water, and the other is boiled ice cubes."</p><p></p><p>Make my ass! He was currently in the past and couldn't touch anything, so of course he couldn't cook.</p><p></p><p>"But I can guide you on how to cook." As a spring water commander, Qi Yuan was most adept at this.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Holy Mother had finally agreed to eat, so he naturally wanted to accommodate her.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want braised fish or steamed fish?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Holy Mother was slightly stunned, looking a bit dazed. "I like spicy food."</p><p></p><p>"Braised fish!" Qi Yuan said excitedly. </p><p></p><p>He had finally persuaded the Fasting Holy Mother to eat.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, he secretly asked, "How much do you need to eat for the Pillar of Heaven to be fully repaired?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably... before you leave." The Fasting Holy Mother didn't directly answer this question.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know I'll leave?" Qi Yuan looked into the Fasting Holy Mother's eyes, as if trying to see some useful information.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... you'll stay here forever?" There was a smile in the Fasting Holy Mother's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"...No." </p><p></p><p>The Lost Glow Stick had a time limit. He could stay in the past for at most four days.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the brilliant smile in the eyes of the woman in red, he couldn't help but ask, "Have we met before?"</p><p></p><p>The Lost Glow Stick had one use left.</p><p></p><p>In the last use, had he met the Fasting Holy Mother?</p><p></p><p>"Never." The woman in red shook her head. "When will you teach me how to make braised fish?"</p><p></p><p>"Now, immediately, right away!" Qi Yuan was very proactive. "But before I leave, I need to enter the realm of contemplation a day in advance to observe the gods."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The Fasting Holy Mother nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have pots, bowls, ladles, and other utensils? What about seasonings?" Qi Yuan scanned the bamboo house where the Fasting Holy Mother was staying. It was completely empty.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"No." The Fasting Holy Mother shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you conjure some?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>As great venerable ones, conjuring these things would be very simple.</p><p></p><p>They could even conjure a complete braised fish.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Holy Mother ignored Qi Yuan's words and moved with light steps. "Buy them down the mountain."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan had no choice but to follow.</p><p></p><p>"Buy more. I'm afraid you might break the spatula with your strength," Qi Yuan said, following closely behind the Fasting Holy Mother as they left the place.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead, the lake was clear, the aquatic plants were green, and fish swam, swishing their tails and causing ripples.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the Fasting Holy Mother stood above the lake.</p><p></p><p>"There are many fish in this lake. We could make a hundred-fish banquet."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Pillar of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Ling Zhong, who had left not long ago, returned again.</p><p></p><p>Without a head on his shoulders, he looked particularly eerie in the dark night.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a towering mountain that reached into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Ling Zhong spoke in a heavy voice: "The Pillar of Heaven is unstable. Has the Fasting Holy Mother... been injured?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fan Xin stood side by side with Great Venerable Ling Zhong, looking worried: "With the invasion of evil gods now, the Pillar of Heaven is of utmost importance and cannot be compromised."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, several true gods following behind looked curiously at the Pillar of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>These young true gods were very curious about the legendary Fasting Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had the chance to meet her in person, they were naturally nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Is it true that the Fasting Holy Mother is as cold as ice and never smiles?" an ancient god asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"With fasting as her name, the Fasting Holy Mother's way is unclear to people."</p><p></p><p>"It's not just unclear, it's unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>I heard that when the Fasting Holy Mother was young, a legendary figure saw her talent and gifted her divine realm nectar.</p><p></p><p>But the Fasting Holy Mother refused, saying she doesn't consume anything."</p><p></p><p>When a venerable one mentioned this, his eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>That was divine realm nectar, which could awaken the embryonic form of a divine realm when consumed.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Holy Mother was able to refuse such a priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>She truly doesn't eat anything.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fan Xin's face showed a reminiscent expression: "The legendary figure you mentioned was me."</p><p></p><p>To this day, he still couldn't understand why the Fasting Holy Mother wouldn't eat.</p><p></p><p>Divine realm nectar was the purest of treasures, a primordial substance. Even if consumed, it wouldn't affect the Fasting Holy Mother's great way.</p><p></p><p>But she still refused.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Ling Zhong spoke at this time: "I've known her for a thousand years. She doesn't eat mortal food and even... has some aversion to food.</p><p></p><p>Remember, in front of the Fasting Holy Mother, don't mention eating, drinking, or even food. Otherwise... you'll face the consequences."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the venerable ones behind were somewhat afraid.</p><p></p><p>The Fasting Holy Mother's reputation preceded her.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly hid all the pills, nectars, and wines they had on them in their storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if discovered by the Fasting Holy Mother, they might anger such an unpredictable figure.</p><p></p><p>"Why has the Fasting Holy Mother left the Pillar of Heaven? Strange, since merging with the pillar, she hasn't left for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fan Xin looked at the Pillar of Heaven ahead, his gaze surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Pillar of Heaven had always been in disrepair, on the verge of collapse at any time.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Fasting Holy Mother had always resided within the Pillar of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's someone!" an ancient god spoke up at this time.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over and saw a stream of light slowly passing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Within the light, a woman in red clothes, with skin like snow, of incomparable beauty, her black hair like a waterfall, and a shallow dimple on her smiling face.</p><p></p><p>She looked like a person from a painting.</p><p></p><p>However, this fairy-like figure was holding three pots and several spatulas in her hands, with pots, bowls, ladles, and other utensils hanging at her waist.</p><p></p><p>"Is that... the Fasting Holy Mother?" An ancient god blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This seemed somewhat different from what they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Fasting Holy Mother supposed to abstain from mortal food?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't she known for never smiling? Why was she grinning to herself while alone, holding pots in her hands and with a kitchen knife hanging at her waist?</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fan Xin was also stunned, almost thinking he had mistaken someone else for her.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Great Venerable Ling Zhong had no head, otherwise his expression at this moment would surely have been very interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Fasting... what are you doing?" Great Venerable Ling Zhong voiced his confusion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone, the Fasting Holy Mother's faint smile had not yet faded. She glanced sideways, looking at the group with deep eyes: "Why have you returned?"</p><p></p><p>That was the look.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Ling Zhong breathed a sigh of relief. This was the Fasting Holy Mother he knew.</p><p></p><p>Just now must have been an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing the things hanging at the Fasting Holy Mother's waist, he still couldn't keep his composure.</p><p></p><p>"The Pillar of Heaven is unstable. Old Man Fan Xin and I came to check." Great Venerable Ling Zhong said, "Are you unharmed?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine," the Fasting Holy Mother said flatly.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Fan Xin then asked, "Can the Fasting Holy Mother participate in the battle at the Dragon Rising Grounds half a year from now?"</p><p></p><p>With the Pillar of Heaven unstable, Old Man Fan Xin feared the Fasting Holy Mother might be injured, affecting the battle to repel the evil gods at the Dragon Rising Grounds.</p><p></p><p>"I can," the Fasting Holy Mother said briefly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

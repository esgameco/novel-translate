        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Three red booklets appeared. Golden Canary held one, Little Wedding Dress's sleeve grasped one, and Qi Yuan also held one.</p><p></p><p>The camera on Zero One's head recorded this scene.</p><p></p><p>"I used to see people with cameras on their heads in videos. Now I finally understand - they were robots!" Qi Yuan had another new discovery today.</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary smiled mischievously: "This young lady can also grow a camera on her head."</p><p></p><p>With her words, a camera sprouted from the top of her head. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>From Little Wedding Dress's sleeve, a wooden sign with a "happy" expression slipped out.</p><p></p><p>Zero One then said: "The video has been edited with music, and the copy has been finalized. The master can publish it at any time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan logged into his account and found the video from earlier in his drafts.</p><p></p><p>The video didn't show any faces, just three hands and three marriage certificates. </p><p></p><p>Or more precisely, two hands and one sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally my turn to show off!" Qi Yuan happily clicked to post.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Xie Xinsu was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>She had been dazed since seeing Ning Tao yesterday. </p><p></p><p>Today... she had just woken up to see a moving wedding dress.</p><p></p><p>And... it had even obtained a marriage certificate with the cold and emotionless master.</p><p></p><p>She was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a demon race?"</p><p></p><p>"A puppet?"</p><p></p><p>"Or what?"</p><p></p><p>She was utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>This Golden Canary was clearly a cultivator with powerful abilities, so how could she share a husband with an "alien race"?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she also felt a vague sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly felt that her previous life's cultivation level of Yuan Dan... seemed insignificant.</p><p></p><p>This alien called Little Wedding Dress had an extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>"Dog Master... could Cat Master also have an extraordinary background?" </p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought arose in Xie Xinsu's mind.</p><p></p><p>She quickly shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible. If he had an extraordinary background, why would he practice martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>How could someone who had entered the path of immortal cultivation take the path of martial arts?</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of this world had limited prospects.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu's mind was in a fog, with many thoughts her current cat brain couldn't sort out.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, busy with the wedding, and we still have to attend the banquet tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately there's just the three of us on our household register, otherwise we'd have to toast guests.</p><p></p><p>Now it's good, we even saved on the officiant's fee." Qi Yuan waved his hand, in quite a good mood.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had saved money again, and had accumulated another sum for purchasing Arching Stars.</p><p></p><p>"People have been notified, the hotel has been booked, time to start cultivating... martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan played games, always keeping the game tasks in mind.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts was the task.</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary and Little Wedding Dress were life.</p><p></p><p>"I'll sunbathe with Big Sister Little Wedding Dress!"</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary pulled Little Wedding Dress to sunbathe on the balcony.</p><p></p><p>The house was full of joy and harmony.</p><p></p><p>Back in the room, Qi Yuan continued his martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a cheat that allowed him to endlessly devour demon blood essence to increase his cultivation,</p><p></p><p>cultivation still required effort.</p><p></p><p>"Using martial arts blood energy to transform into storage space... it's so troublesome to cultivate, it needs... one night?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had obtained this martial technique at his base in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's too troublesome to cultivate, I'll just add points."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt it was better to be lazy.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the bed, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A faint exotic fragrance wafted over. He knew it was Golden Canary's scent.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but recall Golden Canary's appearance not long ago - her petite figure, dazed expression, shattered gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, oh Qi Yuan, be a hardworking person, abstain from lust!"</p><p></p><p>"Only about fifty demon blood essences left, have to use them sparingly."</p><p></p><p>"You used ten drops of demon blood essence, starting to compress your blood energy throughout your body, then expanding it.</p><p></p><p>Ding... Blood energy space successfully opened, area 0.01 cubic meters."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan examined his body internally and found an additional blood energy space inside.</p><p></p><p>"The space is a bit small... but it's fine, let's leave it at that."</p><p></p><p>Although he could use demon blood essence to expand the space, Qi Yuan didn't do so.</p><p></p><p>He needed to keep some demon blood essence in reserve for unforeseen needs.</p><p></p><p>He was very strong, but still had the mindset of being prepared for danger in times of peace.</p><p></p><p>"This diligent cultivation session had good results.</p><p></p><p>The biggest gain was that my voice acting made a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The word 'ding' is truly the essence of the system."</p><p></p><p>The more Qi Yuan thought about it, the more proud he felt of himself.</p><p></p><p>This sense of accomplishment was no different from skipping a pebble seventeen times across water.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the next task will start?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't have enough demon blood essence."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What heavy rain."</p><p></p><p>In the dark basement, Shen Yang looked at the damp floor, his eyes revealing a trace of worry.</p><p></p><p>His living space was less than 10 square meters, with a monthly rent of 500 yuan.</p><p></p><p>In this kind of first-tier city, it was considered quite good to have a place to stay.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, someone came today to inform him that those crude, low buildings and basements were not fit for human habitation and posed safety hazards.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew about the hazards, but who would want to live in such a place?</p><p></p><p>Last time, he lived in a house like a rural outhouse, but unfortunately a typhoon blew the house away, forcing him to move.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found a new tiny home, and now he had to leave again.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, making money is so hard, but compared to guarding a small plot of land back home, at least I can save some money here and have hope."</p><p></p><p>After a day of hard labor, his body now ached all over, completely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He could only browse short videos to relieve boredom and fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Although he secretly felt discontent and wanted to improve, not wanting to accept his fate, living in such a world... what could he do?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a video caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>He paused, his eyes revealing an envious look.</p><p></p><p>"These privileged people are getting bolder, showing off marriage certificates, three at once, not even trying to hide it."</p><p></p><p>"There should be a law prohibiting flaunting wealth, otherwise us commoners can't stand it."</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang thought randomly, then smiled.</p><p></p><p>He opened the comments section and browsed casually.</p><p></p><p>"Envying the privileged every day!"</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, teach me!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you married two wives at once!"</p><p></p><p>"Couldn't help it, reported it!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't get it wrong, this isn't a privileged person, this is an immortal cultivation master. Didn't you see, his previous video was selling immortal cultivation techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang was stunned when he saw this comment.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang couldn't help but recall recent online discussions.</p><p></p><p>"This world... it can't really be about to change drastically, can it? It's getting more and more fantastical."</p><p></p><p>Like the Martial Arts Tournament, where champion Qi Yuan broke martial arts limits, turning his opponent into a mist of blood with one punch; or Spiderweb Island, where immortal light flickered, and over ten thousand infant girl corpses were discovered inside.</p><p></p><p>Or the nationwide vote in Qinyuan Country to decide the fate of the Mu family of the Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>Or the additional sun that appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>All sorts of bizarre events happening one after another.</p><p></p><p>Most people vaguely sensed that great changes were about to occur in the world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps an unprecedented transformation was imminent.</p><p></p><p>"If I became an immortal cultivator, couldn't I also marry two wives?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just imagining.</p><p></p><p>If he became an immortal cultivator, he would help the world when successful.</p><p></p><p>He clicked on the profile of the person who married two wives and looked at his first video.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal cultivation technique... one hundred million?"</p><p></p><p>"And it sold?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it... be real!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang's heart suddenly stirred, and he followed the account.</p><p></p><p>"Should I... take a bold step?"</p><p></p><p>He knew that in this world, apart from background, most people's talents weren't that different.</p><p></p><p>Being a little bolder, he might... gain unexpected rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to donate to send a private message?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yang gritted his teeth, recharged to donate, then sent a message saying "Congratulations on your wedding".</p><p></p><p>Now, the previous video only had a few dozen comments, and those wanting to send private messages were probably very few.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, needing to donate to send a private message deterred many people.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night had fully fallen, with the round moon shining brightly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Too bad, this moon is different from the one in Canglang Realm."</p><p></p><p>The moon in Canglang Realm was the projection of the Moon God Sovereign across the myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>This moon was the satellite of Arching Star.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, husband? Do you want to return to Canglang Realm?" </p><p></p><p>The door gently opened as a young woman in a black spaghetti strap dress entered the room. Her snow-white shoulders were exposed to the air, with the unique fragrance and delicate skin of a young woman.</p><p></p><p>Her skin had a sickly paleness, whiter than frost or snow, but now faint red marks could vaguely be seen.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the young woman's body was too petite, there was a large gap between the upper edge of the slip and her chest. With snow-white skin like mutton fat jade, Qi Yuan could see everything with just a glance down.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can return anytime I want. It's just that the time flow is different. The game hasn't ended, so it's better to stay here," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>He also took the opportunity to pull Ning Tao into his arms.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I need to stay for at least a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>To become the Human Dao Martial Sovereign, he needed to be champion one hundred times.</p><p></p><p>Now it was only once!</p><p></p><p>Still ninety-nine times to go.</p><p></p><p>That's ninety-nine years.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years is so short!" The young woman tightly grasped Qi Yuan's arm.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I've now reached the Great Perfection of Divine Infant stage and can summon you to Canglang Realm anytime.</p><p></p><p>As for... the Solar Golden Core, it can just hang in the sky by itself.</p><p></p><p>I guess... it can also devour suns."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young woman's face lit up with joy, but then she said: "No, I... still need to stay in the sky often to comprehend the Divine Domain."</p><p></p><p>On the Solar Golden Core, she was constantly in a state between forgetting and not forgetting.</p><p></p><p>Time was the foundation of her Divine Domain.</p><p></p><p>Only on the Solar Golden Core could she quickly comprehend the Divine Domain and increase her strength.</p><p></p><p>Placed elsewhere, it might take thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of years to slowly progress.</p><p></p><p>Staying on the Solar Golden Core would allow her strength to increase faster.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to be like on Nine Pan Mountain, only able to be his burden, helplessly watching him enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Although she liked the feeling of being protected,</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to always be like that.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hesitated, pondering something: "Your Divine Domain is the Dao of Time.</p><p></p><p>I think... you could pursue graduate studies. The technology here is quite interesting, it might help with your Dao of Time."</p><p></p><p>"Graduate studies?" The young woman was slightly stunned, seeming to seriously consider it.</p><p></p><p>"And get a doctorate while you're at it, then you'll be Dr. Wife in the future." Qi Yuan said softly, then continued, "As the saying goes, the first sword after reaching shore is to slay one's lover. You won't kick me aside after getting your doctorate, will you?"</p><p></p><p>"You..." The young woman seemed somewhat angry, "I'll kick you right now!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha..." Qi Yuan chuckled, "Actually, I think immortal cultivation is also..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a kind of science.</p><p></p><p>In this world, when stars age and die, they may become black holes.</p><p></p><p>You say, if I were to make my golden core die out, would it also turn into a black hole?</p><p></p><p>You should know, black holes are a mysterious celestial body, even more terrifying compared to stars.</p><p></p><p>I even have a feeling that if I entered a black hole now, I would instantly be torn to pieces."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just Qi Yuan's speculation. </p><p></p><p>He had never entered a black hole, or even seen one.</p><p></p><p>This universe... was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it could only be considered a small universe, just the size of a galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Qi Yuan's current strength was still very weak, unable to discover many other things.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of... if you're not sure, it's better not to try." The girl was very nervous for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I've always been very steady."</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't steady, he would have already turned his divine infant into a black hole.</p><p></p><p>After all, the golden core transforming into an infant was very similar to a star turning into a black hole.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were other reasons, namely that Qi Yuan was reluctant to part with his star-like golden core.</p><p></p><p>With the golden core hanging in the sky, illuminating all the heavens, how impressive was that?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, who said that the Yang Spirit was the endpoint of cultivation? His golden core path could also reach the other shore.</p><p></p><p>Later when he had more golden cores, the sky would be full of his suns. He could casually shatter a few stars to play with and see if they could turn into black holes.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I... must work hard too!" The girl nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"Working hard is fine, just don't work hard while I'm sleeping." Qi Yuan spoke, looking at the girl with a hint of pity in his eyes, "You must be quite lonely alone on the sun."</p><p></p><p>"It's very hot there, how could it be lonely!" The girl smiled coquettishly, then seemed to think of something and her voice became hesitant, "My lord need not worry, if you miss me... you can call me down anytime, I..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her actions became bolder, fidgeting rather restlessly in Qi Yuan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sly smile flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Goldfinch, stop pretending to be Ning Tao!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Goldfinch's face instantly turned red with embarrassment, her bold movements coming to an abrupt halt. She looked flustered, "Blood Pearl, you're talking nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath, her mouth was sealed shut and her body stiffened.</p><p></p><p>"Mmph..."</p><p></p><p>A dozen breaths later, she was directly subdued by Qi Yuan and pressed down onto the bed.</p><p></p><p>She sat up, hunching her back to Qi Yuan, and said breathlessly: "How did you figure out it was me!"</p><p></p><p>"If it were Ning Tao, I'd be the one pinned down right now." Qi Yuan held Goldfinch's slender waist, his eyes revealing a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also understood that Ning Tao was her, Goldfinch was also her - they were all the person he cared about.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the hotel lobby.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat formed on the hotel manager's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he had received a call from someone booking a wedding at their hotel.</p><p></p><p>At first, he thought it would be a big order.</p><p></p><p>But... just one table? He actually felt it was somewhat... laughable and pitiful.</p><p></p><p>Booking just one table for a wedding, how shabby was that?</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, he realized business was hard to come by these days, so he still reserved a private room for the newlyweds and even offered them a discounted price.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't expect that a while later, a group of uninvited guests would arrive and give some instructions.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he understand that he himself was the laughable and pitiful one.</p><p></p><p>A top-level dignitary was holding their wedding ceremony at his hotel.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought it was a VIP trying to keep a low profile by choosing their hotel.</p><p></p><p>A group of officials instructed them not to disclose anything about today's events.</p><p></p><p>But... no one told him that the bride was not just one person.</p><p></p><p>Well... that's not right, one of them was human, the other was not human.</p><p></p><p>Acting as a waiter himself to serve tea and pour water, his legs trembled as he entered that private room.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't the only one embarrassing himself.</p><p></p><p>The men and women raising wine glasses to drink in the room were all trembling, afraid of spilling their wine.</p><p></p><p>My goodness! The hotel manager felt his worldview collapsing.</p><p></p><p>It was his first time hosting a wedding for someone who... wasn't human.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the private room, Qi Yuan held up a wine glass filled with soft drinks and scanned the crowd: "Why aren't you all smiling? Are you not naturally cheerful people?"</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan hurriedly put on a smile: "Mr. Qi, it's just that Miss Ning Tao is too beautiful, we're a bit nervous."</p><p></p><p>"Is Little Bride not beautiful?" Qi Yuan couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>He never played favorites.</p><p></p><p>"She's beautiful!" Kuanghuan nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan gripped her wine glass and also nodded vigorously. At this moment, her mood was a mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to her previous thoughts, she felt ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Initially, she had found Qi Yuan quite handsome and even had some feelings, though of course, she had such feelings for many celebrities.</p><p></p><p>When she learned Qi Yuan had a mental illness, she had snuffed out those feelings.</p><p></p><p>After all, she couldn't lose face like that.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing Qi Yuan's wives - one an incomparably beautiful Ning Tao, and the other... a wedding dress.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly felt that her past self was... laughably terrible.</p><p></p><p>Those present all had different thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's body also trembled slightly with irrepressible excitement.</p><p></p><p>Originally, because of Qi Yuan, she had already developed a rift with her manager.</p><p></p><p>Working diligently as a driver, but in the end... gaining nothing.</p><p></p><p>Now... just being able to attend this wedding was already worth it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Zhong Niao's face: "Doctor, has your kidney deficiency improved?"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, everyone present turned their gaze to Zhong Niao's face.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Qi said Zhong Niao had kidney deficiency, she definitely had kidney deficiency.</p><p></p><p>However, at such a young age, how could she already have kidney deficiency?</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao's face instantly turned red, but she still couldn't help retorting: "I don't have kidney deficiency!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, she had come to persuade Qi Yuan not to harm other girls.</p><p></p><p>After all, a mentally ill person getting married would just be holding someone back.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that the one being "harmed" was... a wedding dress, all the words she had prepared were swallowed back down.</p><p></p><p>What could she say now?</p><p></p><p>Although she was a bit willful, she wasn't stupid. She was afraid of being beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you give me a drop of your blood, I'll help you research your kidney deficiency." Qi Yuan spoke again at this time.</p><p></p><p>Now, after entering the Golden Core stage, he had also vaguely sensed the special qualities in Wu Qi's blood, as well as in the blood of the child brought back from Guiran earlier.</p><p></p><p>For him, it was indeed of great use.</p><p></p><p>It could nourish the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>When in the Mortal Heart Realm, Qi Yuan had formed the divine infant of the Primordial Chaos Divine Demon.</p><p></p><p>These divine infants were him, yet not him, still retaining a trace of true spirit.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all in a state of dormancy now.</p><p></p><p>He had placed these divine infants in the Ancient Mirror of Tiankun to nurture them.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had discovered an even better place.</p><p></p><p>That is, people like Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he could place the divine infants to reside in the bodies of these people. Their bodies would then have additional grandfathers or grandmothers.</p><p></p><p>These grandfathers and grandmothers would occasionally awaken, guiding them to increase their strength, and in turn nourishing their divine souls, allowing them to truly awaken.</p><p></p><p>Once these divine infants awakened on their own and transformed into subjects, they could cultivate on their own.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation of visualizing powerful Blue Star Divine Demons, plus the resource boost from the mysterious alien legacy grounds.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation progress of these subjects would be astonishing.</p><p></p><p>With limitless potential.</p><p></p><p>Each could become a Yang Spirit!</p><p></p><p>By then, to what level would Qi Yuan's strength reach? Of course, these were just speculations.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan was just a small Elemental Core.</p><p></p><p>To summon the divine infants would require reaching the Divine Infant realm, which was still far off.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps by that time, this world would have already undergone a spiritual energy revival, with numerous immortal cultivation worlds connecting to it, and many immortal sects descending to recruit disciples and leave behind legacies.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan might be going around distributing grandfathers and grandmothers, competing with those sects for disciples.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, Doctor Zhong was similar to Wu Qi in some ways, yet also different.</p><p></p><p>That's why Qi Yuan wanted a drop of her blood, to explore the truth.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have kidney deficiency, and I won't give you my blood!" Zhong Niao said vigilantly.</p><p></p><p>She had dealt with Qi Yuan many times, so she wasn't very afraid of him.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, you may have lost a grandmother." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't force others.</p><p></p><p>"I lost my grandmother long ago!" Zhong Niao couldn't help retorting again.</p><p></p><p>"That's why I was planning to recommend a grandmother to you. If you like, I could even recommend a grandfather." Qi Yuan was very generous.</p><p></p><p>With over four thousand divine infants, he needed to find quite a few people.</p><p></p><p>But for now, those who met the conditions were just Wu Qi, and Yaji and his sister who were brought back from Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>Doctor Zhong might count as half.</p><p></p><p>"No need, thank you!" Zhong Niao was very suspicious if Qi Yuan's condition had worsened, "Did you not take the medicine I prescribed for you last time?"</p><p></p><p>With a doctor's benevolent heart, she still asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless: "You should take care of your own kidney deficiency first. You haven't slept well in a long time. If you keep having nightmares, who knows when you might be gone."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhong Niao's face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>That dream was indeed terrifying and extremely frightening.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Wu Qi: "How about I send you a grandmother in a while?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's head was in a daze.</p><p></p><p>How come she was also being sent a grandmother? She didn't have the courage of Zhong Niao, so she could only grit her teeth and agree: "Okay, I will definitely treat her like my own grandmother!"</p><p></p><p>"I might not only send a big grandmother, but also a second grandmother." Qi Yuan spoke carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi could only smile and reply: "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu watched this scene, also smiling foolishly.</p><p></p><p>The conversation here was too high-level, he couldn't understand at all.</p><p></p><p>Toasting and drinking, the wedding banquet was eaten in a joyous atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>After sending everyone away, Qi Yuan embraced Ning Tao and held Little Bride's hand, their figures flashing as they returned to his room.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily: "Finally ate at my own banquet, though it was a wedding banquet. I missed the funeral banquet last time, it's probably... the biggest regret in my remaining life."</p><p></p><p>Not attending his own funeral and not eating at his own banquet was truly one of the three great regrets in life.</p><p></p><p>If asked what the other two regrets were, Qi Yuan didn't know, because he had made them up.</p><p></p><p>"We can make up for it!" Goldfinch said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Her body was small and petite, charming and adorable. She had to jump lightly to reach Qi Yuan's eyes, so Qi Yuan always hugged her to kiss.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's not auspicious."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>Then, he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Look, what did I buy for you?"</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch hurriedly took it and opened what was in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Her face instantly turned red, and she said through gritted teeth: "It's still daytime, Blood Pearl!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what are you thinking? Aren't you going to take the graduate school entrance exam? I bought you a school uniform!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Goldfinch's face turned even redder.</p><p></p><p>"I've already pulled some strings to let you take the exam for our Tianyue City graduate school!" Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Goldfinch nodded, "This young lady will take the exam, what about you?"</p><p></p><p>"I will naturally practice martial arts, and also... I have a premonition that the mission for the Underworld is about to come. I need to go in to complete the mission."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity this young lady can't go in.

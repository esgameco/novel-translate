        <h1>Chapter 436</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But now, this confidence and dominance moved them.</p><p></p><p>Among the many geniuses present, who wasn't convinced by Black Sword?</p><p></p><p>Even Ice Sword, though he wouldn't admit it verbally, had always been striving to catch up to Black Sword. </p><p></p><p>Although he knew, the more he chased, the bigger the gap became.</p><p></p><p>But what did this Blood Robe just say?</p><p></p><p>Black Sword hasn't grasped the Great Principle, and isn't qualified to be his goal! All the geniuses were shaken, looking at Qi Yuan with various expressions.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe was challenging Black Sword!</p><p></p><p>Or rather, declaring war on Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>The old affairs of Purple Origin Heaven were unsealed in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Many seemed to smell the scent of gunpowder and war.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of how Purple Origin Heaven's ancestor directly sent Blood Robe the Black Demon Ancestor's blood, they couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword represented the Great Elder of Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Half of the other nine elders were disciples of the Great Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Elder of Purple Origin Heaven was as well.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sixth Elder had grievances with the Great Elder and was always dissatisfied. This wasn't a big secret within Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Blood Robe challenging Black Sword, everyone smelled thick gunpowder.</p><p></p><p>Was this a continuation of the struggle between the Sixth Elder and... the Great Elder?</p><p></p><p>But... did this Blood Robe... really have the confidence to match Black Sword?</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting, there was once a master of the Supreme Principle who visited Black Demon Abyss. Upon seeing Black Sword, he said, "In my youth, I was far inferior to Black Sword."</p><p></p><p>Of course, they didn't know that Qi Yuan didn't have that intention at all.</p><p></p><p>Others said he wanted to surpass Black Sword, to make Black Sword his goal.</p><p></p><p>He simply wanted to prove his innocence. The person he wanted to surpass, Black Sword wasn't qualified enough.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's expression remained unchanged, as calm as a chrysanthemum: "I've only walked a bit ahead of you, there's no need to make me your goal to surpass."</p><p></p><p>It seemed he didn't take Qi Yuan's words to heart.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu looked at Black Sword, her eyes full of stars, then turned to Qi Yuan with disdain: "Look at Brother Black Sword, then look at you, you can see the difference."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan didn't quite understand An Xun Lu's words, "I see, he's not as good-looking as me, that's the difference."</p><p></p><p>"You!" An Xun Lu was about to die of anger, "What nonsense are you saying, Brother Black Sword's talent is a hundred times stronger than yours, his appearance surpasses yours a hundred times!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to argue with An Xun Lu anymore.</p><p></p><p>He could see she was a fanatic.</p><p></p><p>He disliked fanatics the most. Arguing with fanatics was meaningless, they would make up all sorts of things in their minds.</p><p></p><p>However, Purple Origin Xiao Lu beside them couldn't help but say: "Clearly Senior Brother Blood Robe looks better than Senior Brother Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Purple Origin Xiao Lu, you're blind!" An Xun Lu was surprised that the usually shy girl would contradict her.</p><p></p><p>"My eyes are fine, Senior Brother Blood Robe is clearly better looking!" Purple Origin Xiao Lu's face flushed red, obviously arguing wasn't her strong suit.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" An Xun Lu changed the subject, because indeed... Blood Robe was much better looking than Brother Black Sword, "Brother Black Sword is a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable, our Black Demon Abyss's number one genius, his talent far surpasses Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe just started cultivating the 'Ancestor Blood Scripture' late, given enough time, surpassing Black Sword wouldn't be a problem!" Purple Origin Xiao Lu argued reasonably.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>This Purple Origin Xiao Lu... seemed to be his fanatic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly felt he had been biased, viewing a certain group through colored glasses.</p><p></p><p>There were good people among "fanatics" too.</p><p></p><p>The two girls argued endlessly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Black Sword spoke, his voice calm: "There's one more thing to announce.</p><p></p><p>The Principle Discourse Meeting will begin soon. The younger generation has thirty spots to go observe.</p><p></p><p>The observation spots will be allocated based on contributions to Black Demon Abyss."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the geniuses present suddenly changed expression, their breathing becoming rapid.</p><p></p><p>The Principle Discourse Meeting was one of the Sixth Heaven's grandest events.</p><p></p><p>At that time, all Yang Spirits and forces that received invitations would go to the Principle Assembly for discourse.</p><p></p><p>That was Yang Spirits discoursing, comprehending principles!</p><p></p><p>For geniuses like them, the benefits were immense, laying the foundation for their future paths.</p><p></p><p>It could be said, if they had some insights, it could save tens of thousands of years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, ordinary cultivators had no qualifications to participate.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary Yang Spirits, without working for free for the Principle Assembly, had no qualifications to participate.</p><p></p><p>Only top holy lands like Black Demon Abyss had more spots, even allowing the younger generation to participate.</p><p></p><p>"Contributions... looks like we can't cultivate anymore, we have to go do missions!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I haven't done missions in so many years!"</p><p></p><p>"There's less than a year until the Principle Discourse Meeting, how many contributions can we amass?"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses present had solemn expressions, some happy, some worried.</p><p></p><p>There were two ways to obtain contribution points: one was doing missions, the other was breaking through in the 'Ancestor Blood Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level breakthrough in the 'Ancestor Blood Scripture', the more contribution points obtained.</p><p></p><p>For example, Ice Sword had already reached the eighth level of the 'Ancestor Blood Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>Just the contribution points he could exchange from this were enough to support him getting a spot for the Principle Discourse Meeting.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Venerable's lesson ended, everyone slowly left.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Lu's face was a bit red now, obviously she rarely argued with people and was not skilled at it.</p><p></p><p>She frowned at times, pondered at times, seeming to be replaying her argument in her mind, thinking about where she could further optimize.</p><p></p><p>At this time, An Xun Lu suddenly attacked her from nearby, speaking sarcastically: "Senior Brother Blood Robe just came to Purple Origin Heaven, just started cultivating the 'Ancestor Blood Scripture', and hasn't done any missions. He'll probably miss this Principle Discourse Meeting, what a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt nothing hearing these words.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't qualify, he still had Mo Chi's invitation.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he could just pretend to be Mo Chi and go.</p><p></p><p>However, it angered Purple Origin Xiao Lu greatly, she directly turned her head and refused to look at An Xun Lu.</p><p></p><p>She wouldn't listen to bad comments.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu was smug, seeming to declare victory. She didn't pay attention to Qi Yuan anymore, but went towards the mountain peak to see Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Lu's face bore a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>She waved her hand, revealing many mission lists inside.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the mission lists with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe, the contribution points for these missions are too few, and they take too much time, you..."</p><p></p><p>She was very worried for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Robe's talent was absolutely terrifying, but if he didn't go to the Principle Discourse Meeting, it would be a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>The gap with Black Sword would only grow larger.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine." Qi Yuan's expression was lazy. He looked at the mission list below and suddenly asked, "These contribution points... can they be exchanged for Black Demon Ancestor's blood?"</p><p></p><p>Because he found that many missions on it were related to the Mo Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Mo Luo clan stopped paying tribute, causing quite a stir in Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Many new missions were related to the Mo Luo clan.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to complete them, he could do so with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>For example, one of the missions was to go to the Fifth Heaven, communicate with the Mo Luo clan, and get them to pay at least 100 portions of Mi Luo Light as tribute.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was good at these missions.</p><p></p><p>"No." Purple Origin Xiao Lu shook her head, her expression troubled.</p><p></p><p>The preciousness of Black Demon Ancestor's blood meant that apart from Great Principles, there were almost no other ways to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>She saw Qi Yuan's gaze fixed on the Mo Luo clan section, and thought of something: "Could it be that Senior Brother Blood Robe can solve these Mo Luo clan missions?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother came from the Demon Abyss, and likely had a close relationship with the Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>His question seemed to indicate he was confident about completing the Demon Clan's tasks.</p><p></p><p>"I can handle it," Qi Yuan said honestly. </p><p></p><p>Purple Origin's eyes lit up: "Blood Robe Senior Brother is so amazing. Why don't you take on these tasks? If you complete them, it should be enough to attend the Ultimate Dao Conference."</p><p></p><p>"I won't complete them," Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Was he an idiot to go complete these tasks?</p><p></p><p>Completing the tasks would indeed earn contribution points, but he would lose out.</p><p></p><p>Most of these tasks involved making the Demon Clan pay tribute. </p><p></p><p>The Demon Clan was all his. Taking his own things to pay tribute to the Black Demon Abyss in exchange for a pitiful amount of contribution points - had he lost his mind?</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Purple Origin was confused and didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"Little Pink Horn, don't worry. I have my own plans regarding contribution points," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Couldn't he get contribution points without doing tasks?</p><p></p><p>Just upgrade the Ancestral Blood Scripture a bit.</p><p></p><p>"How many levels of the Ancestral Blood Scripture need to be exchanged for enough contribution points to attend the Ultimate Dao Conference?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Six levels gives you a chance... To be safe, seven levels!" Purple Origin seemed to understand Qi Yuan's thinking, but felt it was a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't ask further and just answered directly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it'll be done tonight then," Qi Yuan said with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He not only wanted to attend this Ultimate Dao Conference as Magic Flame Venerable, but also use Blood Robe's spot.</p><p></p><p>After all, he now had connections.</p><p></p><p>With a great Ultimate Dao master backing him, it would be convenient to do things.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Purple Origin blinked, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>But she was always shy. Since Qi Yuan didn't explain further, she didn't dare to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the place in Purple Sky Heaven to test Ancestral Blood Scripture cultivation progress? I want to go test and exchange for contribution points!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Purple Origin's eyes widened and her breathing quickened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Was Blood Robe Senior Brother going to exchange his Ancestral Blood Scripture cultivation level for contribution points?</p><p></p><p>Did this mean he had cultivated to at least the first level, or second level, or even third level?</p><p></p><p>The fastest record for the Ancestral Blood Scripture was set by Black Sword - entering the third level in half a month, and the fourth level in three months.</p><p></p><p>And he was far ahead of others.</p><p></p><p>For example, it took her a full year just for the first level.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues for several more paragraphs describing interactions between other characters]</p>

        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Instant Kill!</p><p></p><p>That's right, another instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Facing a King-level, Qi Yuan instantly killed them.</p><p></p><p>Facing Emperor-level, Qi Yuan still instantly killed them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his people didn't even get up, they were still sitting on the blue stones.</p><p></p><p>With just a casual wave of his hand, seven Emperor-level experts fell dead.</p><p></p><p>What kind of realm is this? Is he truly a supreme Emperor?</p><p></p><p>On the pavilion, Cold Moon's small face was filled with shock, and the woman in black beside her also had a horrified expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held a bowl of fish soup: "You'd better drink it quickly, the bloody smell will come over here if you don't."</p><p></p><p>He said as he slowly savored the fish soup.</p><p></p><p>"The taste is not bad, almost as good as my shijie's spirit fish soup."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan praised.</p><p></p><p>This praise seemed to be well-received, as the Moon Girl's face broke into a sweet smile, and the crescent moon in her eyes turned into a full moon.</p><p></p><p>However, the little girl thought of something, suddenly stepped forward and ran towards the seven corpses, wanting to retrieve Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"No need to pick it up, the sword is already stuck there. Whoever crosses this sword will be killed!" Qi Yuan laughed.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was timid and fearful, even scared to sleep at night when facing a Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the game, of course, he had to be a bit more unrestrained, striking hard.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he kept cowering, he would become a laughingstock.</p><p></p><p>On the pavilion, Cold Moon watched this scene, her eyes filled with admiration and longing.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Deity!"</p><p></p><p>The woman in black was also extremely excited: "The Faceless Sword Deity, he must have come out of the forbidden area."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The fat man sitting high up had a face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"What do you all think of the Moon Imperial Clan of the Seventh Month Branch?"</p><p></p><p>In the hall, there were more than twenty supreme Emperor-level experts seated.</p><p></p><p>"With a snap of the fingers, they can be extinguished!" A supreme Emperor-level expert spoke, his voice as majestic as a bell.</p><p></p><p>"The Southern Domain only has these barbarians left resisting, as long as we annihilate them, the entire Southern Domain will be ours." A female supreme Emperor-level expert spoke, her voice quite ethereal.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a thin and agile old man spoke up: "I heard that there is a supreme Emperor-level expert near the Seventh Month Lake, his strength is very powerful, he killed our Hundred Cities Alliance's seven Emperors with a single sword, we must be vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Should we report this to..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Even if that Faceless Sword Deity is strong, can he defeat the twenty-five of us?</p><p>Can he defeat our three thousand Iron Floating Troops?" The thin old man spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there's no need to trouble that one.</p><p>We have three thousand Iron Floating Troops, all elite warriors, and we are here, how can we not kill that Faceless Sword Deity?" </p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed animatedly, all agreeing.</p><p></p><p>They were experienced and knew the Faceless Sword Deity's strength was formidable.</p><p></p><p>They feared the Faceless Sword Deity, but they feared the Black-Robed Guardians even more.</p><p></p><p>If the Black-Robed Guardians appeared, not only their enemies would die, but they themselves as well!</p><p></p><p>And they were nothing more than cannon fodder for the Black-Robed Guardians.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the Black-Robed Guardians, all are equal.</p><p>Even they could be casually devoured, leaving only a human skin behind.</p><p></p><p>So, unless absolutely necessary, they dared not summon the Black-Robed Guardians.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, it's settled then, in ten days.</p><p>We will act, three thousand Iron Floating Troops, crush the Moon Imperial Clan!</p><p>Their two Holy Maidens must be captured, to be sacrificed... to the Heavens!" The fat Buddha-like man spoke, setting the tone for the plan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After killing those seven short-sighted Emperor-level experts, the Hundred Cities Alliance people did not come again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still sat on the blue stones by the Seventh Month Lake every day.</p><p></p><p>The little girl Moon Girl sat next to Qi Yuan, silent, also looking at the snowy lake.</p><p></p><p>The big and small, almost became two snowmen.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan's enthusiasm was burning, and he even helped the Moon Girl to keep warm and ward off the cold.</p><p></p><p>The little girl sat next to Qi Yuan, not showing any signs of feeling cold.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Cold Moon, the next Sacrificial Priestess of the Seventh Month, also came to see Qi Yuan, and told him about the Hundred Cities Alliance's impending large-scale attack.</p><p></p><p>She urged Qi Yuan to take the Holy Maiden and leave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Cold Moon and said, "I'm enjoying the snow with her here."</p><p></p><p>Cold Moon, upon hearing this, did not say anything, only saying gloomily, "If the senior is not strong enough, you can abandon us and leave."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Don't worry, if the situation is too tough, I'll play dead immediately."</p><p></p><p>After Cold Moon left, it wasn't long before the woman in black came.</p><p></p><p>She knelt on the ground and paid respects to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of the old friend in the Five Elements Forbidden Land, and said, "Three hundred years later, the Demon Subjugation Assembly will begin, and if there are no accidents, we will eliminate the external demonic forces."</p><p></p><p>The woman in black left with tears in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The lakeside became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>The heavy snow continued for several days.</p><p>The snow piled up thicker and thicker.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, the Moon Girl in a white cloak came out again, holding a bowl. Her face was flushed, and a layer of white mist could be seen with each breath.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's nose twitched: "This time it's not fish soup, you've changed the dish?"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl opened the bowl, and a sweet fragrance wafted over.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused, then smiled: "Crispy sweet duck, I've finally tasted it."</p><p></p><p>He remembered that it was the day he casually mentioned it, and the Moon Girl had remembered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a sip and savored it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Your culinary skills are really good. Too bad you're an NPC, otherwise I'd have taken you to the Seven-Colored Peak to be my little chef."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl had a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of something, and suddenly said, "Are you just treating me as an NPC to complete your tasks? Come on, tell me, what's your real purpose in being so attentive?"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl's face showed a flash of panic, which quickly disappeared. She tightly gripped Qi Yuan's clothes: "I don't want to die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at her, recalling the Seventh Month Sacrificial Priestess. </p><p>In these past few days, he had also heard that the Moon Imperial Clan had two Holy Maidens.</p><p>One Holy Maiden had left with the Seventh Month Sacrificial Priestess, her whereabouts unknown.</p><p>This Holy Maiden, the Moon Girl, was by his side.</p><p>Was she... abandoned?</p><p></p><p>"I can only protect you for a month's time," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, in less than a month, he would leave to truly face the external demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl's gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, "If you don't want to die, you have to become stronger yourself, protect yourself.</p><p>During this time, I'll occasionally give you some guidance, and whatever you can comprehend will be your fortune."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl heard this, her small face filled with excitement, and she nodded vigorously, looking very happy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this and smiled: "Respecting the elderly but not loving the young, that is not acceptable.</p><p>External demonic forces, you are wrong."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The ten days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The snow did not diminish as expected, but continued to fall heavily.</p><p>Even the ancient Qi Cypress trees had turned into a white expanse.</p><p></p><p>On the Seventh Month Lake, a thick layer of ice had formed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat alone by the lakeside.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of the earth trembling reached his ears.</p><p>Like the heavy drumbeats, pounding on one's heart.</p><p></p><p>The ice blocks in the lake were shaking, as if being broken by the trembling sound.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl ran out of the wooden hut, wearing a thin long dress, her small face a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked out, and saw in the distance the vast snowy expanse being stirred up by huge footsteps, kicking up swirling snow. Behind the snow, massive and burly figures were slowly approaching, letting out low roars.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand tall, heavily armored Iron Troops were advancing towards the Seventh Month Lake.</p><p>This was the Iron Floating Troops of the Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Among the three thousand mighty Iron Troops, each one was a warrior.</p><p>The strongest among them carried over twenty sedan chairs.</p><p>Each sedan chair had a supreme Emperor-level expert seated in it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, those supreme Emperors were lounging lazily in the sedan chairs, their expressions quite carefree.</p><p></p><p>The fat Buddha-like man's face was full of smiles: "Don't underestimate them, let's all join hands to suppress them."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Fat Emperor, we'll be the ones left standing in the end, how could we be careless?" </p><p></p><p>"Offering the Holy Maiden to the Heavens, we should be able to obtain ten years of peace."</p><p></p><p>"There's another Holy Maiden, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Capture this one first, then go after the second one!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperors discussed, deciding the Moon Girl's fate.</p><p></p><p>But at the Seventh Month Lake, Qi Yuan was still sitting on the blue stones.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Moon Girl: "Are you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl glanced at the heavy army, then shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Go, pull out my sword and hold it in your arms," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl's gaze became resolute.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the massive army was advancing, their footsteps flattening the snow on the ground, kicking up the snow.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Girl's thin figure slowly walked towards the sword a hundred meters away.</p><p>She walked alone against the wind and snow, leaving a line of neat, even footprints on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the sedan chairs, the women had a playful smile on their faces: "What is she doing, going to her death?"</p><p></p><p>The fat Buddha-like man's smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems another one who doesn't know his limits!"</p><p></p><p>Since the Black-Robed Guards appeared in the mortal realm, they have become the mightiest beings in this world. </p><p></p><p>As for those who have reached even higher realms, daring to manifest in this world, they will be hooked by the fishing line from the heavens, their flesh and blood stripped away, leaving only a human skin.</p><p></p><p>What do the twenty-five Supreme Emperors, along with the three thousand Iron Buddhas, have to fear? The snow is deep and thick.</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl walked up to the precious sword stuck in the ground. She extended her delicate white hand and forcefully pulled out the sword.</p><p></p><p>Embracing the sword that was almost as tall as her, she stood in the wind and snow, looking at the distant Iron Buddhas, her eyes defiant.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling of the earth grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>The snow around Moon Girl seemed to be shaken up, and the snowflakes on the trees fell one by one.</p><p></p><p>The little girl hugged the long sword, looking at the approaching Iron Buddhas, and shouted with all her might: "Those who cross this sword shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was drowned out by the marching of the three thousand Iron Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>But the Supreme Emperors, even the Emperors, heard the little girl's words.</p><p></p><p>They were amused, some with a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>Even the Chubby Emperor was dumbfounded, then said, "Even the Heavenly Domain dare not utter such words."</p><p></p><p>"That Faceless Man must be afraid, deceiving that Holy Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>"I laugh at the Holy Maiden's foolishness and lack of intelligence."</p><p></p><p>A group of Emperors, giggling and chuckling.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, standing on the branches of the ancient Qi Chun tree, Cold Moon revealed a glimpse of despair in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Maiden, I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>She guessed that the Faceless Man was still afraid, and she felt a little saddened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the army was still advancing, not stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Iron Buddhas, kill!"</p><p></p><p>With the order given, the three thousand Iron Buddhas charged forward like giant elephants.</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl, embracing the long sword, let the snowflakes blind her eyes. Facing the charging Iron Buddhas, her slender legs stood firmly: "Those who cross the sword shall be killed!"</p><p></p><p>With her clear and melodious voice, the sword in her embrace suddenly unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red killing intent permeated the air at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The blood energy surged, like a mighty demonic cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The sword flew through the air, the blood energy overwhelming the swirling snow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sword transformed into a blood-red dragon, charging into the midst of the three thousand Iron Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red dragon rampaged, colliding with the Iron Buddhas, and hundreds of them were sent flying, their bones and organs shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Monster!"</p><p></p><p>The three thousand invincible Iron Buddhas were shattered by the blood-red dragon. In an instant, they were in disarray, some crying for their parents, constantly screaming and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The mighty and awe-inspiring army had lost its previous grandeur.</p><p></p><p>The sword with the blood-red dragon aura divided its light, reaping countless lives.</p><p></p><p>In just a dozen breaths, the three thousand Iron Buddhas were all slain.</p><p></p><p>By the shore of July Lake, the Faceless Man sitting on the blue stone didn't even look at the battlefield. He lightly said, "This is the Brilliant Sword I created a few days ago. How much have you learned?"</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl's eyes turned from the color of the moon to a deep red, her eyes glowing: "I've learned three-tenths of it."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the twenty-five palanquins of the Supreme Emperors all revealed expressions of horror and deep shock.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a powerful being in this world?</p><p>How could there be such a sword! One sword, a blood-red dragon, annihilating three thousand Iron Buddhas!</p><p></p><p>By the shore of July Lake, Qi Yuan heard Moon Girl's words and showed a satisfied expression: "Your talent is not bad. The remaining NPCs should be enough for you to learn seven or eight-tenths of it, right?"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, the sword-like blood-red dragon seemed to have a will of its own, charging towards the twenty-five Supreme Emperors! The twenty-five Supreme Emperors were terrified.</p><p></p><p>What they saw was not a sword, but a blood-red evil dragon that had slaughtered countless lives.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The beautiful female Supreme Emperor in the colorful feathered robe was grazed by the blood light, and half of her body was severed, the remaining flesh and blood quickly withering, but the blood was boiling.</p><p></p><p>"Demon!"</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Emperors, seeing this, no longer dared to fight back. They had lived this long, not because they were strong or brave, but because they were good at being cowardly and shameless.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the sword-like blood-red dragon had no intention of sparing them.</p><p></p><p>One after another, beams of blood light, like those from a blood moon grindstone, struck and killed the Supreme Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Screams, pleas for mercy, were drowned out by the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-five Supreme Emperors were one by one slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The final sword pierced through the fat body of the Chubby Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Chubby Emperor collapsed on the ground, his eyes cloudy, still wearing a smile on his face: "Black-Robed Guard... the Heavenly Deity from the Outer Realms, will not let you off."</p><p></p><p>He said this and then breathed his last, dying there.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sword-like blood-red dragon flew back to Qi Yuan's side and sank into the lake.</p><p></p><p>Under the branches of the ancient Qi Chun tree, Cold Moon was utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>This... this exceeded the Supreme Emperors!</p><p>Such power!</p><p></p><p>The Black-Robed Lady was also extremely excited, murmuring, "My Lord!"</p><p></p><p>By the shore of July Lake, Moon Girl, holding the sword sheath, came to Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>The precious sword circled in the lake, washing off the filthy blood on its body, and returned to the sheath.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Moon Girl and smiled: "For your first battle against so many enemies, share your thoughts."</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl's small face was filled with joy: "Very strong, very strong."</p><p></p><p>She was, of course, referring to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's my turn to share my thoughts," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had asked Moon Girl that question just to say this.</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl looked up at Qi Yuan attentively.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sneered, "I haven't had to grind such low-level monsters for a long time.</p><p>These kinds of monsters shouldn't even appear on my map."</p><p></p><p>After entering the Five Elements Forbidden Land, the Yin-Yang Forbidden, and especially the steps after the Heavenly Forbidden, the opponents Qi Yuan encountered were what?</p><p>Heavenly Domain, that was hundreds or thousands at a time.</p><p>The Divine Realm wasn't even considered anything.</p><p>This time, it was three thousand.</p><p></p><p>These three thousand Iron Buddhas, these twenty-five Supreme Emperors, were just trash mobs, weren't they?</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to grind some higher-level monsters. Do you want to come and take a look?" Qi Yuan looked at Moon Girl and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl nodded, her small face filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took Moon Girl's small hand: "Let's go, let's go see this so-called Black-Robed Guard, and see if he's worthy of being called an elite monster."</p><p></p><p>As a player, how could he just sit in one place and wait for enemies to come grind him? Taking the initiative to attack was his style.</p><p></p><p>At July Lake, he had already gotten his answer.</p><p>It was time for him to leave, to face the final boss of this world and seize the fragments of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>But before that, the rampaging Black-Robed Guard had to be dealt with first.</p><p>These small fry were so arrogant, how could Qi Yuan tolerate it?</p><p></p><p>Holding Moon Girl's hand, the two of them disappeared into the vast snow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p>A vast necropolis.</p><p>Everywhere were white bones and half-decayed corpses.</p><p>There was a lot of flesh and blood, but no vultures or wild wolves came here.</p><p>It was eerily silent.</p><p>This was the core forbidden land of the Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p>It was also the most terrifying place.</p><p>No warriors dared to come here.</p><p>Even the Supreme Emperors, just by glancing at this necropolis, would be filled with fear and dread.</p><p></p><p>And now, a faceless man leading a seven or eight-year-old girl had entered this place.</p><p></p><p>It was silent, without a single sound.</p><p></p><p>The faceless man's expression was neither sad nor happy: "This map... is too weak, not even comparable to a single hair of the Four Great Forbidden Lands."</p><p></p><p>The faceless man was Qi Yuan. He brought Moon Girl and slaughtered the entire Hundred Cities Alliance.</p><p></p><p>King-level experts? Emperor-level experts? Supreme Emperors? They were just cannon fodder, not worth Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>He killed gods, killed Buddhas, turning the Hundred Cities Alliance into a river of blood.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had finally come to the lair of the dreaded Black-Robed Guard.</p><p></p><p>Holding his sword, he softly said, "I'm here to grind."</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the massive blood-red sword charged towards the necropolis.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, countless Black-Robed Guards flew out of the cave, like bats from a cave.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these Black-Robed Guards, a complex expression in his eyes: "Demonic beings from the Outer Realms, you really are a mental patient.</p><p>Not only devouring flesh and blood, but also making their human skins into Black-Robed Guards.</p><p>A boss like you, I estimate you'll never be discharged from the mental asylum.</p><p>Oh, no, you'll probably die in the mental hospital."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's words fell, his sword charged towards the Black-Robed Guards.</p><p></p><p>Blood filled the air, slaughter reigned supreme.</p><p>The sword reaped one Black-Robed Guard after another.</p><p></p><p>People see the Black-Robed Guards as ghosts? No, Qi Yuan is the true ghost.</p><p></p><p>He held Moon Girl's hand and softly asked, "How much have you learned?"</p><p></p><p>"Nine-tenths."</p><p></p><p>"Almost there. Once you've learned the full ten-tenths, I'll be leaving."</p><p></p><p>Moon Girl gripped Qi Yuan's hand even tighter.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Her mind couldn't quite keep up.</p><p></p><p>"...Eat." After hesitating, she answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression changed: "Such deep scheming, traveling thousands of miles from Tianfu to Qingshui Village just to eat pig head meat!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi: "???"</p><p></p><p>She was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't come for the pig head meat."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you just say you wanted to eat the feast?" Qi Yuan said quickly.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>"Then what did you come here for?" Qi Yuan interrupted her.</p><p></p><p>"I came for the... inside the statue," Qi Qi said, finally waking up.</p><p></p><p>She almost fell for his trick.</p><p></p><p>The man before her was indeed a god.</p><p></p><p>With just a few simple sentences, he had led her in circles, almost making her reveal her purpose.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that there was no need to hide her purpose in the first place, she said: "Great God, this humble girl came here for an item inside the statue."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Qi finished speaking, the villagers of Qingshui Village looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The statue seemed to be gone.</p><p></p><p>"I'm waiting to eat the feast, we'll talk later." Qi Yuan kicked his foot.</p><p></p><p>The pig he was stepping on let out a squeal as Qi Yuan kicked it into Wang Zhongshan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, the maid Xiao Xue was also holding onto a pig.</p><p></p><p>There were too few villagers, so it was given to her to hold.</p><p></p><p>Now she had a pitiful look on her face: "Miss, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>As a young unmarried woman, this was her first time holding a pig.</p><p></p><p>"Follow along to eat the feast."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the large pot, the boiling water bubbled, sending waves of heat upwards.</p><p></p><p>The aroma of large chunks of pork meat wafted through the air, spreading throughout the entire village.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand: "Wang Zhongshan, call over the mourning team from Shi Family Village. The people here cry too shyly, it's no fun."</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhongshan beside him was stunned, then quickly nodded: "Yes, Great God, I'll call them over right away."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Shen Tu couldn't help but say: "Our people in Qingshui Village can cry too!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Shen Tu: "Forget it, your Qingshui Village people cry too fake."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Chen Xifan from Chen Xi Village again, showing an approving expression: "Your village chef's skills are not bad, he can prepare a feast, better than Shi Family Village."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Xifan hunched over: "Willing to cook for the honored one every day."</p><p></p><p>Just today, this god of Qingshui Village had arrived at their Chen Xi Village in grand fashion.</p><p></p><p>The god they believed in, upon seeing fat meat arrive, got excited and went to welcome it.</p><p></p><p>The result was tragic, directly beheaded with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Those temple guards of Chen Xi Village also transformed into divine demons, but were slain one by one by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Except for some villagers who stubbornly resisted, most people chose to save themselves.</p><p></p><p>They worshipped the new god out of necessity, offering young boys and girls every year, harboring resentment in their hearts but powerless to resist.</p><p></p><p>Towards Qi Yuan, the people of Chen Xi Village felt both fear and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The feast continued.</p><p></p><p>As the fatty pork was served, everyone present had their appetites stimulated.</p><p></p><p>The village chief Yu Lu and the divine official Shen Tu of Qingshui Village sat together, with a fat man and a thin man beside them.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Venerable is the guardian god of our Qingshui Village, but... the people of Shi Family Village are too fawning," said the thin man, his voice tinged with a hint of jealousy.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's all my fault for wanting to sell the statue for money, thoroughly offending the honored one," said the fat man with a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>After the battle with Shi Family Village ended, Qingshui Village had actually already reached its end.</p><p></p><p>The originally fat man had almost starved to the point of changing his appearance.</p><p></p><p>The statue in the temple was useless to keep, so selling it was not unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, shouldn't we subjects be the arms of the god? Our village's guardian god is a bit... excessive.</p><p></p><p>For everything, he does it himself, directly taking up the sword to fight!</p><p></p><p>This is too dangerous," said the thin man nervously.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a country's king personally led troops into battle every day, and charged faster than the soldiers.</p><p></p><p>How could these villagers not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>If something happened to this god, their Qingshui Village would be completely finished.</p><p></p><p>"It's because we're too weak!" Village Chief Yu Lu puffed on his pipe, exhaling smoke.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone present looked somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, they were simply too weak and unable to help the god solve problems.</p><p></p><p>If they were all individually powerful, they wouldn't have to worry about not being valued.</p><p></p><p>"Our strength is not good, our mourning is not good, even our feast cooking is not as good as Chen Xi Village," said the divine official Shen Tu.</p><p></p><p>These people had helpless expressions. By rights, they should be the direct subordinates of the Origin Venerable, but the result was... feasting every day.</p><p></p><p>Feasting was good, but without improving themselves, they would certainly be gradually marginalized.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that our strength is too weak and we cannot nourish the Great God in return.</p><p></p><p>And now with the great changes in heaven and earth, it's also very difficult for gods to reshape their divine bodies..." said Village Chief Yu Lu hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>After the great changes in heaven and earth, ancient gods could no longer reshape their divine bodies and step into the realm of true gods.</p><p></p><p>So, many ancient gods would not seriously manage their own territories.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, in ancient times, the stronger the people in the territory, the stronger the god would become.</p><p></p><p>"What if we imitated the new gods and allowed the Great God to assimilate us? Wouldn't the Great God become stronger then?" the fat man couldn't help but mention.</p><p></p><p>New gods were stronger than ancient gods, firstly because new gods were constantly emerging.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, new gods would assimilate their subjects, merging them into one.</p><p></p><p>Just like those divine demons from Shi Family Village - if the evil god was still alive, they would eventually become temple guards, becoming part of the evil god, completely losing their own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense are you talking about? Those are all done by evil gods, and besides, we have no way to control such abilities," said the divine official Shen Tu.</p><p></p><p>The group laughed and didn't continue discussing this topic.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still a hint of worry in their hearts, seemingly uncertain about the future.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Qi ate pig head meat while secretly glancing at Qi Yuan feasting.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Xue, what do you think of him?" Qi Qi asked quietly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xue's mouth was full of grease, having not eaten so well in a long time: "He's truly a great benefactor!"</p><p></p><p>Anyone who could let her eat and drink so well was a great benefactor, a great person.</p><p></p><p>"He looks unrestrained, but is actually meticulous in his thoughts. With just a few simple sentences, he almost made me reveal my entire background," Qi Qi recalled their earlier conversation, feeling that Qi Yuan was profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan knew what Qi Qi was thinking, he would certainly cry out in injustice.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom!" maid Xiao Xue praised while eating pork.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi continued: "I heard he single-handedly slew the new gods of Shi Family Village and Chen Xi Village."</p><p></p><p>"Courageous, strong!" maid Xiao Xue praised without thinking.</p><p></p><p>The pork was too delicious, she wanted to eat it every day.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, should I give him the Yin Birth Stone?" Qi Qi secretly glanced at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now that it was difficult for ancient gods to break through to true gods, a single Yin Birth Stone could attract the covetous eyes of many ancient gods and even divine beings.</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue finally stopped eating pork and frowned in thought. After thinking for a long time, she looked at the fragrant pork: "Besides him, we really don't have a better choice."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tianfu collapsed, and the Qi family was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, Qi Qi has relied on her maid Xiao Xue for survival, and rarely got to know any senior experts.</p><p></p><p>As for those she could trust, there were even fewer.</p><p></p><p>The deity of Qingshui Village might truly be someone she could rely on.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's mind was filled with thoughts as she looked at Qi Yuan, and she seemed to have finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan felt his strength increasing and thought it was really enjoyable to start killing new gods.</p><p></p><p>"Level 21 now."</p><p></p><p>After killing two new gods, he had risen from level 1 to level 21.</p><p></p><p>This was because according to cultivation realms, he was only at the Golden Core stage, while the two he killed were both late-stage God Embryo realm, so his experience bar increased quickly.</p><p></p><p>"If I kill more, I can reach level 90. Would that be... the Yin God realm?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He felt that coming to this world was really not bad.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that all the monsters here were elites, so killing them made his experience bar increase quickly.</p><p></p><p>The only downside was that he had to eat after every fight, otherwise he'd be too hungry.</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can condense my God Embryo in this world," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Qi walked over with a determined expression: "Great Deity, actually I came to Qingshui Village for a very important matter."</p><p></p><p>"I know, to eat pork head meat," Qi Yuan glanced at the young girl before him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but marvel that she had reached Golden Core at such a young age.</p><p></p><p>In the Canglan Realm, she could have participated in the Eastern Land Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>This Mortal Heart Realm truly had extraordinary people everywhere, geniuses all around.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Deity need not tease this little girl. I have come to present a gift to you," Qi Qi smiled charmingly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became interested: "What gift?"</p><p></p><p>"Would the senior be willing to take this little girl to see the deity statue in Qingshui Village?" Qi Qi said.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the thing inside the statue you mentioned at the beginning?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Qi nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go take a look." Qi Yuan waved his hand, "You all continue with the feast, I'll be back later."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan leave, the feasting crowd all breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They began eating more cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light flew past and landed in front of the temple in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the statue?" Qi Qi looked at the empty temple with a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"These... fragments on the ground are all that's left," Qi Yuan said. "Maybe my dazzling appearance was too intense, and the statue couldn't withstand it and shattered."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi fell silent, then after a long while said: "The statue of Qingshui Village was cast by my Qi family. It was extremely sturdy. Even a peak divine being would find it difficult to destroy."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe because I was too dazzling."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi glanced at Qi Yuan. She didn't quite understand what he was saying.</p><p></p><p>But thinking back to Qi Yuan's previous words, she felt there must be deeper meaning behind them.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the fragments on the ground, she slowly said: "When the Qi family originally cast this deity statue, they buried a Yin Birth Stone inside it."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she watched Qi Yuan's reaction, but saw that he remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>She was inwardly surprised. A big shot was indeed a big shot, able to remain calm even upon hearing about a treasure like the Yin Birth Stone.</p><p></p><p>This further strengthened her determination to invest in him.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Supreme Lord had great potential.</p><p></p><p>"Now that great changes have occurred in heaven and earth, ancient gods are unable to break through to the True God realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin Birth Stone can help ancient gods step into the True God realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi bent down and cupped some of the statue fragments in her hands.</p><p></p><p>"Although the statue has shattered, this little girl can still extract the Yin Birth Stone from these fragments for the Great Deity to break through to the True God realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, meanwhile, was pondering.</p><p></p><p>He could be considered a player.</p><p></p><p>Would these restrictions from the great changes in heaven and earth apply to him? Back in the Wangyue Continent, the Great Sun had also set rules prohibiting all beings from breaking through to level 100.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have been affected by that as well.</p><p></p><p>In that case, this Yin Birth Stone could be useful to him too.</p><p></p><p>"One doesn't accept favors without reason. Quickly tell me, what quest do you have for me?" Qi Yuan treated Qi Qi as an NPC giving out quests. Now she had simply activated a quest.</p><p></p><p>And the Yin Birth Stone was just the quest reward.</p><p></p><p>"Great Deity, why bother with such calculations between us?" Qi Qi said this with a slightly blushing face.</p><p></p><p>She continued: "When my ancestors cast the statue, they made an agreement with the spirit of the statue. The deity who emerges from the statue should... with this little girl... this little girl..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi's crystal-clear ears turned transparent red, her voice carrying a hint of coyness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes widened: "Don't tell me you're my fiancée due to an arranged marriage, and you've come today to break off the engagement?"</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>If he was being dumped, should he shout out that classic line "Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, don't underestimate a poor young man"?</p><p></p><p>But what if she wasn't breaking off the engagement?</p><p></p><p>Should he seize the initiative?</p><p></p><p>Surprise flashed through Qi Qi's beautiful eyes. Qi Yuan's words confused her.</p><p></p><p>"The agreement my ancestors made with the spirit of the statue was... for this little girl to take the Great Deity as... her adoptive father."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He had just gained one daughter, and now another? "Although we both have the surname Qi, it's a bit much for you to call me godfather. </p><p></p><p>We don't even know who's older between us." Qi Yuan had always thought of himself as very young.</p><p></p><p>Gaining such a grown daughter would easily lead to misunderstandings.</p><p></p><p>"This was the agreement between my ancestors and the spirit of the statue," Qi Qi said haltingly. "If the Great Deity doesn't wish to acknowledge it, then we can forget about this matter."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she took out a token.</p><p></p><p>It was a piece of yellow cloth with writing recording the original agreement.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the shattered statue on the ground and finally murmured: "The statue shattered to receive me. I'll remember this favor. Today, I'll take a small loss and accept you as my daughter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi felt joy in her heart, but still with a hint of shyness: "Father!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt it was a bit strange: "You should just call me godfather."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, hearing "father" made him think of Lü Fengxian.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather" sounded much better.</p><p></p><p>His associations were more proper.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was slightly stunned, but finally called out sweetly: "Godfather!"</p><p></p><p>Calling an ancient god "godfather" didn't cause Qi Qi too much psychological pressure.</p><p></p><p>Most ancient gods were heroic spirits who died in ancient battles.</p><p></p><p>These senior heroic spirits who participated in the ancient... Great Deluge War and died for the Mortal Heart Realm were all worthy of Qi Qi's admiration.</p><p></p><p>They had lived far longer than Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>Having become an adopted daughter, Qi Qi quickly stepped into her role: "Godfather, now that you've obtained the Yin Birth Stone and have the potential to step into the True God realm, you can't just focus on improving your own strength like before. When encountering enemies, try to avoid taking the initiative to fight as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the connection was.</p><p></p><p>"Does godfather know that the strength of a True God is related not only to oneself, but also to one's subjects?" Qi Qi said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had fought with the evil gods of Stone Family Village and Chen Xi Village.</p><p></p><p>They received empowerment from the villagers, significantly increasing their strength.</p><p></p><p>But the villagers of Qingshui Village were too weak, so Qi Yuan hadn't let them empower him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

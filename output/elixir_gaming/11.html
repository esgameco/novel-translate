        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"These little monsters are quite creatively designed."</p><p></p><p>The clothes were in all kinds of colors and styles - skirts, shorts, robes, vests, nursing dresses, coats, overalls... ancient and modern attires, all present.</p><p></p><p>These clothes seemed like living beings, floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>However, as Qi Yuan entered the Yiguan Prohibition, these colorful clothes all turned their heads in unison.</p><p></p><p>The clothes had no heads, they were hollow, but Qi Yuan felt as if thousands of eyes were staring at him.</p><p></p><p>"The idea is good, run!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly fled.</p><p></p><p>Although he was level 82, there were too many clothing monsters in the Yiguan Prohibition.</p><p></p><p>There were tens of thousands of them in front of him, and many were over level 50. More importantly, the fierce beasts and monsters in the Xuanyuan Prohibition, though powerful, were not well-organized and fought individually.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Yiguan was clearly like a military formation.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan took action, these Yiguan would likely surround him directly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shamefully fled.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour later, Qi Yuan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I finally escaped."</p><p></p><p>He took out his greatsword and directly dug a large pit into the ground. </p><p></p><p>The depth of the pit was unknown.</p><p></p><p>He dug it skillfully, as he was accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>He laid down in the pit.</p><p></p><p>He then noticed the message Jinli had sent in the chat interface.</p><p></p><p>He immediately replied: "I didn't lie to you, you can enter the Xuanyuan Prohibition by just carrying a ladder, there's no danger."</p><p></p><p>The rules he had personally set and established, how could they have any problems?</p><p></p><p>Of course, seeing that Jinli said she wanted to go to the Xuanyuan Prohibition in person, Qi Yuan still took a look at his game screen.</p><p></p><p>The game screen showed that the Xuanyuan Prohibition was in the controlled stage.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Xuanyuan Prohibition was his possession.</p><p></p><p>He sent another message: "Don't worry, it's fine, go boldly."</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Colored Peak, Qi Yuan looked at the moonlight in the sky and felt a bit weary.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if it was because he had played the game for too long, and his spirit was too exhausted.</p><p></p><p>In the game, he told Jinli: "There are too many clothing monsters in the Yiguan Prohibition, let's go grind monsters again tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>I've dug a pit and buried myself in the ground.</p><p></p><p>I'm logging off, good night."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Qi Yuan put down the game jade slip, which then merged into his body.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the pitch-black palace, the sleeping Jinli suddenly opened her eyes. </p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on the Linglong Jade Slip, and when she saw the contents, a mysterious expression flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, be careful, pay attention to your safety, good night."</p><p></p><p>Just a simple greeting.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Prime Minister's Mansion, Sima Ting was still awake.</p><p></p><p>On his desk, there was a pile of official documents to be handled.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Empress Jinli, he was more like a politically adept politician, always putting interests first.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Empress have any unusual movements today?" Sima Ting put down the documents and slowly asked.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, a person shrouded in shadows appeared, bowing his head and saying, "Today the Empress did not see the Minister of the Department of Revenue, and did not mobilize disaster relief funds. In the afternoon, she went to see Lady Qin. </p><p></p><p>After returning to the palace, she has been reviewing memorials, without any unusual movements.</p><p></p><p>However, during the night, she instructed the maids to go to the Library Pavilion to consult information about the Xuanyuan Prohibition."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanyuan Prohibition?" Sima Ting smiled, "It seems she has no other way, and can only pin her hopes on the elusive Xuanyuan Prohibition."</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting knew that the battle in ten days was very important to Empress Jinli.</p><p></p><p>If Jinli lost, the already precarious situation would collapse completely.</p><p></p><p>And now, Lady Qin was seriously injured and could not be a match for the National Teacher of the Southern Feng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>So Jinli had taken a risk and gone to the Xuanyuan Prohibition, hoping to enter it and obtain a spiritual medicine to heal Lady Qin.</p><p></p><p>This was Sima Ting's guess.</p><p></p><p>"The Empress has reached a dead end, no need to bother with her." Sima Ting did not even put Jinli in his eyes, what he needed to focus on and worry about were the collaborators of the Northern Han King's Mansion, and the General of the Tiankai Frontier.</p><p></p><p>However, he picked up the documents and added, "Send some people to follow and see if there are any surprises."</p><p></p><p>When doing anything, it's still better to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The familiar sound came.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, and the wooden cat puppet was sealed again, unable to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sounds. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But this time, Qi Yuan rarely opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The sun has already scorched its butt. </p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, I need to set an example for my junior sister, and can't sleep in late."</p><p></p><p>Although the disciples of the Divine Light Sect had already completed their morning cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, this was a rare early rising.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished washing up, he stretched and the sunlight shone on his face, making him look extremely lazy.</p><p></p><p>But because he was too handsome, even when lazy, he still had a special charm.</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, junior sister." Qi Yuan came out of the courtyard and saw Jiang Lingsu, who was sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>He didn't approach her, but deliberately kept his distance.</p><p></p><p>In his line of sight, there also appeared some hidden information about Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>【She is an ordinary girl, but she possesses many Dao techniques, and diligently cultivates, hoping that one day she will have the power to suppress the world and prevent disasters from occurring.】</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's evaluation of Jiang Lingsu increased even more.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan and frowned, "Senior brother, why do you look so weak, as if... you've indulged in sensual pleasures too much."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had just been playing games too much, consuming his spiritual energy too much.</p><p></p><p>At present, his cultivation was stuck at the Perfected Qi realm, and he had not yet stepped into the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>So, isn't it normal to consume a lot of energy from playing games? Unfortunately, for the current Qi Yuan, there are two things he still lacks in order to step into the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>One is a suitable cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The second is a suitable Foundation Establishment spiritual object.</p><p></p><p>As for a suitable cultivation method, naturally it would be self-created.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation is low, his eyes can see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>He can blindly create a cultivation method, and then constantly refine it through the hidden information.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan has already looked through all the cultivation methods of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he is still far from creating a cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he has accumulated too little.</p><p></p><p>However, just now when he looked at Jiang Lingsu, she had countless Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jiang Lingsu and said, "Junior sister, you have to save your senior brother."</p><p></p><p>He didn't take Jiang Lingsu's previous "attack" words to heart.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Jiang Lingsu asked worriedly, afraid that her senior brother had a problem with his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I see that you have an extraordinary background..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to borrow money?"</p><p></p><p>"No, what I want to say is, do you have any extra cultivation methods, regardless of their grade, let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu breathed a sigh of relief: "Senior brother, how many do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the more the better. Preferably a few hundred, even a thousand." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Many Dao techniques, that means the quantity won't be small.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what do you want these cultivation methods for?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lazily said, "Even if I tell you, you won't believe it. </p><p></p><p>Just give me some cultivation methods, and in the future when I have achieved success in my cultivation, not only the Divine Light Sect, but the entire Canglan Realm, your senior brother will protect you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Protect her? She still needs protection? Although Qi Yuan is taller than her, and perhaps older, Jiang Lingsu feels that she can easily defeat this senior brother in a fight.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want so many cultivation methods for, tell me and I'll listen." Jiang Lingsu asked again.</p><p></p><p>"To create my own cultivation method." Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, telling the truth is something no one believes.</p><p></p><p>For example, he has already revealed that the sect master is a spy undercover, but unfortunately no one believes him.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Create his own cultivation method?</p><p></p><p>This senior brother really dares to dream.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, she still took out a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, there are quite a few cultivation methods here, just borrow them to take a look."</p><p></p><p>All these years, Ruan Yixiao has only accepted this one disciple, Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This shows that Ruan Yixiao must value Qi Yuan very much.</p><p></p><p>She needs to get along well with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I've lent you the cultivation methods, senior brother, you can't indulge in games all the time, you need to cultivate properly, and in the future you have to protect your junior sister." Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>"Gaming is also a form of cultivation." Qi Yuan took the jade slip of cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>As for the sweaty smell on his junior sister's body, it no longer smells unpleasant, but rather fragrant, all thanks to the hundreds of cultivation methods in her jade slip.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood-red armor covered his entire body, and Qi Yuan's height had already grown to 137 meters.</p><p></p><p>On his shoulders, the blood-red thorns were scarlet red, transparent and enchanting under the sunlight, as if they were about to drip blood.</p><p></p><p>He held a huge longsword, like a demon who had emerged from hell, taking big steps.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the sword, his voice hoarse and heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was only one word - kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p></p><p>Three thousand mountain peaks flew towards Qi Yuan, and peak-level experts of the Divine Realm attacked from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his blood-red eyes, and he saw countless afterimages and countless martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He raised the longsword with one hand and jumped up violently.</p><p></p><p>The huge impact force cracked the ground beneath his feet.</p><p></p><p>The massive blood-colored armor leaped up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all techniques seemed useless.</p><p></p><p>The 137-meter-tall massive body and the downward impact force were enough to terrify anyone.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention this huge entity also unleashed an extremely powerful sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Die, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Everything he saw, he killed!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not know how many people he had killed.</p><p></p><p>But in the game world, on the Ascension Platform, all the people he saw were slaughtered by him one by one!</p><p></p><p>Seen, then dead!</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, and the huge mountain peaks were shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Rocks and soil flew in all directions, breaking into fragments.</p><p></p><p>The owners of the mountain peaks were directly killed by the sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was like the God of Slaughter, no, the Demon of Slaughter! The huge blood-red treasure sword swung, killing one after another.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand peak experts of the Divine Realm united and attacked him continuously.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were using a spider web to entangle a huge entity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded the sword, brutally sweeping, breaking through all laws.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, no matter what martial arts techniques or forbidden arts, they were all cut off like spider webs and turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The mountain peaks were broken.</p><p>The river water flowed backwards!</p><p>The Divine Realm was drenched in blood.</p><p></p><p>Facing three thousand peak experts of the Divine Realm, Qi Yuan was like a wolf among sheep! The powerful beast, stepping on the ground, looking down from the clouds, slaughtering the masses with the huge treasure sword.</p><p></p><p>His combat skills, his will, had been forged to perfection in these 129,600 battles.</p><p></p><p>His battle with the peak experts of the Divine Realm was filled with the aesthetics of violence, brutal, impolite, and domineering; yet also filled with the ultimate in skill, natural, and artistic.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>Kill him until the heavens and earth are overturned, kill him until the sun and moon lose their light, kill him until the human world is in chaos!</p><p></p><p>Together with his wife, Qi Yuan slaughtered the three thousand Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judge's eyes had a trace of worry: "Have you felt that the sealing of the Five Elements Forbidden Land is slowly dissipating? Perhaps in a thousand years, it will become an ordinary forbidden land, and even the Supreme Sovereign can step into it."</p><p></p><p>"Do you suspect it's an evil entity from the Outer Realm?" Feather spoke, "By the time the Demon Slaying Assembly is over, a thousand years from now, what use would it be to slowly unseal the Five Elements Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>"You're right." Dragon Judge ended the topic, "How is the Clothing Sect Master faring in the human world now, and how much has our divine projection... consumed?"</p><p></p><p>"He's only been out for a month? You're thinking too much. There are still three hundred years, I hope he can reach the peak of the Divine Realm, so that we will have a better chance against the evil entities from the Outer Realm."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Judge thought of something, and his expression became grave: "When the Heavenly Deity went to resist the evil entities from the Outer Realm, he once sent you a message. Apart from what you've already told us, is there really nothing else, such as the strength and specific number of the evil entities from the Outer Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Feather fell silent for a moment: "No, I've already told you everything the Heavenly Deity said."</p><p></p><p>"Why bother hiding it?" Dragon Judge sighed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing." </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The huge treasure sword descended from the sky, shattering the last mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The sword tip also ground down the last peak-level expert of the Three Thousand Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yes, not stabbed to death, because his body could not accommodate such a huge hole, so he was directly ground down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, his entire body filled with a dense bloody aura, as if it was about to solidify into a tangible form.</p><p></p><p>Half a day in the outside world, one year in the Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fought without rest, continuously.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he had completely killed all three thousand experts of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red armor on his body had dried up, with some black spots.</p><p></p><p>He stuck the sword diagonally into the mountain peak and sat down, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>The exhaled air from his nostrils and mouth blew away the surrounding debris and mud.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the water in the lake and splashed it on his face repeatedly, causing the water level to drop significantly, exposing the silt.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt much cooler now.</p><p></p><p>After defeating the Three Thousand Divine Realm, he had now climbed 129,600 steps.</p><p></p><p>Going up further, there would be the true Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>After defeating the Golden Armor Divine General, he would completely control Tian Jue.</p><p></p><p>On the last steps, there were still the Three Thousand Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The final Golden Armor Divine General, what a terrifying existence would he be?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no fear.</p><p></p><p>Now he was the weakest, but also the strongest.</p><p></p><p>If he retreated, his martial will would dissipate.</p><p></p><p>He could only forge ahead, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>He pulled the sword out from the crevice of the mountain peak, and the mountain peak shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>He held the sword and entered the final Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>His body size was also rapidly shrinking, becoming 12 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a majestic voice came: "You've come."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw the one-armed Golden Armor Divine General.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the Ascension Platform, his expression mechanical and cold, holding a black spear in his right hand.</p><p></p><p>The spear was stained with blood and emanated a cold aura.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly different from the Golden Armor Divine General Qi Yuan first saw.</p><p></p><p>"After all these years, I never thought someone would still be able to ascend the Ascension Platform," the Golden Armor Divine General spoke, his mechanical voice seeming a bit melancholic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked, "Where can one go after ascending the Ascension Platform?"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Armor Divine General's expressionless face revealed a strange smile for the first time: "They say it's the starry sky, but..."</p><p></p><p>He did not continue.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked, "But what?"</p><p></p><p>"But in reality, it's to become the disciple of our Master, and ultimately enter our Master's stomach." The Golden Armor Divine General pointed the black spear at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a chill down his spine upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Who is the Master of Tian Jue? Who created the arena? He did not know.</p><p></p><p>However, the Master of Di Jue is now an evil entity from the Outer Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The world is now in chaos, with the sun and moon reversed, so a weak one like you has the opportunity to ascend the true Ascension Platform, to stand before me." The Golden Armor Divine General spoke, his voice mechanical and cold, "Come, end this boring battle."</p><p></p><p>The spear was sharp, emanating a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed Golden Armor Divine General stood in place, the pressure permeating the air, surpassing that of a myriad armies.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, and information appeared.</p><p></p><p>【Defeat the Broken Golden Armor Divine General's Remnant Soul, Level 119.】</p><p></p><p>Level 119?! This was the first time he had seen such a powerful expert in this world.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had not seen anyone able to break through level 100.</p><p></p><p>Even he himself could not break through level 100.</p><p></p><p>Now, he faced a 119-level expert.</p><p></p><p>An unknown, mysterious, and powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hackles rose, his body trembled, every muscle tense.</p><p></p><p>All his focus, all his mental energy, were concentrated on the Golden Armor Divine General.</p><p></p><p>He held the sword, he was alert, he attacked.</p><p></p><p>All his desire to kill, all his fighting will, reached their peak at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He understood that this battle was almost certain death.</p><p></p><p>So, when Qi Yuan struck, it was with his strongest attack.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The huge treasure sword, empowered by numerous martial arts techniques and skills, unleashed the mightiest strike in the world.</p><p></p><p>The sword strike pierced directly into the body of the Golden Armor Divine General.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Armor Divine General shattered into fragments.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, Qi Yuan saw the Golden Armor Divine General's look of astonishment, saw him turn into fragments.</p><p></p><p>But how could a 119-level expert be killed by his sword strike?</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew that was just an illusion!</p><p>"Come out!"</p><p>"Come out!"</p><p>"I see you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the giant sword and unleashed his signature sword technique again.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Summer Slashes.</p><p></p><p>This sword art, wildly swinging, full of loopholes, yet could give him the greatest sense of security.</p><p></p><p>As if whoever came, would be injured by his Eight Summer Slashes.</p><p></p><p>Alas, no matter how Qi Yuan shouted, no one responded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a prompt appeared in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>【Slaying the Broken Golden Armor Divine General's Remnant Soul has granted you the opportunity to reach level 100. Do you wish to ascend?】</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Did I kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Killed him?" </p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right!"</p><p></p><p>His expression was filled with even greater terror.</p><p></p><p>"Is this really the power of a 119-level expert, who can even know my innermost thoughts and realize that I am an NPC in this game?"</p><p></p><p>"Using a simulated GM to trick me, what a ruthless scheme!"</p><p></p><p>"The moment I let my guard down, you will surely strike me down with thunderous force!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan coldly sneered at the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one responded to him.</p><p></p><p>He stood there, not knowing how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>He had a puzzled look on his face: "Could it be that I overthought this?"</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then bent down to search for something on the ground.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Qi Yuan looked at the golden armor fragments assembled on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, not fragments, but mere crumbs.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked: "So he really died? Just like that?"</p><p></p><p>He could not understand it.</p><p></p><p>"I was being paranoid, worrying over nothing. Good thing there were no spectators in the arena, or else I, the young emperor, would have lost all face by scaring myself."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then turned his attention to the notification he had just received.</p><p></p><p>Slaying the Golden Armored Divine General, obtaining the opportunity to advance to level 100?</p><p></p><p>He was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had relied on Xiao Jia to reach level 104.</p><p></p><p>But that was not his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He had many maxed-out experience bars within him.</p><p></p><p>Once he reached level 100, he would be able to level up rapidly, reaching a realm he could not even imagine.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, he did not dare to level up.</p><p></p><p>Especially after what the Golden Armored Divine General had said before.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that something terrifying would happen if he reached level 100.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, he had not yet seen a single legitimate level 100 expert.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hold off on leveling up for now," Qi Yuan decided to keep the leveling opportunity.</p><p></p><p>He would only use it when he had no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Another notification appeared.</p><p></p><p>[The Heavenly Abyss instance has been cleared, and rewards have been obtained.]</p><p></p><p>[Reward 1: 30 Fragments of the Heavenly Dao.]</p><p></p><p>[Reward 2: The opportunity to advance to level 100 (can be used at any time.)]</p><p></p><p>"I already have 60 fragments? According to my guess, with another 30 from the Earthly Abyss and 10 from the Yin-Yang Forbidden, I will be able to obtain all the Heavenly Dao Fragments and complete the Heavenly Dao Foundation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another game notification appeared.</p><p></p><p>[Step onto the Ascension Platform, and in one hour, the Heavenly Abyss' restriction will be lifted, allowing you to freely depart for the Mortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>After a month of Worldly Enlightenment, you will be transported to the Earthly Abyss.]</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal Realm?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, "I can finally meet Jinli!"</p><p></p><p>"But only a month's time before having to go to the Earthly Abyss to fight the boss?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter, let's meet first!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, and quickly told Jinli the news.</p><p></p><p>"Jinli, I've already cleared the Heavenly Abyss, and I can now leave the Forbidden Lands. I have a month's time to stay in the Mortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's meet at the Ancient Qi Cypress Tree!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and you left the Southern Qin Kingdom a while ago and went to the Ancient Qi Cypress, have you arrived there yet?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, in a small town beneath the Ancient Qi Cypress Tree, Jinli was sitting by a lake.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, some children were playing and frolicking, and a child was playing in the water, only to be pulled out by their mother and given a few resounding slaps on the bottom, the force of which clearly indicated it was a mother's hand.</p><p></p><p>A large bird flew down from the Ancient Qi Cypress and splashed into the water, seemingly catching a small fish.</p><p></p><p>Around the lake, there were also many young men and women in romantic trysts.</p><p></p><p>"Is he coming to see me?" Jinli's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have a month's time. Where should we meet, give me the coordinates."</p><p></p><p>"I'm in the Seven-Month Town, within the Moon Imperial Domain beneath the Ancient Qi Cypress. It's easy to find. After leaving the Heavenly Abyss, head southeast and you'll arrive here. I'll be waiting for you by the Half-Moon Lake."  Jinli's body trembled, unable to hide the excitement in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I've noted it down," Qi Yuan said, then asked, "How is it outside? Are things expensive? Is the food good? Is the scenery beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>"The scenery here is very beautiful, the Ancient Qi Cypress is truly massive.</p><p></p><p>It is the divine tree of the Wangyue Continent, and the Moon Imperial Domain is right next to it, unlike the Southern Qin Kingdom, there is no war here, and the people live in peace and prosperity.</p><p></p><p>There are many delicious foods, today I even tried a crispy sweet duck, and the taste was quite good.</p><p></p><p>I'm trying to learn how to cook, and when you come, I'll cook for you myself!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I hope it's not too bad, otherwise I'll have to pretend it's delicious and eat it all, that would be so uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this is the first time I'm meeting an online friend, I have to admit I'm quite excited."</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>"How do you look? Oh, that was rather abrupt of me."</p><p></p><p>"I should be... alright, I guess?"</p><p></p><p>"No worries, no worries, I'm very handsome, I won't look down on you.</p><p></p><p>I've asked you so many questions, do you want to ask me some as well? Like how tall I am, how much I earn, whether I have a car or a house, how much the betrothal gift is..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I've said too much, it feels like a blind date.</p><p></p><p>Online, we should just be casual."</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"It means finding a partner, never mind. I'm tired from today's exertions, I'll rest up a bit. Hopefully, I'll be out of the Heavenly Abyss by tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>If I don't get lost, I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>If I do get lost, then it'll be three days or a week from now!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan logged off.</p><p></p><p>Jinli, dressed in white, sat by the lake, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, that esteemed individual will be coming to see you soon?" Qin Yí appeared by Jinli's side.</p><p></p><p>Jinli smiled slightly: "Yes, and Qin Yí, please don't call me 'Your Majesty' anymore, just call me Alí.</p><p></p><p>I'm no longer the Empress of the Southern Qin Kingdom, and I'm not suited to be an empress."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí smiled and said, "Your Majesty, with your peerless beauty, you are worthy of any man. You need not worry."</p><p></p><p>Jinli remained silent, not responding.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí continued, "That esteemed individual was able to lend Your Majesty the fearsome Forbidden Army, showing how much he cares for you. Your Majesty need not be so distracted, lest you wither away before even meeting him."</p><p></p><p>Jinli stood up: "Alright, Qin Yí, let's head back."</p><p></p><p>The two left the lakeside and headed towards the courtyard they had purchased.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a group of children wearing various masks walked past Jinli.</p><p></p><p>The masks were of all kinds, and the children, holding sticks, were humming a song, following a private tutor.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yí, where are they going with those masks?" Jinli asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Seems they are going to worship some deity's statue," Qin Yí knew a little, but not much.</p><p></p><p>"What deity, and why the masks?"</p><p></p><p>"Apparently, that deity also wears a mask."</p><p></p><p>"And why are they all holding sticks?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure."</p><p></p><p>"What deity is it that they worship?"</p><p></p><p>"Not one of the marriage deities. However, in three days, there will be a temple fair in this town. If that esteemed individual arrives, you two can go and watch the temple fair together.</p><p></p><p>This town seems to have many statues of deities, and quite a few prosperous temples."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, a temple fair does sound interesting, we can go take a look."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched and yawned.</p><p></p><p>He stood by the lake, looking at his reflection in the water.</p><p></p><p>"Still as handsome as ever."</p><p></p><p>He got up, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>"Should I bring a gift for the meeting? Otherwise, it would be impolite."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I don't have anything on me."</p><p></p><p>He stood by the lake in the Heavenly Abyss, pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>His figure then dissipated, and he ran all over the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a wooden hairpin appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>The hairpin was quite ordinary, but it was made from many precious plants.</p><p></p><p>"A handcrafted wooden hairpin, that should be fine, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Won't I be criticized online for giving a cheap handmade gift?"</p><p></p><p>"Jinli is not that kind of person, it'll be okay."</p><p></p><p>He thought for a bit.</p><p></p><p>He sent a message to Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"I've brought a gift for our meeting, a handcrafted wooden hairpin, don't think it's too cheap."</p><p></p><p>After that, he left the Heavenly Abyss and headed out.</p><p></p><p>After dozens of breaths, Qi Yuan finally exited the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"A desert?" </p><p></p><p>He gazed up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Ancient poems surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Lone smoke from the desert, the river's sunset round.</p><p></p><p>He looked out, seeing a vast golden desert.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? My game interface is gone?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Heavenly Abyss, his game interface had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to [Mo Yan Jiu Hu] and [A Fish Dragon Who Likes Cold Mixed Vegetables] for your donations!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

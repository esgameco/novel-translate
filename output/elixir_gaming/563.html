        <h1>Chapter 563</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the blind woman does not truly exist in this world, but is merely a reappearance of the imagination of the soul.</p><p></p><p>However, how should one explain that night of boundless charm? There was still a vague sense of doubt and confusion in Qi Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qinmiao: "Last time you two said that if I came to the Taixin Domain, you could let me see the original copy of the 'Origin Esoterica'."</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's gaze, the two of them felt a tightness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yuan stepped forward and responded on behalf of Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qinmiao: "Lord Jiemaster, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan responded.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, he seemed to have thought of something, his gaze piercing through the clouds and falling on the old man and Long Qi.</p><p></p><p>"They are craving to drink some immortal wine, so let me give them some immortal wine."</p><p></p><p>The old man and Long Qi's expressions tightened. They had never been simultaneously gazed upon by so many powerful figures before, and this feeling of being the center of attention made them both anxious and excited.</p><p></p><p>The old man's thoughts were complex.</p><p></p><p>Long Qi's joy was difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Little Qi... no, Big Qi still remembered them!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within the Cloud Palace, the ancient books were as vast as clouds.</p><p></p><p>Some were engraved on stone steles, some carved on bamboo slips, and some printed on paper.</p><p></p><p>The vast library represented the historical and cultural development of various domains and worlds in the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>The original copy of the "Origin Esoterica" was hidden in the deepest part of the library.</p><p></p><p>"The original copy of the 'Origin Esoterica' is recorded on the medium of the Shenmu, chronicling the various secrets of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the passage of time, many chapters of the original have been lost."</p><p></p><p>Yuan handed the original copy of the "Origin Esoterica" to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Rather than a book, it was more like a wooden stele, a wood carving.</p><p></p><p>However, this wooden stele had been weathered by countless years, and many of the characters on it were no longer legible.</p><p></p><p>"Good, let me take a look." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>His attention was focused on the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>Yuan's figure retreated and left the library.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Yuan remained in front of the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning of the universe, the first ancient god was Pan, whose towering figure wielded a giant axe to carve out the heavens and earth?"</p><p></p><p>"This... is related to the story I told the Voiceless Voice."</p><p></p><p>"The heavens and earth collapsed, the earth shattered, the goddess appeared... using stone to mend the earth."</p><p></p><p>"Is this because my story influenced the Voiceless Voice, or... can my words transform the decaying into the miraculous?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the awakening of his special ability.</p><p></p><p>If he did not have this special ability, he would not have been able to communicate with the Voiceless Voice.</p><p></p><p>His voice could be transmitted to any corner, and then... undergo special changes, causing unknown effects.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered in secret.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was his voice that influenced the Voiceless Voice, leading to the birth of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... my mouth is quite powerful, able to impregnate the universe with my words." Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the "Origin Esoterica", the records about the Shenmu Abyss only mentioned that it was the origin of the world, a realm of nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there is no mention of Black Sky in the 'Origin Esoterica'."</p><p></p><p>The understanding of Black Sky by the Ancestral Gods like Qi Kai and Yuan might not be as much as Qi Yuan, who had slain many strange gods and swept across chaotic star domains.</p><p></p><p>After sitting for half a day, Qi Yuan had thoroughly read through the entire "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>The first half of the "Origin Esoterica" was very similar to the mythological stories Qi Yuan had told the Voiceless Voice.</p><p></p><p>As for the later content, it was about the various major and minor events of the invasion of Black Sky and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Void Paradise and the Radiant Universe were also mentioned in the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze shifted to the epilogue of the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>The text there was completely different from the previous ones, with a graceful feminine style.</p><p></p><p>"And... it is from the same person as the inscription on the stone tablet at Luori Cliff."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to encounter such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that... most of the words are not legible."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully examined it, and could only make out the eight characters "Clouds have rain", "Thunder and lightning without sound".</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, he could not make them out.</p><p></p><p>"Clouds, rain, thunder... Is this a forging technique?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the eight forging techniques the blind woman had given him.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... The game is almost over, if I can't find you again, I may not be able to help you make eyes."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He was a person who valued favors deeply.</p><p></p><p>What he had promised, he would see through to the end.</p><p></p><p>Now, the game in this world was also about to end.</p><p></p><p>The character he was playing would also soon come to a complete end.</p><p></p><p>When it ends, that will be the day he departs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... giving him all seven pieces of the Qi Kai Light... Isn't that too bold?"</p><p></p><p>The burly bearded man was somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Kai Light had consumed the lifeblood of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>It was also the only reliance of the Ancestral Gods in their fight against Black Sky and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was the Jiemaster, he was also a person of this world, and most of the Ancestral Gods were not familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, he might be another "One", right?</p><p></p><p>"Jiemaster wants it, why haven't you given it to him yet?" The white-haired old man said.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Qi Kai Light, most people did not really want to give it to Qi Yuan right after meeting him.</p><p></p><p>But since Qi Yuan's strength was so powerful, reaching the Jiemaster realm, they had no choice.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan acted alone, they might not be able to match him even if they all joined forces.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that giving it to him so easily, we can't help but feel some worry." The burly bearded man said.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, 'Doubt those you use, use those you don't doubt.' Since the Qi Kai Light is already in the Jiemaster's hands, what we need to do now is to trust him." The Sheng NÃ¼ said.</p><p></p><p>The others nodded. At this point, aside from trust, what else could they do? "Yes, instead of getting caught up in these things, it's better to think about how to deal with Black Sky and Black Earth?"</p><p></p><p>The many Ancestral Gods discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>Black Sky and Black Earth were coming with overwhelming force, even greater than the previous attack.</p><p></p><p>The line drawn by the Radiant Dao Master still existed, and based on the rate of its disappearance, the Shenmu Universe still had ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But this invasion of Black Sky and Black Earth was still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... it would end up like last time, with half the domain falling.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Jiemaster should be the main force... We... will provide intelligence support for him." Said one of the Ancestral Gods.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan now controlled the Qi Kai Light, they could not well enter the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>They could only provide intelligence support for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this battle will pass smoothly, without any unexpected events!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, once this battle is over, it will give us more breathing room, and the other seeds can also grow stronger, and the Qi Kai Light... will also be forged in greater numbers." Someone said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, back then with only half a piece of the Qi Kai Light, Yuan was able to fend off the enemies in the Void Sea. Now with seven pieces, and with the Jiemaster taking action, what unexpected things could happen?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's appearance had given the citizens of the Imperial Star a shot of adrenaline.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, everywhere was abuzz with discussions about Qi Yuan, this Jiemaster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the moonlight was bright, and the surroundings were silent.</p><p></p><p>The old man had changed into his grand manor, the table was laden with immortal wine, and the old man was sipping his wine, his expression hazy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this guy, how come he suddenly became enlightened? Tomorrow he will head to the battlefield, I don't know if he will get injured or not." The old man was a bit worried about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was even afraid that Qi Yuan would perish in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of talk couldn't be said out loud, it's inauspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Liu, don't worry, the Realm Lord this time should be fine." Ancestor God Qin said.</p><p></p><p>The secrets about the dividing line drawn by the Radiant Dao Master cannot be told to the lower-level people, otherwise it will cause panic and create trouble.</p><p></p><p>But Qin could secretly reveal a thing or two.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ancestor God Qin speak so firmly, Old Man Liu heaved a sigh of relief: "Good, as long as there's no trouble."</p><p></p><p>Long Qi was sitting beside them, drinking carefully, but the luster in his eyes couldn't be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Little Qi becoming a Realm Lord has had a huge impact on Old Man Liu and him.</p><p></p><p>The house has been replaced by a mansion.</p><p></p><p>Every day, there are god-level experts, even Ancestor Gods, coming to visit.</p><p></p><p>This was unimaginable in the past.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Qi Yuan also came back once, leaving everyone deeply sighing.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this time Brother Qi can display his divine might and completely defeat the Black Heavens and Black Earths!" Long Qi gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Realm Lord!" Ancestor God Qin raised his cup and said.</p><p></p><p>The entire Imperial Star, all the citizens, had tense expressions.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, it will be the day Qi Yuan rushes to the frontline, and also the day the war officially begins.</p><p></p><p>Some are worried, some are excited, and some are perplexed, with different thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>Majestic warships were patrolling, ancient and solemn, stained with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord's expression was indecipherable: "I've heard that this time, it will be that Realm Lord who will go to the Void Sea to deal with us?"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Black Earth clan members all nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Realm Lord from the Chaotic Star Realm, he has killed many of our experts." A Great Dao Celestial God said with apprehension.</p><p></p><p>"A Realm Lord actually appeared in the Divine Wood Universe, this person is quite strange." The Void Realm Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in this battle, the one who ignites the light can go back, but this Qi Yuan must remain in the Void Sea!" At this time, a man whose entire body was on fire said, his voice full of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Flame Realm Lord, are you doing this to avenge your nephew?" The Void Realm Lord glanced at the Flame Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord had a nephew named Qi Huang. </p><p></p><p>He loved him dearly, even arranging for Qi Huang to be in the safe Chaotic Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, Qi Huang died, killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could the Flame Realm Lord not be furious? "He is a Realm Lord, not that easy to kill." The Void Realm Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>They were all Realm Lord realm, with similar strengths, how difficult would it be to slay him? "Even if it costs me this life, I must kill him!" The Flame Realm Lord said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Gods present were all somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>Although the Anomaly Source was enough to revive them.</p><p></p><p>But at their level, they all tried to avoid using the Anomaly Source for resurrection.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knows... will the revived self still be the same self?</p><p></p><p>"It seems this nephew was very important to you." The Void Realm Lord smiled.</p><p></p><p>He also thought of some rumors.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang had many uncles.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that these so-called uncles... were all incarnations of the Flame Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>And Qi Huang was the key for the Flame Realm Lord to step into the Myriad Realm?</p><p></p><p>Now, he was slain by Qi Yuan, his anger was understandable.</p><p></p><p>This was a resentment that obstructed the Dao!</p><p></p><p>It's just that... exchanging life for life, in the Void Realm Lord's eyes, was unwise.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Lord, help me slay Qi Yuan!" The Flame Realm Lord looked at the Void Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord hesitated: "This lord doesn't want to risk his life."</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord was willing to exchange life for life, but he wouldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>"You assist me from the side, and after the task is accomplished, I will open my Divine Sea and let you comprehend my Flame Dao!" The Flame Realm Lord said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord heard this and was somewhat surprised: "Really?"</p><p></p><p>For a Realm Lord at the Dao level, the most important thing was the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Dao that each Realm Lord comprehended was their trump card, their greatest reliance.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord opening his Divine Sea and letting the Void Realm Lord comprehend his Dao was a very dangerous thing.</p><p></p><p>During this period, if the Void Realm Lord suddenly had evil intentions, the Flame Realm Lord would immediately perish.</p><p></p><p>However... with the Anomaly Source, even if he perished, he could revive.</p><p></p><p>But for the Void Realm Lord, the revived self would no longer be the same, and this was something he also needed to avoid.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Flame Realm Lord, for the sake of hunting down Qi Yuan, actually offered such a reward, how could the Void Realm Lord not be tempted?</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll help with this task." The Void Realm Lord's thoughts were burning hot.</p><p></p><p>If he could master another Dao, it would be a huge boost for him.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he might even have the possibility of breaking through to the Myriad Realm, or even the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Black Heavens and Black Earths had Realm Lords at the Myriad Realm, but not a single one at the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he broke through to the Primordial Realm, he would become the first among the Black Heavens and Black Earths.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case... our battle plan this time needs to be adjusted." The Void Realm Lord lowered his head in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens and Black Earths invaded the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>For the Divine Wood Universe, the war was extremely brutal and intense.</p><p></p><p>But for the Black Heavens and Black Earths, without receiving the highest order from the Black Heavens, everything was just... probing and playing around.</p><p></p><p>So last time, Yuan led half of the Qi Guangming into the Void Sea to resist the Black Heavens and Black Earths' army.</p><p></p><p>They had a thousand ways to slay Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, no one made a move.</p><p></p><p>Because, with half of the Qi Guangming, it was enough to exchange for a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>No Realm Lord was willing to die, even if they could be revived by the Anomaly Source.</p><p></p><p>But this time is different, the Flame Realm Lord is willing to pay the price, willing to use the Anomaly Source to revive.</p><p></p><p>Since someone is willing to pay the price, leaving Qi Yuan behind... is as simple as that.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Void Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the Void Sea alone, feeling as if he was entering a muddy swamp.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sea... was a special space created by the collision of two universes.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Celestial Gods would find it very difficult to walk in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>It's as if there were restrictions everywhere, making every step arduous.</p><p></p><p>Only Realm Lords and above, would this restriction be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if one wielded the Qi Guangming treasure, then... even ordinary god-level, or even sky-level experts could enter the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Half a day's journey ahead is the Black Heavens and Black Earths' fleet." Yuan's voice came from the communication talisman, "Realm Lord, you only need to hold the Qi Guangming and obstruct the fleet's advance!"</p><p></p><p>Last time, Yuan did just that, confronting the Black Heavens and Black Earths for more than ten years.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the fleet retreated, not taking another step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the seven pieces of Qi Guangming, he also had five special communication talismans.</p><p></p><p>These communication talismans, relying on the Qi Guangming, allowed Qi Yuan to still receive news from the Divine Wood Universe even in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>"What if they attack me?" Qi Yuan asked, "Can I fight back?"</p><p></p><p>"Normally, the Black Heavens and Black Earths won't rashly attack you in the Void Sea." Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lords of the Black Heavens and Black Earths were all cautious about their lives, no one wanted a one-for-one exchange.</p><p></p><p>"But if someone does attack you, the Realm Lord can certainly retaliate." Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What if I want to take the initiative to attack?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 347</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator with star-like eyebrows and sword-like eyes looked exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Those kneeling below, in the Fire Spirit Realm, wouldn't even qualify as menial disciples.</p><p></p><p>What angered her most was that yesterday she had rejected a youth without spirit roots who wanted to join.</p><p></p><p>That youth had directly declared: "Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, don't look down on a poor youth!"</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing this was here, with many cameras around.</p><p></p><p>If it had been in the Fire Spirit Realm, she would have slapped that person to death long ago.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Fighting God Sect recently accepted a pure spirit root disciple, it's really enviable!" The female cultivator with star-like eyebrows and sword-like eyes mentioned this with a look of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Fighting God Sect and Xuantian Sect were old rivals.</p><p></p><p>This opposition could be traced back ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>However, ten thousand years ago, the Xuantian Sect had the upper hand over the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>But in the past few thousand years, well... the Xuantian Sect had declined.</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator with pure spirit roots, if they cultivate smoothly with sufficient resources, may even have the chance to... enter the Divine Infant realm!" The middle-aged man beside her sighed, his eyes showing envy. "The strongest we've recruited is only an earth-grade spirit root, but that child Zhiqi is very hardworking, her achievements may not be low."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of Wang Zhiqi, Xie Tang's face also showed a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>That child's talent in the Xuantian Sect was second only to their missing holy maiden Xie Xinsu.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, the Fighting God Sect snatched away some of our student sources again.</p><p></p><p>Oh right, they also want to take away Tianyue City where Zhiqi is from!" The man mentioned, looking indignant.</p><p></p><p>The more student sources, the more outstanding talents would emerge.</p><p></p><p>The sources of students for their sects came from two things: first, the treaties signed with the Seven Martial Star; second, the competitions between the major sects.</p><p></p><p>Well... in the last competition, the Xuantian Sect lost to the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>So the Fighting God Sect took away one of Xuantian Sect's student source locations.</p><p></p><p>However, the Fighting God Sect was too greedy.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Sect clearly lost Xinshan, but they wanted to snatch away the adjacent Tianyue as well.</p><p></p><p>"If senior sister was still here, how could they be so arrogant!" Xie Tang said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Senior sister Xie Xinsu was Xuantian Sect's number one Primordial Core.</p><p></p><p>Her battle prowess was astonishing and her talent extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But a year ago, senior sister suddenly disappeared mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Sect Leader He Yunzi had even sought guidance from the ancestors for the holy maiden Xie Xinsu, inquiring about her whereabouts, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Xie Xinsu's disappearance became Xuantian Sect's biggest mystery.</p><p></p><p>Some in the sect even felt this might be related to the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>"No, I must go to Tianyue City this time. If they want to take Tianyue, they'll have to ask if I, Xie Tang, agree.</p><p></p><p>It's perfect timing, I'll accompany Zhiqi back home!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianyue City, Jun'an Residential Complex.</p><p></p><p>Yaji basked in the sun, feeling life was extremely pleasant.</p><p></p><p>His sister sat behind him, lazily playing with her phone.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Guiran, where the only entertainment was stargazing, life here was so much better.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, they didn't have to be on edge, afraid of being captured and having their organs harvested.</p><p></p><p>This kind of life was all thanks to the adults.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he felt admiration for the adults in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Little ones, what a coincidence, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elderly voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>An old man in white robes appeared.</p><p></p><p>The old man's white robes were embroidered with gold-edged vigorous pines, and there was also a strange beast on it, looking quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Yaji looked at the old man, his eyes showing a hint of wariness. He instinctively shielded his sister behind him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old man's face showed a helpless smile: "The little one is very wary of me.</p><p></p><p>This poor Daoist is Zhang Dayang, I have no ill intentions towards you young friends, but want to give you two an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"We don't want any opportunities!" Yaji looked up, watching the old man vigilantly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Dayang wore a kind smile on his face: "Young friend, don't refuse too quickly, look..."</p><p></p><p>Facing children, Zhang Dayang naturally had his own methods.</p><p></p><p>Only to see him open his hand, and suddenly a banana appeared in his originally empty hand.</p><p></p><p>This kind of transformation technique was especially appealing to children.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Yaji's sister behind him stared at the banana with wonder, showing a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"If you two follow me and take me as your master, in the future... you'll be able to do as this old man does, changing into whatever you want... whenever you want."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dayang said proudly, seemingly full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a young man beside him said: "You two kids are very lucky. In the Fire Spirit Realm, who wouldn't cry and kneel to take the Carefree Immortal as their master?</p><p></p><p>With such a great opportunity before you, you two little ones still aren't kowtowing to take him as your master? Once you do, the trajectory of your lives will completely change!</p><p></p><p>You will enter a world... that was once unimaginable and unattainable."</p><p></p><p>As the young man spoke, his expression was arrogant, with a sense of looking down upon the world from on high.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Dayang shook his head: "Friend, you exaggerate somewhat. I'm just a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It's just that these two... suit my eye, and their talents are quite suitable. I'm just acting on a whim.</p><p></p><p>You two young friends, are you willing to follow me?</p><p></p><p>Don't hesitate, as long as you two agree, I'll personally go persuade your elders."</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Immortal did things in his own style, different from ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yaji quickly shook his head: "Sorry, we're not interested."</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Immortal Zhang Dayang was slightly stunned: "Could it be that my techniques aren't dazzling enough?"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand again.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a small golden dragon appear between his arms, coiling and flying about, looking quite beautiful.</p><p></p><p>This kind of scene was most likely to attract children.</p><p></p><p>However, Yaji didn't even look, directly leaving while holding his sister's hand.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dayang was stunned, then smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, that young man's gaze turned cold: "Senior, do you want me to go capture them?</p><p></p><p>Hmph, eyes that fail to recognize a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Such a heaven-sent opportunity before them, yet they can still miss it."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dayang shook his head, his eyes showing a smile: "This poor Daoist has pursued freedom all his life, why force others?</p><p></p><p>Everything depends on fate. In the coming days, this old man will show a few more tricks. If they still aren't willing, it means we have a connection but no destiny."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young man's eyes rolled: "Then I congratulate senior on soon accepting these two fine disciples.</p><p></p><p>However... in case these two have no destiny with senior, I hope senior won't mind if our Fighting God Sect... takes them in!"</p><p></p><p>Those two had very good talents, one with an earth-grade spirit root, one with a heaven-grade spirit root.</p><p></p><p>If the Carefree Immortal hadn't wanted to take them as disciples, given their Fighting God Sect's style of doing things, they would have long since abducted those two.</p><p></p><p>"Fine." The Carefree Immortal acted strangely, with no prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>If the Fighting God Sect abducted them, so be it.</p><p></p><p>"I've already investigated. These two aren't from Qinyuan, they were brought back from Guiran by someone in this residential complex.</p><p></p><p>Our Fighting God Sect has cooperated with the Wu Sect of Wugui before.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes... we can just take them away in the name of the Wugui nation, it's very simple." The young man said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Mission completed. Obtained: one Atavism Pill.]</p><p></p><p>With a flash of light, a medicinal pill appeared in Qi Yuan's stone house.</p><p></p><p>Unlike ordinary pills, this pill was actually blood-red, emitting a strong bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this pill curiously.</p><p></p><p>[To take the Atavism Pill, please go to the Blood Jade Wall for the best effect.]</p><p></p><p>Another prompt came.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blood Jade Wall was a blood-colored wall present in every stronghold. </p><p></p><p>Various strange and bizarre beast patterns were carved on the wall.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating under the Blood Jade Wall was very beneficial for blood martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to go out for a walk. I wonder if this Ancestral Reversion Pill can allow me to see my ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The mission completion notification had come, and she had finally returned to the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"An girl, what happened to you all? One mission... took nearly a year. This old man thought you had died during the mission," Lin Yaoshan said, wearing tattered clothes and looking at An Qiao with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, these missions were completed very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Completing one in a month was considered extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's case of taking nearly a year was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Not just Lin Yaoshan, but others in the stronghold also thought An Qiao had probably died in the mission world.</p><p></p><p>But now, after nearly a year, An Qiao suddenly appeared, which truly shocked quite a few people in the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many people had gathered around An Qiao.</p><p></p><p>"What happened, An Qiao? This mission didn't seem difficult based on its rating. How did it take a year?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, over twenty people participated in this mission, yet it took nearly a year. That's too exaggerated, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao looked at the people surrounding her and swallowed: "Have you ever experienced the mission target being... taken away by a colleague?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Taken away by a colleague? For a year?"</p><p></p><p>"This person has evil intentions!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he wanted to leave you all trapped in the mission world?"</p><p></p><p>The people present changed their expressions slightly, all thinking of something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If they offended a colleague while completing a mission, and that colleague kidnapped the mission target, making it impossible for them to complete the mission, wouldn't that mean... they might be forever trapped in the mission world, eventually dying from their bodies exploding?</p><p></p><p>"This person is malicious. Did you manage to catch him?</p><p></p><p>After nearly a year, the mission ended, so you must have caught him.</p><p></p><p>It seems his strength was formidable, and he was also skilled at escaping, actually making you spend a year to catch him," Lin Yaoshan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>As an old-style martial artist, he was inferior to others. When entering mission worlds, he mostly relied on teammates to complete missions.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered such a situation, he really wouldn't know what to do.</p><p></p><p>He decided he must thoroughly implement and practice the theory of being subservient.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where's young brother Qi Yuan? I remember he was at the Jade Blood Realm, right? Could it be that even he couldn't catch that villain?" Lin Yaoshan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, An Qiao's heart skipped a beat, and she revealed a bitter smile: "That person... was Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"What... it was him!"</p><p></p><p>"He actually did such an unconscionable thing, does he have no principles at all!"</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. When he comes out, we must educate him, otherwise, how can we survive if we team up with him!"</p><p></p><p>"We must educate him, or else..."</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there was a chorus of condemnation from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"I think... it's better not to educate him," An Qiao said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Why not? Could it be that he's already at mid Jade Blood Realm? Hmph, mid Jade Blood Realm... has some strength, but that's all!"</p><p></p><p>"An Qiao, don't be afraid. We've got your back!"</p><p></p><p>"Today we must have a good talk with him. Disregarding the lives of his compatriots is truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong he is, can he kill us all before his blood martial energy is exhausted if we rush him together?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was agitated and impassioned.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao looked at everyone and muttered, "He can."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Lin Yaoshan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at An Qiao, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard An Qiao say: "Fengyuan had twelve beast lairs in total. The weakest beast lair had 3,000 beast soldiers, led by a Beast Elite.</p><p></p><p>The strongest beast lair had 20,000 beast soldiers, led by a Beast Spirit.</p><p></p><p>In this year, Qi Yuan took the mission target and fought across 3,000 li, single-handedly... wiping out all the beast lairs!</p><p></p><p>The reason he took away the mission target was that he feared we would complete the mission, and he wouldn't be able to wipe out all 100,000+ beasts in Fengyuan!"</p><p></p><p>As An Qiao spoke, she became more and more excited, even her breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>The men and women present fell silent upon hearing this, shocked.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? He killed over 100,000 beasts alone? Even a Martial Spirit couldn't do that, and even a Martial King... would probably die from exhaustion!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was stunned, feeling this was too inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>After all, beast soldiers were not ordinary humans.</p><p></p><p>Twenty thousand beast soldiers, led by a Beast Spirit, could probably wear down even a Martial King through attrition.</p><p></p><p>And... Martial King.</p><p></p><p>Well, they hadn't heard of any stronghold having a Martial King.</p><p></p><p>Even in mission worlds, in those extremely large-scale mission worlds, Martial Kings were merely legends.</p><p></p><p>A Martial King, converted to the cultivation world, would be equivalent to a Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>The invincible Purple Mansion realm!</p><p></p><p>"An Qiao, you're here. What a coincidence. By the way, this Genius Alliance certificate, help me deliver it to Yang Guang."</p><p></p><p>A calm and leisurely voice came, and at this moment, all the people present suddenly smelled an extremely thick bloody scent.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, their blood was boiling and trembling, as if they had been targeted by a terrifying demon.</p><p></p><p>They saw a handsome young man in a blood-red robe appear.</p><p></p><p>The Genius Alliance certificate also fell into An Qiao's hand.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Qi Yuan, their bodies trembling involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>This trembling seemed to be engraved in their genes, in their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had doubted An Qiao was exaggerating.</p><p></p><p>But now, when Qi Yuan appeared, they knew what An Qiao said was absolutely true!</p><p></p><p>That terrifyingly overwhelming killing intent and bloody aura couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>And their blood martial way was based on beasts.</p><p></p><p>So they had the deepest feeling.</p><p></p><p>These people looked at Qi Yuan, trembling in fear, all their previous bravado gone.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at everyone: "Did I just hear someone speaking ill of me? A few days ago, at the Four Seasons Restaurant, someone spoke ill of me and was beaten to death by me.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... there are still people speaking ill of me?"</p><p></p><p>With one glance, a thick bloody aura spread.</p><p></p><p>These people couldn't help but tremble, their hearts filled with extreme fear.</p><p></p><p>They had a feeling that if Qi Yuan wanted to, he could kill them at any time.</p><p></p><p>"You all look at me with such fearful eyes. Could it be... you all spoke ill of me and are feeling guilty?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at everyone, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"We didn't!"</p><p></p><p>These people hurriedly looked at Qi Yuan with flattery, some trying hard to put on innocent expressions.</p><p></p><p>"If you didn't curse me, why are you afraid of me?" Qi Yuan moved his lips.</p><p></p><p>He thought of a classic saying.</p><p></p><p>The people present became even more afraid, wanting to appear unafraid, but their bodies wouldn't allow it.</p><p></p><p>But then he said: "Forget it, I'm magnanimous and won't hold it against you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided that when he got back, he needed to find the Golden Canary and have her help conceal the bloody aura on his body.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it was too demonic.</p><p></p><p>This affected his bright and positive image.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

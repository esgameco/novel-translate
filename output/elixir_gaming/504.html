        <h1>Chapter 504</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu looked at the peculiar-looking magical artifact and found it rather ugly.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that the other party might be the ruthless person who appeared in the Red Cloud Stronghold, he asked, "How much is this... in silver taels?"</p><p></p><p>The young master saw this and was somewhat puzzled, but did not say much, only looking at Qi Yuan's collection of magical artifacts with disdain.</p><p></p><p>They looked shabby and not very impressive.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Yellow-grade magical artifact, something I created with great effort and painstaking work. </p><p></p><p>More importantly, this type of artifact only exists in imagination, this is the first time it has appeared in reality.</p><p></p><p>You've struck it lucky, it's only 1,000 taels."</p><p></p><p>"What, 1,000 taels?" Before Young Master Tu could speak, a bystander couldn't help but exclaim, "Even the best Yellow-grade magical artifacts don't cost that much, you're being too greedy!"</p><p></p><p>"That's way too much, except for some top-tier Yellow-grade artifacts, where would it be worth over 1,000 taels?"</p><p></p><p>Generally, the value of a Yellow-grade artifact fluctuates around a few hundred taels, rarely exceeding 1,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>The young master couldn't help but sneer, "Why don't you go rob someone?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained calm, "If you try to attack me, I'll rob you today."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been law-abiding and kind, following the principle of "I don't bother you, you don't bother me." </p><p></p><p>Since the young master hadn't really offended him yet, he naturally couldn't rob him.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The young master wanted to say something, but was quickly stopped by Young Master Tu.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Qi Yuan was a ruthless person. </p><p></p><p>If they really offended Qi Yuan and got killed, where would they go to reason with him? "1,000 taels of silver, I... I'll buy it," Young Master Tu gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>The people around saw this and all exclaimed in surprise: "Bought it?"</p><p></p><p>"He actually bought it!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, this person is really rich!"</p><p></p><p>The other stall owners couldn't help but look at Young Master Tu with the eyes of a "fat sheep."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I also have a Yellow-grade artifact, not much inferior to his, only 800 taels, will you buy it?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you 500 taels!"</p><p></p><p>They all saw Young Master Tu as a "fat sheep" to be fleeced.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu ignored them and asked Qi Yuan, "What is special about this magical artifact?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it has its unique features." Qi Yuan's eyes showed a smile. "See that button there? When you press it lightly during use, a beam of light sword will appear.</p><p></p><p>This light sword is formed by absorbing the vital energy of heaven and earth, indestructible, with the killing intent of the earth, and terrifying power."</p><p></p><p>Light sword, light sword, Qi Yuan definitely didn't practice the light of this world into a sword, but transformed the vital energy of heaven and earth into a sword.</p><p></p><p>The main features of this light sword are sharpness and durability.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, sounds quite ordinary." The young master couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>The rest also felt that Qi Yuan's description was too plain.</p><p></p><p>Like some Yellow-grade artifacts, they are engraved with some special functions.</p><p></p><p>Such as attacks that come with burning, freezing, and other special properties.</p><p></p><p>This one of Qi Yuan's not only lacks that, but is also so expensive.</p><p></p><p>"I'll buy it." Without any hesitation, Young Master Tu handed over a 1,000-tael silver note.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the silver note and said indifferently, "In fact, this artifact also has a special ability, but to activate that ability, it requires 10,000 taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"10,000 taels of silver?"</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying?"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"This might be able to buy the cheapest Earth-grade artifact!"</p><p></p><p>"You... this is too outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"No matter how special the function is, can it really be worth 10,000 taels of silver?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, some looking at Qi Yuan, feeling that this person was too greedy.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing a sheep and fleecing it to death.</p><p></p><p>The young master was also shocked: "10,000 taels, do you know what that concept is?"</p><p></p><p>Even he would be hard-pressed to produce 10,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>As for Young Master Tu, he was now hesitant and extremely conflicted, his mind a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask the senior, what is this special ability?" Young Master Tu, remembering the powerful person from the Red Cloud Stronghold, couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"If you hear it, you have to buy it, no backing out, are you sure you want to hear it?" Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The other party had money, so he might as well fleece him a bit more.</p><p></p><p>Open a stall for a day, eat for a year.</p><p></p><p>With 10,000 taels, he could buy a lot of materials.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the opportunity, he had to seize it.</p><p></p><p>The young master pulled Young Master Tu: "Brother Tu, why bother being deceived by this person, that's 10,000 taels!"</p><p></p><p>They came from noble backgrounds, but even 10,000 taels would be a huge burden.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu was now extremely hesitant, on one hand he knew Qi Yuan was very strong, on the other hand he was afraid this was a scam.</p><p></p><p>"Fortune favors the brave, if you leave, the special ability of this artifact will never be activated in your lifetime." Qi Yuan's voice was calm, full of bewitching power.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu was extremely conflicted, he looked at Qi Yuan's face, recalling the news that had come back from the Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>That day, many people saw the mysterious person there display his might.</p><p></p><p>Later, many Imperial Guards went to the Red Cloud Stronghold to investigate the identity of that mysterious person, having the stronghold's residents describe the mysterious person's appearance, and then drawing it out.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, each of the stronghold's residents described something different, saying all kinds of strange things.</p><p></p><p>The drawings of the person also varied.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some mysterious power was preventing them from finding out the identity of that mysterious person.</p><p></p><p>However, the combination of an old and a young man, one shabby, one handsome, was a fact.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu thought of the blood-colored armor on that mysterious man, and he felt a sense of connection.</p><p></p><p>That blood-colored armor looked like a strange magical artifact.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the special ability of this artifact is also related to that?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, his heart started racing.</p><p></p><p>"I... I'll buy it, please tell me, senior!" Finally, Young Master Tu gritted his teeth and turned to the young master beside him, "I don't have enough money with me, can you lend me 4,000 taels?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tu... he's obviously a swindler!" The young master was a bit anxious, "The artifacts they have here are not certified, strange and bizarre, I think they're worth at most a few dozen taels, yet you're willing to pay 10,000 taels, don't tell me it's even better than an Earth-grade artifact?"</p><p></p><p>The young master said a long string of things, like a machine gun.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gong, lend me the money, even if I get swindled, it's my own problem, you won't lose anything!" Young Master Tu was clearly worked up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this scene, and he even felt that if he swindled Young Master Tu, he would definitely succeed.</p><p></p><p>However, he was law-abiding and kind, and never did anything illegal.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The young master's expression was gloomy, but in the end he lent 4,000 taels to Young Master Tu.</p><p></p><p>The people around saw the young master and Young Master Tu, their breathing even quickened, and many had a greedy look in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu held the 10,000-tael silver note and respectfully said, "Please tell me, senior."</p><p></p><p>"Its special ability is called 'Summon the Deity'.</p><p></p><p>Sleeping within the light sword is a divine being, named 'Divine Descent'.</p><p></p><p>You only need to have a shallow faith in Him.</p><p></p><p>When in danger, you can silently recite the words 'Summon the Deity', and the avatar of the deity will descend to help you resolve your troubles.</p><p></p><p>However, this summoning has a limit of only three times."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used a voice transmission technique this time.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tu heard this, his expression stunned, and a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Summon the avatar of a deity? It sounded so unreliable.</p><p></p><p>After all, only those who dare to call themselves deities are definitely divine artifacts or divine-level Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>This small Yellow-grade artifact being able to summon the avatar of a deity, it sounded too dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, you've hit the jackpot, I only have three of these artifacts that can activate special abilities, this time I'm being generous to you." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>In his words, he couldn't help but reveal a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was a genius.</p><p></p><p>Killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>Selling the artifact, earning silver, and also gaining a believer.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, when he performs the 'Divine Descent' to help the believer, he actually cannot obtain any substantial reward, at most just increasing his acting level.</p><p></p><p>Now, he is selling this opportunity in the form of an artifact.</p><p></p><p>This is truly clever to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Worthy of being called the number one smart person in Da Ning!</p><p></p><p>"Only three?" Young Master Tu swallowed hard, looking at Qi Yuan with some doubt.</p><p></p><p>After all, the matter of the avatar of a deity, no matter how he heard it, sounded so mystical.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's used up, so there won't be any left. You have to be careful with it and try to use it as late as possible," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the young master had an unkind gaze. "Brother Tu, what ability does it activate?"</p><p></p><p>He still felt that Qi Yuan was a swindler.</p><p></p><p>"This... Black Brother, it's not appropriate to stay here any longer. Let's go somewhere else to talk," the Third Young Master Tu said hesitantly, not knowing how to explain.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly left with the young master.</p><p></p><p>"There are two more magical artifacts here. If you want to buy them, it's only a thousand taels, but if you give ten thousand taels, you can activate a special ability," Qi Yuan called out.</p><p></p><p>The people around Qi Yuan and the Third Young Master Tu all felt that the Third Young Master Tu was a stooge.</p><p></p><p>After all, ten thousand taels were given away just like that.</p><p></p><p>They became more interested in the magical artifacts on Qi Yuan's stall.</p><p></p><p>However, even a thousand taels or ten thousand taels left many people stunned.</p><p></p><p>No one's money just blew in with the wind, and in the end... only a few people bought a few artifacts worth dozens of taels.</p><p></p><p>As for the expensive ones, not a single one was sold.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Qi Yuan lazily stretched.</p><p></p><p>"Spending money like flowing water, more than ten thousand taels, and now less than half remains."</p><p></p><p>After the Third Young Master Tu left, Qi Yuan quickly packed up his stall and then went to the Ghost Market to buy some refining materials.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Market had a wide variety of refining materials, and Qi Yuan needed many of them.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the magical artifacts with storage bag-like functions were also something Qi Yuan desperately needed, costing him three thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>And the space inside was quite small, less than ten cubic meters.</p><p></p><p>He bought the rest of the materials and stored them all in the storage magical artifact, accumulating quite a lot.</p><p></p><p>"With so many materials, I can also refine a lot of powerful drones or mechanical angels!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was full of ambition.</p><p></p><p>He felt that by organizing an electronic army, he could disguise himself as a deity, relying on these electronic troops.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ideas for these magical artifacts came from the Blue Star, and some TV shows and movies.</p><p></p><p>These "ancient people" had never seen modern weapons, so they would surely see him as a deity.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, with so much money, you can also buy some buns!" Chen Kang Bao said beside him.</p><p></p><p>He was the most concerned about food.</p><p></p><p>"You, you're always thinking about eating," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he and Chen Kang Bao had already walked out of the Ghost Market, and Qi Yuan deliberately slowed his pace.</p><p></p><p>"In the Immortal Cultivation World, I've never encountered robbing and killing. But in this game world, I have. Interesting, very interesting," he murmured, then said to the dark, heavy forest behind him, "Since you've come, come out! Why hide and show only your heads?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's words fell, five figures emerged from the forest.</p><p></p><p>These five figures were all dressed in black robes, concealing their figures.</p><p></p><p>Each one emanated a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, leave the storage magical artifact and the silver taels, and we'll let you leave alive!" the leader said in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>When the Third Young Master Tu spent ten thousand taels to buy the magical artifacts on Qi Yuan's stall, many eyes had fallen on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That was ten thousand taels, enough to tempt even Profound-level Armored Soldiers to take risks.</p><p></p><p>These five figures included two Profound-level Armored Soldiers and three Yellow-level advanced Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>"Your courage is a bit too much. Are you not afraid that I'm hiding my true strength?" Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, little brother, why bother trying to scare us.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Ghost Market, passing through the gate inspection, do you think we don't know your strength? A mere Yellow-level Armored Soldier dares to try to cheat and deceive? Damaging the reputation of the Ghost Market, the silver you swindled will be ours!"</p><p></p><p>A Profound-level Armored Soldier spoke, his voice cold.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who entered the Ghost Market had to pass through the entrance.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance, there was a Earth-level magical artifact.</p><p></p><p>That Earth-level magical artifact was a detection-type artifact, able to determine the aura of the person entering.</p><p></p><p>These five people had asked the people in the Ghost Market, and they knew that Qi Yuan's aura was only at the Yellow-level, not formidable.</p><p></p><p>They also guessed that Qi Yuan had somehow tricked that Third Young Master Tu.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before that Third Young Master Tu realized it, and the Tu Family would surely make a move against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They had to hurry, before the Tu Family acted, and seize that ten thousand taels for themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, human hearts are so evil. Why do they have to bully me, when I'm just a humble son-in-law?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, his disguise disappeared, revealing an even more exceptionally handsome face.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the one you're bullying is the son-in-law of the Shen Family... Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Once bullied, the son-in-law Qi Yuan immediately went online.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he increase his acting experience.</p><p></p><p>"Shen... Shen Family son-in-law?" The five black-robed figures were taken aback, clearly not reacting.</p><p></p><p>"You're actually the Shen Family son-in-law?" One of the Profound-level Armored Soldiers became a bit wary. "Shen Lingxuan's husband?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's name was renowned.</p><p></p><p>Although Shen Lingxuan and he were both Profound-level Armored Soldiers, Shen Lingxuan was a genius on the Heavenly Prodigy Rankings, incomparable to them.</p><p></p><p>"It's him, a bit troublesome," another Profound-level Armored Soldier spoke, regretting getting involved in this matter.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't offend the Shen Family's wrath.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he a waste?" someone said, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew the Shen Family son-in-law was a useless person who didn't cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Yet he had hidden his strength so deeply, being a Yellow-level Armored Soldier?</p><p></p><p>The leader's expression kept changing, and finally he said, "Young Master Qi, let's forget this matter. We'll act like we were never here."</p><p></p><p>Thinking that his identity hadn't been exposed, he had the intention to retreat.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they killed Shen Lingxuan's husband, the Ghost Market couldn't protect them.</p><p></p><p>The others seeing this also wanted to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I've already revealed my identity. If you don't continue bullying me, won't I lose face?"</p><p></p><p>"And Wang Kanshan, Fang Tai, Lin Hu... do you really think I can't recognize you just because you're wearing those robes?" Qi Yuan directly named these five people.</p><p></p><p>The five black-robed figures' expressions suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>How were they exposed? How did this Qi Yuan know their identities? If Qi Yuan returned to the Shen Family and reported their names, they would be doomed!</p><p></p><p>No, he couldn't be allowed to live and return!</p><p></p><p>Murderous intent arose! Wang Kanshan felt a strong threat, his eyes filled with killing intent as he looked at the others, finally gritting his teeth and saying, "Kill him, and leave Jining Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>No matter what, this seemed to be the only path left to take at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The other four, seeing this, also revealed murderous gazes and charged towards Qi Yuan: "Die!"</p><p></p><p>Wielding magical artifacts, they attacked Qi Yuan with a thunderous strike, not holding back at all. Although Qi Yuan's appearance was strange, his strength was real, and as mere Yellow-level, they could kill him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to show off my skills again."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I've gotten used to relying on brute force, I almost forgot that I'm a tech expert!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice sounded, his figure suddenly flashed.</p><p></p><p>This flash of movement was just right, not too much, not too little, perfectly evading the attack from the five.</p><p></p><p>Then, a short sword stabbed out, flowing like clouds and water, thrusting towards Wang Kanshan's neck.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was fast, skillful, and natural.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Profound-level Armored Soldier Wang Kanshan clutched his neck and collapsed to the ground, his body going limp. He never understood how that sword strike had appeared at his neck. The other four looked at Qi Yuan as if he were a devil.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's techniques were simply too... unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, too perfect.</p><p></p><p>Even though his strength was only at the Yellow-level in terms of power and speed, their strength far surpassed his.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were completely toyed with by him, unable to even touch the hem of Qi Yuan's robe.</p><p></p><p>"Continue bullying me, I'm just a weak and powerless little son-in-law," Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>But to these four, it was like the smile of a devil.</p><p></p><p>Sword light flashed, and another dozen breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the forest, several corpses fell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan elegantly sheathed his sword, then looked down with disdain: "So poor, yet still learning to kill and rob others?"</p><p></p><p>He had only searched them and found less than three hundred taels, truly pathetic!

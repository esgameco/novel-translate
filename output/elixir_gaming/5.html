        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's eyes were filled with a smile, adding a touch of charm to her delicate and beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a cultivation technique, how could it be so easy to modify? Especially for a practitioner at the Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have reached the Foundation Establishment realm would have the qualifications to modify a cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Jiang Lingsu paid no attention to what her senior brother Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>She took the jade slip containing the cultivation technique, and after thinking about something, reminded him, "Senior brother, cultivating the technique is extremely important. You must not rashly modify or cultivate it, or you may end up going down the wrong path and become possessed!"</p><p></p><p>She had just recently become acquainted with Senior Brother Qi Yuan, so she only gave a brief reminder, not wanting to get too intimate too quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at her and slowly said, "Do you think that as long as you don't modify the cultivation technique, everything will be fine?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>It seems that her senior brother really has a problem, and a big one at that.</p><p></p><p>A practitioner of the Fool's Sect! She didn't say anything further, but took the jade slip containing the cultivation technique back to her own room.</p><p></p><p>"'The Technique of Refining the Seven-Colored Flames'?"</p><p>"A Jade-grade technique?"</p><p>"Looks rather ordinary."</p><p></p><p>She had originally wanted to use this technique to investigate the background of the Peak Lord of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p>But it looks rather ordinary.</p><p>Although a Jade-grade technique is still decent, she didn't place much importance on it.</p><p>After all, her family has a large collection of Jade-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>She examined the content of the technique.</p><p>"The latter part seems to be... what my senior brother modified?"</p><p>"Looks like he's quite capable of deceiving people."</p><p>"At least he managed to deceive me."</p><p>"The Tower of Ascending to the Heavens contains all techniques, it seems this one is also recorded there. I wonder if my sister Yaya has any annotations on it.</p><p>She is the best at modifying cultivation techniques. If I have time, I'll let her evaluate the modified content, so that my senior brother can avoid taking the wrong path if he cultivates it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu murmured to herself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attention was completely focused on the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained this game jade slip about a year ago.</p><p>He had been playing this game for around a year, and it was just a regular boss-fighting game.</p><p></p><p>The game map showed that the place he was in was called the Yueyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Yueyue Continent had four major forbidden lands and two great desolate lands.</p><p></p><p>The map Qi Yuan was currently in was called the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>There were many demonic beasts in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p>These demonic beasts were fierce and brutal.</p><p>There were snakes as thick as buckets, carnivorous flowers with rows of sharp teeth, and giant beetles as big as tanks.</p><p></p><p>To Qi Yuan, these demonic beasts were all just experience packages.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one demonic beast in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land that disgusted Qi Yuan and lowered his gaming experience.</p><p>That beast was a fox tail that resembled a writing brush, with a loud name called the "Crazed Brush".</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, Qi Yuan's game character was wearing golden armor and was slaughtering everything in sight.</p><p>Those powerful demonic beasts were completely powerless against him.</p><p></p><p>"Mere 50-level demonic beasts, daring to show off in front of me!"</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Qi Yuan swept his sword across.</p><p></p><p>At level 80, he could be considered a rampaging tyrant in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p>These days, he had been rampaging.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, he was just an ordinary 1-level player.</p><p>The game he played was Battlegrounds.</p><p>In a year's time, he leveled up to 80, able to stroll through the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p>Now he was playing as a rampaging ruffian.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land now cower in fear at the sight of him.</p><p>And slaying the demonic beasts in the Yueyue Continent also greatly benefited Qi Yuan in the real world.</p><p>Otherwise, how could he have reached the Qi Condensation realm in just one year?</p><p>Even true geniuses would need at least three years to reach the Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation progress in the game could affect his own cultivation.</p><p>Of course, only to a certain extent.</p><p>After all...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Finally, the him in the game is very strong now. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> How strong? Qi Yuan has no concept.</p><p></p><p>But killing the sect master of the Divine Light Sect with a single sword strike is no big deal.</p><p></p><p>However, the him in reality is merely a small Qi Condensation realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"I'll defeat the final boss, the Crazy Brush, and complete this dungeon."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Qi Yuan became even more motivated.</p><p></p><p>He will complete the dungeon today.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what reward I'll get."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe a harmless cultivation technique as a reward?"</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, a foundation-building spiritual item would do."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Crazy Brush, a fierce battle intent flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This brush, during the day it takes the form of a brush, but at night it transforms into a beautiful fox demon in human form, extremely alluring.</p><p></p><p>And the thing they love to do the most is night raids.</p><p></p><p>If one falls for their tricks, at the most passionate moment, they will reveal their fangs.</p><p></p><p>Directly transforming into a sharp brush, stabbing into the... hole of the bewitched person.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan has seen many demonic beasts in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land fall victim to the Crazy Brush, and the results were truly tragic.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan won't be bewitched by the Crazy Brush, but... he has to log out at night.</p><p></p><p>Once he logs out, he has to be on guard against the Crazy Brush.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he almost imitated the male protagonist from a certain anime, and made himself a "golden crotch" to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>In the end, before logging out, he dug a hole and buried himself in the ground to avoid the Crazy Brush's night raid.</p><p></p><p>"The final Crazy Brush boss is only level 70, no problem."</p><p></p><p>"I have to quickly defeat it, and in the evening I still need to take my little pet out for a walk."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded a long sword, his body clad in golden armor, emanating multicolored brilliance. With a single sword strike, there were all kinds of special effects, looking quite flamboyant.</p><p></p><p>If this were in another game, one look would know that he is a big spender, and a very stylish one at that.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Qi Yuan entered the Xuanyuan Palace.</p><p></p><p>Holding a great treasure sword, he let out a rather chuuni roar: "Demonic beasts, where can you run!"</p><p></p><p>Meek and mild in reality, but aggressive in the game.</p><p></p><p>Responding to him was the Crazy Brush's shrill cry of fear.</p><p></p><p>He wielded the long sword, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Crazy Brushes were broken.</p><p></p><p>His experience bar was also constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>"Come out, demonic beasts!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted, wanting to summon the greatest boss in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one responded to him.</p><p></p><p>All the Crazy Brushes were fleeing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was killing them joyfully.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a golden light shook violently.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Palace started trembling.</p><p></p><p>A brush with a fox-like tail burst out from the ground.</p><p></p><p>The sharp brush, like a sharp sword, craving a worthy opponent, directly stabbed towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I was well-prepared." Qi Yuan was not flustered.</p><p></p><p>He had made a plan to deal with this beforehand.</p><p></p><p>And even if he didn't have a plan, he would not be afraid.</p><p>His strength was evident.</p><p></p><p>"Summer Eight Slashes!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan unleashed his strongest sword technique.</p><p></p><p>That's right, he used a sword technique with a sword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Crazy Brush was directly broken.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "It's only worthy of taking one of my slashes, too weak.</p><p>There are still seven slashes, I wonder who can withstand them, how lonely."</p><p></p><p>The crazed brush perished, and the Xuanyuan Palace collapsed at that moment.</p><p>And at this time, a prompt also reached Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>【The Xuanyuan Forbidden Land dungeon has been cleared, rewards obtained.】</p><p></p><p>【Reward 1: 10 Heavenly Dao Fragments.】</p><p></p><p>【Reward 2: Divine Brush.】</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

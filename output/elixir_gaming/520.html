            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your birthday? How coincidental?"</p><p></p><p>"On the day of your birth, you slew demons and exorcised evil spirits, you really do have a protagonist-like quality."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's stay..."</p><p></p><p>The voices gradually faded away on the surface of Lake Yeshanhu.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later.</p><p></p><p>The delicate little hand grasped the slender pen, the crooked handwriting wandering across theå®£paper.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't written in my diary these past few days, because I went and did a meaningful big thing!"</p><p></p><p>"...The knife spun in my hand, myriads of thunderbolts surged forth, within my line of sight, the treacherous spirits were all slain!"</p><p></p><p>"The final Luo Tong Shui Jun, the powerful and treacherous spirit that had been wreaking havoc, was also felled by my heroic single stroke.</p><p></p><p>In the last moments before its life extinguished, Luo Tong Shui Jun told me a story about itself.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that it was once a human being, who had entered the Heavenly Sect, and even had a sworn brother as a teacher.</p><p></p><p>However, when the two went on an adventure outside, it unfortunately died out there, and upon awakening, it was no longer human..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, every great villain has a touching story behind them."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi put down her pen, glancing at the kitchen knife beside her, feeling both joy and a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity that the kitchen knife didn't bleed and shatter in her embrace, or that she didn't lose an eye or a leg, for then this world-saving journey would have been even more legendary and memorable.</p><p></p><p>Although in her diary, this world-saving journey was described as fraught with danger, where she even experienced several bloody battles, in reality she had simply steamrolled through without any real peril.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the world-saving journey in my writing is more interesting than reality."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Jiang Yunxi was living within her own pen.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because reality is too easy and smooth, so it lacks a certain elegance?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Cai, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's mind wandered, and she glanced at Qi Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm summarizing the gains from this venture."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan replied briefly, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>His words were only half true.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his thoughts were quite complex.</p><p></p><p>"The reward for playing the role of perfection and attainment is... wood."</p><p></p><p>The first reward for playing the role of the kitchen knife was the sharpness of iron, the second was similar, allowing Qi Yuan to obtain a physique comparable to a heavenly-grade artifact.</p><p></p><p>When it came to playing the role of perfection and attainment, the reward was the vitality of wood.</p><p></p><p>Massive life force, endless and surging, permeating Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"So this wood... is the hilt of the knife?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could only make this association.</p><p></p><p>The final reward was related to the knife hilt.</p><p></p><p>"Originally I was a technique-type warrior, after obtaining a powerful physical body, I became unstoppable. Now with so much wood vitality, I can truly be considered... immortal?"</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the reward from this role-playing was exceptionally bountiful.</p><p></p><p>The endless flowing vitality, like a mighty river, combined with the great skill of Death Radiance, when facing encirclement, he would be able to unleash extremely powerful forces.</p><p></p><p>Even if all the opponents were of the same realm, he could potentially achieve immortality! [Kitchen Knife role-playing completed, Role 4 unlocked.]</p><p></p><p>[Role 4: Blind Artifact Forger]</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flood of information poured into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Blind Artifact Forger was blind from birth, his impoverished parents unable to support a blind infant, ultimately abandoning him in a rainy night by the river.</p><p></p><p>The blind infant was fortunate, being found and taken in by an old man in the deep mountains, an impoverished artifact forger apprentice whose lifelong dream was to become a master artifact forger.</p><p></p><p>Alas, his talents were lacking, so he pinned his hopes on the Blind Artifact Forger.</p><p></p><p>When the Blind Artifact Forger was seven years old, the old man passed away, leaving the Blind Artifact Forger with a lingering regret.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to become a divine-level artifact forger, to fulfill the old man's aspirations! His natural talents were actually extraordinary, his memory phenomenal, easily grasping all the forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, he... was blind.</p><p></p><p>Even seeking the most powerful medical saints could not cure his blindness.</p><p></p><p>Blindness imposed immense limitations on artifact forging...</p><p></p><p>Despite the Blind Artifact Forger's amazing talents, he was stuck at the heavenly-grade artifact forger level.</p><p></p><p>His greatest lifelong wish was to become a divine-level artifact forger, or even surpass that, to see the higher realms.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, this one has the right stuff, as for the useless Qi Yuan... he's too much of a waste."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already guessed.</p><p></p><p>When the game collapsed before, he had infused his essence blood to maintain this game world.</p><p></p><p>The characters he was now playing were extensions of that essence blood.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was also quite surprised, his essence blood could truly transform.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there the useless Qi Yuan, but also the Kitchen Knife.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there was also the Blind Artifact Forger.</p><p></p><p>He carefully recalled the Blind Artifact Forger's life story.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, various forging techniques and repair methods flowed into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gained a deeper understanding of the art of artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>"This Blind Artifact Forger is truly a genius, his talents are excellent, unlike the useless Qi Yuan, whose mind is always thinking about being bullied, pouring water for his mother-in-law."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt quite relieved.</p><p></p><p>At least his essence blood had some use.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the Blind Artifact Forger's memories, he heard a familiar voice.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the voice of Qi Yuan's father?"</p><p></p><p>"Does he have dealings with the Blind Artifact Forger?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the world to be so small.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, your talents are astounding, with the prospect of reaching the divine level, even surpassing that, please join us, together we will fight for the Azure Mountain Realm, for our homeland, to dispel the darkness and see the light again!"</p><p></p><p>These were the words spoken by Qi Yuan's father.</p><p></p><p>According to the Blind Artifact Forger's memories,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's father had joined a mysterious organization, one that spoke of the world's impending destruction, and that only by uniting all artifact forgers to create the mightiest artifacts could they avoid this calamity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's father invited the Blind Artifact Forger to join their organization and forge the ultimate artifact.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blind Artifact Forger refused.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have to make a note of this, after all, to play the role of Qi Yuan, I need to understand and grasp all the relevant information about him."</p><p></p><p>"Playing the Blind Artifact Forger..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This role-playing is so strange, once I start playing, I'll actually go blind, and furthermore... the completion won't be perfect, I'll remain in the Blind Artifact Forger's state?"</p><p></p><p>The other role-playings did not have this issue.</p><p></p><p>He could be the Kitchen Knife, he could be the Godly Arrival, he could be the useless Qi Yuan, switching freely between them.</p><p></p><p>But playing the Blind Artifact Forger was different, once he started, he had to complete it in one go.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because, among all the playable characters, his will is the strongest, occupying the dominant position?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had this speculation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can't play the Blind Artifact Forger yet, I still need to play Qi Yuan and the Godly Arrival."</p><p></p><p>"But even if I don't actively play, in at most five months, I'll have to play him."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Role-playing had its limitations, and right now he didn't want to exclusively play the Blind Artifact Forger.</p><p></p><p>But if he didn't play, in at most five months, he would be forced to play.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, I still have five months, I need to quickly improve my strength, and... learn more.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Blind Artifact Forger's lifelong wish was only to become a divine-level artifact forger, if I can become a divine-level forger within five months, won't I just breeze through the role-playing?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't want to go blind himself.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look at Jiang Yunxi, with a slightly unexpected expression.</p><p></p><p>"This network of connections... I'll have to make use of it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The fall of Luo Tong Shui Jun caused a huge commotion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Movement.</p><p></p><p>Especially on that day, ten Imperial Guards descended to the underwater palace, and the strongest among them, Wei Kun the Sorrowful Wind Hand, chose to remain in the underwater palace.</p><p></p><p>But who would have known that shortly after the other Imperial Guards left, the underwater palace let out a thunderous roar, and the sturdy artifact collapsed on the spot, vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Wei Kun the Sorrowful Wind Hand died inside the underwater palace, never coming out.</p><p></p><p>This left the remaining Imperial Guards feeling caught off guard, instinctively feeling... that there might have been a conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had their own thoughts, but the news of the Water Lord's demise and Jiang Yunxi staying behind the words left by the Water Lord Luotong spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>Especially the next day, the Mountain King found Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the matter of the underwater palace, Jiang Yunxi was evasive, but during the night, the Mountain King accidentally discovered Jiang Yunxi's personal diary, revealing the truth of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Yunxi is actually the Mandate Child, and was entrusted by a mysterious old man with a divine artifact, the Vegetable Knife, to slay the Water Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, a mere Profound-level Imperial Guard actually managed to slay the Luotong Water Lord, whom even the Heaven Sect found difficult to deal with - what level of artifact is this!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I will be Jiang Yunxi the Princess's dog!"</p><p></p><p>"The Luotong Water Lord is gone... gone?"</p><p></p><p>Those who learned the news felt as if they were in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was enthusiastically preparing for the Artifact Refiner's Conference, discussing the repair of the Mighty Trident, and the various Imperial Guards had already reported their determination to go and kill the Water Lord.</p><p></p><p>But the result told us that the Water Lord had suddenly disappeared, and was killed by an obscure princess.</p><p></p><p>Now, Jiang Yunxi can be called the Darling of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>At the Mountain King's temporary residence, there were many people coming daily to present gifts.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain King smiled cheerfully every day, exceptionally delighted.</p><p></p><p>As for Jiang Yunxi, she kept a low profile, letting the artifact refiners from the conference bring her ancient books related to artifact refining every day, which earned her the admiration of many.</p><p></p><p>"Unassuming and unruffled, the Princess Yunxi has the qualities of a phoenix!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I heard from the storyteller at the tavern that when that legendary terrifying artifact slew the Luotong Water Lord, it heroically withstood several blows from the Water Lord to protect Princess Yunxi, and turned to ashes."</p><p></p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi ultimately lived in the books, and even her diary had been modified at the time.</p><p></p><p>Her Vegetable Knife artifact, in this story, heroically shattered while protecting her.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when I can obtain an artifact like that?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, just then, outside a courtyard, Xie Danran's expression was solemn, appearing upright and dignified, but if one looked closely, there was a hint of worry in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He stood respectfully outside the courtyard, his posture straight and tall.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a maid came out.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xie, please come in, the Princess is waiting for you inside."</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran hurriedly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>But his heart was filled with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, he had seen that foolish princess on Ao Mountain Lake.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the two had a confrontation.</p><p></p><p>That princess had said that she was the Savior, and not to stop her.</p><p></p><p>He had not taken it seriously, inwardly mocking her.</p><p></p><p>But now, who would have known that the Water Lord had actually been slain by Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>"The Princess hates evil and is naive... I must have offended her last time. This time, I need to turn my image around. If I can't even deceive Shen Lingxuan, who is so intelligent, how can I deceive her?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's thoughts turned, and he stood even straighter, like a refined gentleman.</p><p></p><p>He had to turn his image around in the Princess's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Soon, led by the maid, he saw Jiang Yunxi sitting behind the curtain.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran hurriedly paid his respects: "Xie Danran of the Heaven Sect pays his respects to the Princess. The Princess has risen up to save the common people from the water and fire, truly impressing me!"</p><p></p><p>He bent over, almost kneeling on the ground, his attitude extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>"At Ao Mountain Lake, I failed to recognize the true phoenix, and offended the Princess. Whenever I think about it, I feel utterly remorseful!"</p><p></p><p>Behind the curtain, Jiang Yunxi's toes were almost curling up, she seemed to really enjoy being praised.</p><p></p><p>However, remembering the task Qiao Yuan had instructed, she said in a crisp voice, like a deer biting tender lotus roots: "I heard that you once offered a poisonous scheme, wanting to hand over Shen Lingxuan to the people from the Raksasa Country?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran was a bit puzzled, wasn't the Princess summoning him because of the incident where he had obstructed her? Why was she asking about this instead?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly knelt on the ground, his expression becoming passionate and heroic: "Princess, you do not know, the person I admire and care for most in my life is my shidi Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>To hand over my shidi to the Raksasa Country people, if you ask who would be the most heartbroken, naturally it would be me. That pain, even if you tore out my heart ten times, it would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>But even though it is painful, for the sake of the thirty million people of the Jining Prefecture, I had to reveal that poisonous scheme!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran knelt on the ground, weeping bitterly, appearing extremely remorseful.</p><p></p><p>He said while beating his chest, tears streaming down his face.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi behind the curtain was also moved by Xie Danran's performance.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Old Cai was wrong? This Xie Danran is a good person, and they had misunderstood him? However, remembering Old Cai's instructions, she still snorted coldly: "Hmph, who knows what evil intentions you harbor!"</p><p></p><p>"If I can save the masses, what fear is there in shattering this body of mine?"</p><p></p><p>The two continued to converse.</p><p></p><p>With Jiang Yunxi's brain, although she was a bit clever, she was not very smart.</p><p></p><p>After an hour of conversation, Jiang Yunxi was moved by Xie Danran.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's eyes became increasingly confident, and his posture grew even more upright.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that if given a few more hours, he could win over Jiang Yunxi.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>This left Xie Danran a bit melancholic, feeling that he still had many tricks he hadn't used.</p><p></p><p>But he could only leave.</p><p></p><p>"Old Cai, I feel like this Xie Danran might be a good person. When he was speaking, he was upright and heroic, just like the righteous characters in novels.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, I followed your instructions and deliberately provoked him, but he didn't get angry, not even uttering a single curse word."Jiang Yunxi whispered.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the Vegetable Knife paused in its reading of the books.</p><p></p><p>"You're still too young, I'll give you the last lesson of your life tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Come, let me ask you, during this period, didn't Xie Danran say a single curse word or insulting remark?"Qiao Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Jiang Yunxi nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This means he is well-versed in curse words and insults, so he could perfectly avoid them."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Understand? Someone who is so well-versed in these things is not an ordinary morally corrupt person, but a very good at disguising morally corrupt person!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi's eyes widened: "Old Cai, what you said makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>She suddenly had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"And during these few hours, didn't he never deny being a murderer, rapist, bandit, or evil spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems... he didn't."</p><p></p><p>"So the answer is obvious."</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying, Old Cai, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have known how good he is at disguising himself. I'll have someone kill him right away!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Now that she had slain the Luotong Water Lord and saved Jining Prefecture, her power was great, her word was law.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran had offended her, he only had the path of death left! "Old Cai, you are a true teacher, a single word of yours has enlightened me so profoundly, it's a pity... that you cannot stay by my side."Jiang Yunxi's words had a touch of melancholy, "Otherwise, with my talents, becoming the number one chef and savior of the world, I might even have the possibility of becoming the number one intelligent person in the Great Ning!"</p><p></p><p>For the matter of her birthday, Old Cai had kept her company for an extra day.</p><p></p><p>Later, Old Cai wanted to read books, and stayed with her for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>Now, the books were read, and it was time for Old Cai to leave.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 434</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor hung outside the celestial curtain, his gaze deep and profound.</p><p></p><p>His eyes fell upon Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Qi Yuan go to meet Purple Origin Great Snow, the corner of his mouth twitched involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>His inner calm, undisturbed for so many years, began to waver.</p><p></p><p>"This guy... is there something wrong with him?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Qi Yuan had now secretly found Purple Origin Great Snow.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he said was: "I want to ask you something!"</p><p></p><p>What is it?</p><p></p><p>"Does the Ancestor have a long-lost father out there somewhere?"</p><p></p><p>Huh? "The Ancestor gave me Black Demon Ancestor Blood as a welcome gift, he's been so good to me, I'm a bit suspicious..."</p><p></p><p>Meeting with Purple Origin Great Snow was one thing, but then he went around asking the street sweepers, garbage collectors, and fishermen.</p><p></p><p>He asked everyone he saw the same two questions:</p><p></p><p>Does the Ancestor have a father left behind somewhere?</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor gave me Black Demon Ancestor Blood as a welcome gift!</p><p></p><p>That's right, he asked any random passerby, frightening many of the cultivators in Purple Origin Heaven.</p><p></p><p>He even didn't spare unborn children still in the womb. </p><p></p><p>Through their mothers' bellies, he directly said the Ancestor gave Black Demon Ancestor Blood, and asked if the Ancestor had an ancestor left behind somewhere.</p><p></p><p>In any case, within half a day, thousands of people in Purple Origin Heaven had been questioned by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on a steep mountain peak, red magma flowed, emitting thick heat.</p><p></p><p>The ground was cracked, with magma bubbling up occasionally.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure stood still.</p><p></p><p>An impolite voice sounded by his ear: "What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was none other than An Xunlu.</p><p></p><p>Her expression was cold as she crossed her arms, looking at Qi Yuan with some wariness.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had just offended Qi Yuan a few days ago, so his coming here now easily made her think he wanted revenge.</p><p></p><p>"I came here to ask you something!" Qi Yuan said secretly.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu narrowed her eyes: "What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know if the Ancestor has a father left behind somewhere?" Qi Yuan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu was very familiar with Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>And Black Sword was the number one genius of Black Demon Abyss, the light of hope, so he might know many hidden truths.</p><p></p><p>"What... are you talking about?" An Xunlu didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, didn't the Ancestor give me a welcome gift?" Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu turned her head, the firelight from the magma reflecting on her fair face, making it appear especially rosy: "So you've come to brag about this?"</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have seen through Qi Yuan's little scheme, and didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor valuing someone and giving them a treasure might make others jealous and envious, but not her.</p><p></p><p>Her future man was Black Sword after all.</p><p></p><p>The person all nine Ancestors of Black Demon Abyss treated with care.</p><p></p><p>"What bragging, I'm confused and sincerely asking." Qi Yuan couldn't help but retort.</p><p></p><p>Where was the trust between people? Oh right, he forgot, the other party wasn't human.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, what gift did the Ancestor give you?" An Xunlu asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It was probably something a little precious, so Blood Robe couldn't help coming to show off.</p><p></p><p>But she wasn't ordinary, having been by Black Sword's side, she had long seen too many precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor gave me Black Demon Ancestor Blood." Qi Yuan said, taking out the Black Demon Ancestor Blood and revealing half of it to An Xunlu.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu's pupils suddenly dilated, her breathing became rapid causing her ample chest to heave: "This... how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>How could it possibly be Black Demon Ancestor Blood!</p><p></p><p>This was Black Demon Ancestor Blood!</p><p></p><p>In Black Demon Abyss, Black Demon Ancestor Blood was even more precious than miraculous treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Spirits at the Ultimate Principle realm weren't qualified to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Only the Ancestors at the Great Ultimate Principle realm were qualified to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Demon Luo clan's Demon Luo Well swallowed some Black Demon Ancestor Blood, they were expelled.</p><p></p><p>Even now, Black Sword wasn't qualified to obtain Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>How could Blood Robe? "Impossible, Black Demon Ancestor Blood is the Ancestor's prized possession, how could he give it to you!" An Xunlu didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>But the aura emanating from the storage bag was clearly that of Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>As someone with Black Demon Abyss bloodline, she might mistake her own father, but could never mistake Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>"What? Prized possession? Is the Ancestor a duck or something?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu took a deep breath to calm herself down: "You really did get it, I didn't expect the Ancestor would give you Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>But... even with Black Demon Ancestor Blood, the number one of the younger generation in Black Demon Abyss is still Big Brother Black Sword, not you.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard you try, you can only see Black Sword's back!"</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu thrust out her chest and said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm not trying to compete with Black Sword for first place or anything, don't talk nonsense." Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>As someone with social anxiety, what would he do with an empty title of number one?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" An Xunlu was very proud, directly turning and leaving, not willing to pay any more attention to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was nearly grinding her teeth to pieces.</p><p></p><p>That was Black Demon Ancestor Blood, a supreme treasure no cultivator with Black Demon Abyss bloodline could resist.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, looks like this is another unsolved mystery of the world."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Logically, it would make the most sense to ask Purple Origin Heaven's Ancestor about this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>After all, just asking would reveal the answer.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was socially intelligent, he couldn't just go ask Purple Origin Heaven's Ancestor directly, to avoid awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the celestial curtain, Purple Origin Ancestor's beard quivered with anger.</p><p></p><p>"This guy's personality is too erratic!"</p><p></p><p>Over the past half day, he had completely lost face.</p><p></p><p>Just then, space rippled, Ultimate Principle energy flowed, and a shadowy figure appeared beside Purple Origin Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Brother, you actually gave Black Demon Ancestor Blood to Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than Third Elder, who had parted from Purple Origin Ancestor not long ago.</p><p></p><p>His eyes held a trace of surprise, as well as a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>Even if Blood Robe's talent could reach Great Ultimate Principle, even if he could master Supreme Great Ultimate Principle, it still wasn't worth them... sacrificing their own huge benefits to nurture him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, we've had a bit too much Black Demon Ancestor Blood lately, couldn't use it all." Purple Origin Ancestor said casually, clearly not wanting to answer directly.</p><p></p><p>Third Elder's expression changed several times, then he sighed and said: "Sixth Brother, it seems you still resent Master, back then..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile disappeared from Purple Origin Ancestor's face.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with Master." He replied flatly.</p><p></p><p>Third Elder clearly didn't accept Purple Origin Ancestor's words.</p><p></p><p>"You gave Black Demon Ancestor Blood to Blood Robe, hoping he could defeat... Black Sword... to prove to Master that you were right.</p><p></p><p>But... Black Sword's origin is Black Demon Ancestor Blood, no matter how talented Blood Robe is, he can't possibly be his match!" Third Elder lamented.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the events back then had greatly affected Sixth Brother, he was still hung up on it even now.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm too lazy to explain, believe whatever you want, don't bother me!" </p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor waved his hand, and Third Elder's figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>In the vast space, only Purple Origin Ancestor remained.</p><p></p><p>An unsatisfied look appeared on his face: "To think they would take me for such a petty person?"</p><p></p><p>Then, the dissatisfaction turned to secret joy: "Hmph, this is good too, they won't pay too much attention to Blood Robe."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>Inside the steel building, it was especially quiet.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Little Dew, who cleaned, had long finished and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the cold building, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>"Level 7 of the Ancestor Blood Scripture."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood up, feeling refreshed.</p><p></p><p>In three months, he had reached the 7th level of the Ancestor Blood Scripture. His strength at the Ten Thousand Dao Martial God realm had also made a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>"When I reach level 9 of the Ancestor Blood Scripture, I should be able to withstand Ultimate Principle with just Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If I master all levels, wouldn't I be able to defeat Great Ultimate Principle?"</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in quite a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Back in reality, his cultivation had stagnated, with very little progress.</p><p></p><p>This kind of growth was much slower compared to playing games.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, there was the pleasant surprise of the "Ancestral Blood Scripture".</p><p></p><p>With the improvement of his Myriad Path Martial God cultivation, his innate divine ability "Exploding Bird-Killing Fist" had also advanced.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he comprehended sword intent and suddenly realized the "Exploding Bird-Killing Sword".</p><p></p><p>This sword technique was several times more powerful than the Exploding Bird-Killing Fist.</p><p></p><p>It had increased attack power against avian creatures.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that cultivating the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' is so difficult. I've already worked so hard, risking my life to cultivate, and even with the help of Black Magic Ancestral Blood, it still took me a full three months to reach the seventh layer!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, my talent is still too poor. If I were like Black Sword, I'd probably have maxed out the layers by now."</p><p></p><p>"When talent is lacking, resources must make up for it. How can I obtain more Black Magic Ancestral Blood?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Devouring Black Magic Ancestral Blood could increase his cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>However, Black Magic Ancestral Blood was precious, extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Apart from those few Great Ultimate Reason cultivators, almost no other Yang Spirit cultivators had the qualifications to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find an opportunity to loot their ancestors' gold coins," Qi Yuan mused. "Should I do a blood recognition ritual and have him accept me as his father?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a crisp voice like a lark's rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Is Blood Robe Senior Brother here?"</p><p></p><p>"Pink Horn Sister, come in!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, opening the cave dwelling's door. Zi Yuan Xiao Lu, dressed in a pink pleated skirt, entered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's face, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu's cheeks flushed red all the way to her ears. She lowered her head and said softly, "Blood Robe Senior Brother, in a while there will be the Heavenly Venerable's lecture. I came to call you to go together and listen to the teachings on the Way of Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and there's an important announcement to be made at this Heavenly Venerable's lecture."</p><p></p><p>In the Black Magic Abyss, Yang Spirit cultivators would personally give lectures at regular intervals.</p><p></p><p>Those qualified to attend these lectures were truly the core geniuses of the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Zi Yuan Heaven, fewer than a hundred geniuses could participate.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? Then I'll go with you to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he had just finished cultivating and was feeling quite drained. He needed to take it easy, so he might as well go listen.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu had invited him to this Heavenly Venerable's lecture three months ago.</p><p></p><p>After their conversation, they flew together towards the location of the Heavenly Venerable's lecture.</p><p></p><p>"How is Senior Brother's cultivation of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' progressing?" Zi Yuan Xiao Lu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"My talent is lacking, it's an uphill battle!" Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The "Ancestral Blood Scripture" was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother's talent is so high, and you even have Black Magic Ancestral Blood. All you lack is time!" </p><p></p><p>"I also lack resources. I really want to eat some more Black Magic Ancestral Blood," Qi Yuan said greedily.</p><p></p><p>The upper realms really did have more good things.</p><p></p><p>"Even the ancestors don't have much Black Magic Ancestral Blood. Senior Brother being able to obtain it is truly enviable," Zi Yuan Xiao Lu said softly.</p><p></p><p>She thought of something and quickly reminded him, "Senior Brother, the news of you obtaining Black Magic Ancestral Blood has spread throughout the entire Black Magic Abyss. At this Heavenly Venerable's lecture, there will likely be quite a few people who are dissatisfied. You should be... a little careful."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu was somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>If Senior Brother's handsome face were to be marred by someone, where would she secretly admire such a good-looking face?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I always convince people with reason!" Qi Yuan said, completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>The two of them took a teleportation formation, leaving Zi Yuan Heaven and entering Black Magic Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Black Magic Heaven was the location for this Heavenly Venerable's lecture.</p><p></p><p>Under Zi Yuan Xiao Lu's guidance, Qi Yuan arrived at a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the mountain peak was filled with human figures, nearly a thousand in total.</p><p></p><p>Each figure emitted an extremely powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Any one of them, if placed in a sacred land of the First Heaven, would be qualified to be a Holy Son.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Da Xue was lounging lazily, with poor posture.</p><p></p><p>"Why is the supply of Milo Immortal Qi for this Heavenly Venerable's lecture reduced by more than half? Could it be that our Black Magic Abyss is about to be destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>She held up a wine cup, taking a small sip of the Milo Immortal Qi inside, which quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, a man with a pentagram on his forehead smiled bitterly and said, "Senior Sister, don't speak nonsense. It's because recently... the Molo Clan hasn't been paying tribute."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zi Yuan Da Xue was stunned. "How dare those people not pay tribute?"</p><p></p><p>She had been to the Fifth Heaven and witnessed the cowardly appearance of the Molo Clan.</p><p></p><p>When they saw people from their Black Magic Abyss, they would directly acknowledge them as fathers and ancestors.</p><p></p><p>During festivals and holidays, they would still offer good things as tribute to the Black Magic Abyss, all for the sake of returning to the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly they became tough and stopped paying tribute.</p><p></p><p>She naturally didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. Perhaps... the Molo Clan is preparing to completely rely on the support of the Great Huang Palace," said the man with stars on his head.</p><p></p><p>He was also one of the Five Demon Sons of Zi Yuan Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this Molo Clan is getting quite bold."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a dissatisfied voice rang out. A man with an upright posture approached, emanating a cold aura, like an ice sword.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses present all showed expressions of reverence and fear when they saw this man.</p><p></p><p>In the Black Magic Abyss, before Black Sword appeared, Ice Sword was supreme.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword was a top-tier genius, even the number one genius, with qualifications sufficient to step into the realm of Great Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>There were three such geniuses like Ice Sword in the entire Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was merely having sufficient qualifications. Actually stepping into the realm of Great Ultimate Reason was not so simple.</p><p></p><p>"When I step into the Yang Spirit realm, I must pay a visit to the Molo Clan," Ice Sword said, emanating a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that Senior Brother Ice Sword has already reached the eighth layer of the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'. You must be about to ascend to the divine throne and step into the Yang Spirit realm!" At this moment, a genius flattered.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword's gaze was profound: "Anything less than the ninth layer is not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had always regarded Black Sword as his target.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Big Brother Black Sword's 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' has already reached the tenth layer!" Just then, An Xun Lu said proudly, with an arrogant air.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses present all changed expression dramatically upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"He's already at the tenth layer?"</p><p></p><p>"Hasn't Senior Brother Black Sword been cultivating the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' for less than five thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>"That's too exaggerated!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator geniuses present all felt somewhat discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, the average time of obtaining the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' was over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation levels were mostly at the third or fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>Those who had cultivated to the fifth or sixth layer could become Demon Sons of various Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Only true geniuses like Ice Sword could reach the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>As for Black Sword, he was even more like a lofty mountain peak, difficult for others to match.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if I had Black Magic Ancestral Blood, I might have had a chance to glimpse the tenth layer by now!" Ice Sword's tone was full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>I recommend a hard-hitting, satisfying novel called "Holy Fist!"</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: As Bai Xiao descends, he raises his head and not only sees this bizarre and magnificent world, but also the career modifier he downloaded before transmigrating.</p><p></p><p>"Consume all the experience of the secondary careers [Bio-Mech Engineer], [Secret Realm Scholar], and [Special Hypnotist], converting it into a million potential points, all used to upgrade and modify the main career [Fighter]!"</p><p></p><p>"I... have obtained the golden ultimate career [God of Martial Combat]!"</p><p></p><p>In the world's largest urban agglomeration, on a rainy night.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, countless killers and fighters engage in life-and-death battles, while massive metal mechs and bio-armors self-destruct in explosions. Blood and flames mix together, everything falling into primitive violence and chaos.</p><p></p><p>At the top of a high tower, Bai Xiao stands silently in the dark rainy curtain, like a stiff and terrifying statue. His crimson eyes gaze down, with restrained bloodthirst and madness hidden in the coldness.</p><p></p><p>He leaps down, his windbreaker fluttering wildly.</p><p></p><p>The God of Martial Combat descends upon the final battlefield!</p><p></p><p>A cold voice echoes across the city skyline.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will kill everyone present! If you have the ability, come and stop me..."</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

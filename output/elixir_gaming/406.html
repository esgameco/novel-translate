        <h1>Chapter 406</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was an enormous being, but the blood-colored creature on its head was even more vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>In its confusion, it seemed unable to react for a moment, only muttering instinctively: "Big."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators' legs trembled involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly... red light overflowed throughout heaven and earth! The endless darkness dissipated, replaced by infinite blood color and purple radiance.</p><p></p><p>That vast and boundless body was covered in blood-red armor, with intricate and delicate patterns engraved upon it.</p><p></p><p>Even in its vastness, it did not lack in fine detail.</p><p></p><p>The blood crystal spikes on its shoulders were larger than heavenly pillars! Qi Yuan stood in the void, with chaos before him and endless starry sky behind.</p><p></p><p>Stars were scattered like fireflies, and the chaos was like dough. He opened his bloody maw and bit into that chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, the beings of the Cang Lan Realm could not see this scene - only the Great Tribulation witnessed it.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>All the beings in the world seemed to hear the sound of swallowing.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what had happened, only that the Blood-Robed Sword God seemed to have appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a confused yet questioning voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Tribulation transcender, did you... eat the Cang Lan Realm along with me?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Tribulation was in a daze, finding itself in a strange place.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators were shocked when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>"The Cang Lan Realm was eaten?"</p><p></p><p>"We were eaten?"</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have heard the sound of swallowing!"</p><p></p><p>"...How powerful must the Blood-Robed Sword God be to swallow the Great Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>Countless beings were puzzled, or rather, unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong's expression also changed slightly at this moment. He hurriedly used a realm-breaking talisman.</p><p></p><p>The realm-breaking talisman should have been able to take him back to the Star Departure Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, the realm-breaking talisman failed to work.</p><p></p><p>His face changed drastically: "Is what the Great Tribulation said true?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingshan also looked utterly shocked: "We were eaten?"</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable! As great venerable ones, they knew their own limits.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary Yang Spirit Dharma Body wasn't as big as the Cang Lan Realm, such a great world.</p><p></p><p>But the result... was that it was swallowed by the Blood-Robed Sword God?</p><p></p><p>What kind of concept was this! And... what did the Blood-Robed Sword God swallow this world for? What state were they in now? All the cultivators had the same bewildering questions in their minds.</p><p></p><p>But then the Great Tribulation spoke: "Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed that It was not afraid of the Blood-Robed Sword God who had swallowed It.</p><p></p><p>"This... is my Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>From the distant void came the cold yet dashing voice of the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had traversed all of Cang Lan in order to leave a mark on all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Great Tribulation, he needed to take control of the initiative.</p><p></p><p>So, he directly manifested his Dharma Body, merged with Little Jia, and swallowed the Great Tribulation along with the Cang Lan Realm into his Purple Palace in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of the Gate of Ultimate Principle, this realm was isolated.</p><p></p><p>The one from Tai Huang Palace using the mark could not annihilate all the beings in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he could close the door and beat the dog.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the one from Tai Huang Palace descended...</p><p></p><p>He would lose this battle with 90% certainty.</p><p></p><p>He was merely a great cultivator of the Purple Palace, at most a village-level tycoon. How could he compare to the one from Tai Huang Palace, a world-class tycoon in terms of power?</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The confused Great Tribulation was surprised, but not panicked.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of Great Celestial Rank, no, far stronger than Great Celestial Rank."</p><p></p><p>It looked at Qi Yuan, still confused.</p><p></p><p>"For existences like us, the size of our bodies is not important.</p><p></p><p>Why manifest the Dharma Body? It makes me somewhat alarmed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not respond.</p><p></p><p>He did not agree with the Great Tribulation's words.</p><p></p><p>In the upper realms, most beings believed that above the Great Celestial Rank was the Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>Without cultivating the Ultimate Principle, no matter how large the Dharma Body, it was nothing more than a big toy.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan felt that this was only because this big toy wasn't big enough.</p><p></p><p>If he were billions of times larger than the sun, larger than the universe, could... the Ultimate Principle even tickle him? If he wasn't big enough, when he swallowed the Cang Lan Realm, he would probably crush many continents.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, being bigger really is useful.</p><p></p><p>However, after swallowing the Cang Lan Realm and placing it within his Purple Palace, he indeed had no need to maintain this Dharma Body.</p><p></p><p>His form suddenly shrank by thousands, tens of thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his eyes truly looked at the Great Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>[Great Tribulation, the elemental body of the Great Sun's past self, created by some special mutation, separated from the Great Sun.]</p><p></p><p>Information about the Great Tribulation appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Great Tribulation before him seemed to have a body composed of formless chaos, extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>And it was the elemental body of the Great Sun's past self.</p><p></p><p>"You are the past self of the Great Sun?" Qi Yuan was surprised, with a hint of wariness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that the main body of the Great Sun... this world-class tycoon, had already discovered him, this village-level tycoon?</p><p></p><p>A flash of spiritual light appeared in the confused eyes of the Great Tribulation: "It is not me, I am not It, strength is tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Great Tribulation's words, Qi Yuan understood somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Tribulation was the past self of the Great Sun, it was different from the past selves of ordinary Yang Spirits, having been separated.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not know the reason, and the Yang Spirit had not informed him of this information.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ultimate Principle True Buddhas of the Buddha Realm did not know.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this was a secret involving the realm of Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the lines have been said, saying more would cost extra, the investors would be distressed... let's... have Qi Yuan eliminate the Great Tribulation!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's tone suddenly rose, and all the cultivators in the world finally saw that Blood-Robed Sword God, no smaller than the Great Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>He wore blood-colored armor all over his body, covered entirely in blood color, with only his eyes exposed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, surging battle intent erupted.</p><p></p><p>The ground plates of the Cang Lan Realm also trembled with Qi Yuan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Tribulation transcender, even if you excel in Cang Lan, you must die at the hands of the Great Tribulation, this is fate!"</p><p></p><p>The confused Great Tribulation's voice was vast.</p><p></p><p>It had no intelligence, only instinct, driven by instinct to fight.</p><p></p><p>An incredibly powerful strike collided at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The world shook.</p><p></p><p>The huge shockwave seemed to sweep across at this moment, about to shatter the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a distant place, Qi Qi's expression became solemn: "Yin and Yang separated, not interfering with each other."</p><p></p><p>With her voice, the Cang Lan Realm suddenly fell into the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>A special energy separated the Cang Lan Realm from the battle above at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The battle area was Yang, the Netherworld was Yin, not interfering with each other.</p><p></p><p>A powerful strike collided.</p><p></p><p>Under the blood-colored armor, Qi Yuan's expression was calm: "Is this the power of the Great Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Tribulation's combat power was much weaker than the villain boss of the Arch Star World.</p><p></p><p>A simple and brutal strike caused this chaotic body to crack.</p><p></p><p>Obviously in this clash, the Great Tribulation was at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the other cultivators all showed excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God... could he really eliminate the Great Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>"How... strong must he be!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of wisdom appeared in Great Wisdom True Lord's eyes: "This time, the Netherworld has isolated the upper realm, the Great Tribulation cannot call for help... perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong's body also trembled.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't imagine how such a powerful being as the Blood-Robed Sword God had appeared in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed the Cang Lan Realm, making the Great Tribulation lose its ability to call for help from the upper realm, and then deal with it slowly.</p><p></p><p>After all, when the three Yang Spirits of the Star Departure Realm attacked the Great Tribulation together, the Great Tribulation, which was still very weak at that time, immediately called for help.</p><p></p><p>At that time, two Yang Spirits from Tai Huang Palace descended, killing gods who blocked their way and killing Buddhas who stood in their path. Was this... the correct answer to save the world? He was excited, thinking that if the Blood-Robed Sword God succeeded this time, he would invite the Blood-Robed Sword God back to the Star Departure Realm.</p><p></p><p>Let him eat the Star Departure Realm too? Many powerful beings were shocked in their hearts. The strength of the Great Tribulation had already made them tremble, but the Blood-</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword Saint... seemed even stronger than the Great Calamity! And they seemed to still be within the Blood Robed Sword Saint's Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>The little fox girl was now hiding in a stone cave. She looked up at the sky and thought: "Since I'm in the Blood Robed Sword Saint senior's Purple Palace, does that mean I'm also in his heart?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her lovesick brain was running wild.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had previously insulted and slandered the Blood Robed Sword Saint now acted like meek quails.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Chaotic Great Calamity spoke. Its expression could only be described as chaotic, with no other discernible emotions.</p><p></p><p>"According to what living beings say, you've cut off my connection to the upper realm. Your plan was well thought out. </p><p></p><p>But you don't know that between Primordial Bodies... there is mutual exchange!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy seemed to appear on the face of the Chaotic Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a vast echoing sound resonated throughout the Cang Lan Realm and the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>It was as if three thousand gods and Buddhas were chanting in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Between Primordial Bodies... there is mutual exchange."</p><p>"Between Primordial Bodies... there is mutual exchange."</p><p></p><p>In the endless void above, an enormous behemoth struggled forth.</p><p></p><p>Its appearance was somewhat similar to the Great Calamity, though about one-third smaller in size.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Calamity from the Qian Mo Realm!" The black-robed man's deathly eyes shed tears of blood.</p><p></p><p>He recognized that this new Great Calamity that had suddenly emerged came from the Qian Mo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong's eyes also suddenly contracted: "This... this is the Great Calamity from the Star Departure Realm!"</p><p></p><p>His gums trembled as he thought of something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>According to those from the upper realm, there were three thousand worlds with Great Calamities.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand Great Calamities...</p><p></p><p>In the boundless sea of void ahead, one enormous behemoth after another crawled out.</p><p></p><p>One terrifying giant shadow after another emerged, each seemingly no less formidable than the Great Calamity of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were chaotic, rigid, ferocious, or bloody.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this space became filled with endless chaotic composite beings. They crowded together, their bodies merging into each other.</p><p></p><p>The dense mass of Great Calamity Primordial Bodies, with thousands of huge eyes, stared coldly and chaotically at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They opened their mouths, revealing densely packed, sharp, barbed teeth inside. In each mouth were thousands of forked, moist, sticky tongues, like the intertwining of countless snakes in a snake pit, their sight alone inspiring dread.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Chaotic Great Calamity's gaze towards Qi Yuan, there appeared a hint of an emotion called greed.</p><p></p><p>Countless greedy eyes stared at Qi Yuan, as if looking at a piece of supremely delicious cake.</p><p></p><p>"Between Primordial Bodies, there is mutual exchange. Your scheme has failed!"</p><p></p><p>"The strong become calamities, it is the destiny of those who undergo tribulations to inevitably become flesh within the calamity."</p><p></p><p>The three thousand Great Calamities piled together, indescribable and terrifyingly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>All living beings in the Cang Lan Realm showed expressions of despair.</p><p></p><p>Even one Great Calamity was so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Yet now three thousand... Great Calamities had come! They couldn't imagine it, feeling only that doomsday loomed overhead.</p><p></p><p>Many Yin spirits and great lords didn't even have the courage to look at the dense mass of Great Calamities. One glance would make them nauseous and lose their composure.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu bit her lip, her face pale. She looked at the blood-colored figure in front of the Great Calamities, her gaze filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>If you descend to the Underworld, I will follow!</p><p></p><p>A hint of bitterness finally showed in Great Wisdom True Lord's deep eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Cut off from the upper realm, yet still three thousand Great Calamities..."</p><p></p><p>The No Sky Elder sat in the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, his expression desolate: "What exactly does the Great Sun want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua used his spiritual power to the extreme. He looked at the sky, his gums aching: "Blood Robed Sword Saint senior, hang in there a bit longer. This junior will immediately go to the Phoenix Heaven Domain and punch that coward with the same name as you in the nose!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Before facing the Great Calamities, he had tested his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>The result he got was: difficult.</p><p></p><p>To avoid accidents, he had swallowed the Cang Lan Realm along with the Great Calamity into his Purple Palace, cutting off the Great Calamity's chance to seek help from the Supreme Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Great Calamity had... called over all the other Great Calamities.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over. The three thousand Great Calamities were all Primordial Bodies of the Great Sun's past self.</p><p></p><p>If the Primordial Bodies of the Great Sun's past self were this strong, the strength of the main body... was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>However, this wasn't what Qi Yuan should be considering now. He looked at the Great Calamities, his expression calm: "Are there any other Primordial Bodies? Come all together?"</p><p></p><p>"We are not the Great Sun, good things... we eat together."</p><p></p><p>The three thousand Chaotic Great Calamities, terrifying behemoths, spoke simultaneously, their voices uniform as if coming from one person.</p><p></p><p>They had given their answer.</p><p></p><p>All the Great Calamities had gathered in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you must be sworn brothers who vowed to die on the same day!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, if the Cang Lan Realm were a game, with players as cultivators, it would be impossible to pass without cheating!</p><p></p><p>After isolating the Supreme Radiance Palace and the upper realm, this Great Calamity could still call for reinforcements!</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored figure stood before the three thousand Great Calamities, facing the terrifying three thousand beings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted: "You think you're the only one who can call for help?"</p><p></p><p>"Calling for help... who can't do that!"</p><p></p><p>The roaring voice also became sacred and solemn at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Radiant and glorious, infant emerging from the divine treasury, heed my command!"</p><p></p><p>"Gods and Buddhas descend to the world!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Cang Lan Realm, all living beings looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>But they saw nothing, only the terrifying Great Calamities.</p><p></p><p>However, in their ears, the voices of gods and demons were chanting and echoing!</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace in the Vast Heaven receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Emperor of the Southern Ultimate Heaven receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Three Officials receive the order!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Directions Heavenly Honored Ones receive the order!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Twenty-Eight Constellations receive the order!"</p><p></p><p>"The Thunder Department True Gods, heed my command, fight for the Heavenly Honored One!" "The Dipper Department True Gods, heed my command, fight for the Heavenly Honored One!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The multitude of the Tai Sui Department, respectfully obey the Heavenly Honored One's order, fight!"</p><p></p><p>The voices were endless, like ten thousand gods and demons roaring in unison.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the horizon, one saw...</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of gods and demons as soldiers, all descending to the world, to fight for their lord! At this moment, Qi Yuan's four thousand divine infants all emerged, riding clouds and mist, hiding in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Each god and Buddha was majestic, with divine light shining, incomparably dignified, inspiring awe and reverence in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>All the deities lined up behind Qi Yuan, like soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Four thousand against three thousand, a battle rarely seen or even unrecorded in the upper realm, was happening within Qi Yuan's Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>"You think you're the only one who can call for help?"</p><p></p><p>"You think you're the only Great Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red terrifying figure charged into the Great Calamity Primordial Bodies at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the three thousand Chaotic Great Calamity Primordial Bodies, besides greed, there finally appeared a hint of an emotion called bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Countless divine lights and innumerable divine powers continuously engulfed everything.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, no living being's figure could be seen. As far as the eye could see, there were various divine realms, divine lights, and divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Any slight leak would be enough to pierce through the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, however, it was like a huge hodgepodge, a chaotic battle in one pot.</p><p></p><p>Powerful divine powers were everywhere, endless destructive auras were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Even a mythical powerhouse would not survive for even a ten-thousandth of a breath if they stepped into it.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood rain fell, landing on the line separating Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter continued, the battle went on, blood and fire were burning.</p><p></p><p>All living beings looked up at the sky, watching this cruel and desperate battle, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>In Wang Lingtong's eyes, there was also bewilderment and astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected the Great Calamity to be so strong, nor had he expected... the Blood Robed Sword Saint to be even stronger than the Great Calamity!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

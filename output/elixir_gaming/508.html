        <h1>Chapter 508</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The forked snake tongue, stained with bloody stench, sent shivers down their souls.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Lei and Tu Shu were terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, am I going to die here today?" Tu Shu spat out some old phlegm.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Peak Grandmaster Armored Soldier was overwhelming, and even their combined forces were no match for it.</p><p></p><p>Just now, how they had tormented the Black Crow, the Winged Snake would do the same to them.</p><p></p><p>"Winged Snake, before I die, I want to know why you came here?" Tu Shu shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>He was very curious about the Winged Snake's arrival. A powerhouse of that level, infiltrating Ninguo, carried great risks, perhaps even facing attacks from Grandmaster Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>The item the Black Crow had handed to the Winged Snake also piqued Tu Shu's curiosity, as he felt there might be a conspiracy targeting Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>"Are you stalling for time?" the Winged Snake was not interested in idle chatter, "In the Luosha Kingdom of the Middle Continent, there is an ancient saying - the villain dies from talking too much."</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder also knew that its actions were considered villainous in the eyes of the sanctimonious.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, its body suddenly plunged, the sound of the wind cutting through the air.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Lei's steel ball shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she was nearly two realms lower than the Winged Snake Elder.</p><p></p><p>Clang! </p><p></p><p>The iron ball rang out, violently swinging back, almost carrying Zhan Lei flying with it.</p><p></p><p>The outcome was decided in a single exchange.</p><p></p><p>The two were not on the same level at all!</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder, if ranked in Ninguo, would be among the top thirty on the Grandmaster list, worthy of the title of a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Lei coughed up blood, her face ashen.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tu Shu was anxious, but he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tu, if you hadn't plotted against me, perhaps only you would have died today, but now... there are two more." the Black Crow Elder said ominously.</p><p></p><p>The young master Tu was now very anxious, filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>At the Peak Grandmaster level, the Tus only had one such powerhouse, and he had been in seclusion for years, unaware of the situation here.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Tu gritted his teeth, feeling the path ahead was bleak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, perhaps only the one from the Shen family could save him.</p><p></p><p>But the one from the Shen family, like their family patriarch, had been in seclusion, where would he appear from?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something, throwing caution to the wind, a sword of light appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The light gathered, crystalline and sparkling with a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>"An interesting little toy." the Black Crow Elder glanced at it, giving his evaluation, then sneered, "Unexpectedly, a mere Profound Armored Soldier Cultivator dares to wield a sword in resistance?"</p><p></p><p>Tu was now in a desperate state, recalling Qi Yuan's words.</p><p>His heart was anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please don't deceive me, don't deceive me!"</p><p>"I want to walk tall in Ninguo!"</p><p>"Don't waste the ten thousand taels of silver!"</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>But ten thousand taels of silver could not possibly hire a Peak Grandmaster Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he still gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Summon! The Deity!"</p><p></p><p>The special ability activated by spending ten thousand taels of silver, if it was truly real! This scene made the Winged Snake unable to help but turn his gaze sideways: "The ant... has unleashed its ultimate move?"</p><p></p><p>The words were full of mockery.</p><p></p><p>The Black Crow Elder also laughed continuously.</p><p></p><p>Only Tu Shu had an expression of admiration: "As expected of our Tu family's son, keep your spirit up, don't lose face, use the sword to hack it, let them see that the bones of the Tu family men are not soft!"</p><p></p><p>Tu Shu's words almost made the young master Tu draw his sword and charge, before being slapped to death by a snake tail.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the young master Tu looked at the sword of light, filled with expectation.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the light remained calm, without any special occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that person had deceived him?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, ten thousand taels of silver, to summon the avatar of a deity, and three times at that, such a thing... no fool would believe it.</p><p></p><p>He was utterly despairing.</p><p></p><p>But just then, suddenly, the heavens above parted, and a stream of light descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In front of the young master Tu, a ball of radiance appeared, shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>A sense of majesty, sacredness, and holiness permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>The light orb was not large, just about the size of a person.</p><p></p><p>Completely white, the specific form could not be discerned, but the sacred aura emanated from within.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder, the Black Crow Elder, and the others could not help but have their gazes drawn to that ball of light.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" the Winged Snake was somewhat wary.</p><p></p><p>"This light descending from the heavens..." the Black Crow hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a majestic voice suddenly resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Where there is no light, the Deity shall descend!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The light shattered in an instant! A tall figure emerged, bathed in light, stepping firmly and striding powerfully.</p><p></p><p>He was entirely forged of light, wearing armor of light, shimmering and resplendent, like a divine being descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Dragon scales and phoenix feathers intertwined, totems covering his body.</p><p></p><p>The radiance was at times fierce, at times gentle, a combination of tyranny and tenderness throughout.</p><p></p><p>"It's true, it's true!" the young master Tu murmured, his gaze burning with fervor.</p><p></p><p>"What is this exactly?" the Black Crow was extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>"Pretentious nonsense!" the Winged Snake snorted coldly, for he could not see through the suddenly appearing tall figure.</p><p></p><p>Tu Shu and Zhan Lei looked at the young master Tu, utterly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The young master Tu stood up and shouted towards the figure of light: "Deity, descend and slay these two evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>As his voice fell, the gaze of the light figure fell upon the Winged Snake and the Black Crow.</p><p></p><p>In that gaze, the Winged Snake saw many things - sacredness, absolute indifference, and the order of justice.</p><p></p><p>"What... are you exactly?" the Winged Snake felt a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Moso Kingdom was rather isolated, and even Heavenly Armored Soldiers were extremely rare, this scene was beyond his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>However, considering the young master Tu's words, he had a terrible guess.</p><p></p><p>"Deity, are you the incarnation of a god?" thinking of this, the Winged Snake's back shivered.</p><p></p><p>Gods existed only in legends.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that in the Middle Continent Luosha Kingdom, above the Heavenly Armored Soldiers, there was an existence known as the Deity!</p><p></p><p>But the Deity was far removed from them.</p><p></p><p>How could this be the incarnation of a god? Yet at this moment, it had already developed a desire to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The item was important.</p><p></p><p>What if this was truly the incarnation of a god? It glanced at the Black Crow, and their eyes met.</p><p></p><p>The two old monsters had the same thought.</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, they frantically headed towards the Kunling Ford.</p><p></p><p>The Kunling Ford was difficult to enter, even Peak Grandmaster Armored Soldiers could not enter unharmed.</p><p></p><p>But this did not apply to those with the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>Their idea was simple, first enter the Kunling Ford to hide, and then escape.</p><p></p><p>The divine light figure stood quietly, silent.</p><p></p><p>It did not pursue, merely watching as the two fled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the young master Tu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be a substandard product, summoning a mere illusion... scaring them away?"</p><p></p><p>He momentarily thought of this.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was fake, being able to scare away the Black Crow Elder and the Winged Snake Elder was still a great profit.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tu Shu came over, a look of amazement on his face: "This thing..."</p><p></p><p>However, just then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p></p><p>"As I, the Deity, descend!"</p><p></p><p>The light figure's voice rang out with majesty.</p><p></p><p>As if countless believers were calling out.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the light incarnation began to grow taller.</p><p></p><p>Three meters, six meters, twenty feet, thirty feet... until it towered at a staggering one hundred feet!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His figure, wielding the peerlessly holy light sword.</p><p></p><p>Tall, majestic, and sacred.</p><p></p><p>This sword represents justice, represents order, represents rules.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast and solemn voice also resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Wield the light, dispel the darkness!"</p><p></p><p>"If there is injustice, summon me, the divine!"</p><p></p><p>This voice did not come from an illusion, but seemed to emanate from the light sword itself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the terrifying 30-meter light shadow moved, the one wielding the light sword slashed downwards! No fancy techniques, just a powerful strike! Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the Kunling Ford, a massive beam of light burst forth.</p><p></p><p>The earth shook, as if dragons and snakes were rising from the ground! The earth emanated a murderous intent, the heavens and earth were overturned; the divine emanated a murderous intent, all things withered!</p><p></p><p>In the Kunling Ford, the mist evaporated, the water plants were severed, as if the miasma and poisonous gas had been shattered.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword energy swept through the Kunling Ford, howling through the muddy marshes.</p><p></p><p>Expressions of ferocious fear appeared on the faces of the Winged Snake and Black Crow Elders.</p><p></p><p>The intense sword beam instantly consumed them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah...no!"</p><p></p><p>Their agonizing cries rang out, followed by sizzling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The Earth-rank Armored Soldiers were invulnerable, ordinary blades could not harm them.</p><p></p><p>But under this powerful strike, their invulnerable bodies were as fragile as paper, sliced apart.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying heat, reaching unimaginable temperatures, even melted and vaporized them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The Black Crow Elder's roar was abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Winged Snake Elder persisted a bit longer, the process of his gasification even allowing one to see the scales melting.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the two Earth-rank Armored Soldiers perished.</p><p></p><p>And in the Kunling Ford, the numerous demonic spirits they had nurtured, numbering in the hundreds, were also awakened by this sword.</p><p></p><p>Alas, as soon as they awoke, they faced this tyrannical, merciless, and scorching sword.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even have time to let out a cry before they were ruthlessly slaughtered, ending their miserable lives.</p><p></p><p>That divine incarnation also seemed to have exhausted all its energy from this single strike, dissipating into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This...this sword strike..." Tu Sanzi was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps even the legendary Heaven-rank Armored Soldiers would not be much against this," Zhan Lei said contemplatively, her imposing figure even more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>"A single strike slaying two Earth-rank Armored Soldiers and hundreds of demonic spirits, truly...too powerful!" </p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Tu Shu looked at Tu Sanzi, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This...the divine artifact, I bought it for a thousand taels of silver from the ghost market," Tu Sanzi swallowed, not hiding anything. "The stall owner said that if I spent ten thousand taels, I could activate a special ability called 'Summon the Divine', which could only be used three times to summon a divine incarnation.</p><p></p><p>This time...I tried it, and unexpectedly, it actually worked!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand taels?" Tu Shu looked at Tu Sanzi skeptically, "If that were me, I would have killed that stall owner with a single sword strike!"</p><p></p><p>Though he said that, his eyes were filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand taels, to summon such a terrifying existence...too much of a bargain." Tu Shu was amazed, "Is that stall owner still in the ghost market? Does he have any other divine artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>"There are two more light swords, but at the time...I didn't have the money, so I didn't buy them," Tu Sanzi said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Wasteful fool!" Tu Shu couldn't help but curse, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>Such terrifying artifacts, even if they cost ten thousand, a hundred thousand taels, he must obtain them.</p><p></p><p>An Earth-rank peak Armored Soldier, shattered by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The power of this sword strike, perhaps even reached the level of the legendary Heaven-rank Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>"Ah...my light sword seems to be damaged, I can't use it for now," Tu Sanzi said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Summoning such a terrifying incarnation requires immense energy, it may need to be nurtured for a period of time before it can be used a second time!" Zhan Lei offered her analysis.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tu Sanzi breathed a sigh of relief: "I wonder how long it will need to be nurtured."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it needs to be nurtured for a hundred years, it's worth it. Even if you die, it can be a treasure to your clan!" Tu Shu murmured, "Just who is that stall owner, what kind of divine being is he?"</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Kunling Ford.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, although this sword strike killed the Winged Snake and Black Crow, we still cannot enter the Kunling Ford, I don't know what the Black Crow gave the Winged Snake..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back first, report this matter, and then...go to the ghost market!" Tu Shu was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't wait to go to the ghost market and buy the remaining two light swords.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The three figures disappeared without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's complexion was ashen.</p><p></p><p>"I've grown stronger, but also more fragile."</p><p></p><p>His face was as pale as paper.</p><p></p><p>His aura was unstable, as if a gust of wind could blow him over.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when Tu Sanzi used the Summon the Divine ability, </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had activated his "Summon the Divine" skill.</p><p></p><p>The divine incarnation descended and unleashed a seemingly impressive sword strike.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, this sword strike had placed an enormous burden on him.</p><p></p><p>Now, his entire spiritual energy was depleted, his vitality and spirit drained.</p><p></p><p>That one sword strike had slain two Earth-rank Armored Soldiers and hundreds of demonic spirits, also bringing Qi Yuan a massive amount of experience.</p><p></p><p>He had now abruptly advanced around 40 levels, reaching level 96.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he had directly crossed over from Yellow-rank to Earth-rank Armored Soldier, a truly astonishing feat.</p><p></p><p>However, this sword strike had also completely exhausted him.</p><p></p><p>In the coming period, he would be unable to display the full power of an Earth-rank Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, effort is nothing compared to natural talent."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had worked so hard, painstakingly leveling up to the 90s, investing so much of his heart and blood.</p><p></p><p>Yet, faced with the 30% Summoning Degree awakened "Summon the Divine", a single sword strike could slay him.</p><p></p><p>And "Summon the Divine", as a divine sword artifact, created by Sheng Nü, was already a divine weapon from birth.</p><p></p><p>"Wield the light, dispel the darkness. </p><p>If there is injustice, summon me, the divine!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the hope Sheng Nü had when she created Summon the Divine?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>To play the role of Summon the Divine, one needed to understand its background setting.</p><p></p><p>The incantation just now was not uttered by Qi Yuan, but from the inner voice of Summon the Divine.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's eyes, this was the very purpose of Summon the Divine's existence.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, how can cultivation compare to just needing to play a role to raise my Summoning Degree a bit, I can just summon myself and instantly slay a Heaven-rank Armored Soldier with a single sword strike?"</p><p></p><p>"Playing a role only requires playing, but cultivation has more to consider, you even have to kill demonic spirits."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm an adult, I want it all!"</p><p></p><p>"Old man, quickly carry me to the Kunling Ford, I want to go in and loot the corpses!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said to the nearby Chen Kang Bao.</p><p></p><p>Now he was very weak, even walking was difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Young master...this old servant's body..." Chen Kang Bao looked troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I've blessed you!" Qi Yuan lied.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Kang Bao's face lit up with joy: "Young master, I'm full of vigor!"</p><p></p><p>He then picked up Qi Yuan and ran towards the Kunling Ford, his legs moving with the speed of the wind, no longer appearing like a seventy or eighty-year-old.</p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh, "Unexpectedly, the first mount I have in this game world is an old man, how disappointing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit let down.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why, but he always wanted to ride that frost maiden.</p><p></p><p>That desire seemed innate, yet also newly born.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...that I'm an LSP?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>He admitted he was lecherous, but he wouldn't call himself an LSP, he was still young!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

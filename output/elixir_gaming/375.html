        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form stretched across the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the land of origins, Black Deer Martial Lord and others surveyed the Demon Court, their eyes revealing astonished expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons?"</p><p></p><p>"The homeland of the Ancestral Demon Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"We've actually arrived at the homeland of East Lord's consort!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst a burst of discussion,</p><p></p><p>Above the Demon Court, a spatial ripple emerged. </p><p></p><p>Excitement showed in the Demon King's eyes.</p><p></p><p>For this was the ripple of the Ancestor descending to the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>The other Purple Mansion cultivators of the Demon Court all had reverent looks, but were actually still uncertain inside.</p><p></p><p>Because they had no idea of the Ancestor's realm, nor how strong that powerful enemy was.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it was a realm beyond their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The ripples grew stronger. Before the person arrived, their voice came first.</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable One's body is rather large. You all exert yourselves and let me stick a toe in."</p><p></p><p>This voice came from the rippling space.</p><p></p><p>This Ancestor from the upper realm clearly wanted to show off.</p><p></p><p>He's rather large? Is he as large as me?</p><p></p><p>The Demon King and many Purple Mansion cultivators glanced at the sky, seeing that enormous being show no reaction. They all poured their demonic power into that space.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that space was finally forced open into an enormous gap.</p><p></p><p>A massive being the size of a city squeezed out, blotting out the sky and covering the many demons below the Demon Court, blocking their view.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, the gap is too small. Only one toe came out!"</p><p></p><p>The voice carried a hint of pride and boasting.</p><p></p><p>In Earth terms, this would be called humble-bragging.</p><p></p><p>He was a Great Venerable who could cross the heavens in four steps.</p><p></p><p>One punch could easily destroy a country.</p><p></p><p>How could there be any opponents in the lower realm?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the nearby Demon King was startled. </p><p></p><p>Normally, seeing such a large toe, he would indeed have to kowtow and grovel.</p><p></p><p>After all, a toe the size of a city was enough to frighten people.</p><p></p><p>But compared to that boundless being in the sky, it was still far too small.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King couldn't help but look at the Demon Queen.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Queen also understood the Demon King's meaning and transmitted: "Perhaps the Ancestor is small but mighty."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, using "small but mighty" here would be incorrect. </p><p></p><p>But compared to the terrifying giant in the sky, this was already a compliment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope so," the Demon King thought uneasily.</p><p></p><p>Then he and the other Purple Mansion cultivators exerted themselves to expand the rift.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second.</p><p></p><p>The giant in the sky grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>It was as big as half the Demon Court.</p><p></p><p>Blotting out the sky, truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Such a giant could destroy a city with a sneeze.</p><p></p><p>A huge eyeball was like a lantern.</p><p></p><p>"The light in the Realm of Ten Thousand Demons is actually red. Interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor from the upper realm finally squeezed out completely.</p><p></p><p>His body was very large - this was already the largest form he could maintain.</p><p></p><p>His gaze couldn't help but fall on the ten-thousand-zhang long giant snake in the Demon Court, his eyes carrying a hint of disdain.</p><p></p><p>This Demon King of the Demon Court really had no experience.</p><p></p><p>A ten-thousand-zhang long snake? You call that rather large? Nothing special.</p><p></p><p>It's normal for people in the lower realm to lack experience.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the one who killed my disciple?" The old man spoke, his voice like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>The entire Demon Court seemed to be hit by a gale. Many low-level demons couldn't stand steady and were blown away. Some were even directly killed by the shock, extremely miserable.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King was also startled, because just from this Ancestor's gaze, he felt his soul was about to be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I am the Demon King of the Demon Court, not the great enemy. I was the one who just notified you," the Demon King hurriedly explained anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm was stunned, somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then where is the enemy?"</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around, not seeing any rather large beings.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Could it be they were scared off by This Venerable One?"</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm was smug.</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>He was a prominent figure even in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable, some could even see the legendary Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>If favored by a Yang Spirit and granted the qualification to reflect all heavens, that would be incredible.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the lower realm and having enemies fear him was also normal.</p><p></p><p>"Which way did he flee?" the old man from the upper realm couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Demon King glanced at the Demon Queen again.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that small didn't necessarily mean mighty, and could also be unreliable.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't flee. He's... in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Fled to the sky?" The old man from the upper realm only heard half the sentence. His enormous body looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"...Your sky is quite strange, all red. This old one suddenly remembered there's a bun I haven't eaten. I'll come back after eating the bun."</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm finished speaking and made to leave in a practiced manner.</p><p></p><p>However, his enormous body suddenly plunged, but couldn't enter the spatial rift no matter how he tried.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely anxious, his expression finally losing composure, almost crying.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded by his ear: "Are you the mastermind who plotted against me?"</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm's body stiffened, not daring to move at all: "This little old one didn't, absolutely didn't, Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>In the upper realm, Yang Spirits were respectfully called Heavenly Venerables!</p><p></p><p>He never imagined he would encounter a Yang Spirit in this backwater place. What concept was this? It's like going fishing in the pond by your house and suddenly finding an aircraft carrier parked in the pond.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...</p><p></p><p>The probability is very small, right? Well... it could barely happen once, after all there are always illogical things that occur in this world.</p><p></p><p>How... did it happen again in the same place?</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it you who sent Thousand Eyes to Brilliant Star, telling him to cancel the martial arts tournament and stop me from playing games?" The voice was vast, huge eyeballs staring at the old man from the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm trembled all over, sweat rolling down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Court, it also started raining foul-smelling water.</p><p></p><p>"This little one absolutely wouldn't dare plot against the Heavenly Venerable!" How many years had it been since he last sweated?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>The other party wasn't lying.</p><p></p><p>Because his nose didn't grow longer.</p><p></p><p>"Do all the old men in your upper realm not bathe? You stink." Qi Yuan said with disgust.</p><p></p><p>It seems the civilization of the upper realm wasn't much either.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the lower realm, it was just the pot calling the kettle black.</p><p></p><p>When he went to the upper realm, he would definitely rectify the customs there.</p><p></p><p>Everyone be civilized! Old men and women bathe once a day!</p><p></p><p>He could open a bathhouse then, and definitely make a fortune.</p><p></p><p>After all, old men and women were all his potential ideal lovers.</p><p></p><p>Ideal lovers not bathing made Qi Yuan feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"I..." The old man from the upper realm was speechless, not daring to argue.</p><p></p><p>At their level of cultivation, who still bathed? Water was dirtier than they were.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're not the mastermind, could it be someone else?" Qi Yuan was surprised, looking at the old man from the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King was also extremely frightened.</p><p></p><p>Judging by this, small really wasn't mighty!</p><p></p><p>"This little old one truly doesn't know, and doesn't know anything about a martial arts tournament!" The old man from the upper realm cried injustice.</p><p></p><p>In his heart he cursed the Demon King to death.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I misunderstood?" The terrifying giant pondered.</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Even the legendary Heavenly Venerable of the holy land he belonged to didn't have such a large Dharma body, right?</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster was this!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was also in a dilemma. He somewhat suspected he had developed paranoid delusions?</p><p></p><p>Impossible</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright.</p><p></p><p>It's always good to be cautious. </p><p></p><p>Better to kill by mistake than let someone escape.</p><p></p><p>However..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know of the Ancestor Demon Lord?" Qi Yuan asked, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to understand the game background of this world.</p><p></p><p>According to Black Deer Martial Lord, the East Lord's dao partner was the Ancestor Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins, that ancient demon of the Purple Palace said that after the Ancestor Demon disappeared, the demons from the upper realm occupied the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man from the upper realm trembled and said: "This old one has heard of the Ancestor Demon Lord. She was... a Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>He felt very bitter. </p><p></p><p>It was bad enough that one Heavenly Venerable had appeared here, but now another one?</p><p></p><p>"A Yang Spirit?" Qi Yuan wasn't surprised. He asked again, "Who was her dao partner?"</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm was slightly stunned, then said: "I've never heard that the Ancestor Demon Lord had a dao partner."</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, Black Deer Martial Lord and the others were surprised to hear this.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this demon is talking nonsense. The Ancestor Demon Lord's dao partner was the East Lord."</p><p></p><p>"It must be due to its limited knowledge!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the old man from the upper realm and continued asking: "Have you heard of the East Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of it," the old man quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so." Qi Yuan was surprised. "Do you know the origins of the Ancestor Demon Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"This..." The old man from the upper realm quickly racked his brains.</p><p></p><p>Facing a Heavenly Venerable, he didn't dare conceal anything.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, there was no point in concealing anything.</p><p></p><p>A Heavenly Venerable could search his soul and get all the answers.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Ancestor Demon Lord was not a being from this world.</p><p></p><p>She used her powerful divine abilities to cut off connections between heaven and earth, unwilling to ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>Later, she disappeared, and only then did this realm fall into our hands," the old man said.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, it was impossible for a Yang Spirit to appear in the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of an Ancestor Demon Lord from another world was already terrifying enough.</p><p></p><p>But now, another new one had appeared here.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be frightened?</p><p></p><p>"This old one is named Qian Lai, an elder from the 37th realm of Wuliang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Our Wuliang Mountain has a Heavenly Venerable, seated in the Third Heaven."</p><p></p><p>The old man from the upper realm mentioned his background, hoping to intimidate Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This way, perhaps Qi Yuan wouldn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, could it be that he's the mastermind behind all this?</p><p></p><p>I'll give you a chance. Call him down here," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face suddenly darkened, his expression strained: "This old one... doesn't have the qualifications to see the Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Wuliang Mountain had seven hundred realms, and he was merely an elder from one of them.</p><p></p><p>How could he have the qualifications to see the legendary Heavenly Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"Boring, boring."</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood-colored light swept across the world.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying giant eye in the sky closed.</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Court, all the demons froze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>When the giant eye opened again, all the demons in the Demon Court, including that unwashed old man from the upper realm, perished.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red figure also appeared above the Demon Court, extremely handsome.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red figure was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He came here to see if there were any traces left by the Ancestor Demon Lord in this realm.</p><p></p><p>However... after searching around, he didn't find any useful information.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the end, Qi Yuan didn't go to Canxing to attend the feast.</p><p></p><p>However, he secretly took a portion of pork trotter rice before leaving.</p><p></p><p>After all, when he returned to Gongxing, he could eat the pork trotter rice while bored in the sky.</p><p></p><p>By the time he finished the pork trotter rice, Qi Yuan's figure had returned to his home.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu's fur stood on end as she let out a miserable cry.</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero One stood quietly, like an elegant female housekeeper: "Welcome back, Master."</p><p></p><p>The woman in the tight suit tensed up, her heart racing as she looked at the excessively handsome man before her.</p><p></p><p>Even now, she couldn't accept that her brother... was actually that enormous being in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back. Did I keep you waiting too long?" Qi Yuan looked at the woman in the tight suit, his voice gentle.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was his creditor.</p><p></p><p>"No, not at all!" the woman in the tight suit quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>"I know you've come a long way to find me, wanting me to repay the money.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, I'm a bit tight on cash right now. Those few tens of thousands I owe you, can I pay them back a bit later?" Qi Yuan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>He still wanted to save money to buy land and build the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Repaying the debt was out of the question for now.</p><p></p><p>"No! No need to repay!" the woman in the tight suit hurriedly said. Perhaps due to nervousness, she was even a bit out of breath as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>She even began to doubt whether this overly gentle man speaking so cautiously before her was really the being who had swallowed stars whole.</p><p></p><p>"There are still more good people in the world!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh. "Actually, I'm a good person too. When I went to Canxing to ask them not to cancel the martial arts tournament, it was partly for selfish reasons.</p><p></p><p>But... more importantly, I didn't want traditional culture to end with our generation, and I didn't want the audience of the martial arts tournament to be without such a good show in the future.</p><p></p><p>By doing this, I'm also contributing to Qinyuan Country's GDP!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Qi Yuan felt a bit guilty.</p><p></p><p>After all, contributing to GDP was a bit of a stretch.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had heard stories like this before:</p><p></p><p>Little A takes out 100 yuan and says to Little B: "If you eat the dog poop in front of you, I'll give you this 100 yuan."</p><p></p><p>Little B is tempted, eats the dog poop, and happily earns 100 yuan, but then feels cheated. He takes out 100 yuan and asks Little A to eat dog poop.</p><p></p><p>Little A loses 100 yuan, feels upset, so he eats the dog poop to earn back his 100 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Neither of them earned any money, they each ate two piles of dog poop, but they promoted the country's GDP development.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the woman in the tight suit could only respond with "Mm-hmm," not daring to say much more.</p><p></p><p>As for persuading Qi Yuan to leave and hide in Tianyuan Sect?</p><p></p><p>She wouldn't dare mention that again.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I need to go to the Origin Land now. Bye-bye, see you next time."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He came in a hurry and left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>He was still waiting to see the East Lord's Wall and find out what the legendary Spirit Realm Martial Lord really was.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Scroll of Mountains and Seas.</p><p></p><p>The moon shared its light, and the bright river reflected its image.</p><p></p><p>On the clear lake surface, a small boat was like a brushstroke in a landscape painting.</p><p></p><p>A woman stood at the bow of the boat, her eyes filled with endless hesitation.</p><p></p><p>She looked ahead and slowly said: "How much longer until we see the truth?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu looked at the woman and said softly: "It could be ten years, or it could be a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Within the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, countless scrolls began to intersect and connect.</p><p></p><p>Countless killings occurred.</p><p></p><p>When Wang Yuanyu saw Lüzhu, an endless killing intent surged in her heart.</p><p></p><p>There was an urge to kill the other party.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, she suppressed her instincts and cooperated with Lüzhu.</p><p></p><p>Because she knew that after seeing the truth, they would face a truly great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"I hope time passes quickly," Lüzhu said, her beautiful eyes flashing with joy and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid that when the worlds converge, you'll perish and your dao will be extinguished?" Wang Yuanyu said, "In this world, all falsehoods may be destroyed, leaving only one truth."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid, but I want to see Master and personally say thank you to him," Lüzhu said wistfully.</p><p></p><p>The princess from back then had finally grown up.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Master disappeared, she didn't get the chance to thank him.</p><p></p><p>This "thank you" had always remained in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"I also want Master to know that Lüzhu hasn't let him down!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

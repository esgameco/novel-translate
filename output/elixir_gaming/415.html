        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In front of the two of them, many arrays for concealing auras were placed.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the fat sheep?" Ji Buping asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>"In the array below," Qi Yuan whispered, letting out a small breath.</p><p></p><p>The clouds and mist in front dispersed, revealing a figure wearing a gray robe.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the barrier of the array, they couldn't see clearly.</p><p></p><p>The gray-robed figure looked ordinary, trapped within an ancient array. Streams of immortal energy flowed as he seemed to be trying to break the array.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when Ji Buping saw that gray-robed figure, his heart suddenly skipped a beat, as if sensing great danger.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist... why do I feel like he... seems rather extraordinary?" </p><p></p><p>Ji Buping spoke, his voice tinged with hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't he look very ordinary? If there's anything unusual, it's just that he's a bit old," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping looked again: "I don't know why, but seeing him makes me feel uneasy. He's not very powerful, is he?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, with the array blocking their view, he couldn't see clearly.</p><p></p><p>"He's just average. Look at the ancient array below, it's broken down and in disrepair. If it were a young and strong person, they'd probably break through in a few moves. </p><p></p><p>As for him, he's old, pushing for a while then resting for a bit. You can tell he's not as good as the two of us," Qi Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping was half-convinced, when suddenly his face filled with shock: "He tore through space with one punch!"</p><p></p><p>"The space inside that old array is all aged and rusty. You could tear it apart too if you went in!"</p><p></p><p>"But he... a Yangsheng Tianzun?!" Ji Buping's heart pounded.</p><p></p><p>The aura that Mochi Tianzun momentarily leaked was clearly that of a Yangsheng!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had just gotten a clear look at the old man's face in the gray robe - it was none other than the legendary Mochi Tianzun!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he's a Yangsheng, but it's no big deal. He's old and not very agile. </p><p></p><p>If you slide tackle him and stab his belly, I'd say you have a 30% chance," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping felt both amused and utterly bewildered. </p><p></p><p>Question marks were practically bursting from his head.</p><p></p><p>What was wrong with this world? His mind couldn't process it.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even dare to move.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, go slide tackle him and give him a scare!" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Buping didn't dare budge an inch.</p><p></p><p>He thought Qi Yuan must be crazy.</p><p></p><p>After all, daring to plot against a Yangsheng of the Moluo clan in their core territory - that was definitely insane.</p><p></p><p>Besides, anyone who dared scheme against a Yangsheng must be a Yangsheng themselves at minimum, right?</p><p></p><p>A Yangsheng bigshot... calling him over? Were they playing house?</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to kill him, wouldn't it just take a glance? His face twisted into an expression worse than crying: "Sen...senior..."</p><p></p><p>He had already realized something was very wrong.</p><p></p><p>"What, you want to desert at the last minute? Don't even think about it! We'll ambush him together later, I already have a plan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said loudly, seeming quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>This guy was just like Qin Wuyang.</p><p></p><p>Without another word, he grabbed Ji Buping's collar: "I have such high hopes for you, don't let me down!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping's mind was in chaos, feeling that the blood-robed man before him was truly insane.</p><p></p><p>A real madman! No matter what, daring to make a move against a Yangsheng of the Moluo clan - they were both dead men today!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the ancient array.</p><p></p><p>Mochi Tianzun took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Mere ancient arrays are not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>This time he had expended quite a bit of energy.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the purple qi, it was nothing.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the purple qi in the distance and took another deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that I would be so fortunate as to encounter purple qi. I just wonder whose cave dwelling this used to be."</p><p></p><p>He scanned around but found nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the master of this ancient array had long since left or perished, leaving behind only a wisp of purple qi.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this wisp of purple qi, he was excited, feeling that destiny was on his side.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, he remained cautious, scanning the surroundings to avoid any other killing arrays.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, the purple qi in heaven and earth began to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>Mochi Tianzun's expression remained unchanged: "Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>Though the purple qi had no consciousness, it would instinctively try to escape.</p><p></p><p>So he quickly gave chase.</p><p></p><p>After all, with his Yangsheng strength, this purple qi had no hope of escaping his grasp.</p><p></p><p>But after just a few breaths of time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression froze, his mind violently shaken.</p><p></p><p>Before him appeared an ancient, profound door radiating the light of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that door, even Mochi Tianzun, as a Yangsheng, couldn't help but tremble, his expression becoming frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"The... the Door of Ultimate Principles!"</p><p></p><p>His breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>This door was none other than the number one miraculous treasure of the immortal realm - the Door of Ultimate Principles! Legend had it that all the ultimate principles comprehended by the Ultimate Principle realm experts of the Six Heavens were contained within! It was also said that whoever obtained the Door of Ultimate Principles and entered to contemplate the ultimate principles within...</p><p></p><p>As long as they had enough time, they would certainly attain the Great Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>It was even said that one could comprehend the ultimate principles of other Yangsheng in the Great Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he, Mochi Tianzun... would become number one in the immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, destiny is on my side!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all of Mochi Tianzun's rationality vanished, replaced by utter frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ultimate Principles before him was his sole target.</p><p></p><p>Although even Great Ultimate Principle experts had never captured the Door of Ultimate Principles, what if... what if he succeeded?</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, the Door of Ultimate Principles opened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mochi Tianzun was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because this was something he had never heard of, not even in rumors.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Great Ultimate Principle realm expert attacked the Door of Ultimate Principles, they could not open it.</p><p></p><p>Let alone enter the Door of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>Forget about controlling the Door of Ultimate Principles, just entering it... would be the greatest opportunity in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Before he could think further, that wisp of purple qi suddenly contracted and flew into the Door of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>The space around the Door of Ultimate Principles also rippled, as if about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mochi Tianzun knew he could hesitate no longer, or this heaven-sent opportunity would be lost.</p><p></p><p>"We cultivators must forge ahead bravely and dare to fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Destiny is on my side!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Mochi Tianzun transformed into a streak of light and plunged into the Door of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>Awaiting him were infinite ultimate principles!</p><p></p><p>He would become number one in the immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, seeing this, Qi Yuan's eyes gleamed with a smile: "Fellow Daoist Ji, the fish has taken the bait. Let's go close the door and beat the dog!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he grabbed Ji Buping by the neck and entered his own Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, inside the Purple Palace, Mochi Tianzun's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Death energy?"</p><p></p><p>"Yin energy?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this supposed to be the Door of Ultimate Principles?"</p><p></p><p>He was confused and extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that upon entering the Door of Ultimate Principles, he would be greeted by infinite ultimate principles.</p><p></p><p>But... there wasn't a single ultimate principle to be found.</p><p></p><p>This place was extremely gloomy and permeated with death energy.</p><p></p><p>It didn't resemble the interior of the Door of Ultimate Principles at all!</p><p></p><p>But he had clearly entered the Door of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression suddenly changed again.</p><p></p><p>"There are no stars reflecting all of creation, only ten suns?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he caught the scent of danger.</p><p></p><p>Because these ten suns were far too familiar.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the Ten Suns Celestial Lord from a while ago... who reflected across the heavens, wanting to seize the position of the Great Sun Lord?</p><p></p><p>"Who's there? Come out!" </p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Celestial Lord was extremely cautious, because he sensed movement in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He looked over and immediately saw a cultivator in black robes approaching slowly, his whole body seeming to tremble, holding a weapon like a large blade.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Celestial Lord became tense at once.</p><p></p><p>A Great Lord? </p><p></p><p>No, definitely hiding something.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? The Ten Suns Celestial Lord?" The Demon Flame Celestial Lord looked at the man with the large blade.</p><p></p><p>But the man didn't say anything, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Demon Flame Celestial Lord, his gaze seeming very determined. </p><p></p><p>He looked at the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's belly, as if truly planning to do a sliding tackle to open up his stomach.</p><p></p><p>"Playing tricks!"</p><p></p><p>Although extremely wary, the Demon Flame Celestial Lord was after all a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord. </p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't encounter a Yang Spirit at the Ultimate Principle realm, he could protect himself.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the black-robed figure, the Demon Flame Celestial Lord didn't hold back at all, immediately unleashing his full power attack! After all, this man with the large blade before him was very strange, and must be a hidden expert.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do a sliding..." Ji Buping faced death unflinchingly. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice echoed in his ears. He forgot everything else, only remembering to do a sliding tackle.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to recall that he had once killed a great Ultimate Principle expert with a sliding tackle.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing an ordinary Yang Spirit Celestial Lord, with a sliding tackle... he had a 30% chance.</p><p></p><p>Well, he died in less than three breaths, and the Demon Flame Celestial Lord wasn't even 70% full.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Celestial Lord looked ahead, slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because with one strike, the opponent had directly turned to ash! His victory was too easy, leaving him somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>If it was a plot, why send a Great Lord? Anyway, he was very confused and couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also normal. </p><p></p><p>He didn't know Qi Yuan, so how could he understand Qi Yuan's thought process.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking in to rob, killing in anger, you have committed a capital offense!"</p><p></p><p>A man in a blood-red robe appeared, his eyes showing an expression of grief and indignation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this man, the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's pupils suddenly contracted: "Are you... the Ten Suns Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Whether I'm the Ten Suns Celestial Lord or not doesn't matter. Right now, I am an eyewitness!" Qi Yuan stood on the moral high ground to judge the Demon Flame Celestial Lord, "As the saying goes, a life for a life. Now... you must die here!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't stand seeing innocent people killed indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this Demon Flame Celestial Lord had killed Qi Yuan's naive, innocent, kind and lovable little companion Ji Buping.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't sit by and watch Ji Buping die in his house.</p><p></p><p>The person he brought out was killed, he had to take revenge!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Celestial Lord had a face full of question marks.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, are you brain-damaged?</p><p></p><p>But he felt that would be too impolite.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a Yang Spirit, how could he be crazy?</p><p></p><p>Although some Ultimate Principle realm experts' emotions could indeed be affected by the Ultimate Principle, the person before him didn't seem like that.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, can we talk properly?" The Demon Flame Celestial Lord was extremely wary.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Sure, you dare to slander me for not talking properly, you really are a once-in-ten-thousand-years villain!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan hesitated no longer.</p><p></p><p>What should you do when a criminal comes to your home? You should kill them directly! After all, self-defense is not a crime!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this criminal had killed someone!</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura spread.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant inside Qi Yuan gathered at this moment, all his power concentrating on his body.</p><p></p><p>His figure also suddenly became tall and large at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Flame Celestial Lord's expression suddenly changed, showing a look of terror: "An alternative Yang Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>There was no trace of an Ultimate Principle Yang Spirit's aura on the person before him.</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength was much greater, he would have ways to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>But now, the aura emanating from the opponent... was vaguely approaching the Ultimate Principle!</p><p></p><p>His heart shook, along with confusion.</p><p></p><p>This could only be explained by an alternative Yang Spirit! But the Ten Suns Celestial Lord had sought to compete for the position of that lord of the Great Radiance Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Suns Celestial Lord's talent was also extremely brilliant, so why would he take such an... alternative Yang Spirit path?</p><p></p><p>"What alternative Yang Spirit, I'm just a righteous Purple Palace great cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the energy of over a thousand divine infants gathered on Qi Yuan's body. This powerful strike went straight for the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's body.</p><p></p><p>Powerful!</p><p></p><p>Unmatched!</p><p></p><p>Force! Under this strike, the Demon Flame Celestial Lord had no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>This kind of power was a gap that no combat technique, no Dao method, no divine ability could bridge.</p><p></p><p>His body also shattered under this punch.</p><p></p><p>His soul also cracked at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's punch, reaching the level of an ordinary Ultimate Principle, small Celestial Position, he simply could not resist.</p><p></p><p>However, his soul ultimately did not perish.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had still held back on this strike.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the Demon Flame Celestial Lord died, the Demon Luo clan would certainly be shaken, which would affect his lying low and also affect his continued fishing.</p><p></p><p>He only left half a wisp of the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's soul.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Demon Flame Celestial Lord was terrified.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's Great Forgetting Mind Sutra suddenly activated.</p><p></p><p>"Grandson, I'm actually your long-lost ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"Your ancestor, I am the spirit of the Ultimate Principle Gate!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you remember?"</p><p></p><p>"I crippled you for your own good, it was to allow you to inherit the Ultimate Principle Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Mind Sutra activated, and Qi Yuan began brainwashing the remnant soul of the Demon Flame Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>If he were facing a Celestial Lord directly, his Great Forgetting Mind Sutra wouldn't be able to brainwash now.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Demon Flame Celestial Lord had been severely injured by him, and the flame of his soul was in Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>The effect of the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>He made the Demon Flame Celestial Lord forget the past, and continuously constructed false memories in the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's mind.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Brainwashing complete!"</p><p></p><p>After all, if he didn't brainwash, what if the Demon Flame Celestial Lord was very tough and extinguished his own soul? If that happened, the Demon Luo clan would definitely know.</p><p></p><p>His success rate for fishing next would decrease, and he might even be counter-fished.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's a pity, if only I had East Lord's mouth."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>Using the Great Forgetting Mind Sutra to brainwash was still slow.</p><p></p><p>Not as good as East Lord's, where the other person would believe it as soon as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, this white moonlight's storage bags were all destroyed by my punch, all the good things are gone."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, feeling somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a Yang Spirit, not a cabbage.</p><p></p><p>A Golden Core cultivator's body might not be as hard as a storage bag, but a Yang Spirit... how could the storage bag still be intact when the body was shattered.</p><p></p><p>"But well?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I never thought there would come a day when I would have to pretend to be an ugly person!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, his appearance changed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He actually transformed into the appearance of the Demon Flame Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>He had already scanned the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's soul.</p><p></p><p>He planned to go to the Demon Flame Celestial Lord's cave dwelling to get some good things.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

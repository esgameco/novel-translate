        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He did not conceal these things.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao made a "tsk" sound: "Although you're new, don't try to take advantage of this old lady's age. I still know some Restarters. Among cultivation realms, there's no such thing as a Yang Spirit realm. I've only heard that the Purple Palace is the pinnacle of power, and above the Purple Palace are deities who have long since ascended to... the unknowable realm."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao had some understanding of cultivators. She had heard about cultivation realms, so she naturally didn't believe Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes showed a surprised expression: "You know so much. Can I ask you a question?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan started freeloading again, trying to get information for free.</p><p></p><p>"This old lady knows more than just that. Go ahead and ask." An Qiao was generous and took care of newcomers. Who told the newcomer to be so handsome, pleasing to the eye. If he were turned into a little sissy boy, it would surely be even more interesting. Of course, An Qiao only thought this to herself.</p><p></p><p>"When cultivators come here, do their realms also decrease?"</p><p></p><p>"They probably... do." An Qiao said uncertainly. </p><p></p><p>The man in black tight-fitting clothes beside her added: "It's not probably, it's definitely."</p><p></p><p>As for the reason, he didn't elaborate.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean immortal techniques and old martial arts are on the same level?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>According to An Qiao, what the natives here practiced were all old martial arts. They could maintain their strength when fighting on their home turf, but once they went to other parallel worlds in the game, their level would drop by one.</p><p></p><p>New martial arts didn't have these problems, and could maintain their strength in... various parallel worlds within the game.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to ask: "If one went to other worlds, or even... the universe, could new martial arts still maintain their strength?"</p><p></p><p>This was what Qi Yuan cared about most.</p><p></p><p>If they could, then... new martial arts would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Spirits at the level of Great Principle could only maintain their full strength when going to other worlds.</p><p></p><p>But... the universe was another concept entirely.</p><p></p><p>"Other universes..." An Qiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>As someone who wasn't very ancient, she was also aware of the concept of other universes. Scientists had proposed that other universes might exist. But this was just speculation, not proven.</p><p></p><p>"If you can take me to other universes, I'll prove it to you," An Qiao replied.</p><p></p><p>Not getting the answer he wanted, Qi Yuan didn't mind at all, but looked at the two of them with puppy dog eyes and said: "If martial techniques can't be traded, what about cultivation methods? My true love... no, my substitute true love is with monsters, I want to increase my strength to see them one last time."</p><p></p><p>These monsters could provide essence blood, weren't they true loves?</p><p></p><p>However, these monsters fell a bit short of Qi Yuan's criteria for true love certification. So they were just substitutes for true love.</p><p></p><p>"Your true love was captured by monsters?" An Qiao misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan say his true love was with monsters, she assumed it had been captured.</p><p></p><p>The man in black tight-fitting clothes beside her gave Qi Yuan another look, with an intriguing expression: "You've only been here for less than a day, and you already have a true love? Don't tell me you've immersed yourself in this identity and become obsessed with the woman the previous owner liked. That's not good. My advice is to forget about her, just treat it like watching a TV show."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible!" Qi Yuan loudly refused, "My desire to see them is as constant as the sun and moon, as enduring as the sea. I must see my true love!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attitude was sincere and genuine.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him like this, An Qiao was somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>"I have a martial arts cultivation method here. It's somewhat incomplete, only able to maintain up to the peak of the Qi Blood realm. Do you want it?" An Qiao finally decided to be Qi Yuan's benefactor.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you're really a good person. My true loves will surely be very grateful," Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>The man in black tight-fitting clothes didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao took out an old sheepskin scroll from her Qi Blood space.</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin scroll was yellowed and somewhat damaged, looking quite aged.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation method is called 'Heaven Shocking Technique'. The name sounds impressive, but it's actually very ordinary, barely qualifying as a cultivation method. By the way, after getting the method, cultivate diligently and don't go looking for your true love. This mission is unusual, and the monsters involved are at least at the Qi Blood realm, even the weakest ones. You're no match for them now. During this time, you just need to cultivate, follow our instructions, do some investigation, and the mission will be easily completed. It should take... no more than a month or two."</p><p></p><p>"A month or two... that long?" Qi Yuan was surprised. "What's the time difference between here and reality?"</p><p></p><p>If one second inside was ten thousand years outside, that would be terrible. He didn't know if he could still withdraw his 100 million Qin yuan, no, 10 trillion, from the bank.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao smiled: "You're already dead, you should cut ties with the past. The time here flows at the same rate as reality. By the way, we're staying at the county office. Do you want to stay with us?"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao extended an invitation.</p><p></p><p>"No thanks, I'm used to being alone. I like being... a lone wolf." When he said "lone wolf", Qi Yuan paused slightly. Because he wasn't a lone wolf, Xiao Jia was always with him.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, come find us at the county office if anything comes up. We also need to quickly report the results of our investigation here to the team leader."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, goodbye everyone." Qi Yuan waved to everyone, then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the desolate and dilapidated courtyard, only An Qiao and the man in black tight-fitting clothes remained, along with a large black dog.</p><p></p><p>"This newcomer... seems a bit unreliable, but my intuition tells me he must be unusual in some way, with some secrets," the man in black tight-fitting clothes said softly.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao smiled mischievously: "Perhaps he's had contact with cultivators and mastered some magic techniques."</p><p></p><p>The man in black tight-fitting clothes recalled their conversation up to now and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, here martial arts reign supreme. Mastering a little bit of immortal techniques is not worth mentioning," the man in black tight-fitting clothes replied seriously.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating immortal techniques takes much longer than martial arts. Moreover, coming to this Netherworld, one's cultivation would drop by a major level. So it really wasn't worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't have some secrets? You have them, I have them, the team leader has them," An Qiao said with a slight smile, leading the big black dog. "Fatty, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Fatty the dog grumbled at this point: "Actually, I have secrets too."</p><p></p><p>But no one paid attention to what it said.</p><p></p><p>In the inn.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan drank tea while looking at the sheepskin scroll.</p><p></p><p>[This is a martial arts cultivation method, incomplete, with 124 flaws. The method can be improved...]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts cultivation method held no great secrets for him.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I've mastered too few cultivation methods and can't fill in the gaps."</p><p></p><p>At present, he could only improve this cultivation method somewhat, unable to deduce more.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Right now I'm too weak, just entered the Qi Blood realm. If I meet my true love, I'll lack confidence. No good... I need to increase my strength."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan began cultivating the "Heaven Shocking Technique".</p><p></p><p>About a quarter hour later, Qi Yuan opened his eyes: "The speed is too slow. At this rate, it would take at least three months to cultivate to the middle stage of Qi Blood realm."</p><p></p><p>Taking three months to go from early stage to middle stage would seem shocking to An Qiao if she knew. She would exclaim "how terrifying" and say this person must not be allowed to live.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, this speed was still too slow.</p><p></p><p>Here's the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to add some deep blue points," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Three drops of monster blood floated beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed one drop of blood and began to circulate his technique.</p><p></p><p>"You have consumed one drop of monster blood. Your martial arts cultivation has increased by ten days. Two drops of monster blood remain."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't have a deep blue system, so he had to voice it himself.</p><p></p><p>If others saw this, they might think he was crazy, but Qi Yuan enjoyed it.</p><p></p><p>"You've consumed two more drops of monster blood. Your cultivation speed has increased. Suddenly, a flash of inspiration strikes, and you seem to have grasped the 'Shocking Sky Technique', focusing on the character for 'shock'.</p><p></p><p>Shocking thunder, shocking horses, shocking awakening of insects.</p><p></p><p>Your cultivation has rapidly improved, equivalent to two months of hard training!"</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, a flash of blood color passed through Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The three drops of monster blood greatly increased his cultivation, shortening his training time by more than two months.</p><p></p><p>"I'm becoming more and more versatile. When I was in the Wangyue Continent, I could voice those monsters who couldn't speak. Now I can... voice the system."</p><p></p><p>"If I ever lose my job in the future, I'll just pretend to be the system."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was proud of his voiceover skills, not worried about being unemployed.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I've been working so hard, why hasn't Old Huang's white moonlight substitute come to find me yet?" Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had just killed Fourth Master Huang, and logically, Old Huang should have received the news by now.</p><p></p><p>If Old Huang were a diligent person, he would come to seek revenge now.</p><p></p><p>However, Old Huang didn't come.</p><p></p><p>"Usually, when you beat up the old one, an even older one comes.</p><p></p><p>But if the older one doesn't come, I can only beat up the old one and then beat up an even older one."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to take the initiative and go cause trouble for Old Huang, no longer waiting passively.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know that due to the arrival of people from the Demon Suppression Department in Yunyun County, the monsters in this area were now strictly forbidden from going out at will.</p><p></p><p>These monsters were all lying low in different areas.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan left the inn, his martial arts cultivation having improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>If he killed another Fourth Master Huang and encountered another substitute white moonlight, he would be able to reach the middle stage of the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, his plan was to kill more.</p><p></p><p>As night fell,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped at an abandoned mansion.</p><p></p><p>Today he went to the Huang mansion, but it was empty.</p><p></p><p>After his investigation, he learned that all the monsters in Yunyun County were now lying low, gathering at various strongholds, seemingly holding some kind of monster promotion meeting.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan stood in front of the mansion, his eyes showing a relaxed expression: "In this stronghold, the strongest is Old Huang, a Blood Qi Realm monster. The number of monsters... about twenty?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, it was a bit tough.</p><p></p><p>If Old Huang restrained him and the other monsters attacked, it would be difficult for him to escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>"System, you're so useless. Why do I need monster blood to add points?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed, and after about a breath, he realized.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I remembered wrong. I don't have a system."</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan was like someone complaining about a girlfriend's flaws, only to suddenly realize he didn't have a girlfriend.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, are you from the government office? What are you looking at? Don't you know that only monsters are allowed to enter the mansion ahead?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, an arrogant voice came from behind Qi Yuan. A monster with a thunder-god mouth and a rooster face approached, looking fierce and evil.</p><p></p><p>This appearance was gloomy and extremely creepy.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze flickering, as if he might eat Qi Yuan if the timing was off.</p><p></p><p>"Chicken?" Qi Yuan recognized it as a chicken monster at a glance.</p><p></p><p>It was his first time seeing a male chicken.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not a monster, my wife is, so of course I have the right to enter. I'm a live-in son-in-law!" Qi Yuan said, puffing out his chest.</p><p></p><p>He had sacrificed too much to see the white moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"Your wife is a monster?" The rooster spirit was surprised, then the disdain in his eyes grew stronger. "So you're just a hairless pretty boy."</p><p></p><p>As a monster, the rooster spirit had always looked down on humans with sparse hair.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't help that some female monsters liked them.</p><p></p><p>In the rooster spirit's eyes, those female monsters were neither fish nor fowl, plucking all the hair from their bodies and only keeping a few monster characteristics. They looked awful.</p><p></p><p>They were really human-worshipping, foreign-fawning little monster girls.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and said, "Can I go in now?"</p><p></p><p>The rooster spirit gave Qi Yuan a cold glance: "You'll have to ask the old locust tree spirit at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>He's lived for a long time and can identify disguises."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the rooster spirit swaggered towards the dilapidated mansion, tail held high.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched the rooster spirit's back, his eyes showing a greedy look: "This is a rooster spirit, it can be used to buy a house. If only I were a civil servant."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan thought this, he saw a gust of demonic wind ahead.</p><p></p><p>An old man who looked like dry tree bark appeared.</p><p></p><p>When the rooster spirit saw the old man, his attitude became respectful: "Elder Locust."</p><p></p><p>The dry bark old man glanced at the rooster spirit indifferently: "A rooster that has become a spirit, enter."</p><p></p><p>The rooster spirit bowed solemnly, then said, "There's a human behind me who claims to be some female monster's pretty boy. I think he has ulterior motives. Elder Locust should check him carefully."</p><p></p><p>The dry bark old man looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze becoming profound.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan walked over confidently, his smile as bright as morning dew: "Little Bride... come out."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the space rippled, and a flash of blood color appeared.</p><p></p><p>Beside Qi Yuan, a tall figure in a bridal gown appeared.</p><p></p><p>The bright red bridal gown was in Chinese style, looking quite eerie in the pitch-black night.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, that blood-red bridal gown was leaning against Qi Yuan like a little bird depending on its mate.</p><p></p><p>If she had a face, it would surely be adorned with flower ornaments, with gentle eyes and brows.</p><p></p><p>"This is my wife, Little Bride, whom I married with an eight-bearer sedan chair," Qi Yuan introduced proudly, holding Little Bride's icy cold sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." The rooster spirit's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>He had guessed what kind of monster Qi Yuan's wife might be, but he hadn't thought of... this? Was there such a thing in this world as a bridal gown becoming a spirit or monster? This was a rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Even the calm gaze of Elder Locust was slightly moved at this moment. He looked at Little Bride, and a strand of monster energy flew past.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be trying to determine if Little Bride was a monster.</p><p></p><p>The rooster spirit beside him also looked nervous, wanting to know what was going on.</p><p></p><p>After about twelve breaths, Elder Locust finally spoke, though his voice was a bit hoarse: "Bridal gown monster, enter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Qi Yuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the rooster spirit and said proudly, "I'm going in."</p><p></p><p>The rooster spirit couldn't discern Little Bride's cultivation level and looked at her warily before quickly entering the mansion.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, a desolate voice came through the air.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this old fellow will have to move again. I can't bear to watch, can't bear to watch. The water is too deep."</p><p></p><p>Recommended a friend's book, not my alt account, it's a mental illness genre, starting an urban daily life system in the apocalypse, dating red-faced zombies, "It's Already the Apocalypse, and the Perfect Life System Just Arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Meng Xu wakes up one day to find he has activated the perfect life system, and he's about to get promoted and reach the peak of life.</p><p></p><p>However, when he pulls back the curtains, he's dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The apocalypse has arrived, zombies are everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Blood and fire everywhere, darkness has descended upon the world.</p><p></p><p>It's already the apocalypse, and the perfect life system just arrived?</p><p></p><p>[A perfect day starts with striking up a conversation.

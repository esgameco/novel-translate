        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Furious Roar Sweeps Through the Ghost Pass</p><p></p><p>The cultivators within a radius of millions of miles could all hear that furious roar.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a dazzling dark light erupted from within the Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an extremely dark yet incomprehensible light had exploded.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth shook, the spiritual energy surging like the tides.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators trembled in fear, while others were utterly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This level of power..."</p><p>"What kind of powerful expert is clashing here?"</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Immortal Venerable was surprised: "This is... the Ghost Pass, did the Banners' Master make a move?"</p><p>"Could it be that the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence has done something big again?"</p><p>"Wait... where is the Myriad Ghosts Banner?"</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Immortal Venerable in the void blinked his eyes, his heart surging with shock.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless cultivators in the Demon Pass turned their gaze towards the Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence is a ruthless person, he has completely destroyed the Myriad Ghosts Banner!" Zi Yuan Da Xue exclaimed in shock, while also not forgetting to spit out some mushrooms.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the best opportunity for us to attack the Ghost Pass!" Although Anhui Deer was a love-struck fool, she also had a strong sense of ambition. Of course, she couldn't help but add, "This Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence, he's not even worthy to compare himself to the Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiao Lu glared at Anhui Deer, clutching her clothes, racking her brain but unable to find any reason to speak up for her senior brother in the Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, seeing the disappearance of the Myriad Ghosts Banner, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu immediately associated it with the time she had helped her senior brother find the Tiankun Wondrous Land where the Myriad Ghosts Banner could be viewed.</p><p></p><p>There might be a connection between these two things.</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother in the Blood Robe must be acquainted with that Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence!</p><p></p><p>This astonishing attack was partly due to the merits of her senior brother in the Blood Robe, and also greatly contributed by her, Zi Yuan Xiao Lu. However, she had promised her senior brother not to reveal this, so she kept her mouth shut.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would definitely shock Anhui Deer!</p><p></p><p>Black Sword sighed softly: "Normally, we would have rushed up to fight, but now that the Black Abyss has just submitted to the Taihuang Palace, what reason do we have to go there?"</p><p></p><p>The current turmoil in the Demon Pass was the best opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p></p><p>However, the Abyss Lord had become a timid turtle. If they went now, wouldn't they be courting death?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Anhui Deer lowered her head, her eyes gleaming with determination: "When Black Sword Brother becomes the Great Absolute, and commands the Black Abyss, we will definitely not be so constrained!"</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses all agreed wholeheartedly. It was clear that they all had great faith in Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword was the only true lord of the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Black Sword had not yet grown strong enough.</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss had to endure for a while.</p><p></p><p>"A single Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence can overturn the Ghostly Heavenly Banners so thoroughly. If Black Sword Brother becomes the Great Absolute, even the Taihuang Palace will have to show us respect!" said one of the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were also some voices circulating in the Black Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Lord's submission was for the greater good, to buy time for Black Sword's growth.</p><p></p><p>Without a Great Absolute who had mastered the Supreme Absolute, the Black Abyss would only be cannon fodder in the Rinne Rebirth, without any say.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the current turmoil in the Rinne Rebirth, clashes like the one between the Black Abyss and the Ghostly Heavenly Banners would not be uncommon.</p><p></p><p>But looking back, those forces with a Supreme Venerable remained unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>This was their foundation, their confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The current humiliation is only for the bright future ahead!"</p><p>"Enduring hardship now will lead to sweet success later!"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the geniuses' different perspectives, the Celestial Immortal Venerables' attention was focused on the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence snatching the Myriad Ghosts Banner.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to stir all the Celestial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Offensive Spiritual Treasures were the supreme foundation of the sects.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence was able to seize the Myriad Ghosts Banner, an Offensive Spiritual Treasure.</p><p></p><p>This method was too mysterious and shocking.</p><p></p><p>Even a Supreme Venerable could not snatch a third of the Myriad Ghosts Banner's main body.</p><p></p><p>But the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence managed to do it.</p><p></p><p>How could this not terrify them?</p><p></p><p>Did this mean that the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence, if he wished, could even snatch their Offensive Spiritual Treasures?</p><p></p><p>"This Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence is truly mysterious!"</p><p>"However, he has been a bit too bold. Now that the Rinne Rebirth has begun, the Taihuang Palace will be the first to deal with him!"</p><p>"Searching through ancient records, we've never found this force."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Tiankun Wondrous Land.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Glad to have returned safely!"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of excitement in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was a third of the Myriad Ghosts Banner's main body.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his half-finished Emperor's Banner, wouldn't that mean he could almost refine the Offensive Spiritual Treasure, the Emperor's Banner?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, time to get to work again. Refining the Emperor's Banner, my grand plan, will give me more confidence."</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan became focused again.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the Myriad Ghosts Banner.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying figure appeared within the Myriad Ghosts Banner, its aura shocking, and it fiercely attacked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the lower-level cultivators in the Tiankun Wondrous Land all felt a sense of great calamity.</p><p></p><p>This power was too frightening.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? What's going on?"</p><p>"This aura, could it be a Celestial Immortal Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>This counterattack's power was comparable to a Great Absolute's strike.</p><p></p><p>This Offensive Spiritual Treasure, refined daily by the Banners' Master, could be said to be inseparable from the Banners' Master in a certain sense.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Myriad Ghosts Banner's counterattack, Qi Yuan let out a cold shout: "You've come into my home, and still want to assault me?"</p><p></p><p>A massive pressure swept out, easily dissipating the strike comparable to a Great Absolute's.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stepped on the Myriad Ghosts Banner, suppressing the spirit soldier.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Ghosts Banner struggled constantly, but it was full of loopholes and couldn't break free.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he suddenly spoke loudly: "Don't panic, everyone. I'm refining a treasure, so there might be some commotion, but don't worry... it won't harm you.</p><p></p><p>If anyone is disturbed from their sleep, you can silently meditate, and I'll let you fall asleep instantly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still considerate.</p><p></p><p>Refining treasures would undoubtedly produce rumbling noises and strange phenomena. If it disturbed the cultivators' sleep or the common people, he had to give a heads-up and find a solution.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his voice, the cultivators in the Tiankun Wondrous Land all heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"It's our Lord who has returned!"</p><p>"What treasure is our Lord refining?"</p><p>"The aura is so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators looked towards Qi Yuan's location, their expressions curious.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen a Celestial Immortal refine treasures before.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, among the common people, there was also some bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>A young man in beast-skin clothes, who had been trying to stay up all night to restore his normal sleep schedule, suddenly showed a look of ecstatic joy: "Sleep!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, the Tiankun Wondrous Land became particularly lively.</p><p></p><p>Every day, it was as if celestial music had descended, with thousands of great scholars debating, and tens of thousands of Buddhas chanting sutras.</p><p></p><p>The scriptures were obscure and profound, containing the sounds of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, there were also the howls of evil demons and wandering souls, quite terrifying.</p><p></p><p>For the first six months, some cultivators were still fearful and apprehensive, but as time passed, they gradually got used to it.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, it seemed as if countless terrifying wandering souls were howling and roaring in the northeast of the Tiankun Wondrous Land, like a hellish scene.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is the work of a Celestial Immortal's treasure, terrifying to the extreme!"</p><p>"Even a wisp of this aura could drive one to madness!"</p><p>"For some reason, this aura feels somewhat familiar, similar to the Myriad Souls Banner of the Ghostly Heavenly Banners!"</p><p>"Could it be that this Lord is a cultivator of the Ghostly Heavenly Banners?"</p><p>"Alas, the exit from the Tiankun Wondrous Land where this Lord is refining the treasure has been sealed."</p><p></p><p>Some people thought about this, feeling fearful.</p><p></p><p>That was the Ghostly Heavenly Banners.</p><p></p><p>The Ghostly Heavenly Banners' cultivators refining the Myriad Souls Banner often destroyed an entire realm, absorbing the wandering souls into the banner.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Ghostly Heavenly Banners.</p><p></p><p>The Banners' Master hovered in the void.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Ghosts Banner trembled constantly, a menacing gleam flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Celestial Immortal Venerables all lowered their heads, not daring to meet his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Hiding in the Wondrous Land, do you think you can escape me?"</p><p></p><p>The Banners' Master's voice was laced with thick anger.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Ghosts Banner was his life-bound treasure.</p><p></p><p>Based on the Myriad Ghosts Banner, he could vaguely judge that the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence was hiding in the Wondrous Land.</p><p></p><p>As for which Wondrous Land, he did not know yet.</p><p></p><p>But given time, he would soon find out.</p><p></p><p>"Snatching the Myriad Ghosts Banner will come at a price!"</p><p></p><p>While confirming the location of the Myriad Ghosts Banner, he also contacted the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Because he had the intent to kill and either slay or imprison the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he could not accomplish this alone, so he needed the help of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>A phantom figure descended upon the Ghostly Heavenly Banners.</p><p></p><p>All the Celestial Immortal Venerables saw this and immediately paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>The Banners' Master of the Ghostly Heavenly Banners also hurriedly said, "Greetings, Supreme Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>This Supreme Venerable was the number one figure under the Great Sun in the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun has said that the Palace Emissary of the Emperor's Residence is not a Great Absolute," the Supreme Venerable spoke, his voice like a grand bell.</p><p></p><p>All the Celestial Immortal Venerables who heard this were stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"He is not a Great Absolute?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? If he is not a Great Dao Sovereign, how could he easily slay a Dao Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>"If he is not a Great Dao Sovereign, then what am I?" said a Dao Sovereign Celestial with a bitter expression.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Guilt Celestial Venerable and the Demon Origin Celestial Venerable were also greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>If the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace was not a Great Dao Sovereign, how could he fight them to a stalemate?</p><p></p><p>"The number of Great Dao Sovereigns in the world has not increased or decreased, and... I observe that he does not have the mark of a Great Dao Sovereign, so he may be an anomaly from outside the Immortal Realms, possessing the combat power of a Great Dao Sovereign but not being one himself," declared the True Origin Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Banner Lord's eyes flashed with killing intent: "Without the mark of a Great Dao Sovereign... does that mean I can slay him?"</p><p></p><p>At the Dao Sovereign realm, one would have the mark of a Great Dao Sovereign. This mark is closely connected to the Immortal Dao Will. That is why ordinary Great Dao Sovereigns cannot truly harm each other.</p><p></p><p>Only by using an offensive Tribulation Treasure can one carve a crack in the opponent's Dao Sovereign mark.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a Supreme Venerable can easily erase the opponent's Dao Sovereign mark and then slay them.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the Banner Lord shook his head. The opponent was too slippery.</p><p></p><p>Although he said he could slay the opponent, he could not catch him.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Eternal Sigh Talisman. Once this talisman is unleashed, it will trap the target in eternal time. </p><p></p><p>If he does not possess the true Dao Sovereign realm, this eternal time will only allow you to struggle with him, not escape."</p><p></p><p>The True Origin Celestial Venerable produced an ordinary-looking talisman and placed it in the Banner Lord's hand.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerables present heard this and their expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is actually the Eternal Sigh Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>"This talisman comes from the hand of the Great Day, this Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace... he is doomed!"</p><p></p><p>Holding the Eternal Sigh Talisman, the Banner Lord's gaze deepened: "True Origin Celestial Venerable, rest assured, with this Eternal Sigh Talisman, I will personally slay him!"</p><p></p><p>Since the opponent does not have the mark of a Great Dao Sovereign, naturally he also does not possess the true Dao Sovereign realm, and can only fight him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he were a true Dao Sovereign, he might not be able to break free from the Eternal Sigh Talisman forged by the Great Day.</p><p></p><p>The Great Day has comprehended the Supreme Dao, and it is at the Wen level.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, that Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace will certainly not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>With his offensive Tribulation Treasure, he can grind the opponent to death.</p><p></p><p>"Await your good news," the True Origin Celestial Venerable said, and his illusory figure dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A look of smugness appeared in the Banner Lord's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Invite the four directions, I will slay the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord spoke with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent hides in a strange land and does not come out, he can just swallow the strange land.</p><p></p><p>He can even descend upon the strange land and slay the opponent.</p><p></p><p>As for confirming the location of the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace, it is merely a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner is one with him, and by carefully searching for a few days, he will be able to find the opponent's location.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" </p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Venerables heard this, and their hearts were filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Realm will finally wipe away its humiliation.</p><p></p><p>These Celestial Venerables disappeared like flowing light.</p><p></p><p>About a day later, the news of the Banner Lord's invitation spread to the major Holy Lands.</p><p></p><p>In the White Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The veiled, charming woman's eyes held a smile. </p><p></p><p>"The Banner Lord wants to slay that Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace and invites the four directions, how interesting."</p><p></p><p>Her smile held a trace of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord's strength was on par with hers.</p><p></p><p>She knew she was not capable of slaying a Great Dao Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Banner Lord had such confidence, which meant... the hand of the Supreme Yang Palace must be behind this.</p><p></p><p>"It would be worth going to see the excitement!"</p><p></p><p>In the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess Venerable's gaze was deep, tinged with unease: "I will not go!"</p><p></p><p>She directly refused.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Firmament, the Heavenly Lord's figure was majestic, shrouded in a layer of mist that obscured his features.</p><p></p><p>"Is a Great Dao Sovereign about to perish? It seems... this time the shedding of Lingyao, the Venerables who may perish may not be just one."</p><p></p><p>As for the other powers with Supreme Venerables in charge, they also mostly only sent second or third-in-command to attend, and the majority did not dispatch Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Demon Pass, Ziyuan's expression was tense.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Pass and the Demon Realm were very close, so the news of the Demon Realm's invitation to the four directions also quickly reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Realm is so bold to invite the four directions, isn't it afraid that the news will reach the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace and he will flee?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Supreme Yang Palace must have a hand in this, otherwise how would the Demon Realm have such confidence!"</p><p></p><p>"The Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace has been too arrogant, even taking the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, it seems this time... he is doomed."</p><p></p><p>"The outcome is not yet decided, how can you be so certain?" Ziyuan Daxue said casually, suddenly seeing Ziyuan Xiaolu and gently asking, "Xiaolu, why the sour expression, could it be that you are worried about that Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Ziyuan Xiaolu was a bit anxious. "Big Sister Daxue, can you contact Bloodrobe Senior Brother? I just went to his cave dwelling but he wasn't there."</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue shook her head: "That guy comes and goes mysteriously, who knows where he is?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Xiaolu heard this, feeling extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>She even suspected that Bloodrobe Senior Brother might be with the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was all her own speculation.</p><p></p><p>It was also possible that Bloodrobe Senior Brother didn't even know the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, you seem so anxious, is there something important?" Ziyuan Daxue looked at Ziyuan Xiaolu.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Xiaolu shook her head, her expression disappointed: "Nothing."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she thought of something and softly asked, "Big Sister Daxue, can you contact the Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Ziyuan Daxue also shook her head. "Just now the news of the Demon Realm's invitation came, the Abyss Lord has summoned all the Celestial Venerables, probably to discuss some important matter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ziyuan Xiaolu's face turned bitter, looking like a frost-bitten eggplant.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaolu, is it that you feel Bloodrobe is in danger?" Ziyuan Daxue asked.</p><p></p><p>Based on Ziyuan Xiaolu's words, she had deduced many things.</p><p></p><p>"No... no." Ziyuan Xiaolu denied.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had promised Bloodrobe Senior Brother that no matter what, she would not reveal their secret.</p><p></p><p>What if Bloodrobe Senior Brother had nothing to do with the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace, and was planning something else?</p><p></p><p>If she leaked it out, it would interfere with Bloodrobe Senior Brother's important matter.</p><p></p><p>"You, don't worry too much about that Bloodrobe guy, even if the Ancestor is in danger, he won't be in danger. That guy, his mouth is so loose, I've never seen anyone who can curse the Supreme Yang Palace's person so fiercely, yet still survive this long," Ziyuan Daxue said casually.</p><p></p><p>To insult a Supreme Venerable is unforgivable, and even Ziyuan Daxue, who disliked the Supreme Yang Palace's person, did not dare to curse him.</p><p></p><p>But that Bloodrobe guy cursed so fiercely, yet still managed to survive this long, if he didn't have some skills, that would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ziyuan Xiaolu's heart was somewhat at ease: "I hope Bloodrobe Senior Brother is alright."</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Expanse Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>The forging of the Human Emperor's Banner was still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was focused and earnest, naturally unaware that the Banner Lord of the Demon Realm was inviting the four directions to slay him.</p><p></p><p>In any case, his right eyebrow had not twitched, indicating that everything was normal.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Heavenly Expanse Strange Land was filled with strange phenomena.</p><p></p><p>The originally hellish soul soldiers had now changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>They were now clad in golden armor or holy light armor, looking majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>The messages of greed, killing, and evil had disappeared, replaced by righteousness and brightness.</p><p></p><p>The forging of the Human Emperor's Banner was now only one step away from completion.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Qi Yuan opened his eyes and let out a great shout.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Ghost Heavenly Division, hear my command!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the originally dense Yin Ghost army suddenly erupted with holy light from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>As if blessed by the Heavenly Dao, they transformed from the soul collectors of the Underworld into the guardian divine generals of the Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Enter my Human Emperor's Banner, protect my human realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Enter my Human Emperor's Banner, sweep away the evil of the Immortal Realms!"</p><p></p><p>"Enter my Human Emperor's Banner, rectify the human way!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's great shout, the boundless Yin Ghost army, with majestic might like the sea, suddenly rushed into the Human Emperor's Banner.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying cries of slaughter swept across the land like countless burning paper money effects.</p><p></p><p>Countless divine warriors entered, and at this moment, the originally tattered Human Emperor's Banner, stained with blood, was now shining with brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>But though the banner is tattered, the spirit is eternal.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Human Emperor's Banner, Qi Yuan's eyes held a satisfied expression as he looked at his masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>"If this banner is thrown at someone, wouldn't that person be covered in bruises?"</p><p></p><p>Finally, he had his own offensive Tribulation Treasure.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, he now also possessed greater combat power!</p>

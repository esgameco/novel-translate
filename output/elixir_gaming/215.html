        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we've been rooted here for over a hundred years, yet the information we've passed on has been so limited," Aunt Liu couldn't help but say disappointedly.</p><p></p><p>They had taken root in the occupied area in order to gather intelligence and pass it on to the ancient gods. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, over all these years, the information they had transmitted was limited.</p><p></p><p>And many of their sisters had died.</p><p></p><p>This sometimes made Aunt Liu wonder if what they were doing was really worth it.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Liu, no matter the results, we just need to do our part well. We only need to pass on information - leave eliminating the evil gods to those great ones!" Little Xing said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu smiled helplessly: "It's just that after being in the occupied area for hundreds of years, not only has the situation not improved, it's become even more chaotic. I'm just feeling a bit emotional about it."</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a while, Aunt Liu gave her instructions, and Little Xing took her suona and headed to the private room where Qi Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing's face showed curiosity. </p><p></p><p>After all, coming to a place like theirs to listen to suona was practically unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"Are the two guests sure they want to listen to suona?" Little Xing asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan glanced at Little Xing.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on an evil god in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>That evil god had concealed his aura and was squinting his eyes, seeming to be plotting something.</p><p></p><p>On that evil god's body was a treasure formed from the divine power of the Starving Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the desolate and sorrowful sound of the suona began.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked at the evil god in the hall who was hiding his identity and aura, and transmitted: "Sir, should we make our move?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan withdrew his gaze and looked at Little Xing's pure face.</p><p></p><p>"Why involve these poor NPCs?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>When he entered the tower, the Solar Golden Pill was already influencing everyone at every moment.</p><p></p><p>Except for Aunt Liu and Little Xing, no one else knew Qi Yuan had entered this tower.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi showed an ashamed expression: "I was rash, Old Zhu."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, there will be plenty of opportunities. Let's wait until this suona piece is finished before we take care of business."</p><p></p><p>In the brothel, Qi Yuan leisurely drank tea and savored the sound of the suona.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing seemed to have gotten into the spirit, not only playing the suona but also starting to dance as she played.</p><p></p><p>Her dance was seductive and particularly enchanting.</p><p></p><p>Under the mournful suona music, the young girl's body danced, as if it were the background color of the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on a tall mountain outside Flower Leaf City.</p><p></p><p>The man in the gold silk mask showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"That group actually attacked Maple and Forest countries, killing dozens of new gods?"</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this news, the man in the gold silk mask was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had just clashed briefly with that group.</p><p></p><p>To preserve his strength and avoid unexpected situations, he had chosen to lie low at the time and not really pursue them.</p><p></p><p>He had thought those people would know when to stop.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, that group was so bold as to directly slaughter the new gods of Maple and Forest countries.</p><p></p><p>This was forcing their military camp to take action.</p><p></p><p>"Camp Master, now that Maple and Forest countries are facing a crisis, should we send troops to support them?" the deputy carefully asked.</p><p></p><p>"Send troops? Would we make it in time?" The gold silk masked man shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the deputy nodded, then thought of something and continued: "The Great Yangterrace Lord just sent a message saying we're the closest, telling us to go encircle those ancient gods causing trouble first."</p><p></p><p>The gold silk masked man still shook his head: "Don't bother. Without the allied forces assembled, I won't make a move. Otherwise, it will just be my subordinates dying, while everyone shares the credit equally. Where in this world are there such good deals!</p><p></p><p>Anyway, those few ancient gods are trapped fish in a pot, they can't escape. There's no rush."</p><p></p><p>The gold silk masked man was confident of victory.</p><p></p><p>This mortal realm would sooner or later be the domain of the new gods.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much the enemy struggled, it was just the throes of death.</p><p></p><p>The overall situation was already decided. What he needed to do was figure out how to preserve his strength and maximize his benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Let them live another day." The gold silk masked man said easily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, how's the investigation of the Starving Holy Sect going?" the gold silk masked man asked at this point.</p><p></p><p>In the occupied area, many disciples of the Starving Holy Mother were hidden in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Currently the Red Leaf Tower is most suspicious. A true god has already gone to investigate," the deputy answered.</p><p></p><p>"Why bother with all that trouble? If there's suspicion, just wipe them out. This is the mortal realm, these subjects are just consumables," the gold silk masked man said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!" the deputy quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan listened to the suona and watched the girl's dance, feeling quite enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder so many people love going to clubs, it really is... elegant!" Qi Yuan sighed with feeling.</p><p></p><p>But just as he made this comment, the door was pushed open.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu hurried in with an apologetic look on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Guests, there's an urgent matter at Red Leaf Tower, I need to take Little Xing away!" Aunt Liu was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>She had just received news that an evil god was going to take action against Red Leaf Tower.</p><p></p><p>She needed to quickly take the Starving Holy Sect believers and leave.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would die here.</p><p></p><p>And they would die horribly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan waved his hand, and Aunt Liu's form was instantly frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>"Happy times are always short."</p><p></p><p>"Little Xing, don't rush, finish playing this suona piece and the restraints on her will be released."</p><p></p><p>Without the suona music, Qi Yuan felt it wouldn't do justice to the great deed he was about to perform.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing looked terrified, but still followed Qi Yuan's instructions and continued playing the suona.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, time for business." Qi Yuan spoke, taking Zhu Zhuangshi and vanishing in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Only a few faint words remained in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I think we didn't pay!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... do you have money?"</p><p></p><p>"...No."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, we just came to have a heart-to-heart with the young ladies, it doesn't count as soliciting, no need to pay, and no need to worry about getting arrested. If the police ask, just say we came to collect old cell phones from the ladies."</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the suona music was still continuing, and Little Xing anxiously looked at Aunt Liu.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Liu, what's wrong?" She had tried many methods but couldn't help Aunt Liu break free.</p><p></p><p>"A true god, this must be the work of a true god!" Aunt Liu was also extremely anxious now.</p><p></p><p>Because this restraint was clearly placed by a true god.</p><p></p><p>How could she, a mere Purple Palace cultivator, possibly break free?</p><p></p><p>She never imagined those two were actually true gods.</p><p></p><p>What were two true gods doing coming to Red Leaf Tower? Whether they were good or bad, Aunt Liu had no idea.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Little Xing, you might as well stop playing. Don't worry about me. An evil god is going to take action against our Red Leaf Tower. If we don't leave now, it will be too late," Aunt Liu urged.</p><p></p><p>It would take at least a hundred breaths to finish this piece.</p><p></p><p>In a hundred breaths, many things could happen.</p><p></p><p>"No, Aunt Liu has treated me like a mother. How could I abandon Aunt Liu and escape alone? That great one said the restraints would be released after finishing this piece. It won't be long now." Little Xing blew hard on the suona, unhurried.</p><p></p><p>However, just at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thunderclap suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The earth shook.</p><p></p><p>Endless purple light flashed continuously.</p><p></p><p>The entire Red Leaf City, and even the surrounding thousand miles of land, seemed to be covered in purple.</p><p></p><p>The world was a sea of purple.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing's long dress was also dyed purple, and her face showed a shocked and bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>The ground violently shook, and the wine on the table</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Bottles and teacups all fell and shattered into pieces. It could be said that the thunder of Tai Yin resounded, and the vast landscape was a riot of purple and red.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Are true gods battling?"</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from the Red Leaf Tower flew out one after another.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of Huaye City also looked towards the direction where the sound came from.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing continued playing the suona, opened the window, and looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Where did something big happen?" Aunt Liu anxiously asked behind her.</p><p></p><p>"It's... Infinite Mountain, Infinite Mountain... is gone!" Little Xing's eyes widened, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"What? Infinite Mountain is gone, how is that possible!" Aunt Liu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Infinite Mountain was where the Evil God's army camp was stationed, with a Great Venerable guarding it, along with hundreds of Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>Such an Evil God army camp, actually... disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was all struck down by a single bolt of lightning!</p><p></p><p>Was this the work of a supreme expert?</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu was extremely anxious, wishing the restrictions on her body would quickly disappear so she could go see for herself what had happened to Infinite Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"This must be the work of a Great Venerable skilled in lightning techniques, at least at the fifth or sixth step of Heaven Treading!</p><p></p><p>Only someone like that could wipe out Infinite Mountain in one strike!"</p><p></p><p>Aunt Liu was extremely excited, her eyes moist.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, she finally witnessed the royal army taking action against the Evil Gods! How could she not be excited.</p><p></p><p>"Who could it be!" Aunt Liu marveled.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>She played the suona, the sound desolate, crying and laughing at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a lazy voice came from within Huaye City.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're escaping to, little Evil God!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, a handsome young man in cyan robes appeared, with long flowing hair and a blood-red sword on his back.</p><p></p><p>The purple light had not yet dissipated, falling on the cyan-robed man, coating his long robe with a layer of purple.</p><p></p><p>He stood in mid-air, looking extremely noble, like a young Heavenly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>An Evil God's body froze in the air, trapped by Zhu Zhuangshi's embryonic divine domain.</p><p></p><p>His divine apertures operated sluggishly, unable to summon any divine power.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Demon, demon!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you use to destroy the army camp!"</p><p></p><p>This Evil God screamed in terror, trembling, utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>That was Infinite Mountain, where a true god's army camp was stationed.</p><p></p><p>One Great Venerable, over sixty at the third step of Heaven Treading, and over three hundred true gods.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all were engulfed by the lightning.</p><p></p><p>Not a single true god escaped, not even the Great Venerable managed to flee.</p><p></p><p>He had been investigating the followers of the No Food Holy Sect and was not in the camp, which is why he escaped this crisis.</p><p></p><p>He truly did not understand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this Evil God, a smile appearing on his extremely handsome face, looking bewitchingly beautiful under the purple light.</p><p></p><p>"I came... to blast fish."</p><p></p><p>Since killing the Evil Gods of the Feng and Lin countries would bring the siege of the Evil God army camp,</p><p></p><p>To solve this problem, it was simple - eliminate the Evil God army camp in advance, leaving no worries.</p><p></p><p>So, Qi Yuan brought Zhu Zhuangshi to Huaye City and used the Tai Yin Thunder Pearl to blast the Evil God army camp.</p><p></p><p>In the ancestral land, Qi Yuan had obtained a bottle of Tai Yin Thunder Pearls.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Yin Thunder Pearls were used for blasting fish.</p><p></p><p>Among them were eight that could be used to blast Great Venerable level fish.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan used one on Infinite Mountain, limiting the range, and directly blasted away the Evil God army camp.</p><p></p><p>Not a single Evil God escaped.</p><p></p><p>"You, the fish that slipped through the net, should also die."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke softly, his sword unsheathed, instantly slaying the Evil God who had fallen into the embryonic divine domain.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators in Huaye City who witnessed this scene were shaken, their hearts either excited or terrified, or thrilled.</p><p></p><p>Little Xing was stunned, she looked at the majestic man in the sky, her eyes reddening: "It's that guest, it's him... who destroyed Infinite Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>She recalled what Aunt Liu had said, that the guest wanted to kill people, and before killing he wanted to hear the suona.</p><p></p><p>The people he killed were the hundreds of Evil Gods on Infinite Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The suona he heard was played by her personally.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was excited and filled with mixed emotions. Had she known this, she would definitely have played harder, with more heart.</p><p></p><p>To not let down the guest's slaughter of Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Friends of Huaye City, I just came to blast some fish.</p><p></p><p>Those of you eating, continue eating, those flirting, continue flirting, don't mind me.</p><p></p><p>Next time I come, I'll treat you all to a feast."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice spread throughout Huaye City.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he and Zhu Zhuangshi turned into a streak of light and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>There were other Evil God army camps nearby, Qi Yuan had to hurry to blast fish.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't go soon, in case they learned of the news here and scattered, that would be a great loss.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the sky disappeared, the purple light still blanketing the entire city.</p><p></p><p>All the citizens who heard the voice could not shake off the shock in their hearts for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The events of today would definitely be remembered for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Great Venerable looked at the ancient gods before him, unable to contain his anger.</p><p></p><p>"You are very bold, killing all the Evil Gods of the Feng and Lin countries!"</p><p></p><p>Just now, the ancient gods who had carried out the plan to slaughter a hundred gods in one day had returned one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Great Venerable met them and immediately started scolding.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he was complaining about why they didn't persuade Qi Yuan to stop.</p><p></p><p>The twin sister had always been hot-tempered, and she wouldn't tolerate the Thunder Great Venerable: "When the master returns, you go persuade him!"</p><p></p><p>Persuade, they couldn't persuade him.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Great Venerable was furious: "Why hasn't Qi Yuan returned yet, where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Great Venerable was really anxious.</p><p></p><p>At dusk, the Dusk Venerable had brought a group of true gods to provide support.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't even see Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>After half an hour of discussion between the Thunder Great Venerable and the Dusk Venerable and others,</p><p></p><p>They jointly formulated a plan, which was to block the Evil Gods of the Evil God army camp at all costs, and then send the Origin Venerable and the eight gods who had contemplated god-level contemplation methods into the North Sea God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>They were prepared to sacrifice themselves, just waiting for Qi Yuan to return.</p><p></p><p>However, the other ancient gods had all returned, but Qi Yuan had not yet come back.</p><p></p><p>How could the Thunder Great Venerable not be anxious?</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry, the Divine Lord has always been wise, he certainly won't put himself in danger," the ancient god Wang Song spoke.</p><p></p><p>He had unconditional trust in Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"If he doesn't come back soon, I'm afraid what will arrive at Feiwu City will be the Evil God army camp!" The Thunder Great Venerable was very angry.</p><p></p><p>This Origin Venerable was too unreliable, making him worry to death.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought he was reckless enough.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Qi Yuan, his wasn't recklessness!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's was true recklessness!</p><p></p><p>Just back from the ancestral land, he went to hunt Zhang Feng, after killing Zhang Feng, he had a feast, and then traveled thousands of miles to kill over a hundred true gods in the Feng and Lin countries.</p><p></p><p>Now if someone told the Thunder Great Venerable that Qi Yuan had taken these true gods to besiege the Evil God army camp, the Thunder Great Venerable would believe it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

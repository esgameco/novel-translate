        <h1>Chapter 321</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Because what Qi Yuan said was too inexplicable and somewhat crazy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Goat Head looked at a dog demon: "Could it be that you bit him, causing him to go mad?"</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his fear of that mysterious bridal demon, Old Goat Head would have probably already taken action and turned this human boy Qi Yuan into salted meat jerky.</p><p></p><p>"How can you baselessly sully my innocence?" The dog demon was unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly agreed: "What this little dog says is very reasonable, I support it."</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he wasn't mad - it was this Old Goat Head who had epilepsy, slandering him.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Huang looked deeply at Qi Yuan, and finally his gaze fell on Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>In his view, Little Bride was a great demon, while Qi Yuan was merely her puppet.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan spoke, it likely represented the bridal demon's opinion. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps she had also taken an interest in the Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, he didn't pay him any mind at all - just a weak human.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... I'm afraid you'll have to meet with Boss Kun and discuss it with him," Uncle Huang said in a gruff voice, tossing the problem to Boss Kun.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's mind raced.</p><p></p><p>Big substitute meal white moonlight? "Where is Boss Kun?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan very much wanted to meet him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not right now.</p><p></p><p>According to the information obtained, Boss Kun was a Jade Blood realm demon, comparable to a Foundation Establishment great demon.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan only had Qi Refinement realm combat strength.</p><p></p><p>"How could Boss Kun's address be casually revealed?" Uncle Huang snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boss Kun was currently with the Blood Spirit Child, lying low, and would not easily appear.</p><p></p><p>"To ensure the news about the Blood Spirit Child doesn't leak, all the demons present today cannot leave without reason, and must follow my arrangements!" Uncle Huang looked at all the demons, his voice overbearing and domineering.</p><p></p><p>The aura of Blood Qi Perfection spread at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The demons present were about to speak but held back.</p><p></p><p>Old Goat Head took the opportunity to say: "Please don't blame us, this matter is of great importance and concerns all our safety.</p><p></p><p>If the news leaks, I will even kill my nephew Goat Fan, so..."</p><p></p><p>The rest was left unsaid, but the demons present understood Old Goat Head's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"If the news leaks, not only will it bring the Demon Suppression Department to Yunyan County, even my good-for-nothing brother died at human hands!" Uncle Huang's rough voice filled the hall.</p><p></p><p>The brother he spoke of was Fourth Uncle Huang.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, according to the news I got from the yamen, a butcher named Qi Er actually colluded with people from the Demon Suppression Department and framed my brother to death.</p><p></p><p>If I ever encounter this cunning and treacherous human, I'll definitely shove my cane up his ass!" Uncle Huang said with a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>His brother had died at Qi Er's hands.</p><p></p><p>The yamen said Qi Er had a close relationship with the Demon Suppression Department.</p><p></p><p>Connecting the two, his brother must have been killed by the Demon Suppression Department.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, sitting nearby, couldn't stay quiet after hearing this: "Old man, your words are too disgusting.</p><p></p><p>That butcher named Qi Er never colluded with the Demon Suppression Department."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Could it be you know Qi Er?" Uncle Huang's gaze turned sharp.</p><p></p><p>If not for Little Bride's presence, given his personality, he would have seized Qi Yuan right then.</p><p></p><p>"Because... in a sense, I am Qi Er," Qi Yuan said. He had always been honest and trustworthy, never telling lies.</p><p></p><p>This statement shocked everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"So you're actually Qi Er!" Uncle Huang's face reddened with anger.</p><p></p><p>This was too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Little Bride, about to make a move.</p><p></p><p>"So, I have the most right to speak on this matter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Er never colluded with the Demon Suppression Department," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you still quibble. The yamen people personally told me that you, Qi Er, were with people from the Demon Suppression Department! How do you explain this?</p><p></p><p>Don't think you can do whatever you want just because you have a female demon backing you!</p><p></p><p>Colluding with the Demon Suppression Department, demons will kill you for this!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Huang decided that even with the bridal demon protecting this Qi Er, he would still seize him.</p><p></p><p>"How could the yamen people know better than me? I never colluded with the Demon Suppression Department.</p><p></p><p>Your brother also didn't die at the hands of the Demon Suppression Department."</p><p></p><p>"Then whose hands did he die by?" Uncle Huang sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally... by my hands." Qi Yuan smiled faintly, stepping forward, "I'm not pretending anymore, I am the Blood Collector of Ten Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... quickly offer up your essence blood, and I can let you die more easily."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to implement Plan B.</p><p></p><p>The previous Plan A wasted too much glucose.</p><p></p><p>Besides, where would he get glucose from? Too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>It was more convenient to just kill these demons.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he had already obtained the information he needed, so there was no need to pretend anymore.</p><p></p><p>"What!" Uncle Huang's face showed disbelief, then he laughed loudly, "Good, so you two came to cause trouble for me!"</p><p></p><p>The other demons also looked at Qi Yuan at this time, their eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>A human actually threatened them and wanted their blood.</p><p></p><p>Was he seeking death?</p><p></p><p>"I'll hold off this bridal demon, the rest of you chop this human brat to pieces." Uncle Huang shouted loudly, his eyes bursting with ferocious light.</p><p></p><p>Since Old Huai hadn't specifically warned them, it meant the demons who entered were at most similar in strength to him.</p><p></p><p>With so many demons, what was there to fear?</p><p></p><p>The other twenty-odd demons looked at Qi Yuan with gleaming eyes, some burning hot, seemingly just waiting for Uncle Huang to make a move before pouncing all at once.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan was very happy: "Seeing your burning gazes, I'm very glad that with you, my substitute meal white moonlights, we are rushing towards each other!"</p><p></p><p>When it came to feelings, Qi Yuan liked things simple and straightforward.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't like watching romance dramas.</p><p></p><p>In romance dramas, the male and female leads always had all sorts of misunderstandings, not saying what they wanted to say, as if they had no mouths.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he and his substitute meal white moonlights were rushing towards each other.</p><p></p><p>Looking at their lecherous little eyes, they couldn't wait to pounce on Qi Yuan immediately.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan very gratified.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Uncle Huang shouted loudly, fiercely attacking Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>The white bone cane in his hand emitted a burst of blood qi, shaking this space.</p><p></p><p>Within the blood qi was an intense bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>Facing this attack, Qi Yuan swung his cleaver to block.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the white bone and cleaver collided, leaving a huge gap in Qi Yuan's cleaver.</p><p></p><p>His hand also shook.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, there was a big gap between him at the early stage of the Blood Qi realm and Uncle Huang.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you brat are so bold, you actually have Blood Qi realm strength." Uncle Huang's face was full of flesh, looking fierce and evil.</p><p></p><p>However, there was more contempt.</p><p></p><p>Among the demons present, which one didn't have Blood Qi realm strength?</p><p></p><p>"Considering how much you want to rush towards me, I'll let you... pass away more peacefully."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan turned his head and glanced at the obedient Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>He whispered softly: "Little Bride, let's join forces!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he chose to merge with Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, red light flashed in the air.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red armor, bewitching and bizarre, completely covered Qi Yuan's body, leaving only a pair of clear and intelligent eyes exposed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body also grew taller at this moment, becoming a huge behemoth.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red spikes on the shoulders, as bright as blood.</p><p></p><p>The cleaver in his hand also seemed to be dyed red with blood, becoming a blood blade.</p><p></p><p>The demons present were shocked at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster is this?"</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a demon?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this?"</p><p></p><p>The demons present were extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>But before they could think more, the brutal monster in front of them charged towards them.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical power!</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving Sword Drawing Technique!</p><p></p><p>Using two great skills simultaneously, the aura on Qi Yuan's body rose to the extreme at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He leapt up suddenly, swinging the cleaver down.</p><p></p><p>"Rush towards me, substitute meals, white moonlights!"</p><p></p><p>On one side was a terrifying giant with a sci-fi mecha-like style, on the other were Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio style demons like yellow weasels and old mountain goats.</p><p></p><p>The two collided violently in this hall.</p><p></p><p>The first to rush towards Qi Yuan was naturally the rooster spirit he had long coveted.</p><p></p><p>The blood blade struck the rooster spirit's head, instantly slicing off its comb and mangling its entire face, killing it immediately.</p><p></p><p>With Little Bride's empowerment, Qi Yuan displayed terrifying strength with martial arts alone.</p><p></p><p>Boosted by two great skills, one slash killed three substitute meal white moonlights.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other demons' faces were filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>"Monster!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>But the battle had already begun, and there was no room for them to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they had no idea that what they faced was far more than just a monster!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no martial techniques, but... his combat skills far surpassed these demons.</p><p></p><p>In Tianjue, he had honed himself for who knows how long.</p><p></p><p>Although without martial techniques he couldn't fully utilize his martial strength,</p><p></p><p>Crushing these low-level demons was still effortless.</p><p></p><p>It was like a divine infant reincarnate easily slaughtering Qi Refinement cultivators without using spells.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored butcher's knife, empowered by the Heaven-Cleaving Sword Drawing Technique...</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Invincible in all directions.</p><p></p><p>With one slash of his knife, three more demon creatures fell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's entire body was blood-red, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was brutal and domineering, each strike of his knife unstoppable. </p><p></p><p>None of the demons present could match him even for a single exchange.</p><p></p><p>Even Old Man Huang's eyes were filled with deep fear.</p><p></p><p>That human's own strength was clearly only at the early Blood Qi realm. Even merged with the wedding dress demon to become a monster, he was still only at the mid Blood Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet the battle prowess he displayed moved even him.</p><p></p><p>Without martial techniques, relying only on skill, to be able to reach this level... how was this possible? As demon after demon around him fell, Old Man Huang's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>He knew that at this point, he had to step up.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Boss Kun's plan would be ruined.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Boss Kun would not spare him, and he would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good, forcing me to this point, you're the first!"</p><p></p><p>The white bone cane in Old Man Huang's hand grew larger at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the blood in his body also began to boil at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious Demon Grinding Slash! Old Man Huang gathered all his strength to unleash the Jade Blood level martial technique gifted to him by Boss Kun.</p><p></p><p>Jade Blood level techniques were far more powerful than Blood Qi level techniques.</p><p></p><p>This kind of power, tyrannical to the extreme, was simply not something a Blood Qi realm martial artist could withstand.</p><p></p><p>A look of slight surprise flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "It seems I underestimated you NPCs, this technique... is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even Qi Yuan sensed a faint threat from Old Man Huang's attack.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly raised his cleaver, his huge form pressing forward, the cleaver blocking the white bone cane.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The cleaver shattered.</p><p></p><p>However, the blood-red light remained, blocking Old Man Huang's strike.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Blood level technique was extremely sharp and destructive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's cleaver crumbled completely into powder under the strain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was full of reminiscence: "This strike of yours is just like an old acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he also burst my blood vessels!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, capillaries.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people might burst many capillaries just from scrubbing while bathing.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you're my ideal love, it turns out the ideal loves in my heart are all similar."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't waste any more words.</p><p></p><p>He could block even Jade Blood level techniques, so Old Man Huang had no other way to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Now he transformed into a huge grim reaper, constantly reaping the lives of these demon creatures in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Tables shattered, dried human flesh fell, the roof was torn open, demon after demon rushed at Qi Yuan from both sides.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan moved through them as if unimpeded, killing, killing, killing, chopping, chopping, chopping.</p><p></p><p>No demon was his match even for a single exchange.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ended his fusion with Little Wedding Dress and stood among the corpses, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why am I so weak, just fighting for this short while and my internal Blood Martial energy is used up."</p><p></p><p>Blood Martial Artists consume their internal Blood Martial energy when fighting.</p><p></p><p>Battling these demons, Qi Yuan's Blood Martial energy was depleted.</p><p></p><p>Now relying only on martial arts, if he encountered another Old Man Huang, he would be finished.</p><p></p><p>"But the harvest was bountiful, these substitute ideal loves of mine... are quite generous."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very happy.</p><p></p><p>Before him, a total of 125 drops of demon essence blood had condensed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing they didn't listen to my Plan A, otherwise it would have been such a waste of glucose."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a deep breath, thinking of many things.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Huang's Jade Blood level technique left a deep impression in his memory.</p><p></p><p>If a Jade Blood realm demon had used this technique, it would have been somewhat difficult for him to deal with just based on his in-game abilities.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to level up."</p><p></p><p>"System, come out!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan didn't actually have a system.</p><p></p><p>But he could do his own voiceover, pretending to be his system.</p><p></p><p>"You consumed 25 drops of demon essence blood, your Blood Martial energy has been replenished and enhanced again."</p><p></p><p>"The Shocking Sky Technique operates rapidly, continuously condensing Blood Martial energy inside your body. You break through to the mid Blood Qi realm."</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly, you seem to have an insight, as if understanding the true essence of the Shocking Sky Technique. With this realization, the essence blood is fully consumed."</p><p></p><p>"You consume another 50 drops of demon essence blood. You suddenly realize the key to the Shocking Sky Technique lies in 'shock' - striking out to 'shock' the enemy can compensate for your own Blood Martial energy.</p><p></p><p>You modify the Shocking Sky Technique, completely transforming it.</p><p></p><p>You ponder deeply, the demon essence blood is fully consumed, and you finally step into the Blood Qi Great Perfection realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished his voiceover and a smug expression appeared on his face: "Now, even without Little Wedding Dress, I can easily cut down all these ideal loves."</p><p></p><p>His words sounded just like that Longyang from some TV show.</p><p></p><p>He kept fifty drops of demon essence blood, not consuming them further.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate from the Blood Qi realm to the Jade Blood realm, fifty drops of demon essence blood was not enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his understanding of Blood Martial Artists was not deep enough.</p><p></p><p>Using the demon essence blood now would be somewhat inefficient.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, Qi Yuan sensed a hint of threat.</p><p></p><p>He saw a white figure approaching in the night sky in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The white figure was humanoid, with disheveled hair, its appearance indiscernible.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan's eyes could not see any useful information.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could tell at a glance that the human was a Jade Blood realm martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Blood realm was comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He himself was now only comparable to a peak Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The white figure suddenly paused in mid-air, seeing the corpses in the courtyard. A flash of clarity passed through its crazed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the white figure burst into laughter, its voice miserable: "All dead, all dead, hahaha."</p><p></p><p>The white figure laughed loudly, but tears flowed from its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was insane, crashing left and right, knocking down many of the abandoned courtyard's walls.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if you have a mental illness, you should stay at home properly, don't go out hurting people," Qi Yuan kindly advised.</p><p></p><p>He hated seeing mentally ill people relying on their illness to do bad things every day while avoiding legal punishment.</p><p></p><p>Although he also relied on a mental illness certificate to escape punishment.</p><p></p><p>But he was different, his mental illness was fake.</p><p></p><p>The insane man's figure paused again. He stared at Qi Yuan, muttering: "Yunyun County will be gone, leave quickly, leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>The sea water is inky black, murderous energy pervades, no one can survive."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the insane man staggered and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He didn't just run away normally, but used some martial technique to vanish.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this person is so pitiful, his mental illness is too severe," Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare imagine, if his mental illness certificate was real and he actually had a mental illness, what would he do? Could it be... he could only become a live-in son-in-law?</p><p></p><p>About a few dozen breaths of time passed as Qi Yuan was still recovering his strength.</p><p></p><p>At this time, another whooshing sound came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Qi Yuan, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao, leading a tracking dog, appeared in the courtyard with a man in black tight-fitting clothes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the demon corpses in the courtyard, their eyes revealed shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because these demons were all Blood Qi realm, and there was even one at Blood Qi Great Perfection.</p><p></p><p>The man in black clothes lowered his head, his eyes full of fear as he looked at Qi Yuan: "You're very lucky, that madman probably still retained a bit of sanity, so he only killed these demons without killing you."</p><p></p><p>The man in black clothes and An Qiao had come here secretly following that white-robed madman from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Now in this courtyard, with so many demon corpses still warm, it was obviously that madman who had killed them.</p><p></p><p>A Jade Blood realm expert facing Blood Qi realm opponents would completely slaughter them.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, a newcomer, he hadn't even considered the possibility it was his doing.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao beside him also smiled: "Look how weak you are, encountering such a big scene on your first mission, you must be both scared and excited, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, can you help me with something?" Seeing the two of them, Qi Yuan wanted to ask for help again.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I was having a party here with these ideal loves, but I accidentally killed them all. I feel bad about it, can you help me bury them? Otherwise their corpses here will stink and pollute the environment.</p><p></p><p>Protecting the environment is everyone's responsibility."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were very disjointed, ordinary people simply couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao was stunned: "What are you saying, you killed the demons?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't joke around!" The man in black clothes also widened his eyes, unable to react for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "Saying 'killed' is inauspicious, this is called mutual pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Look, they were so selflessly devoted that even in death, they left their essence blood for me."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he waved his hand and the remaining fifty drops of demon essence blood appeared.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao and the man in black clothes were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Happy New Year's Eve on the 30th day of the lunar year!

        <h1>Chapter 443</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor left, leaving only Qi Yuan alone in the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>He set up all the formations again. </p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't want to be seen by an old man anytime, anywhere.</p><p></p><p>"So, I need to get an offensive-type treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"And comprehend some supreme principle?"</p><p></p><p>"Then practice the Ancestor Blood Technique to the highest level, or cultivate from the Purple Palace to the Great Principle, in order to contend with that person from Tai Huang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, none of these things were simple.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak. Without the Black Magic Ancestor Blood, it would take at least 70 years to fully cultivate the Ancestor Blood Technique."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt guilty and ashamed. </p><p></p><p>On Blue Star, he could collect retirement benefits after 70 years.</p><p></p><p>"What about an offensive-type treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Lord Tian's Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner has killed too many, it needs to be purified and undergo socialist transformation! If Sadako can become the people's Sadako, why can't the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner become my Human Emperor Banner?"</p><p></p><p>"If it were a person, I wouldn't bother transforming it, to respect free will. </p><p></p><p>But since it's an unconscious treasure, there's no such concern."</p><p></p><p>Many ideas arose in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"My Human Emperor Banner, you have suffered."</p><p></p><p>"It's all because I'm too weak and couldn't save you from danger earlier."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me, I will come to save you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had one more reason to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>"As someone with high EQ, I should first familiarize myself with my Human Emperor Banner before that."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's current strength, he could only swallow his anger, unable to go take the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner from Ghost Lord Tian.</p><p></p><p>But he had Mona's replica of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, which he could use to get some insights.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, Qi Yuan examined it carefully.</p><p></p><p>[Ten Thousand Soul Banner, devours the souls of all living beings, refines soul users. There are several loopholes. If all the soul users within are changed to spirits of the Heavenly Dao, its power can increase over a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>When killing living beings, stimulating their desires and provoking emotions can also increase its power. </p><p></p><p>Kill...]</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm a good person."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used a spell to wash his eyes with water.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to wash his brain to forget this memory.</p><p></p><p>But he was afraid water would get into his head and affect his smart brain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always knew he was just an ordinary Blue Star person who worked hard to get rich, with 5000 years of fine traditions.</p><p></p><p>He knew he couldn't resist temptation and was afraid of going astray by practicing an enhanced version of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>So he simply washed his eyes to forget these things.</p><p></p><p>"It seems from today on, I need to look at the Ten Thousand Soul Banner and the Demon Luo Well every day to refresh the information."</p><p></p><p>The hidden information Qi Yuan's eyes saw was different each natural day.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this could be exploited by going to a world with faster time flow.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan felt there was no need for now.</p><p></p><p>A month quickly passed.</p><p></p><p>During this month, progress on the Black Magic Ancestor Blood was slow. The Black Magic Ancestor Blood had disappeared from the few locations discovered.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor Blood Technique also stagnated.</p><p></p><p>The only good news was that in this month, he gained more understanding of treasures.</p><p></p><p>He also had a tiny bit of an idea on how to modify the Ten Thousand Soul Banner into the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>There were infinite resentful spirits in the Ten Thousand Soul Banner. If purified with great magical power, it might be possible to transform it into the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>"So after successfully refining the Human Emperor Banner, if I kill enemies and keep their souls, I need to use the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra to brainwash them, no, educate and reform them."</p><p></p><p>After reforming them, take them to see a doctor, the kind that still drools after being cured.</p><p></p><p>"These cultivators in the Upper Realm... White Moonlight is really too good."</p><p></p><p>"The remnant souls enter my Human Emperor Banner to serve."</p><p></p><p>"The bodies enter the underworld to become fertilizer."</p><p></p><p>"The spirit stones and techniques in their storage bags are mine to spend!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is very frugal, just like me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After thinking, he sent some messages to Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to this Principle Discourse Conference?"</p><p></p><p>The Principle Discourse Conference was about to begin, and Qi Yuan was about to set off.</p><p></p><p>In recent days, he had also obtained permission to use treasures through Purple Origin Ancestor, and could chat with Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in the Demon Abyss, I can't go." Jin Li's tone carried disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Will that Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable of yours go?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Moon Gathering Heavenly Venerable of Moon God Palace told Qi Yuan that Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable would attend the Principle Discourse Conference.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Token left by Master Ruan Yixi for Qi Yuan was related to the previous generation's Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>To learn news of his master, he could only ask Moon Radiance Heavenly Venerable or Moon God Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, she's already set off." Jin Li replied, and added, "Your identity... don't reveal it."</p><p></p><p>She was referring to the Ten Suns Heavenly Venerable identity.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't."</p><p></p><p>Ending the conversation, Qi Yuan turned his gaze to the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the stronger one's power, the longer it takes to load a new game."</p><p></p><p>But it was fine, the game had loaded over half, probably wouldn't take long to enter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was looking forward to the new game.</p><p></p><p>And that... strange being that never spoke, only emitting soundless voices.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... blind?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why was it mute like this? Speak of the devil, Qi Yuan heard the soundless voice again.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a joyful emotion in it.</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you some good news, I'll probably come play your game after a while. Then we'll see if I can get the Sudden and Abrupt Emperors to open your aperture?"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Qi Yuan regretted it.</p><p></p><p>It sounded a bit inauspicious, as Chaos perished after opening its aperture.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, bye bye."</p><p></p><p>He should also pack up and head to Black Magic Heaven to gather for the Principle Discourse Conference.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the great hall of Black Magic Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The inside and outside were clearly separated.</p><p></p><p>Only fifteen disciples had gathered outside. These fifteen were the most talented disciples of Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword wore blue robes. He looked towards the inner hall, his gaze filled with surging fighting spirit: "I hope next time, I'll be in the inner hall, not the outer hall."</p><p></p><p>Those seated in the inner hall were all Yang Spirit realm cultivators, including Black Sword, that genius.</p><p></p><p>"It would be better if this Principle Discourse Conference was held later. Sister might be sitting inside then." Purple Origin Great Snow said.</p><p></p><p>Among these fifteen disciples, only two were from Purple Origin Heaven - Qi Yuan and Purple Origin Great Snow.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is equal. Cow Horn Sister, if you want to go in and sit now, you can sit wherever you want." Qi Yuan couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>"Can sister sit her big butt on your head?" Purple Origin Great Snow's words were as annoying as ever.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Purple Origin Great Snow's perky buttocks, not wanting to answer, silently noting it down.</p><p></p><p>"Also, don't call me Cow Horn Sister anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"I changed my name. I'm thinking of calling myself Black Robe or Blood Sword. Which do you think is better?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was a bit confused, unable to follow Cow Horn Sister's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>"Look, our Black Magic Abyss has two peerless geniuses in the younger generation, named Black Sword and Blood Robe. There's also a filler called Ice Sword. Do you notice anything?" Purple Origin Great Snow asked.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword in the distance glanced at Purple Origin Great Snow, wanting to speak but stopping himself, finally deciding to act as if nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>This Purple Origin Great Snow was like Blood Robe, best not to get involved with her, or one would lose face.</p><p></p><p>"What commonalities?" Qi Yuan didn't know he had anything in common with Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Black and red are both colors. Sword and robe are both objects. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that your talents are so high because your names are too fitting?"</p><p></p><p>So Purple Origin Great</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Snow had just named them Black Robe and Blood Sword.</p><p></p><p>"..." Qi Yuan decided to ignore Purple Edge Big Snow. She was being a bit too abstract.</p><p></p><p>But Purple Edge Big Snow was very enthusiastic: "Blood Robe, how did you get enough achievements to participate in the Ultimate Reasoning Conference? Did you get in through the back door?"</p><p></p><p>Purple Edge Big Snow was blunt, and her question immediately attracted the attention of many talented young people present.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe had only joined Black Magic Abyss for a short time, so logically he should have missed this Ultimate Reasoning Conference.</p><p></p><p>When Anxun Lu learned that Blood Robe had a spot this time, she was so angry she couldn't sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Although you've been very diligent lately, taking on tasks every day, even if you completed them all... it shouldn't be enough, right?" Purple Edge Big Snow asked curiously. </p><p></p><p>She asked very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>If someone else had asked, Qi Yuan would probably have suspected malicious intent, trying to make things difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>But since it was Purple Edge Big Snow asking, it was quite reasonable. </p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had spent so much time in Purple Edge Heaven that he found he could... crown himself as having the highest EQ in Purple Edge Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"It's because I've cultivated the Ancestral Blood Scripture to a high level," Qi Yuan replied sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on the Ancestral Blood Scripture alone, it would probably need to be at the sixth or seventh layer. Senior Brother Blood Robe just came to Purple Edge Heaven, could you already be at the sixth or seventh layer?" </p><p></p><p>A male cultivator couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Robe seemed to have only been in Purple Edge Heaven for about a year.</p><p></p><p>In that year, even Black Sword had only reached the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>It just didn't add up.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth or seventh layer? You're underestimating me too much. I'm already at the eleventh layer," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the whole place fell silent, everyone looking at Qi Yuan with exasperated expressions.</p><p></p><p>Eleventh layer?...</p><p></p><p>He really dared to say that!</p><p></p><p>Why not just claim to be an Ultimate Reason cultivator?</p><p></p><p>In the current Black Magic Abyss, those who had cultivated the Ancestral Blood Scripture to the eleventh layer probably numbered less than twenty.</p><p></p><p>Among those twenty, the lowest realm was Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>No one believed him and took it as a joke.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Purple Edge Big Snow smiled, "Hurry up and reach the fifteenth layer and take care of that person. I wash my butt every day, waiting to be your concubine."</p><p></p><p>"Vulgar woman, don't call me Blood Sword, you're sullying my surname!" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He really had no way to deal with someone like Purple Edge Big Snow.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came, sounding rather gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"For this Ultimate Reasoning Conference, I, Withered Glory, will be the main envoy, and Black Sword will be the deputy envoy. </p><p></p><p>Since you have all arrived, follow me together!"</p><p></p><p>A sinister, hunchbacked old man approached, with an aura as vast as the sea.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is so pretentious, he's clearly a Heavenly Venerable but still hunches his back," Purple Edge Big Snow transmitted to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I think he walks quite steadily. Didn't your big butt want to find a place to sit? Why not sit on his back?" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Soul Heaven where Withered Glory Heavenly Venerable was from did not have a very good relationship with Purple Edge Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Yin Soul Heaven was also the force that was friendly with Tai Huang Palace and at war with Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, why don't you go sit?" Purple Edge Big Snow rolled her eyes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I respect my elders," Qi Yuan transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"That's the funniest joke I've heard today," Purple Edge Big Snow replied.</p><p></p><p>Amidst a chorus of exchanges, over ten Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables and over ten young talents entered the protective formation together.</p><p></p><p>This protective formation combined defense, travel, and attack in one, and could even enter transmission formations.</p><p></p><p>Black Magic Abyss relied on this formation for travel.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Yang Spirits all closed their eyes to rest, sitting to one side, separated from these young talents.</p><p></p><p>After all, who among them had not been a young talent in the past?</p><p></p><p>Only Black Sword, dressed in white robes with a refined demeanor, conversed with these young talents and answered questions.</p><p></p><p>"The Ultimate Reasoning Conference is not just about Ultimate Reasoning. There are also Heavenly Position Reasoning Conferences, Yang Spirit Reasoning Conferences, Yin Spirit Reasoning Conferences. These reasoning conferences will all be held before the Ultimate Reasoning Conference.</p><p></p><p>If you're interested, you can go to the Mythical level and Heavenly Position level ones first for exchanges."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword said calmly, his voice giving people a feeling of spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He was currently at the Purple Palace realm and hadn't yet decided how to proceed on the Yin Spirit path.</p><p></p><p>This was a perfect opportunity to go listen and perhaps have his clever mind captured by something.</p><p></p><p>He had already planned to first attend the Yin Spirit Reasoning Conference to understand the Yin Spirit way, then go to the Ultimate Reason Wall to comprehend Great Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>A full schedule.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Black Sword, our Black Magic Abyss clan has strong bloodlines but average enlightenment. If one day we have the chance to go to the Ultimate Reason Wall, what should we do if we only comprehend the lowest level of Ultimate Reason?" asked a young talent who looked very muscular.</p><p></p><p>His brain clearly wasn't very bright.</p><p></p><p>"Then work hard to cultivate to the Great Ultimate Reason realm. Once you reach the Great Ultimate Reason realm, apart from Supreme Ultimate Reason, the grades of other Ultimate Reasons have almost no impact on combat power," Black Sword said calmly. "There's not much difference between Heaven grade and Yellow grade."</p><p></p><p>Below Supreme Ultimate Reason, all beings are equal.</p><p></p><p>At the Minor Ultimate Reason realm, the Yellow, Dark, Earth, and Heaven grades of Ultimate Reason could still affect combat power.</p><p></p><p>But by the Great Ultimate Reason realm, the difference was almost negligible. No one could kill anyone else, and without an offensive-type creation treasure, they couldn't even injure each other.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Black Sword has extraordinary talent and will surely comprehend Supreme Ultimate Reason. I wonder which type Senior Brother Black Sword plans to comprehend?" a young cultivator asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The other young talents looked on with envy.</p><p></p><p>Even Ice Sword looked at Black Sword with a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Because Black Sword was the only talent in Black Magic Abyss who had hope of comprehending Supreme Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>Even Blood Robe, in their eyes, would probably max out at Great Ultimate Reason and be unable to comprehend Supreme Ultimate Reason.</p><p></p><p>"Absolute, unchanging through the ages, eternal law; Unique, unifying all things, supreme above all;</p><p>Cyclical, endlessly turning, coming full circle; Innate, origin of all things, primordial true nature.</p><p></p><p>Innate places too much emphasis on bloodline. My bloodline has nothing to do with the innate, so I fear I have no chance with it.</p><p></p><p>The cyclical path is mysterious and unpredictable. The slightest mistake in construction leads to death of body and destruction of the Dao. It seems no one in the Six Heavens has walked the cyclical path yet, so there are no examples to follow.</p><p></p><p>The unique and absolute paths are great Daos, and one should choose between them." Black Sword answered seriously without concealing anything.</p><p></p><p>Among those in the Six Heavens who had comprehended Supreme Ultimate Reason, most were absolute or unique.</p><p></p><p>The one from Tai Huang Palace was the Unique Great Sun.</p><p></p><p>Moon God Monarch was a rare Innate Supreme Yin.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan had a sudden thought: "Is it possible for someone to comprehend all four at once?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, everyone present fell silent, looking at Qi Yuan like he was an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Was this even a human question? There were countless trillions of beings in the Six Heavens, yet those who had comprehended Supreme Ultimate Reason numbered less than ten.</p><p></p><p>Asking this question was like a high school boy asking a teacher, "Can I win the NBA championship, women's gymnastics gold medal, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and World Go Championship all at the same time?"</p><p></p><p>Black Sword glanced at Qi Yuan and pondered seriously: "Theoretically... it's possible."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, theoretically anything is possible.</p><p></p><p>Although there were no such examples, it could still be unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Since it's theoretically possible, that means it's possible.</p><p>Oh my, it's so difficult! How many Supreme Ultimate Reasons should I comprehend this time? It's too hard to decide. My clever brain is going to suffer again!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh. "I'll need to eat an extra meal tonight, have an extra egg to supplement my nutrition."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>A moment of dead silence, everyone looking exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you have Ice Sword big brother lay an egg for you? He has ice phoenix bloodline, eggs he lays would be very nutritious." In the end, it was Purple Edge Big Snow who broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have any education? You're calling him Ice Sword big brother, how can a brother lay eggs!" Qi Yuan felt he had scored a point back.</p><p></p><p>This Purple Edge Big Snow was uneducated. How could males lay eggs? It had to be females.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple, I have a Dao technique that can make men lay eggs!" Purple Edge Big Snow said.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword: "..."</p><p></p><p>He had already tried very hard to stay far away from these two people.</p><p></p><p>But still...</p><p></p><p>Everyone else looked at Ice Sword with pitying and amused expressions.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

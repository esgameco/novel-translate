        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A strange look flashed in Elder Mo Hui's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've seen such an interesting little bug," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly... gave you this courage?"</p><p></p><p>As Elder Mo Hui spoke, the aura of a Yin God spread out.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between a Yin God and a Purple Palace cultivator is divine spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>A Yin God has already transformed the spiritual power in their body into divine spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>It is something more advanced than primordial divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>A single strand of divine spiritual power can casually create a forbidden zone.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Envoy nearby saw this scene and was unable to move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan shouted to the sky: "Ning Tao, save me!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, Qi Yuan used the Great Summoning Technique!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he chose to rely on someone else's power! The spiritual energy in his body was not enough to summon the projection of a fixed star.</p><p></p><p>However, summoning Ning Tao's projection was possible.</p><p></p><p>For his first time relying on someone else's power, Qi Yuan was very excited and full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Cheerful suona music played a light melody.</p><p></p><p>The sun in the sky seemed to flash with light.</p><p></p><p>Space seemed to freeze, time seemed to stop.</p><p></p><p>Under everyone's gaze, a woman in a black dress appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>She had a face that could enchant all living beings, with skin as white as snow, so fair it was excessive, like the most exquisite porcelain in the world.</p><p></p><p>Her petite figure and long black hair cascading like a waterfall at night, her left eye pure as a light rain, like a lively spring maiden, her right eye deep and alluring, like a yandere goddess of the night.</p><p></p><p>A profound and powerful aura emanated from her, like that of a deity.</p><p></p><p>Is this the Blood Robed Sword God's trump card?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya instantly understood - the Blood Robed Sword God and that Yin Goddess must have a close relationship, she may even be the Yin Goddess's most valued descendant.</p><p></p><p>"Second Step of Treading the Heavens!" Elder Mo Hui's pupils contracted, sensing a threat.</p><p></p><p>He had only reached the First Step of Treading the Heavens, with just three divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>But the other party was a terrifying existence at the Second Step of Treading the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Her strength was at least ten times his own.</p><p></p><p>Lower level cultivators may be able to fight above their level.</p><p></p><p>But which of those who have cultivated to the realm of Yin God is not a true genius?</p><p></p><p>With one less divine aperture opened than the opponent, it's very difficult to make up the difference in combat power through other means.</p><p></p><p>This gap of a full small realm makes it impossible to fight above one's level.</p><p></p><p>Even young Great Venerable Ones have no record of fighting above their level.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to escape.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's voice came: "Ning Tao, quickly help me kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"Husband, please wait a moment!" Ning Tao spoke, waving her delicate hand.</p><p></p><p>Elder Mo Hui, who had originally wanted to escape, was instantly imprisoned in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Jiang Ya was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>What did this goddess... call the Blood Robed Sword God? Husband???</p><p></p><p>Wasn't she supposed to be the Blood Robed Sword God's ancestor? How did they become partners?</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword God, a mere Purple Palace cultivator, actually snagged a Second Step Yin God as a wife?</p><p></p><p>This is too...</p><p></p><p>She was a bit confused as she watched the battle unfold before her.</p><p></p><p>"No!" At this moment, Elder Mo Hui roared, the divine spiritual power in all three of his divine apertures constantly circulating, trying to break through this imprisonment.</p><p></p><p>However, his divine spiritual power, compared to Ning Tao's projection, was not even one-tenth as strong.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the two was greater than that between a late-stage Nascent Soul and an early-stage Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>A difference of a major realm.</p><p></p><p>His divine spiritual power was as weak as a mountain spring to Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao merely pointed a finger, and he was locked in place.</p><p></p><p>"You can't kill me, my elder brother is also at the Second Step of Treading the Heavens!" Seeing that he couldn't break free, Elder Mo Hui quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't speak, but looked at Qi Yuan, leaning against his chest like a little bird: "Husband... how should we deal with him?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya, watching this scene from afar, had a look of disbelief in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The lofty Yin God was like a girl in love.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan helplessly played with Ning Tao's hair.</p><p></p><p>The last time she appeared, when no one was around, she called him "little blood pearl".</p><p></p><p>This time, with many people present, she called him "husband".</p><p></p><p>How could he not understand a young girl's thoughts? Looking at Ning Tao's beautiful snow-white face, he muttered: "So this is what it feels like to rely on someone else's power... it really feels... great."</p><p></p><p>After muttering, he looked at Elder Mo Hui and said arrogantly: "Your elder brother is a Yin God, my... wife is also a Yin God!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps to show off, he called Ning Tao his wife for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's left eye was full of tender affection, with a maiden's shyness, while her right eye was coquettish and alluring, her face tinged with a rosy hue.</p><p></p><p>Elder Mo Hui was confused by Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Our Mo Luo clan has five Yin Gods coming this time..."</p><p></p><p>"My wife is a Yin God!"</p><p></p><p>"Two at the Second Step of Treading the Heavens, three..."</p><p></p><p>"My wife is a Yin God!" Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>No matter what Mo Hui said, he blocked it with this sentence, appearing extremely smug.</p><p></p><p>"You are not from the Wangyue Continent, why must you go to war with our Mo Luo clan for the sake of the Wangyue Continent? </p><p></p><p>The three Venerable Ones from your Canglan Realm have already reached an agreement with us to divide the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>If you spare me, our Mo Luo clan can give you one-third of the territory of the Wangyue Continent!" Elder Mo Hui was still trying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression turned cold: "How ridiculous, the Wangyue Continent was mine to begin with, how can you give it to me!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he couldn't persuade Qi Yuan, Elder Mo Hui turned to Ning Tao: "The dispute between the Mo Luo clan and the Wangyue Continent involves... two Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>Senior, cultivating to the Second Step of Treading the Heavens is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>One day, senior will become a Great Venerable One and ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>Why offend our Mo Luo clan and the... Yang God behind us over these small matters?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Elder Mo Hui brought out his trump card.</p><p></p><p>The dispute between the Mo Luo clan and the Wangyue Continent was merely a continuation of the conflict between two Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Mo Luo clan actually had no connection to that Yang God, not even counting as direct subordinates. He was just using it to intimidate Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't even look at Elder Mo Hui, her eyes were fixed on Qi Yuan the whole time.</p><p></p><p>Her projection had limited time, every minute and second was precious.</p><p></p><p>"Using a Yang God to scare me? If you have the ability, tell him to come down and chop me!" If Qi Yuan could be scared by such threats, he wouldn't be Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Besides, it's not so easy for a Yang God to descend to the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!" Qi Yuan embraced Ning Tao and said softly.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>Elder Mo Hui, who was already imprisoned, underwent a terrifying transformation.</p><p></p><p>His bloated fat turned withered, all the scales on his body became dry and cracked.</p><p></p><p>His appearance changed from youthful to elderly in an instant.</p><p></p><p>His turbid eyes revealed an expression of disbelief: "Divine realm seed..."</p><p></p><p>His aura completely extinguished at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A mighty Yin God, capable of destroying an entire nation's continent, just like that... perished.</p><p></p><p>He died simply and cleanly.</p><p></p><p>As if it wasn't a deity who died, but a mortal.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present felt shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had seen a battle between Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>They had thought it would be a battle that darkened the sun and moon, shattered mountains and rivers, but the result was... too simple.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Envoy from before also widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>What happened today was beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Tao's figure also became more ethereal.</p><p></p><p>"Husband... call me next time you encounter a strong enemy!" Her eyes were full of attachment. After saying this, her projection completely dissipated, and she returned to the fixed star's Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>She came like wind and rain, and left like dust.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a faint emptiness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Silence fell around them, even the suona stopped playing. They were all shocked by the battle just now.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Great Wisdom True Lord couldn't help but say: "Senior is truly talented, to actually have a divine wife."</p><p></p><p>If his own partner hadn't passed away early, he would probably be unable to resist asking the Blood Robed Sword God how to find a divine wife.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was silent, then said worriedly: "Senior still needs to be careful, the Mo Luo clan has more than one Yin God, and there are two at the Second Step of Treading the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's concern was not unfounded.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword God's partner was just one Yin God.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, two fists are hard-pressed against four hands. The Mo Luo clan lost one Yin God, but still had four Yin Gods, with strong power.</p><p></p><p>"I have a plan that can solve senior's predicament," Great Wisdom True Lord said seriously. "As long as senior finds a few more divine partners, and calls them all over when encountering enemies, what is there to fear from the Mo Luo clan?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt it made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>Although he was relying on someone else's power now, it doesn't mean he'll do so for his whole life.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he would completely take control of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would be the true ruler of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Rest for half an hour, then we'll continue to exterminate the Mo Luo!" Qi Yuan looked at Elder Mo Hui's corpse, and also glanced at the five Purple Palace cultivators who had long been shattered by the aftershocks.</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when Ning Tao killed Elder Mo Hui, he noticed that his game jade slip underwent a slight change.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was cleaning up the battlefield, Qi Yuan came alone to a secluded place.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness sank into the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A new game icon has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his excitement dissipated considerably.</p><p></p><p>"It's only downloaded less than a quarter?"</p><p></p><p>The good news was that the game icon had appeared, the bad news was that less than a quarter had been downloaded.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, using his clever mind: "Could it be that I... or Ning Tao need to kill Yin spirits to help this game download?"</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the game icon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several male voices reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"God, it's not that we don't want to offer you tributes, it's just that our Qingshui Village is so poor!"</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, Village Chief Yu Lu led us to steal water from the neighboring village, but the chief's divine infant was bitten by the neighboring village chief. Alas, when will this kind of life end?"</p><p></p><p>"In this day and age, we should worship new gods instead of ancient ones!"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit new gods, those are man-eating gods!"</p><p></p><p>"Gods may eat people, but at least they protect the four directions. But what about the ones you worship... Ancient gods have long since... declined. You pray devoutly every day, but do they respond?"</p><p></p><p>"Wah, it must be because we had no offerings and starved the god to death."</p><p></p><p>"Oh Shen Tu, Shen Tu, listen to me, change to a new god like our village!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened to these bewildering conversations.</p><p></p><p>"So, is this the background for the new game?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient gods, and man-eating new gods.</p><p></p><p>But... what did they mean by divine infant village chief? Could divine infant cultivators hold official positions and become village chiefs now?</p><p></p><p>And why did the village chief still need to steal water?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered but couldn't make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>As he listened to the conversation, he suddenly said: "I am the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, those who believe in me shall gain eternal life!"</p><p></p><p>In a distant world, in a remote village.</p><p></p><p>The sleeping Shen Tu opened his eyes wide, looking at the dilapidated statue in the temple with a suspicious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it the Foxtail Grass God, how did it become the Primordial Heavenly Venerable?" He was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Had the god's mind gone bad from hunger?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Snow was falling, covering the capital of the Moon Dynasty in silver.</p><p></p><p>The branches and trunks of the ancient Qi Chun trees were piled with snow.</p><p></p><p>A young girl, appearing six or seven years old, wore a goose-white fox fur coat. She sat on a blue stone, resting with her eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a woman in white appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>The young girl opened her eyes: "How is the situation?"</p><p></p><p>"High Priestess, behind that Blood Robe Sword God is a Yin spirit at the second step of Treading Heaven. Not long ago, that Yin spirit took action and killed the Demon Convergence Venerable." The woman in white was a Yin spirit who had encountered Qi Yuan once before.</p><p></p><p>Despite being a Yin spirit, her attitude towards the girl before her was extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess looked at July Lake in front of her, her gaze clear.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white spoke earnestly at this time: "High Priestess, even with one more ally at the second step of Treading Heaven, it won't change the outcome.</p><p></p><p>The Moon-Gazing Continent... can no longer be defended. We must leave."</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess's young face was childlike, but her gaze was determined: "We can't leave now, I'm waiting for someone."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman in white took a long time before saying: "The one the High Priestess is waiting for, should be that Faceless Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess didn't answer, but this also represented the answer.</p><p></p><p>"After tens of thousands of years, if the Faceless Sword God hadn't perished, he would have come here long ago."</p><p></p><p>"I've already been sitting here for five thousand years, a few more years won't matter.</p><p></p><p>I've never seen him before, I want to know if he's really as legendary as they say..." Infinite longing welled up in the young girl's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she seemed to think of something and couldn't help but ask: "Who do you think is more powerful, the Blood Robe Sword God or the Faceless Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman in white was quite helpless towards her young mistress, and couldn't help but smile bitterly: "Whoever the High Priestess thinks is more powerful, that's who is more powerful."</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword God's wife is only at the second step of Treading Heaven, in this regard, he can't compare to the Faceless Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God's appearance must also be inferior to the Faceless Sword God."</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess said, looking at her own reflection in the water.</p><p></p><p>She was particularly certain about the latter point.</p><p></p><p>"So, the Faceless Sword God wins completely," the High Priestess said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white didn't speak, the worry in her eyes undiminished.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the High Priestess spoke softly: "I know your concerns. When the time comes... if it's unavoidable, I will activate the teleportation formation and take... the Moon Dynasty away."</p><p></p><p>But... if the Faceless Sword God wakes up then, will he be able to find July Lake? But the Moon-Gazing Continent would likely become a true hell.</p><p></p><p>The place he once guarded with his life, how could she bear to see it in ruins?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman in white breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid the High Priestess would stubbornly insist on staying here.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an urgent voice came: "High Priestess!"</p><p></p><p>An emissary of the Faceless God Sect appeared, wearing a black embroidered robe, with a strange expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess's delicate face showed curiosity: "I already know that the Blood Robe Sword God's wife is at the second step of Treading Heaven, is there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"High Priestess, I feel that this Blood Robe Sword God... is somewhat strange," the emissary said haltingly.</p><p></p><p>"What's strange about him?" the High Priestess's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>She had seen many strange things in the world.</p><p></p><p>"As soon as I saw him, I felt very close to him.</p><p></p><p>And I found that it's not just me, anyone from the Moon-Gazing Continent who sees him feels extremely close and particularly trusts him," the emissary said.</p><p></p><p>The situation before them was indeed very strange.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white looked at the emissary, her eyes deep: "There are no traces of divine arts."</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess showed a thoughtful expression: "Anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing, the sword techniques he uses... have traces of your sword techniques, High Priestess."</p><p></p><p>"What..." The High Priestess's starry eyes flickered, reflecting a winter snow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the ancient Qi Chun tree in the sky, Qi Yuan raised his arm.</p><p></p><p>The trace of the crescent moon still hadn't appeared.</p><p></p><p>"So she's not the Moon Girl?" Qi Yuan felt somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>If the High Priestess was the Moon Girl, then logically, the trace of the crescent moon in his hand should have appeared.</p><p></p><p>And the Moon Girl... would probably have sensed him long ago and come to see him.</p><p></p><p>So, that High Priestess was very likely just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"Really, why does it have to snow?" </p><p></p><p>He stood in the vast snowy field, letting the heavy snow cover his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Getting closer and closer to the Moon Dynasty, Qi Yuan stayed in an inn, feeling quite bored, so he went out alone.</p><p></p><p>His state of mind was quite different from before.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps tens of thousands of years had already passed, and everything had disappeared in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Even the Southern Qian Kingdom no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Fate Sect was a sect from nearly ten thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Everything had disappeared into the dust of history.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, snow kept sliding off the trees, falling onto Qi Yuan's shoulders and head.</p><p></p><p>He was about to look up when he saw a woman in her late twenties walking gracefully not far away.</p><p></p><p>She wore a fox fur coat, her expression elegant. Her hood was pulled back, revealing a face like the clear light of a new moon, like snow piled on flowering trees.</p><p></p><p>Her lips were thin, her eyes clear and serene, graceful and gentle.</p><p></p><p>She walked up to Qi Yuan and parted her vermilion lips: "Is she... beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>She extended her jade-like finger, pointing at her own face.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>[This is a somewhat mysterious girl, with deep ties to you.]</p><p></p><p>"Beautiful, very beautiful," Qi Yuan said, looking at this face, not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to figure out her identity.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, if she heard that, she would definitely be very happy."</p><p></p><p>"Who... is she?" Qi Yuan looked at this face, many ideas arising in his mind, as well as a bold guess.</p><p></p><p>"She said, remember this face, so that in the future... when you meet her, you won't fail to recognize her."</p><p></p><p>"Is she Jin Li?" Qi Yuan stared at this face in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The Jin Li he had waited for under the ancient Qi Chun tree for so long but never saw.</p><p></p><p>"She is also the Moon Girl," the young woman said softly.</p><p></p><p>Time froze again at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the July Lake of the past, that stubborn girl.</p><p></p><p>The promise that crossed time and space back then, the two at opposite ends of time, originally impossible to meet, but... under the arrangement of fate, they met in another form.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know she was Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>She also didn't know that he was the Qi Yuan she would know in the future.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't that they had never met, nor was it like seeing an old acquaintance, but that they had always been there.</p><p></p><p>"Who... are you?"</p><p></p><p>The young woman before him changed form, becoming seven or eight years old.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young girl before him, Qi Yuan inexplicably thought of the Moon Girl from back then.</p><p></p><p>He saw traces of the Moon Girl in her.</p><p></p><p>"I am mother's daughter, father's daughter!" The young girl looked at Qi Yuan, her face full of smiles, "I am also the most precious gift father gave to mother."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Jin Li took her out from the statue of the Faceless Sword God.</p><p></p><p>All the memories flooded back.</p><p></p><p>She had really seen him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

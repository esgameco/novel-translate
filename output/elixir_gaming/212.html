        <h1>Chapter 212</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable's full-force attack was nullified in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi patted his wide sleeves, his eyes filled with pride: "Now Old Zhu should be able to easily defeat Big Black Dog!"</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had been badly bullied by Big Black Dog. </p><p></p><p>Now, he could finally hold his head high.</p><p></p><p>The solemn expressions on the faces of the other three gradually faded, the divine light in their eyes slowly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods at the scene were unable to shake off their shock for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The scene just now was too astonishing.</p><p></p><p>That was a Great Venerable! A full-force attack from a Great Venerable, yet it was easily neutralized.</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent in shock.</p><p></p><p>Was this mythology? Clearly not!</p><p></p><p>Though they had never seen god-observing techniques at the mythological level, the power certainly wouldn't be this exaggerated. </p><p></p><p>That was truly a full-force attack from a Great Venerable. Even if four Venerables at the first or second step of Treading the Heavens had awakened divine realm seeds, they still wouldn't be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The scene before them exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Origin Venerable Lord dared to come to Cai Kingdom. He had clearly made calculations in advance and was confident of victory.</p><p></p><p>The image of the Origin Venerable Lord grew even more towering in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice rang out, reaching the ears of the ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>"Qualified NPCs can't just be shocked all the time. That makes it easy to be eliminated by the times.</p><p></p><p>It's important to master a skill.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, at such a young age, not even 35 yet, you'll be eliminated by society and unable to find work.</p><p></p><p>Chef? Musician? Professional mourner?</p><p></p><p>Which do you want to choose? I'll teach you!</p><p></p><p>These three are especially easy to find employment in. No need to fear being eliminated by the times."</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods at the scene were stunned, their shock instantly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The elder twin sister looked at Qi Yuan with a helpless expression: "My lord, we should hurry and escape.</p><p></p><p>If that Great Venerable gives chase, it will inevitably be a battle to the death!"</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also nodded hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable's full-force attack had been blocked.</p><p></p><p>But if that Great Venerable brought hundreds of evil gods in pursuit, they would still face a dire situation.</p><p></p><p>"We can go, but what about the Thunder God Great Venerable?" Qi Yuan pondered for a moment, then decided they didn't need to worry about the Thunder God Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>As long as that old fellow didn't have too big of a problem with his head, once he discovered what happened in the capital of Cai Kingdom, he would likely turn back.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The group transformed into streaks of light, heading towards Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>At this time, thousands of miles away, an old man wore a golden wire mask on his head, engraved with various strange patterns.</p><p></p><p>Through the mask, a pair of cold eyes could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"My attack... was blocked?" He was somewhat surprised, or rather shocked.</p><p></p><p>The other side were merely Venerables, yet four of them working together had blocked his attack.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be surprised?</p><p></p><p>"Camp Master, should we give chase?" A new god at the third step of Treading the Heavens spoke up, his eyes anxious.</p><p></p><p>After all, they couldn't just watch those ancient gods escape.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know how those ancient gods were able to block a Great Venerable's attack,</p><p></p><p>their military camp had quite a few true gods. Led by the Camp Master, they could easily annihilate those ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>"No need." The Camp Master spoke, his voice resolute.</p><p></p><p>The situation before them was somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>Each of the opponent's true gods had a divine realm seed, which was too extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Such true gods would be considered geniuses anywhere and should be carefully nurtured. How could they suddenly appear in occupied territory to be used as assassins? There was something fishy about it, perhaps a plot targeting him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the deputy looked somewhat disappointed. The military achievements within reach were about to slip away.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Venerable took action, he was confident they could capture those twenty ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Camp Master looked at the deputy, narrowing his eyes: "You take a few true gods to capture them."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The deputy was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>No way, are you serious?</p><p></p><p>You want me to go?...</p><p></p><p>The main road was wide and spacious, with divine creatures occasionally flying past.</p><p></p><p>In a roadside tavern, a sign was posted today.</p><p></p><p>"Today's special: Buy 3 drinks, get 3 free."</p><p></p><p>A rather burly figure stopped in front of the tavern, looking at the sign above. His nose sniffed forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a rich fragrant aroma wafted over.</p><p></p><p>"Before undertaking a great endeavor, one should drink heartily!" the burly figure thought. "Innkeeper, bring me three jars of good wine!"</p><p></p><p>"Coming right up!"</p><p></p><p>The burly figure sat down, his gaze seemingly flickering with purple lightning: "It seems fate is looking after me.</p><p></p><p>If I hadn't gotten lost, I might have run into that Great Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The burly figure was none other than the Thunder God Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Qingshui Village, he had been extremely cautious along the way, concealing his identity information as he headed towards Cai Kingdom, intending to catch Zhang Feng off guard.</p><p></p><p>On the road, he encountered an ancient god from the Ancient God Alliance and took the opportunity to gather information.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that ancient god would give him wrong directions, causing him to waste quite a bit of time.</p><p></p><p>However, this also allowed him to avoid the Great Venerable's battle.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, as he was heading towards Cai Kingdom, he saw the Great Venerable's battle in the distance.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he naturally wouldn't have cared about such things.</p><p></p><p>But now he was severely injured, and needed to conceal his identity to avoid being detected by the Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, because he had gotten lost and been delayed, he missed the Great Venerable's battle.</p><p></p><p>This made him feel that fate was on his side.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which two Great Venerables were fighting." The Thunder God Great Venerable pondered.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking for a moment, he didn't dwell on it further. As long as it didn't interfere with his great undertaking, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>The wine was brought to the table. The Thunder God Great Venerable opened a wine jar and poured himself a full bowl.</p><p></p><p>As he drank, he felt exceptionally carefree.</p><p></p><p>As the wine entered his melancholy intestines, he couldn't help but feel more sorrowful: "Based on the timing, that kid should have just left the ancestral lands not long ago.</p><p></p><p>That fellow from Pear Mountain should have stopped him, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Venerable sighed, his mind wandering.</p><p></p><p>This time he had come to assassinate Zhang Feng, leaving his storage bag with Little Snow and bringing nothing of value.</p><p></p><p>He had even thrown away his communication jade slip, fearing his old friends would try to dissuade him and make him back down.</p><p></p><p>Coming to drink this time, the wine bill?</p><p></p><p>To hell with paying! He was going to die anyway, or assassinate Zhang Feng. It should be fine to eat and drink for free once, right?</p><p></p><p>Soon, he had finished drinking the three jars of wine: "Innkeeper, wasn't it buy 3 get 3 free?"</p><p></p><p>"Coming!" Soon, the innkeeper brought out three more jars of wine. The elderly innkeeper had a face full of spring, looking as if some joyous event was approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Innkeeper, do you have some happy event coming up?" the Thunder God Great Venerable couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Venerable very much wanted to say that after he assassinated Zhang Feng, it would be a double celebration.</p><p></p><p>Most of the people in the Mortal Heart Realm despised the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>As for traitors like Zhang Feng, they were even more universally condemned in private.</p><p></p><p>"A great joyous event." The innkeeper glanced at the Thunder God Great Venerable. "You haven't pledged allegiance to the new gods?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not. How could I possibly pledge allegiance to those son-of-a-bitch new gods?" the Thunder God Great Venerable said boldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the innkeeper let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This person even called the new gods sons of bitches, he definitely wasn't from the new god faction.</p><p></p><p>"The heavens of Cai Kingdom... have changed."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" The Thunder God Great Venerable's hand stopped in mid-air, holding his bowl.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Feng is dead."</p><p></p><p>"What?" The Thunder God Great Venerable was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He was preparing to go assassinate Zhang Feng, but now he's being told Zhang Feng is dead?</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper looked at the Thunder God Great Venerable's surprised face and smiled: "Not long ago, a voice rang out in the sky, saying 'Kill Zhang Feng, death to those who block the way.'</p><p></p><p>So quite a few ancient gods rushed towards Cai Kingdom and killed Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>After killing him, those people ran away.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the camp master of the evil god military camp took action, launching a full-force attack, but was blocked by those ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>Now, those ancient gods have fled, probably to the north."</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper pointed in a direction: "Those ancient gods came from that direction, and after killing the person they also returned in that direction."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Supreme was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Who had stolen his job? Was there such a formidable person in the occupied area?</p><p></p><p>"Such a righteous god... I admire him," the Thunder God Supreme said somewhat dazedly. </p><p></p><p>The person he wanted to kill had been killed by someone else, leaving him at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Feng is dead, we've all gotten our revenge!" The shopkeeper's face was filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, most citizens of Cai Kingdom were ashamed of Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>In the occupied areas, such satisfying events were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>These ordinary people lived as if treading on thin ice.</p><p></p><p>Who knew when there might be another "children's banquet" or some other kind of feast.</p><p></p><p>In any case, in the eyes of the evil gods, they were like livestock raised for food, delicious and appetizing.</p><p></p><p>"That righteous god is truly a hero! Traveling thousands of miles to kill a god, then leaving without a care, treating life and death as nothing!" the shopkeeper praised admiringly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder God Supreme's expression froze.</p><p></p><p>Such lavish praise should have been for him.</p><p></p><p>But now, even killing the traitor had been stolen from him!</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Supreme deeply regretted it, suddenly finding himself without a goal.</p><p></p><p>Should he... go try his luck at the evil gods' camp? The Thunder God Supreme sighed about that ancient god who killed Zhang Feng - how unsportsmanlike! He had wanted to kill Zhang Feng first.</p><p></p><p>"That righteous god is quite interesting. After killing Zhang Feng, he shouted to the whole city that next time he'd treat them to a feast. Haha... a feast of Zhang Feng, I wonder if this old man will have the chance in this lifetime," the shopkeeper said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Thunder God Supreme was completely stunned: "What! A feast!"</p><p></p><p>The words "feast" were very distant in the Thunder God Supreme's past memories. </p><p></p><p>Or rather, he may not have heard them more than a few times in his entire life.</p><p></p><p>But since coming to Qingshui Village, it was the word he heard most often.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing it again, his heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... the ancient god who killed Zhang Feng was Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>How was that possible! </p><p></p><p>Wasn't that kid just at the Purple Palace stage? Wasn't he still in the ancestral lands?</p><p></p><p>Even if he had broken through to True God in the ancestral lands, he couldn't just swagger in and kill Zhang Feng, and even block a Supreme's attack.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more absurd it seemed.</p><p></p><p>But that style of action was very much like that kid.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Thunder God Supreme remembered something - the direction the shopkeeper had pointed earlier... wasn't that towards Lin Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, his heart shook.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be that kid? His thoughts were complicated, and he very much wanted to take out a communication jade slip to ask about the situation.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered he had nothing on him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he quickly entered the realm of contemplation and asked in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>"Lishan Supreme, are you there? I have a question!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Thunder God Supreme, you've appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder God Supreme, was that ancient god who contemplated eight mythical beings yesterday your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder God Supreme, where are you now? I've found the Sky Thunder Wood you needed last time."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Thunder God Supreme was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Why were all the people in the group suddenly greeting him?</p><p></p><p>Eight mythical beings, what did that mean? Who had contemplated eight mythical beings?</p><p></p><p>His disciple? He was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lishan Supreme finally appeared: "Thunder God Supreme, you're still here? That's great, you... should go back quickly."</p><p></p><p>In the group chat, Lishan Supreme didn't elaborate.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Thunder God Supreme and Qingshui Village still needed to be kept hidden, to prevent the evil gods from finding out.</p><p></p><p>After all, those eight mythical beings had not yet grown up.</p><p></p><p>If exposed, the evil gods' army might annihilate them in the cradle.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lishan Supreme's words, the Thunder God Supreme had ten thousand questions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to ask more, but remembering there were other ancient gods here, he suppressed the doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the group chat, the Thunder God Supreme furrowed his brow, still pondering something: "Eight mythical beings... was it him?"</p><p></p><p>If so... it was truly too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"Is that kid really a genius?"</p><p></p><p>If it was him, it would be easier to understand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan probably didn't want to see him fall, so he came directly to kill Zhang Feng.</p><p></p><p>"How can he be even more reckless than me!" The Thunder God Supreme slapped his thigh, "This has exposed everything!"</p><p></p><p>He was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan was too reckless, just contemplating eight mythical beings and then striking out forcefully?</p><p></p><p>This matter must have caught the evil gods' attention.</p><p></p><p>It's all over.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Feiwu City, several streaks of light landed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the city residents still feasting, and said to the ancient gods beside him:</p><p></p><p>"You've been working hard for so long, you must be tired. Go feast quickly, replenish your energy."</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, shouldn't we discuss how to deal with the evil gods?" the younger twin sister asked bluntly, speaking her mind.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had traveled thousands of miles, killed Zhang Feng and fled.</p><p></p><p>It was impressive, but they had definitely caught the eye of the evil gods' camp.</p><p></p><p>The many evil gods in their camp would surely start increasing troops to surround and kill them.</p><p></p><p>After all, not to mention the matter of the mythical beings, just over twenty Venerable Ones who had awakened divine realm seeds were worth the evil gods' serious attention.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense!" Qi Yuan nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>This made the ancient gods present breathe a sigh of relief, Qi Yuan wasn't so unreliable after all.</p><p></p><p>"Now, Qingshui Village's strength has increased at least tenfold. We can no longer sit idly by, we should take the initiative to attack, and use battle to nurture battle!" Qi Yuan spoke, while turning his brain to think, "It seems I need to use my clever mind again to formulate a brand new battle plan!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan said this, the ancient gods were once again at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't they be thinking about how to respond to the evil gods' attack, whether to flee or hide, or engage in guerrilla warfare.</p><p></p><p>How... had it turned into taking the initiative to attack? This was seeking death too quickly!</p><p></p><p>"My lord... isn't this a bit hasty?" the older twin sister couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The older twin sister's thoughts were the same as the other ancient gods - now was the time to avoid battle if possible.</p><p></p><p>They had already gained a lot in the ancestral lands.</p><p></p><p>They needed to quickly use up resources to improve the strength of their subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Especially those eight True Gods who had obtained mythical level contemplation methods, they needed to quickly use resources to pile them up to Supreme level.</p><p></p><p>Only then would Qingshui Village's strength truly increase.</p><p></p><p>"It's not hasty at all." Qi Yuan shook his head, "I have many enemies, and when they do things, they dawdle and drag their feet, taking decades for small matters. In the end, all these enemies were destroyed by me!"</p><p></p><p>For example, the Black Mountain Sect - Qi Yuan guessed that the Black Mountain Sect people wanted to attack Blue Star and dig up Qi Yuan's ancestral graves.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Mountain Sect dawdled and never sent troops, while Qi Yuan couldn't sleep at night, directly formulated a plan, and took a spirit boat overnight to destroy the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was the same with the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>They kept targeting Qi Yuan, demanding that the Great Shang hand over Qi Yuan and Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>The useless thing was, they even added a time limit.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were in the Palace of Light's position, he wouldn't have added a time limit, but directly destroyed Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This way, Qi Yuan wouldn't have had time to develop.</p><p></p><p>In Blue Star's history, if Qi Yuan were a Yuan Dynasty general, he would have directly led 100,000 troops to smash Zhu Yuanzhang's begging bowl.</p><p></p><p>"The more time passes, the more variables there are, so... we must strike with lightning speed and kill the surrounding evil gods!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously, speaking with reason.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding ancient gods were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>"I have a new plan, called Three Days... Kill a Hundred Gods!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that everyone seemed to be moved by his words, Qi Yuan quickly struck while the iron was hot.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

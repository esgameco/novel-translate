        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many people's eyes held confusion.</p><p></p><p>Some young couples cheered: "Look, there are fireworks in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>Others seemed to understand, their expressions becoming especially solemn. </p><p></p><p>Lights appearing in the sky like this could represent something very frightening.</p><p></p><p>Many people went online, waiting for trending topics, wanting to understand what exactly had happened.</p><p></p><p>Some people harbored silent worries.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not get an explanation about "fireworks". Instead, they received a bloody, crimson declaration of war! Canxing, allied with the Ancient Witch Country, had officially declared war on the Qinyuan Country.</p><p></p><p>"War has been declared?"</p><p></p><p>"Canxing declared war? How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>"We're doomed, Canxing has actually entered the fray!"</p><p></p><p>The internet was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Although Canxing and Gongxing had always been at odds, targeting each other covertly,</p><p></p><p>This was the first time there had been a full-scale declaration of war.</p><p></p><p>Even during the previous invasion, Canxing had not declared all-out war.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Canxing is truly the beacon of civilization, I've finally waited for this day, I'm so happy."</p><p></p><p>Online, a small number of people cheered.</p><p></p><p>"Only under Canxing's leadership can Qinyuan have true freedom and true democracy!"</p><p></p><p>Back when Canxing and Gongxing were at war, Gongxing had always been at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing, many people admired and fawned over Canxing.</p><p></p><p>These comments immediately aroused anger in many people.</p><p></p><p>"War has always been bloody and cruel!"</p><p></p><p>"If you like Canxing so much, you go there yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we old Qin people were able to defend our territory before, and we can do it again today!"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, we relied on our own perseverance, strong will, and unyielding spirit, plus the Sky Eye we found in the desert, to defeat Canxing.</p><p></p><p>Now, we not only have the Sky Eye, but we also have a group of cultivators. What is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>On Qinyuan's internet, many voices rose up one after another.</p><p></p><p>Offline, supermarkets, shopping malls and other places were crowded with people starting to panic buy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, suddenly, an official video from the Ancient Witch Country once again exploded across Qinyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, at 6 minutes past 6 PM on March 7th,</p><p></p><p>Canxing's fleet launched a deadly surprise attack on Qinyuan's airspace.</p><p></p><p>In this attack, all of Qinyuan's... Sky Eyes were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure you all saw the brilliant colors in the sky like fireworks. That's right, that was the sound of the Sky Eyes shattering.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qinyuan's strongest barrier has been broken, and Qinyuan will be nakedly exposed within the attack range of Canxing's space-air warships.</p><p></p><p>Raise your hands, give up resistance, and welcome the arrival of the heavenly army!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone who saw this video was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Eyes are gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>This time, everyone panicked.</p><p></p><p>Even those cultivators felt a thick cloud of gloom at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivators were most familiar with the power of the Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was a terrifying weapon capable of obliterating Purple Palace realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, they were all destroyed.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be alarmed?</p><p></p><p>Canxing was able to silently destroy Qinyuan's strongest weapon in an instant.</p><p></p><p>What did this represent? It meant that Canxing was far stronger than before! It meant that when Canxing's warships arrived, Qinyuan would have no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>War happened so suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Many people didn't even understand why it had started like this.</p><p></p><p>Of course they didn't know that Canxing was now actually controlled by the demon race from the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The demon race of the Myriad Demon Realm didn't care about Canxing's survival, and directly ordered Canxing to launch suicide attacks.</p><p></p><p>This time, although they took out Qinyuan's Sky Eyes,</p><p></p><p>For Canxing, it was also a devastating loss, severely weakening them.</p><p></p><p>They directly lost 30% of their military capability.</p><p></p><p>Plundering Qinyuan could not make up for the losses.</p><p></p><p>So many people didn't believe Canxing would launch a large-scale invasion across space to invade Qinyuan, as the losses would outweigh the gains.</p><p></p><p>But now, it had happened.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there was chaos in the capital.</p><p></p><p>The seven Wuxing families, twenty family heads, as well as the king and high-ranking military leaders, gathered in an underground facility at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A white-haired old man said angrily and dejectedly: "How could Canxing do this, hurting the enemy by a thousand but losing eight hundred themselves, what benefit is there for them!"</p><p></p><p>"Now is not the time to discuss these things, we should consider how to respond to Canxing's attack!</p><p></p><p>Their follow-up fleet has already set out, in another ten days the army will be at our borders, we're finished!"</p><p></p><p>"We're really done for, without the Sky Eyes, what can we use to resist their warships, will cultivators cut them with swords?" A young family head said in despair.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Eyes were their faith.</p><p></p><p>The reason the seven Wuxing families were so powerful was inextricably linked to the Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Sky Eyes, the seven Wuxing families had stood unshakable.</p><p></p><p>Even when faced with mysterious and powerful cultivators, the Sky Eyes demonstrated strong oppressive and dominant power.</p><p></p><p>This family head had grown up listening to stories of the Sky Eyes since childhood, and now... with the Sky Eyes shattered, his soul flew away in terror.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Eyes were epoch-making weapons, without the Sky Eyes, what can we use to resist? Forget it, let's surrender, there's no point in resisting anymore." One family head said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if the Sky Eyes were T0 level weapons, then Qinyuan had no T1, no T2, only T3.</p><p></p><p>That was how powerful the Sky Eyes were.</p><p></p><p>But now the Sky Eyes had been ambushed and completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Qinyuan was thoroughly finished.</p><p></p><p>"Surrender?" The king's voice held anger and dissatisfaction, "Do you also hope for our people to become food? Isn't the information and data from Canxing clear enough? Even ordinary civilians in Canxing have become food for the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>If we are conquered by the Myriad Demon Realm, the next to become food... will be us!"</p><p></p><p>The former seventh prince had become more mature after years of experience.</p><p></p><p>His voice was stern, carrying strong dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>News from Canxing had always been transmitted to Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>They knew that Canxing's current situation was actually very miserable.</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons had been almost completely infiltrated by the Myriad Demon Realm, with their lives controlled by the demon race.</p><p></p><p>The lower class civilians were treated as food, transported to the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The newly established Great Space Navigation Company on Canxing was engaged in this business.</p><p></p><p>To the demon race of the Myriad Demon Realm, humans were simply ingredients.</p><p></p><p>If conquered by Canxing, it was unimaginable what awaited the people of Qinyuan. These high-level officials might still be able to live in luxury, just having to act subservient occasionally.</p><p></p><p>But what about the common people?</p><p></p><p>The former seventh prince originally had no qualifications to become king.</p><p></p><p>Later, he ascended to the throne and became king.</p><p></p><p>He had always been cautious, but also had ambitions.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to be an incompetent ruler.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Qing nodded and said: "That's right, we absolutely cannot surrender.</p><p></p><p>Even if we die, we must make the invaders pay a price!"</p><p></p><p>The former Gongyi Qing was not in the direct line of the Gongyi family.</p><p></p><p>Before the world was reset, he had carefully and respectfully recited the contents of the contract and password in front of Qi Yuan's tombstone over and over.</p><p></p><p>He was remembered by Qi Yuan, so he was also valued by the Gongyi family and became the family head.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to Qi Yuan's kindness in recognizing his talent, he had always maintained</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Holding onto their original intentions, they also had higher aspirations.</p><p></p><p>At his level, what material enjoyments hadn't he experienced? Now his pursuit was more about leaving his name in history.</p><p></p><p>"But the more fiercely we resist, the more Canxing will surely become enraged and retaliate against us doubly!" someone said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Should we not resist and let the butcher's knife fall?"</p><p></p><p>"Not resisting means death, resisting also means death, and possibly an even more miserable death..."</p><p></p><p>"Without the Eye of the Sky, what do we have to resist with?"</p><p></p><p>Among the Seven Martial Star families, these family heads pushed responsibility onto each other and argued.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the king's eyes were filled with deep disappointment.</p><p></p><p>He knew that many of these twenty family heads were very afraid.</p><p></p><p>Afraid to resist, offend Canxing, and face retribution.</p><p></p><p>He recalled Mr. Qi's words from before - indeed... there was no need for the Seven Martial Stars to exist.</p><p></p><p>Even without the Seven Martial Stars, Qinyuan Kingdom could get along very well.</p><p></p><p>However, when he had asked Mr. Qi back then if the Seven Martial Stars should be brought down from their pedestal, Mr. Qi had said, "I'm just someone who plays games, what does this have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>The arguing continued for half a day, with smoke filling the hall, but no conclusion was reached.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had left, the king looked at the now elderly Gongyi Qing, his eyes full of dejection, and then said: "Have you been able to contact Mr. Qi?"</p><p></p><p>There was a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, their only hope rested on Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't dared to contact Mr. Qi for several decades.</p><p></p><p>Because Mr. Qi had said not to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Disappointment flashed in Gongyi Qing's eyes: "We can't contact him. Mr. Qi is elusive, I'm afraid we can only see him when the Martial Arts Tournament begins. </p><p></p><p>Apart from the Martial Arts Tournament, he doesn't seem to care about anything else in our Qinyuan Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this time... it's too difficult.</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid that even if Mr. Qi intervenes, it will be hard to resolve the current situation.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Demon Realm is too powerful, even Canxing can't resist it.</p><p></p><p>Even if Mr. Qi agrees to help, it would just be a single pillar trying to support a falling building, one hand unable to clap."</p><p></p><p>The king said, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"This time, we can only rely on ourselves.</p><p></p><p>We can't always pin our hopes on others.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi doesn't owe us anything, he's not our nanny."</p><p></p><p>Qinyuan Kingdom was in chaos, with frequent disturbances.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on a small island, over twenty young men and women gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Most of these young people had ordinary appearances, but upon closer inspection, one would find they had extraordinary temperaments.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a young woman wearing tight-fitting clothes had a hint of worry and hesitation in her expression.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan were here, he would recognize this woman in tight clothes as Xiao Mei, his blind date from when he first started playing this game, who had also lent him quite a bit of money.</p><p></p><p>This Xiao Mei was also the disciple of his body's parents.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, "Xiao Mei" followed behind a female Taoist, her expression worried, seemingly concerned about Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>The female Taoist stood up, looking at the young men and women present, her voice ethereal: "Everyone, disaster is approaching. If we continue to stay in this realm, a great terror may descend."</p><p></p><p>The female Taoist was the leader of the Tianyuan Sect, Tianxian Daoren.</p><p></p><p>"If we don't stay in this realm, where do we go?" a man asked.</p><p></p><p>These people were actually all Restarters.</p><p></p><p>Most Restarters had entered the gates of immortality cultivation in recent years, becoming immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, in recent years, conflicts often occurred among Restarters, with only twenty to thirty survivors remaining.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the man's question, Tianxian Daoren couldn't help but feel regretful, then said: "We'll discuss that later. For now, please abandon your conflicts and killings.</p><p></p><p>According to the divination of the Tianyuan Stone, once all Restarters perish, or only a few remain, terrifying things will happen."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, with the Eye of the Sky falling and Canxing invading, is there anything more terrifying than that?" a woman couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The others didn't take the female Taoist's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the female Taoist was the leader of the Tianyuan Sect, with powerful strength and seniority, they wouldn't have given her face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk about great terrors, we should think about how to resist Canxing's invasion, otherwise... if the demon race descends, we'll all die."</p><p></p><p>"Right, the bloodlines flowing in our bodies are most favored by the demon race. The demons of the Myriad Demon Realm won't let us go!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Three Realms are strong, they can't resist Canxing, can't resist the Myriad Demon Realm!"</p><p></p><p>These Restarters were full of worries.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tianxian Daoren's expression became hesitant: "According to the Tianyuan Stone's divination, the crisis facing the Three Realms and Gongxing is even more serious than Canxing's invasion. What on earth... could it be?"</p><p></p><p>With Canxing's invasion and the descent of demons from the Myriad Demon Realm, this realm would become a paradise for demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>All humans would likely become food for the demon race.</p><p></p><p>This was already extremely terrifying and miserable.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the Tianyuan Stone said that their fate, Gongxing's fate, would be even worse than this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems only with the descent of the Ancestor can there be a glimmer of hope," Tianxian Daoren thought.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor was a Yin God, with the power to suppress all enemies in the world. If he descended, all evil spirits and demons in the world would dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Canxing's invasion would become a joke.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of a Yin God!</p><p></p><p>However, it would still take some time for the Ancestor to descend.</p><p></p><p>And during this time, could Gongxing handle the crisis?...</p><p></p><p>On top of the high tower, it was quiet and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the Martial Lords had their eyes closed in meditation, with only one or two hundred idly watching those Martial Kings attempt the challenges.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was browsing the forum, also receiving many useful suggestions.</p><p></p><p>"This person's wisdom is no less than that of the Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, to create the Underworld, one must first have a piece of land.</p><p></p><p>This was my oversight.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, everyone is speculating in real estate now, and house prices are too high, unaffordable."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked worried.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, ordinary land wouldn't do; it had to be land heavy with yin energy.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't fit the decorative style of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Black Deer, do you know of any areas... that are particularly heavy with yin energy?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Yin energy?" Black Deer Martial Lord was surprised, then said, "The Origin Land is quite heavy with yin energy. Here... there are dead people everywhere."</p><p></p><p>Receiving this answer, Qi Yuan wasn't surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Land, although it was the place of beginnings, meaning it should be full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the great battle back then, it was much heavier with yin energy than the Land of Endings.</p><p></p><p>He also knew this place was heavy with yin energy.</p><p></p><p>But he hadn't expected it to be this heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, if I were to buy the Origin Land, how much money would be appropriate? Oh right, what currency do you accept? Would underworld currency work?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to spend his own money, but the Heavenly Bank's money, he could spend a little.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Black Deer Martial Lord coughed, as if choked on saliva, "Is sir joking?"</p><p></p><p>Who would buy the Origin Land? "Haha, if you have enough strength, you can directly occupy the Origin Land and claim it as your private land.</p><p></p><p>However, it's too difficult. Not to mention the Eastern Alliance, there's also a powerful and mysterious force in the Origin Land. You must not offend them, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning that force, Black Deer Martial Lord's face was complex, with deep apprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Directly occupying is not good, it's not ethical at all. I should spend money to buy it.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, sometimes I really wish I could suddenly become rich, wish I could wake up one day and win the grand prize in the lottery." Qi Yuan dreamed, fantasizing.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought that even if he won the grand prize in the lottery every day, it probably wouldn't be enough to buy it, and he became even more disappointed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 511</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Shen changed into plain clothes, and the light makeup on her face had not yet been removed. </p><p></p><p>Her fierce eyes were wide and glaring, her face full of anger.</p><p></p><p>"Was it you who brought the bathwater?"</p><p></p><p>She held a whip in her hand, almost about to strike.</p><p></p><p>After a night of intimate bliss with her husband, she had been preparing to take a nice bath.</p><p></p><p>But then...</p><p></p><p>Of course, she still bathed, but after bathing, she came to trouble Shen Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, I was wrong!" Shen Lingfeng was hung up in a tree. He didn't know what had happened, but he remembered the clever tricks his brother-in-law had taught him, and apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so you know you were wrong?" Mrs. Shen was furious. "Tell me, what were you wrong about?"</p><p></p><p>This question left Shen Lingfeng bewildered again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Qi Yuan's mischief can be forgiven, since he's been in a mental asylum before. Do you want to go to the asylum too?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the bathwater made Mrs. Shen angry. Because she suddenly realized that Shen Lingfeng's previous request for a little sister was intentional.</p><p></p><p>"Pouring out the bathwater is one thing, but what was the meaning of putting onions, ginger, and garlic in it?"</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Shen brandished the whip, cracking it in the air.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng screamed in terror, wailing like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>The servants and maids kept their distance, not daring to approach.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Today is a very lucky day."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan's performance as the son-in-law has reached 70%."</p><p></p><p>"That's more than expected. Could it be that not only the mother-in-law bathed, but the father-in-law bathed as well?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan speculated in secret.</p><p></p><p>According to his calculations, pouring out the bathwater for the mother-in-law would have raised the performance rating to around 60%. But it ended up being 10 points higher.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the bathwater he poured out was not just for the mother-in-law...</p><p></p><p>"The reward for this performance level is... Yin-Yang White Fire."</p><p></p><p>When his performance reached 30%, Qi Yuan had gained the Heart of Forging, improving his success rate in forging.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has obtained the Yin-Yang White Fire.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang White Fire is a powerful spiritual fire.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a craftsman not only depends on their forging techniques, but also on their spiritual fire.</p><p></p><p>There are many materials in the world that are extremely hard and difficult to melt. </p><p></p><p>Some craftsmen, whose spiritual fire is not strong enough, cannot even melt certain rare and precious materials.</p><p></p><p>But the Yin-Yang White Fire is different - it is a powerful and domineering flame that can melt even divine-level materials.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this son-in-law Qi Yuan actually has very high innate talent as a craftsman, he just hasn't awakened it yet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan evaluated.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang White Fire!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's movement, a fierce white flame appeared.</p><p></p><p>In this flame, Qi Yuan could sense the ultimate coldness and scorching heat - two completely different essences coexisting in one flame, very contradictory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out a special material he had purchased - Wind Brilliance Gold, a heavenly-grade material.</p><p></p><p>The unranked spirit tools he had forged before, if infused with a bit of Wind Brilliance Gold, could be elevated to the yellow-grade.</p><p></p><p>And if they were yellow-grade, they could be promoted one small rank higher.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Qi Yuan was unable to melt this material. </p><p></p><p>But now, with the Yin-Yang White Fire surging, the Wind Brilliance Gold quickly softened and liquefied.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang White Fire truly lives up to its name, now even I can forge earth-grade spirit tools."</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, the strongest spirit tools Qi Yuan had forged were only at the mysterious-grade. </p><p></p><p>After awakening the Yin-Yang White Fire, he could try forging earth-grade spirit tools.</p><p></p><p>An earth-grade craftsman would be considered a regional overlord in the Ji Ning Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Shen Lingfeng did not come, and Chen Shenwei approached.</p><p></p><p>"In half a month, I will be following the Shen family to Mount Ao Lake to attend the Forging Conference." Chen Shenwei mentioned this with a worried expression on his face. "I wonder if there will be any young talents who can repair the Mighty Dragon Xuan Yuan."</p><p></p><p>The Forging Conference, also known as the Alchemy Convention, was held with the purpose of gathering the young elites from the three prefectures, to discuss the repair of the Mighty Dragon Xuan Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, an event of this caliber would not have allowed someone like you, who has just entered the field, to participate.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the imminent threat of the Water Lord of Mount Ao Lake, every craftsman's unique ideas are needed." Chen Shenwei continued.</p><p></p><p>"I may not be good at forging, but I excel at unique ideas." Qi Yuan said casually. "If I can repair the Mighty Dragon Xuan Yuan, what kind of reward can I get?"</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking too much." Chen Shenwei chuckled. "Probably around one million taels."</p><p></p><p>"Only one million taels, that's too little?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>If this had been a few days ago, he would have thought one million taels was a lot.</p><p></p><p>But now, with two million taels in his possession, he felt it was not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this is just a small goal, worth me making an effort." </p><p></p><p>"You fool, a regular earth-grade spirit tool is only worth a few to tens of thousands of taels. </p><p></p><p>The Mighty Dragon Xuan Yuan is a near-heavenly tool, and it's related to the safety of the Ji Ning Prefecture's common people, so it's worth one million taels! You actually think the amount is too little, the Shen Mansion probably can't even produce one million taels in cash." Chen Shenwei panted as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Mansion's assets exceeded one million taels, but most of it was in fixed assets, with little cash or silver notes.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei was considered relatively wealthy, but the silver notes he had on him were barely worth ten thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>"Enough about that, here are the materials for forging the Mysterious Element Spear, forge it in the next few days and you can go to Mount Ao Lake." Chen Shenwei handed a pile of materials to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Element Spear was a common unranked spirit tool.</p><p></p><p>In a regular military formation, there would be a powerful spear unit, and their weapons were the Mysterious Element Spears.</p><p></p><p>These spearmen were the elite of the army.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-man spear unit could suppress an earth-grade spirit cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll start forging it now."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it a bit too early? Aren't you going to..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Shenwei's words got stuck at this point.</p><p></p><p>He saw Qi Yuan's arm emanating a cold and scorching flame, and a large pile of materials appeared within it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, those materials had all melted into molten iron.</p><p></p><p>"This is Mysterious Jade Iron, even I would need to melt it for a quarter of an hour... You, you, you..." Chen Shenwei was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He saw Qi Yuan melt the Mysterious Jade Iron in just a few breaths, and looked at Qi Yuan's spiritual fire, full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's spiritual fire had grown stronger than what Chen Shenwei had seen before? Could his spiritual fire continue to evolve? What kind of spiritual fire was this? Countless question marks arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen this kind of spiritual fire before.</p><p></p><p>However, his shock did not last long, as a brand new, straight Mysterious Element Spear appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The spearhead gleamed with a frigid light, as if a cold beam was flowing through it.</p><p></p><p>That cold light shone brilliantly, seeming able to pierce through any obstacle in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Chen, do I now qualify to go to Mount Ao Lake?" Qi Yuan asked calmly, holding the Mysterious Element Spear.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!" Chen Shenwei felt like he was still dreaming, hurriedly nodding. "Cough, cough, Qi Yuan, if you manage to get that one million taels, could you give me a little bit... cough, cough."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave Chen Shenwei a surprised look.</p><p></p><p>Who in this world would dare ask him for money? He was the Debt Collection Hall's master.</p><p></p><p>"Considering how you've been telling good stories these past few days, I'll give you a share." Qi Yuan was very generous.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei heard this and immediately broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he looked at Qi Yuan and became more and more satisfied. "Come, Qi Yuan, write down your insights and thoughts on refining the Xuanyuan Spear, let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei thought of something and quickly took out a notebook and pen to give to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to write it down?" Qi Yuan was surprised, but without any hesitation, he wrote down some of his insights and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei received the notebook and casually glanced through it, unable to suppress his exclamation.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Qi Yuan is truly a divine being descended from heaven, as Chen Kang Bao said? Otherwise, how could his talent in refining weapons be so strong? The things written above, even he, a Xuan-level weapon refiner, did not fully understand.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the notebook and finally wrote on it, "Qi Yuan's initial refinement of the Xuanyuan Spear, witnessed by teacher Chen Xianwei."</p><p></p><p>After writing this, Chen Xianwei was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when Qi Yuan becomes a powerful weapon refiner, even a Heavenly-level weapon refiner, some refiners will definitely look at Qi Yuan's manuscript.</p><p></p><p>When they see the words "Teacher Chen Xianwei," they will surely say that Qi Yuan's achievements are inseparable from his teacher Chen Xianwei.</p><p></p><p>This teacher Chen Xianwei, without leaving any masterpieces for posterity, can be seen as one who is indifferent to fame and fortune.</p><p></p><p>With such words, is he not also worthy of being remembered in history? Thinking about this, his mood became even more joyful.</p><p></p><p>"Keep working hard, I'm going back." </p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei hurriedly left, he needed to report the matter to the family lord.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's talent in refining weapons, he has a very high chance of becoming a Heavenly-level weapon refiner.</p><p></p><p>How long has he been refining weapons?</p><p></p><p>His heart fire is probably even stronger than that of an Earth-level weapon refiner.</p><p></p><p>However, as he passed through the alley, Chen Xianwei encountered his old rival Wu Zhen again.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Old Chen, why are you leaving so quickly? Recently, my disciple refined a so-so inferior-grade artifact, you come and evaluate it." Wu Zhen held an object the size of a chopstick, "Sigh, he has been learning weapon refining for a month, and this is the level he's at, it makes me so weary."</p><p></p><p>He held the chopstick-like object, looking distressed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was really dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he was showing off.</p><p></p><p>See, my disciple refined an inferior-grade artifact in just one month.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei stopped in his tracks and glanced at the artifact.</p><p></p><p>"What a piece of trash, the craftsmanship is too rough!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei commented, then directly left.</p><p></p><p>This left Wu Zhen dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was like someone who posted a beautiful selfie on a certain red book app, then "humbly" said, "Ah, I'm so ordinary, can't compare to those beauties."</p><p></p><p>But then the comments all said, "The beauty is indeed ordinary."</p><p></p><p>This left him completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>How could Chen Xianwei look down on this? Could it be...</p><p></p><p>He suddenly had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the direction, Chen Xianwei was happily walking out of Qi Yuan's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the talent of the son-in-law is even higher than the disciples he has taken in?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Chen Xianwei's retreating back and couldn't help but shout, "Your hair is messy, not properly groomed!"</p><p></p><p>The quickly walking Chen Xianwei almost stumbled, and he hurriedly took out a small mirror from his pocket to tidy up his hair.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Wu Zhen felt like he had regained a bit of his dignity.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation has not fully recovered yet, but 'Heavenly Sword Slash' and 'Deathly Radiance' can be used again."</p><p></p><p>"Yet I haven't awakened any new skills, could it be that I need to reach the Heavenly-level?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After reaching level 90, his various large and small skills had all returned.</p><p></p><p>However, apart from the arrival of the Thousand Transformations, no new major skills had awakened.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Strategist, quickly help me think, this trip to Yeshan Lake is dangerous, how should I avoid the danger?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"If it were the old me, I wouldn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>But now, I am a son-in-law, a son-in-law with a mocking face, whoever sees me will want to bully me.</p><p></p><p>My strength has not recovered, if I get bullied, I might just have to endure it."</p><p></p><p>This was also Qi Yuan's concern.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you can bestow your blessing on me, I will protect you!" Chen Kang Bao said earnestly, full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao's strength, "bestowing a blessing" can deal with small bullies, but dealing with big bullies would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"Or... Young master, turn into a bun?" Chen Kang Bao looked at Qi Yuan expectantly, his mouth almost drooling, "If I hold the young master, no one will have any ill intentions towards a bun."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, no one would have any ill intentions towards a bun.</p><p></p><p>But you, Chen Kang Bao, would have a hungry intention! Qi Yuan glared at Chen Kang Bao, then said, "You've actually reminded me, when I was a son-in-law, I had a mocking face that attracted others to bully me.</p><p></p><p>As long as I'm not a son-in-law anymore, when we go to Yeshan Lake... we'll leave the Shen family's residence."</p><p></p><p>"Turn into a bun?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glared at Chen Kang Bao again: "Turn into a cleaver."</p><p></p><p>"A cleaver?" Chen Kang Bao was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Then you help me find a chef."</p><p></p><p>"To make buns?"</p><p></p><p>"...Get lost!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was completely exasperated: "Old man, go be reborn as a hungry ghost, can't you go three sentences without mentioning buns?"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, when this old servant was young, the family was poor, I often couldn't eat my fill!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan no longer wanted to talk to Chen Kang Bao.</p><p></p><p>He already had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Now, playing the role of a son-in-law has hit a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>The progress of playing the role of a cleaver is still very low, he must seize this opportunity to improve his proficiency in acting as a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, I need to give myself a layer of gold plating, in case that chef uses me to cut snakes, abalone, or steel bars, I won't be able to endure it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's idea was simple, there were still a few days before the trip to Yeshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he would forge a set for himself and encase himself in it.</p><p></p><p>As for that set, the first element is that the outer shell must be extremely hard; the second element is that the interior must be soft, otherwise how would the cleaver sleep?</p><p></p><p>"Wait, does a cleaver need to sleep?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, what should I pay attention to when acting as a cleaver?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to ask his pet cleaver what to pay attention to when acting as a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he needs to be walked? Or even... rummage through the trash?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head, he couldn't accept that.</p><p></p><p>"However, if it's walking people, if it's rummaging through treasuries, I think I can handle it."</p><p></p><p>"The core of acting should have two aspects, one is the thoughts and characteristics of the character itself, and the other is my own cognition.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's just acting, not becoming it!"</p><p></p><p>Acting is just acting, Qi Yuan doesn't want to become a puppet.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, what if next time he acts as a flower thief, he really goes and steals flowers? Acts as Cao Cao, then goes and sleeps with someone else's wife?</p><p></p><p>Hmm... the second one... maybe that's not a bad idea.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of a bug-exploiting method.</p><p></p><p>He acts as Cao Cao, sleeps with the wife of the son-in-law Qi Yuan, isn't that sleeping with someone else's wife?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 310</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the prestige of the Martial Arts Championship title is not what it used to be, among the top 100 competitors, there are still about 30 who have reached the peak of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Yang Shan couldn't help but refute.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty... Are any of them as strong as you? What about last year's champion, could you defeat them?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was conflicted. </p><p></p><p>What if the opponents in this Martial Arts Championship were too strong? If he couldn't win with just martial arts skills, what should he do? Should he... use some cheats?</p><p></p><p>After all, this was like playing a game, and using small cheats didn't really count as cheating.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no one would be able to tell if he used cheats.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan wouldn't be cheating.</p><p></p><p>He would be open and aboveboard, righteous and upright.</p><p></p><p>"Last year's champion..." Yang Shan's eyes revealed a smug smile, "was evenly matched with me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He really hadn't cheated, and there was no need to cheat.</p><p></p><p>"If the level is still this low this year, winning the championship will be a piece of cake for me. Looks like there's no need to cheat!"</p><p></p><p>"You're really underestimating me, kid? What do you mean my level is low?" Yang Shan couldn't help saying. This Qi Yuan's mouth really needed a beating. </p><p></p><p>What kind of talk was this? Even if he was arrogant, he shouldn't be so tactlessly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I finally understand the loneliness of seeking defeat or being undefeated. Being peerless under heaven, how desolate it is."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was emotional, giving off the air of a noble young master in a turbid world, a proud swordsman.</p><p></p><p>This unconsciously exuded aura even made Yang Shan momentarily dazed, inexplicably convinced by Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>But he still stubbornly said: "Mr. Lonely, we'll see how lonely you are in this Martial Arts Championship!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above are the stars, below is Lantai.</p><p></p><p>Long Tai City is an emerging first-tier city in the Qin Yuan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This city is known for its internet celebrity city tourism, with tourists flocking in endless streams every year.</p><p></p><p>In reality, it is actually a strong industrial city.</p><p></p><p>This year's Martial Arts Championship is being held in Lantai City.</p><p></p><p>Lantai City is located in the northern part of the Qin Yuan Kingdom. In a previous dynasty above the Qin Yuan Kingdom, Lantai was once one of the two capitals.</p><p></p><p>This capital was called the Martial Capital, the Martial Capital City.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that during the Tianxi Dynasty, three thousand martial artists once gathered in Lantai to hold a Martial Arts Assembly, seeking methods to break through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand martial artists sat together to discuss and research the essence of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>There are rumors that Luo Bufan, the top martial artist, had an epiphany at the Martial Arts Assembly and broke through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a lotus flower appeared above his head, and he ascended into the sky.</p><p></p><p>This is also the most recent documented case of breaking through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the lands of the Qin Yuan Kingdom, breaking through the limits of martial arts has become a millennial challenge.</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan walked on the streets of Lantai, his eyes revealing a longing expression: "For martial artists, the most famous place is Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>On Wuyun Pavilion, there are traces left by thousands of ancient and modern martial artists using their own strength.</p><p></p><p>If someone with extraordinary talent observes the traces on Wuyun Pavilion, they might be able to glimpse the true meaning of their martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The last martial arts ascender of our Qin people, Luo Bufan, also left traces on Wuyun Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After our test is over, do you want to go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>This time, their destination was the Martial Arts Alliance branch in Long Tai City.</p><p></p><p>Long Tai City was also the venue for the Martial Arts Championship.</p><p></p><p>So if Qi Yuan wanted to participate in the national Martial Arts Championship as an exception, he needed to go through a special channel.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... no problem, I also want to see the traces left by those ancients.</p><p></p><p>And that Luo Bufan, he sounds quite interesting." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go. The building up ahead is the branch of the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But we'll have to queue and wait a while, there are quite a few people here today.</p><p></p><p>These people will all be the cream of the martial arts world in the future. If you want to develop in the martial arts world later, you can get to know them."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like they'll all be old rivals? I, Qi the Undefeated, can't be bothered to get to know them." Qi Yuan said, dubbing himself Undefeated.</p><p></p><p>He would need to participate in more than one Martial Arts Championship.</p><p></p><p>So, with continuous championships, those who hadn't won would always be his opponents.</p><p></p><p>"This young brother is interesting. Coming here at such a young age, it seems you're like me, one of the few in this world!" </p><p></p><p>With these words, a young man wearing flamboyant clothes and with his hair styled into a rooster's comb walked over.</p><p></p><p>He looked to be only twenty-five or twenty-six years old, but his strength was clearly at the peak of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>When Yang Shan saw the newcomer, a trace of solemnity flashed in his eyes: "North Crane Han Xianyun!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this young master's reputation to be so great." The rooster-haired man's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had also heard of North Crane Han Xianyun's name before.</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts world, there were two peerless geniuses who were considered the most likely to break through the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>These two were known as the Southern Lion and the Northern Crane.</p><p></p><p>Both of them had reached the peak of martial arts at just over twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Southern Lion not only had profound cultivation, but also very powerful combat ability.</p><p></p><p>Last year, he had challenged the champion of that year's Martial Arts Championship and lost by only one move.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Southern Lion was the hottest candidate to win the Martial Arts Championship.</p><p></p><p>As for the Northern Crane... he was the second most likely candidate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at North Crane Han Xianyun, a strange expression in his eyes: "You should change your hairstyle."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun was stunned for a moment, then his eyes held some meaning: "Are you saying my hairstyle isn't cool enough?</p><p></p><p>Little brother, if we meet in the Martial Arts Championship, you can kick me in the groin, but don't mess up my hairstyle."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun was extremely flamboyant, his words shocking as soon as he opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Your hairstyle is very cool, but it doesn't suit you." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, could it be that little brother has also studied hairdressing, are we fellow practitioners?" Han Xianyun's eyes widened, "I designed my hairstyle myself, how is it, cool right? Do you want me to design a hairstyle for you, for free!"</p><p></p><p>"No thanks." Qi Yuan shook his head, "There's no rooster or crane in your bloodline, but rather... a rat.</p><p></p><p>So, both your title and hairstyle don't suit you.</p><p></p><p>You should change your hairstyle."</p><p></p><p>"Bloodline?" Han Xianyun was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "Are you serious, or are you just making fun of me?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm serious. Making fun... I wouldn't choose you for that.</p><p></p><p>Isn't that fortune teller in front of the building more interesting than you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't delve deeper into this topic.</p><p></p><p>North Crane Han Xianyun's martial arts bloodline was indeed of the same type as the "rat" in Qi Yuan's research.</p><p></p><p>As for his own body, it contained a type of "sea fish".</p><p></p><p>"Fortune teller, you believe in that?" Han Xianyun looked towards the stall in front of the building.</p><p></p><p>There sat a young man with a weak complexion at the stall.</p><p></p><p>The sign above read "Iron Mouth Heavenly Calculations" in large characters.</p><p></p><p>Next to it was a pile of strange objects, making it look like a scammer's setup.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you're pretending, you should at least make it look more convincing. He's too young to be a divine calculator... I don't believe it." North Crane Han Xianyun was the first to express disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Why don't we let him calculate who will win the championship in this Martial Arts Tournament?"</p><p></p><p>North Crane Han Xianyun nodded: "We're free anyway, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"You're too late, Southern Lion Zhang Yang has already gone!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun quickly looked over, her eyes showing a hint of surprise and some dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Yang is going to cause trouble," Han Xianyun's words vaguely revealed her dissatisfaction with Zhang Yang.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhang Yang was a martial arts prodigy, this person... was very arrogant. </p><p></p><p>Not just ordinary arrogance, but looking down on everyone.</p><p></p><p>It would be understandable if a martial artist was arrogant.</p><p></p><p>But Zhang Yang was not only arrogant, he also looked down on martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He gave off the feeling that it was an honor for the martial arts circle for him to join them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as Zhang Yang went over, many talented young people from the Martial Arts Alliance also went to watch that young fortune teller.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Han Xianyun also walked over. Qi Yuan stroked his chin thoughtfully: "I haven't bought the three pieces of gold jewelry for Ning Tao yet. Maybe... I should set up a fortune telling stall sometime to earn some extra money?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, among the crowd, Zhang Yang's expression was full of disdain: "You charlatan, matters of fate are so profound and mysterious. Even immortal cultivators... cannot claim to peer into fate. What qualifications do you have to make divine predictions?"</p><p></p><p>"The inability to peer into fate is simply due to not being powerful enough," the young man said weakly, but his eyes were full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>If Zhang Yang's gaze was one of looking down on everything from on high,</p><p></p><p>Then that young man's gaze was truly... a calm "arrogance".</p><p></p><p>As if he did not belong to this world.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Southern Lion Zhang Yang felt even more mocking in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just a few days ago, he had learned some earth-shattering news, which put him in a very bad mood.</p><p></p><p>He felt that spending so many years in the martial arts circle was a complete waste of time.</p><p></p><p>He had never thought highly of the martial arts circle to begin with, and now... with the revival of spiritual energy and the emergence of immortal cultivation,</p><p></p><p>He was even more displeased with the martial arts circle.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't to fulfill his wish of winning the championship and put a perfect ending to his past life,</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't have come here at all.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had gained some understanding of immortal cultivation, and felt drawn to it.</p><p></p><p>For him, if he could succeed in martial arts, immortal cultivation would naturally be no problem either.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing a fraud trying to deceive people, he naturally couldn't help but step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Then why don't you divine what level I will reach in the future?" Southern Lion Zhang Yang challenged the young fortune teller.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young man's eyes showed a smile: "Please place your hand on the copper plate, sir."</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller was sitting with a copper plate inscribed with strange symbols.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang didn't hesitate at all and directly placed his hand on it.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time passed, the fortune teller's eyes showed a regretful expression: "You were born into extreme wealth and nobility, but what a pity... your luck has run out.</p><p></p><p>In this life... you will likely achieve nothing."</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller's words immediately caused a stir.</p><p></p><p>"You really are a fraud, this is Southern Lion Zhang Yang, the favorite to win this martial arts tournament!"</p><p></p><p>"If this counts as achieving nothing, then who can achieve anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that sitting here telling fortunes like you is achieving something?"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers' eyes were filled with mockery.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan silently gave up on the idea of telling fortunes to earn extra money.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he heard such mockery, he definitely wouldn't be able to resist arguing with these NPCs.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan wasn't good with words, and hadn't learned many insults.</p><p></p><p>If he got into an argument, he definitely wouldn't be able to win verbally.</p><p></p><p>And if he couldn't win verbally, the only option left would be to resort to violence.</p><p></p><p>"This fortune teller's skills are lacking, he doesn't even know how to say flattering things," Northern Crane Han Xianyun couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the fortune teller with curiosity in his eyes: "Although I'm not skilled in matters of fate, I feel like his predictions are quite accurate. </p><p></p><p>Why don't you let him divine who your bloodline ancestor is, and see if it's a 'mouse'?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Han Xianyun was confused.</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand what Qi Yuan meant.</p><p></p><p>Aren't we all humans, and isn't everyone's bloodline ancestor human?</p><p></p><p>However, since Qi Yuan said so, Han Xianyun was easygoing by nature, so she went over and said: "Why don't you divine what my bloodline ancestor is?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun's words confused many of the people present.</p><p></p><p>Only the young fortune teller, upon hearing these words, had his shoulders tremble almost imperceptibly for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But he hid it well, and no one noticed except Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Han Xianyun and repeated what he had said to Southern Lion Zhang Yang: "Please place your hand on the copper plate."</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun did as instructed, looking at the fortune teller expectantly.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time passed, the fortune teller spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Your ancestors once produced a great general who guarded the nation. Going further back, you are actually descended from the last emperor of the former Tang dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Xianyun's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>If one had investigated the Han family, they would naturally know that the Han family had produced an extremely noble great general who guarded the nation in the past.</p><p></p><p>But... being descended from the last emperor of the former Tang dynasty was an extremely secret matter, and even in the Li family, very few people knew about it.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun herself had only learned of this half a year ago.</p><p></p><p>How did this person know! For some reason, she felt a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>However, she hid her expression and continued: "You certainly know how to flatter, sir."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the fortune teller continued: "I have divined your bloodline ancestor. It is the Colonizing Mouse, one of the 399 Beasts."</p><p></p><p>This sentence immediately confused Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>Because earlier, Qi Yuan had said her bloodline came from a mouse.</p><p></p><p>And now, this fortune teller was saying the same thing.</p><p></p><p>Was it a coincidence, or a conspiracy?</p><p></p><p>"Do you two know each other?" Han Xianyun couldn't help but look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She felt that Qi Yuan and this fortune teller must be working together to target her.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could they know the secrets of her family?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head: "I don't know this NPC."</p><p></p><p>Yang Shan also quickly said: "I can testify that Qi Yuan doesn't know this person."</p><p></p><p>Today's events were all coincidences.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun had a million questions in her mind, feeling that today's events were very strange.</p><p></p><p>The fortune teller said: "I do not know this gentleman... this is our first meeting."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked at Han Xianyun: "What I said is true.</p><p></p><p>If you don't believe me, think back. Three months ago, did you have a dream?</p><p></p><p>In the dream, you were chased by a giant rat."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Xianyun's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>She was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Three months ago, she really did have such a dream.</p><p></p><p>At the time, she hadn't paid much attention to it and hadn't mentioned this dream to anyone.</p><p></p><p>How did this fortune teller know?</p><p></p><p>"How do you know that?" Han Xianyun's mind was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan leaned in: "See, I told you his predictions were quite accurate, but you didn't believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know about Han Xianyun's dream, but he could deduce a thing or two.</p><p></p><p>Back when he was still an innate seed, Qi Yuan had inadvertently seen scenes from that female doctor's dream, and consequently received a curse that left him at death's door.</p><p></p><p>Three months ago, those who could dream were all... people whose bloodline concentration had reached a certain threshold.</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's guess.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, why don't you tell my fortune and see when I'll be able to complete this game?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the fortune teller with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward fiercely, the battle axe in his hand transforming into a deadly weapon.</p><p></p><p>With a violent chop, half of the evil gods instantly met their demise.</p><p></p><p>Wei Ting transformed into a god of war, slaughtering indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Spare us!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with Wei Ting, where was the former arrogance and tyranny of these once high and mighty evil gods?</p><p></p><p>The alluring Tao'an's face twisted in anger: "Let me go. This realm is destined to be the world of new gods. If you keep killing like this, you will surely incur the wrath of the true gods."</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, only two new gods remained at the scene.</p><p></p><p>She spoke quickly, trying to find a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p></p><p>"The surrounding lands are all occupied by new gods. We are here to welcome the Great Plague Lord. If you kill us all, you will completely offend the Great Plague Lord. When the Great Plague Lord descends, he will not spare you!"</p><p></p><p>Tao'an's red dress was alluring, her appearance beautiful. At this moment her mind was racing.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Killing you will completely offend the Great Plague Lord?" Qi Yuan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>A true god descending? Seeing this, Tao'an felt there was hope and quickly said: "We have gathered in Gale Town now to welcome the Great Plague Lord. </p><p></p><p>If you kill us all, the welcoming will be terminated, completely offending the Great Plague Lord! But if you think the Great Plague Lord won't be able to descend, that's just wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>He will just descend one or two years later. Once you've offended the Great Plague Lord, he will surely take action to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>"If you continue with the welcoming, when will the Great Plague Lord descend?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This was something he was very concerned about.</p><p></p><p>The evil god power contained in a true god would definitely be terrifying. </p><p></p><p>If he could... perhaps he could visualize a powerful deity.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month," Tao'an replied, continuing, "Origin Lord, your talent is very strong. It would be a shame to stay in the ancient gods' camp.</p><p></p><p>Currently, two-thirds of the cities in Lin Kingdom are already under the control of us new gods.</p><p></p><p>Just a few days ago, in Jiang Kingdom not far from our Lin Kingdom, a true god took action and directly killed and destroyed that ancient god lord.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Kingdom has also become the domain of us new gods.</p><p></p><p>Origin Lord, I hope you will consider the future.</p><p></p><p>Joining our new gods' camp will definitely be better than staying in the ancient gods' camp.</p><p></p><p>Just like that ancient god from Lu Kingdom who joined our new gods' camp, he's living an enviable life now.</p><p></p><p>He was favored by the Great Xuan Lord, who betrothed his daughter to him!</p><p></p><p>If Origin Lord joins our new gods' camp, not only can you avoid the calamity of the god of killing, you may also have the chance to marry a true god's daughter.</p><p></p><p>Even if not, this humble girl is willing to offer herself..."</p><p></p><p>As Tao'an said this, her face was alluring and full of charm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself: "So to quickly welcome the Great Plague Lord down, I need to keep you alive?"</p><p></p><p>Tao'an's eyes lit up, feeling she had persuaded the Origin Lord.</p><p></p><p>She continued: "When the Great Plague Lord descends, this humble girl will surely speak well of... my lord before the Lord.</p><p></p><p>My lord will have the greatest merit in welcoming the Lord."</p><p></p><p>Tao'an felt a sense of surviving a calamity.</p><p></p><p>The other party's reaction seemed to indicate he really wanted to cooperate with her.</p><p></p><p>"Welcoming the Great Plague Lord, I think that's a good idea," Qi Yuan looked at Tao'an.</p><p></p><p>Tao'an was delighted inside. She slowly walked towards Qi Yuan, deliberately letting her dress slip off her shoulder, revealing endless spring scenery.</p><p></p><p>"My lord's choice this time will surely be the wisest decision of your life."</p><p></p><p>"However... I don't want to cooperate with you."</p><p></p><p>The blood-red long sword let out a sword cry, slashing across with lightning speed. Tao'an's fine head was separated from her body.</p><p></p><p>Her expression still maintained the same look as before, but her final thoughts were filled with endless confusion.</p><p></p><p>Weren't we going to cooperate?</p><p></p><p>Why did he kill her? Unfortunately, she would never have the chance to understand why it turned out this way.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan killed Tao'an with one sword strike. Looking at the trembling evil god not far away, he squeezed out a kind smile: "Shall we cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>The evil god's body shook even more violently. He nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"I want to summon the Great Plague Lord as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The evil god didn't dare to speak, only nod.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly thought of something and said: "If I temporarily cooperate with you new gods, does that count as... friends? No, at least colleagues, right?"</p><p></p><p>The evil god didn't understand this demon's meaning, but still nodded: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, their families and wives are not here.</p><p></p><p>Dying in a foreign land is truly miserable.</p><p></p><p>I can only arrange their funeral affairs. It's not too much to have a meal for them, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Wei Ting, notify everyone, let's have a feast, until... the true god descends!"</p><p></p><p>Before, Qi Yuan felt the reasons for having feasts were not sufficient enough.</p><p></p><p>This time, having a feast for colleagues should be fine, right?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>In Stone Sand Town.</p><p></p><p>Ruo Yu closed his eyes, shutting off his five senses.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day of the Child Banquet.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing he could do about this matter. To avoid seeing and feeling troubled, he shut off his five senses and sat alone in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was an emergency, no one would disturb him today.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a dazzling light shone on the statue. Ruo Yu's eyes showed a surprised look.</p><p></p><p>This was the highest level of alert. Without a major event, the people of Stone Sand Town would not wake him up.</p><p></p><p>Why was there suddenly such a high-level alert? Could it be... evil gods had come to attack?</p><p></p><p>His heart tightened, and he quickly opened his five senses: "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Ruo Yu looked over and saw the village chief with an anxious face.</p><p></p><p>"Great God, something terrible has happened. Just now, that god from Qingshui Village, along with a giant, attacked Kuangsha Town. Just now, the earth shook and mountains trembled."</p><p></p><p>"What!" Ruo Yu's face changed drastically upon hearing this. "How dare he! What's the result, did he die?!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand how a village-level ancient god dared to suddenly attack several town-level gods.</p><p></p><p>The other side was holding a Child Banquet, true, which was infuriating to gods and men alike, but... they could only watch helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Rushing over there would only result in death. Yet he actually charged over.</p><p></p><p>In Ruo Yu's view, the battle must have ended by now.</p><p></p><p>That Origin Lord from Qingshui Village was simply overestimating himself.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, his actions have angered those evil gods and brought trouble to our Stone Sand Town.</p><p></p><p>I hope it doesn't implicate our Stone Sand Town."</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a figure came running frantically towards the temple.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping, dressed in coarse cloth, had completely lost his composure as he rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Terrible news!"</p><p></p><p>Ruo Yu's heart tightened: "Are they coming to attack?"</p><p></p><p>"They've all been killed, all of them..." Xu Youping's face was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Ruo Yu was confused, not understanding Xu Youping's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Lord, along with that giant, killed all the evil gods!" Xu Youping said heavily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ruo Yu's eyes widened, all traces of a guardian god's demeanor gone. He grabbed Xu</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Youping's shoulders: "What did you say?!"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, a giant as tall as the sky emerged from Qingshui Village!" Recalling that towering giant, Xu Youping was still utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying giant, causing the earth to shake with each step, charged directly into Kuangfeng Town, crushing those powerful evil gods like little chicks.</p><p></p><p>Xu Youping recounted everything he had witnessed today to Ruoyu.</p><p></p><p>Ruoyu was also incredibly surprised and couldn't calm down for a long time. Finally, he asked: "What about Shelang?"</p><p></p><p>Shelang was a demigod. Unless a true god descended, there was no way to deal with him if he took action.</p><p></p><p>However, there were no true gods near Feihang City.</p><p></p><p>"The Origin Lord of Qingshui Village personally took action, slaying Shelang with one sword strike!" Mentioning this, Xu Youping's heart was still unsettled, recalling that dazzling sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ruoyu's heart trembled. He paced back and forth in the temple, looking very preoccupied.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he gritted his teeth and said: "Let's go take a look at Kuangfeng Town."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Youping hesitantly said: "But in the end, the Origin Lord killed all the evil gods except one, and reached an agreement with that evil god to... summon a true god together."</p><p></p><p>"What?" This time, Ruoyu completely lost his composure.</p><p></p><p>Killing all the evil gods in one fell swoop, but leaving one to cooperate with - what kind of logic was this?</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to go to Kuangfeng Town for now, but to wait and observe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, leading Wei Ting, suddenly went on a killing spree.</p><p></p><p>This shocked many people.</p><p></p><p>Even the people of Qingshui Village, who were just working together, suddenly heard they were going to Kuangfeng Town to play the suona.</p><p></p><p>The people of Chenxi Village gathered their best chefs and rushed to Kuangfeng Town.</p><p></p><p>When they learned that the evil gods of Kuangfeng Town had been slain, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Everything was fine in the morning, but suddenly Kuangfeng Town was destroyed, and Shelang and other evil gods were killed one after another.</p><p></p><p>The feast was back on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>How could these people not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, at the banquet, the aroma of meat filled the air. The shock had not yet faded from Village Chief Yu Lu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu sat next to him, his heart also in a panic.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi kept stealing glances at Wei Ting, his eyes full of envy.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, alas, I'm so much fatter than him, why wasn't I chosen?"</p><p></p><p>Today, Wei Ting transformed into a giant spirit god, sweeping across the land, truly shocking everyone.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the deity had brought out another extremely precious method of observing gods.</p><p></p><p>Judging by Wei Ting's powerful combat ability, this method of observing gods must be extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the great one chose Wei Ting, which made Zhu Zhuangshi drool with envy.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Chen Xifan couldn't help but say: "What the deity needs is strength, not fat."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi was immediately dissatisfied: "Doesn't my name say it all?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Chen Xifan mocked, unwilling to speak further with Zhu Zhuangshi.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was also incredibly envious of Wei Ting in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A sudden outsider, immediately favored by the deity, directly ascending to heaven along with his chickens and dogs.</p><p></p><p>That method of observing gods directly propelled Wei Ting to the late stage of the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as Wei Ting was given enough time to cultivate to the peak of the Purple Palace realm, and then add a supreme treasure, he could become a true god.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that their Qingshui Village would have one more true god! What an honor this was.</p><p></p><p>Their run-down little village could actually produce a true god.</p><p></p><p>But this was also something to be incredibly jealous of, because this true god could have been any of them, yet they didn't seize the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi, sitting nearby, heard these conversations and smiled. She looked at her maid Xiao Xue: "See? Cultivating a godfather and letting him work hard is much more comfortable than working hard yourself."</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue's face broke into a bright smile: "Indeed."</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, she saw the misery of Jinshi Town and felt heartbroken, full of resentment towards the mastermind behind it.</p><p></p><p>However, she didn't dare tell the master about what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Because she knew that Qingshui Village needed to develop slowly and couldn't oppose any town at the moment.</p><p></p><p>But on the second day, overwhelming joy surged in her heart. What did she see?</p><p></p><p>The master led Wei Ting, and the two of them swept across six towns, capturing all the evil gods in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>Even now, her heart was still full of joy and emotion.</p><p></p><p>She felt like a child who had been wronged, but the next day, her parents helped her get revenge fiercely.</p><p></p><p>She secretly glanced at Qi Yuan in the distance and lowered her voice to say: "Miss, can I also acknowledge the master as my godfather?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi raised an eyebrow: "You want to steal my father?"</p><p></p><p>"...Great-godfather is fine too." Maid Xiao Xue said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a daughter like you!" Qi Qi glared at Maid Xiao Xue.</p><p></p><p>At the table, a group of people ate the feast, interspersed with songs and laughter.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy mood of many days was swept away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Village Chief Yu Lu transmitted a message asking: "What do you think of our deity?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Tu thought of something, his expression changing slightly, and he transmitted back: "Do you mean to..."</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu frowned and pondered: "In ancient times, the great one must have been an extremely powerful deity, perhaps even one who could take three steps across the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"Taking three steps across the heavens barely qualifies one to go to the ancestral land." Village Chief Yu Lu said.</p><p></p><p>The people of Qingshui Village were a branch of the descendants of an ancient clan.</p><p></p><p>The ancient clan had an ancestral land, which was incredibly dangerous. Even true gods who entered had a high probability of perishing.</p><p></p><p>Even great venerable ones who entered had a chance of perishing.</p><p></p><p>But within the ancestral land, there were countless treasures. Some of these treasures could help people overcome the limitations of heaven and earth to enter the realm of true gods, while others were innate treasures with infinite power.</p><p></p><p>As a branch of the descendants of the ancient clan, they actually had the right to recommend their village's guardian deity to enter the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>"However, even if we want to recommend our deity to enter the ancestral land, at the very least, our deity needs to enter the realm of true gods.</p><p></p><p>And to gain the qualification to enter the ancestral land, one probably needs to be able to take three steps across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>To have great gains in the ancestral land and return safely, one needs to be at least a great venerable one.</p><p></p><p>Our deity is still far from those levels.</p><p></p><p>For now, we shouldn't think about things that are too distant. We should focus on how to survive the siege of the evil gods."</p><p></p><p>Shen Tu couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>What Shen Tu said was indeed reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Now that their deity had swept across six towns, it was impressive.</p><p></p><p>But this action must have caught the eye of some powerful evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, before long, powerful evil gods would come to settle the score personally.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their deity now seemed to be planning something big, playing with fire.</p><p></p><p>That Plague Venerable One would probably appear in this world before long.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't imagine how their deity would deal with this.</p><p></p><p>Could he observe another method of observing gods? But where were there so many powerful deities?</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Taking a break for one chapter, will make up with three chapters tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who among the commoners, officials, and nobles in the entire capital city would know that he had arrived?</p><p></p><p>"When the divine descends, the Fifth Extraordinary shall meet his demise!"</p><p></p><p>The voice resounded, spreading across the entire royal capital in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of divine power, Qi Yuan's voice was far faster than the speed of sound.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, countless commoners in the royal capital looked up to the sky, their faces expressing various emotions.</p><p></p><p>There were elders filled with joy, young people confused, and some astonished.</p><p></p><p>There were also Heaven-level Imperial Guards who were exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected we would have the chance to witness a battle between divine beings!"</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the outcome, this battle will be recorded in history!"</p><p></p><p>"The Adjudicating Deity... has returned? I'm not satisfied, when I was weak, the divine had already fallen, and I suffered bullying. After a century of hard work, I finally became a superior, but I haven't even enjoyed the fruits of my labor, and the divine has returned?"</p><p></p><p>The people in the royal capital had diverse reactions to the return of the divine.</p><p></p><p>Just like the middle-aged man in the gray robe, he drew his sword from the scabbard and swung it at Qi Yuan: "The world fears the divine, but I do not fear it!"</p><p></p><p>He was a descendant of the founding duke, and his ancestors had already borne the bitterness for him. He should have been enjoying the good life. </p><p></p><p>He didn't have the ambition of his elder brother, nor the laziness of his younger brother to just lie back and enjoy the good life... well, he was just a pure deviant, seeking excitement.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he violated the law, the son of a duke, and was castrated by the divine as punishment.</p><p></p><p>He harbored deep resentment towards the divine.</p><p></p><p>The old emperor, the Fifth Extraordinary, had exterminated the divine, and he regarded him as a father figure, willing to die for him.</p><p></p><p>"You, without father or lord, shall die!"</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword, unafraid of death.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to tell the aloof and merciless Adjudicator that even a great evildoer like him was unafraid of death.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the young figure did not even glance at him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Ignored!</p><p></p><p>This was blatant disregard!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man in the gray robe was furious. He looked at the carriage and slashed his sword at it.</p><p></p><p>What greeted him was the sword of the old woman in white.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he never got to see the young man's gaze upon him, even until his death.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was just an insignificant ant.</p><p></p><p>This kind of contempt angered him more than death, but he was powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>In the divine's eyes, he was completely irrelevant, and He would not even remember this unimportant figure.</p><p></p><p>"Descend, divine!"</p><p></p><p>"As I, the divine."</p><p></p><p>"Together with you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan silently recited as he ascended into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Facing the deities of the Rakshasa Kingdom, Qi Yuan had no intention of hiding. In the sight of all the commoners, he would slay the emperor of the Rakshasa Kingdom, the sun of the Rakshasa.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a blood-red light cast its shadow on the ground, and in the sky, a terrifying giant over a hundred zhang tall appeared.</p><p></p><p>Covered in blood-red crystal armor, the intricate patterns on the breastplate; the flowing edges were sharp and angular, engraved with a celestial scale; the deep red bracers revealed a hint of gold, connected like golden lines, as if the divine beast was roaming.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of "As I, the divine" and "Together with you", the current Qi Yuan was majestic beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>The holy, the demonic, and the evil were united as one.</p><p>One body, three faces.</p><p></p><p>He was the compassionate saint!</p><p>He was the raging abyss!</p><p>He was the inscrutable evil!</p><p></p><p>In a flash.</p><p>The blood-colored light and the holy radiance enveloped the entire royal capital.</p><p>The entire heaven and earth, intertwined with blood and holiness.</p><p>At the intersection, was darkness.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the majestic figure in the sky.</p><p>Whether they were ordinary people or Imperial Guards, when they saw that towering figure, a sense of fear, awe, and an unbeatable feeling arose in their hearts.</p><p>Their legs trembled involuntarily, their heartbeats racing frantically, a primal instinct, or perhaps a fear of the mighty.</p><p>However, no one knelt down, because... the holy light supported them.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the divine?"</p><p>"The Adjudicating Deity?"</p><p>Some had chattering teeth, others had expressions of terror.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace, the Six Deities gathered.</p><p>The Pacifying King narrowed his eyes, a hint of complexity in his gaze: "The divine... why is it different from the past?"</p><p></p><p>The divine of the past was merely a divine artifact, transforming into a human form during battle.</p><p>However, that was a faceless, holy male.</p><p>Now, the holiness was tinged with blood, making people's hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>"He... is much stronger than before," the old man said, trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>The divine of the past was like a sword hanging over their heads.</p><p>Even when he had reached the level of a Deity-level Imperial Guard, he still felt anxious and uneasy.</p><p>Now, that feeling had returned.</p><p></p><p>"He was slain a hundred years ago, and now... he is surely doomed to die!"</p><p>"Even if he revives, he cannot last long. This is his strongest form."</p><p>"Yes, even we old Deity-level Imperial Guards can see that his outward strength is hollow, and he can only exist for about a hundred breaths."</p><p>"As long as we hold him off, he will surely die."</p><p></p><p>These people were veteran Deity-level Imperial Guards, and their eyes were still sharp.</p><p>The terrifying aura of that majestic figure made them shudder, even though they were Deity-level Imperial Guards, they felt an overwhelming sense of being outmatched.</p><p>But that aura could not be maintained for long.</p><p></p><p>"In his current state, he is stronger than before," the silent Fifth Extraordinary spoke, his expression cold and stern. "If I had not made preparations, this battle, within a hundred breaths, he could have killed at least three of you.</p><p>So you should remember my grace, for this time, I have saved you!"</p><p></p><p>The five Deity-level Imperial Guards present quickly expressed their gratitude.</p><p>The Pacifying King, being the thickest-skinned, even fawned shamelessly: "Your Majesty is like a second father to this humble servant!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary nodded, his eyes gleaming with intense battle intent.</p><p>He gazed at the towering figure approaching the imperial palace, his voice resounding through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"A mere divine artifact, a creation of craftsmen, dares to be so presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from the Fifth Extraordinary was also terrifying.</p><p>The majestic divine might, the dignity of an emperor, struck fear into people's hearts.</p><p>Over the past hundred years, the Fifth Extraordinary had cultivated furiously, neglecting state affairs.</p><p>He had gathered the most precious treasures in the world to nourish himself.</p><p>His strength had reached the limit of stepping through the sky in three steps, almost reaching the level of the original divine.</p><p>Therefore, he had the confidence to battle the current divine.</p><p>Moreover, he had a trump card.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the majestic figure rapidly approached, without a word, gazing at the old emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have come before the king, why do you not kneel?" the Fifth Extraordinary said, full of vigor.</p><p>This was no longer the emperor who dared not even observe the battle a hundred years ago.</p><p>Now, he was full of vigor, the sun of the Rakshasa Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant remained silent, his actions speaking for him.</p><p>A powerful punch, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary saw that punch, his gaze suddenly narrowing.</p><p>An emotion he had not felt in a long time - fear - began to spread.</p><p>He was furious, his voice even more resounding.</p><p></p><p>"All that is illuminated by the sun and moon is my royal domain.</p><p>All living beings and objects within my royal domain are mine!</p><p>You... dare to defy me, and I shall personally slay you.</p><p>I will tell the world that for a thousand generations, they shall have the honor of being my subjects, protected by me."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary shouted enthusiastically, but his body was very honest.</p><p>When that punch descended, his body hastily evaded.</p><p>He dared not engage Qi Yuan in direct combat.</p><p></p><p>In a distant place.</p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly fluttered her wings, her face expressing regret as she looked towards the south.</p><p>"According to the timing, a divine battle should have occurred in the Rakshasa Kingdom's capital, but unfortunately, we probably won't have the chance to go see it."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan, in a black dress, her aura icy cold, though wearing a veil that obscured her peerless beauty, one could still glimpse its magnificence.</p><p>The hem of her dress, embroidered with plum blossoms, trailed down to her ankles, concealing her long, porcelain-like legs.</p><p>Although her attire was somewhat conservative, it still failed to hide her voluptuous figure, with her long legs, slender waist, and ample bosom easily drawing the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, the wielder of this divine artifact has the same name as your husband, both called Qi Yuan," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name, Shen Lingxuan's brow and eyes, with a slight tear-like mole, trembled slightly: "Perhaps it's just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"It must be the same person," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly sighed. "The divine artifact was once the number one divine artifact in the world, and even if it's broken, not just anyone can wield it, at least they need to be a Heaven-level Imperial Guard. Your husband... is only eighteen years old."</p><p></p><p>Even if he had been cultivating since birth, it was impossible for an eighteen-year-old to reach the level of a Heaven-level Imperial Guard.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan nodded in agreement.</p><p>She was a Heaven-level Imperial Guard in her previous life, so she naturally understood the difficulty of reaching that level.</p><p>Even with her past life's memories and exceptional talent, with the help of the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly, she had only just barely reached the Heaven-level.</p><p>However, she suddenly thought of the words the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly had heard in the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p>Her husband had come to find her.</p><p>She suppressed this conjecture in her heart.</p><p>Of course, that time in the Anomaly Domain, after obtaining the Anomaly Source, she had been in a deep slumber, unaware of what had happened in the Anomaly Domain.</p><p>Otherwise, she might have known that this Qi Yuan could indeed be her husband.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, our strength is too weak, we can't even protect ourselves, otherwise we could have gone to help the divine," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said. "The divine's master, its creator, is called Sheng Nü, who is also a Mandate Bearer."</p><p></p><p>"Will he win?" Shen Lingxuan looked towards the location of the Rakshasa Kingdom's capital.</p><p></p><p>"He won't... even if he wins, with his ostentatious display, what awaits him... is also death. The divine also bears a Mandate," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan felt disappointed, a faint sadness welling up in her heart.</p><p>Mandate Bearers, blessed by heaven and earth, yet always having to hide and evade pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Divine Wood Abyss, after refining the Anomaly Source, with my help, hiding there for a few hundred years won't be a problem.</p><p>By then, you'll have become a Deity-level Imperial Guard, and I'll take you to the Outer Realms!"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly already had a plan.</p><p>Although Mandate Bearers would be pursued, in the Outer Realms, there were also places where Mandate Bearers could find refuge.</p><p>It was very safe there.</p><p>However, Shen Lingxuan would need to reach the level of a Deity-level Imperial Guard to go there.</p><p></p><p>Apart from them, countless eyes were focused on the battle in the Rakshasa Kingdom's capital.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Decree, a message appeared.</p><p>"If Brother Qi can weather this calamity, I will recommend him to join the Void Garden, to escape this cage."</p><p>"Brother Qi? Who is that? I've never heard of him." Jie Wuyun was a bit confused.</p><p>As soon as she sent this message, she regretted it, wanting to retract it.</p><p>Because it was clear that the employee of the Thorn Blood had sent the message to the wrong place.</p><p>If she continued to secretly watch, she might be able to see more hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Breaking News.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff members had a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>This person is really adorably foolish.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's Brother Cai Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Jie Wuyun felt a bit regretful, and he continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>Also... how did he know Brother Cai Dao's surname is Qi? The Thorn Blood staff member smiled wryly: "In these past few months, there has been a young man named Qi Yuan, wielding the divine Arrival, who has traveled through the twelve states of the Luoscha Kingdom, slaying demonic blades. Do you know of him?"</p><p></p><p>"I know." Jie Wuyun quickly answered.</p><p></p><p>"He is Brother Cai Dao."</p><p></p><p>"You... how did you find out... no, is Brother Cai Dao facing an attack from the gods now? Wouldn't he have died?" Jie Wuyun was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>"This tribulation is difficult, very difficult. In the 'Blue Mountain Book', there are only a few brief records of this event.</p><p></p><p>The vessel is destroyed, while the Luoscha endures."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, the vessel is destroyed... what about the person?" Jie Wuyun discovered a blind spot.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Blue Mountain Book' does not record him, perhaps... he is not qualified enough."</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible... that he won?"</p><p></p><p>"The chances are slim, it's more likely that he was defeated, but there is a slim chance that he managed to escape with his life."  The Thorn Blood staff member sighed.</p><p></p><p>The events recorded in the 'Blue Mountain Book' may have some minor changes, but the overall direction cannot be altered.</p><p></p><p>Just as the plans of Thorn Blood cannot fail.</p><p></p><p>The divine tree will become a strange spirit, and the Blue Mountain Realm will become a realm of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>And the task he received in the Void Garden is to accelerate this process.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder... how the ending turned out." He sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the royal capital.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure stood upright, like a white jade pillar supporting the heavens, a purple gold beam spanning the seas.</p><p></p><p>His cold and majestic gaze made him seem like a lofty celestial deity.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary's mouth was dripping with scarlet blood, his face revealing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the gap between us to be so great, I've been fleeing with all my might, yet you still managed to injure me."</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan's attack, he mustered the courage to... dodge a bit, wanting to rely on his own strength to fight.</p><p></p><p>But even dodging quickly was useless.</p><p></p><p>He was still grazed, sustaining no light injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, I will no longer hide... I will not give you a chance to live!" The Fifth Extraordinary was quite talkative.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his tone, it seemed he was about to unleash his true strength.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew, he was probably already this powerful.</p><p></p><p>His "not hiding his strength" was just bringing out the Dark Radiance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a azure light appeared before the Fifth Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>He had a smug expression on his face: "You should know... what this is!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression did not change.</p><p></p><p>He saw at a glance that it was the Dark Radiance specifically used to corrupt divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"With it here, you will surely die today." The Fifth Extraordinary let out a cold shout.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, this drop of water suddenly spread out.</p><p></p><p>It was as if blue rain was falling from the heavens, covering the entire royal capital, leaving nowhere to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how you'll escape!"</p><p></p><p>"If it were other divine-level armored soldiers, they might be able to use divine power to resist and isolate it a bit."</p><p></p><p>"But you are a divine artifact, even the slightest touch of divine power will lead to corruption and erosion."</p><p></p><p>The torrential blue rain fell, as if wanting to flood the entire royal capital.</p><p></p><p>The rain with the Dark Radiance could not only pollute divine artifacts, but also corrode... ordinary mortals.</p><p></p><p>This rain was like true "sulfuric acid" rain.</p><p></p><p>If it fell, who knows how many living beings would be charred.</p><p></p><p>The towering buildings were corroded and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The rain continued to fall rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm as he glanced at the citizens below, who were like ants.</p><p></p><p>They were so fragile, yet stubbornly alive.</p><p></p><p>As the Arrival, as the Arrival, at this moment, his choice was...</p><p></p><p>"Absorb!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his colossal mouth.</p><p></p><p>A powerful suction force gathered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The rain of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>All return to me!</p><p></p><p>This massive being, facing the blue rain, opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>All the rain in the sky and earth entered his stomach at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His divine power was constantly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The white glow and golden lines within the blood-colored armor were being stripped away, continuously drained.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Liu Sheng's hoarse voice said to Liu Chuchong, "He's just like you... both foolish children, to prevent this poisonous rain from harming the innocent civilians, he chose to drink it all!"</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know what was in the poisonous rain.</p><p></p><p>But it was clear that it was specifically designed to deal with the Arrival.</p><p></p><p>Even though he could have dodged and only been lightly contaminated, he chose to swallow the poisonous rain for the sake of the people.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chuchong's face showed a worried and guilty expression: "I... judged the noble by my own small mind."</p><p></p><p>Before, she had thought that Qi Yuan would lose himself to power.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, to protect the people and all living beings, sacrificing himself, this was what she admired and respected - the foolish and selfless Arrival.</p><p></p><p>She gazed towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The towering blood-colored figure seemed to be struck by lightning, burned by fire, and corroded by poison.</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds constantly rang out.</p><p></p><p>His divine power turned into a haze of smoke.</p><p></p><p>His figure was constantly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>As if being dissolved.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the civilians protected by the Arrival seemed to have realized something, they looked at the rapidly weakening figure in the sky and couldn't help but call out "Arrival".</p><p></p><p>"Arrival!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrival!"</p><p></p><p>More and more people called out.</p><p></p><p>Even if a hundred years could wash away all memories.</p><p></p><p>But the people of the Luoscha Kingdom, their longing for the "Arrival" has never faded.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary's eyes revealed a cold smile: "Unexpectedly, there is another wielder, yet you are still so foolish.</p><p></p><p>These lowly people, cutting one batch and another will grow, how can their lives be as important as ours?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not avoid the Dark Radiance, but even swallowed all the poisonous rain into his belly, which exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>His original plan was to use the poisonous rain to force the Arrival to be timid and gradually wear him down, before finally slaying him.</p><p></p><p>But the Arrival directly consumed it all.</p><p></p><p>This saved him the trouble.</p><p></p><p>He had already seen the Arrival's divine power constantly collapsing.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, He would completely perish.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, from the shrinking figure, a lazy voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"With so many people calling the Arrival, if I were an armored warrior or Ultraman, perhaps I could draw upon the power of their hearts to unleash a small universe and slay you."</p><p></p><p>"But alas, I am not, I am just myself, a game player portraying the Arrival."</p><p></p><p>As his voice fell.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The hundred-zhang giant suddenly collapsed and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Appearing before the people was a stunningly handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary looked at this person, his eyes revealing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Arrival has perished, your greatest support is gone, who gave you the courage to spout nonsense in front of me!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary looked at this overly young man, his eyes filled with longing for youth, as well as murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, this Qi Yuan could be considered exceptionally talented.</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, he had probably reached the threshold of the divine level, and mastered the divine Arrival artifact.</p><p></p><p>However, high talent is high, but without the Arrival, what is he? A casual divine-level armored soldier could easily slay him.</p><p></p><p>"Without the Arrival... can't I kill you?" Qi Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Without portraying the Arrival, he felt the world had become much better.</p><p></p><p>However... he still had to continue portraying the Arrival.</p><p></p><p>Under the bewildered and shocked gazes of the Fifth Extraordinary and many divine-level armored soldiers.</p><p></p><p>A voice resounded through the royal capital.</p><p></p><p>"Your Arrival... has returned."</p><p></p><p>"I... am the Judgment God!"</p><p></p><p>"If there is any injustice, call upon me, the Arrival!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will slay the gods!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful, terrifying aura swept up towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The handsome and peerless man spoke: "I am also a god!"</p><p></p><p>"A divine-level armored soldier!"</p><p></p><p>"He is actually a divine-level armored soldier!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>The six divine-level armored soldiers present were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>They never expected the wielder of the Arrival to be a divine-level armored soldier.</p><p></p><p>And this divine-level armored soldier was terrifyingly young! "You are actually a divine-level armored soldier, good, good, good!" The Fifth Extraordinary said three "goods" in a row.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat surprised, somewhat fearful, but full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>This young divine-level armored soldier... shockingly extraordinary, but absolutely just entered the divine level.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this one has the Arrival, his inner arrogance led him to come to the royal capital to slay him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he had hidden and cultivated for a hundred years, wouldn't he be invincible under heaven?</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will slay you, eradicate the root!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary struck fiercely, with the power of the peak of the Three Steps to the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an urgent voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Attack together, we must keep him alive."</p><p></p><p>Not only did he bully the small, but he also bullied the few with the many.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the other five divine-level armored soldiers also stepped forward, surrounding and attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Facing the six-person encirclement, Qi Yuan remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this posturing is tiring."</p><p></p><p>"Now let you all see, what is the existence of a technique-type player! One-shot clear!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored light appeared, leaving traces of a massive blood sword.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Changes and Myriad Transformations!</p><p></p><p>In a flash, there were thousands of Qi Yuans in the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>Each of them wielding a blood-colored giant sword, slashing forward.</p><p></p><p>Lethal Radiance! Tyrannical Power!</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique! At this moment, Qi Yuan was utterly unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>His combat arts, combat techniques, in the mundane world, in the extraordinary, in the divine and immortal, belong to the strongest kind of existence.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by seven gods?</p><p></p><p>It's clearly him alone surrounding and attacking seven gods!</p><p></p><p>Without descending as a god, merely by portraying, without the need to pose, his power may not be as strong as descending as a god, but his killing power far exceeds it.</p><p></p><p>Various hidden and damaging techniques, nothing is lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"All of you die!"</p><p></p><p>"BGM, play for me!"</p><p></p><p>Countless drones flew into the sky, some transforming into speakers, some into bell-ringing and drum-beating celestial soldiers, some into demon-like figures blowing horns.</p><p></p><p>Various strange and melodious resounding sounds arose.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt as if he had divine assistance.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary's face revealed a horrified expression: "What are these?"</p><p></p><p>The other divine-level armored soldiers also had a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Because in this clash, they realized that this Qi Yuan... seemed even more terrifying than the Arrival.</p><p></p><p>"This is my BGM."</p><p></p><p>"And your funeral music!"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three supreme imperial rulers of the demonic clan were also shot and killed by the Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>In another half a month, my... task will be completed," Jinli was also learning to speak like Qiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"The task is completed? So fast! Impressive, after you're done, don't log off, wait for me for a while, we'll meet up in person!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Jinli held the Linglong Jade Tide in her hand.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Imperial Guards in her grasp, she could truly be considered the Empress of Nangqian.</p><p></p><p>The taste of power in her hands was indeed intoxicating.</p><p></p><p>But she, who had always loved the clear springs and fresh winds, and knew her own position well, soon snapped out of it.</p><p></p><p>"The matter here is done, it's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>"I was never a qualified ruler anyway, so leaving is no big deal."</p><p></p><p>She had done her best with the matters at hand, relying on the Imperial Guards to eliminate the demonic clan and suppress the Holy Gate of Tianrun, cutting off some crises, and the matters after her would be left to those who came after her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jinli sat by the window, gazing blankly at the distant ancient Qichu trees.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, here's the invitation!"</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Qiyuan was awakened from his dream by someone calling out.</p><p></p><p>After killing so many people in the game, he had gotten used to it. Qiyuan no longer had nightmares.</p><p></p><p>But killing so many people was really tiring, and he had been sleeping longer than usual these past few days.</p><p></p><p>Awakened now, he rubbed his sleepy eyes and pushed the hair blocking his brow aside: "What? What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan felt a bit grumpy upon waking up.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered that there was something important, so he suppressed his grumpiness.</p><p></p><p>Stepping out of the thatched hut, Qiyuan saw the graceful Jiang Lingsu standing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Peach blossoms and plum flowers, arched eyebrows and bright eyes, she also looked playful and cute.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful things were a feast for the eyes, and his grumpiness dissipated a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, this is an invitation for the Sect Master." Jiang Lingsu handed the invitation to Qiyuan, "The Sect Master asked Qingying to bring it, and she also said the Sect Master has a message for you."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What message?" Qiyuan took the invitation.</p><p></p><p>The invitation looked quite high-end and classy, with a ink painting on the outside.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master said you can open the invitation and take a look." Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the Sect Master had up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He opened the invitation and read it carefully, his brow immediately furrowing.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his grumpiness upon waking up was justified.</p><p></p><p>He was startled, wondering if it was because he had mentioned the Hall of Light the other day, and the powerful cultivator from the Hall of Light had sensed it and sent an invitation, wanting to see his master?</p><p></p><p>The invitation was issued in the name of the Hall of Light.</p><p></p><p>The content was quite simple, basically saying that the Foundation Establishment cultivator Zhu Lianhua had come to the Great Liang, and wished to invite some of the top righteous cultivators of the Great Liang to gather and discuss the future situation of the cultivation world of the Great Liang, to determine the development of the Great Liang.</p><p></p><p>Before the gathering, he would first come to pay respects to the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua would be coming to the Shenguang Sect in the next few days, the specific time was uncertain, so the Shenguang Sect needed to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>After reading the content of the invitation, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't coming to cause him trouble, he had worried too much.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the content of the invitation, his eyes carrying a cold smile: "This guy is even better at acting than me!"</p><p></p><p>He handed the invitation to Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>After all, this wasn't something that needed to be kept secret.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu took the invitation and read it, biting her silver teeth, especially after seeing that name, a trace of faint killing intent flashed in her eyes: "This Zhu Lianhua is truly laughable, so high and mighty, thinking he's someone important? A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet he's putting on such a grand show!"</p><p></p><p>The tone in the invitation, Zhu Lianhua's attitude, could be described as extremely arrogant and high-handed.</p><p></p><p>And the specific time of his arrival was uncertain, yet he demanded that Qiyuan and the others prepare to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>Treating them like he was a leader coming for an inspection?</p><p></p><p>And to discuss the future situation of the cultivation world of the Great Liang, determine the development of the Great Liang, that kind of attitude, any cultivator of the Great Liang who saw it would probably want to say: Who the hell are you, what qualifications do you have?</p><p></p><p>In the invitation, Zhu Lianhua's arrogance was fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>"Great minds think alike." Qiyuan fully agreed with his shijie's words.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu continued, "The people of the Hall of Light have always been like this, especially when they go to some small places, the people of their organization are even more like they have their eyes on the top of their heads.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity that they do have the capital to be arrogant.</p><p></p><p>It's best we don't offend them, otherwise... there may be some trouble."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu also had some fear of the Hall of Light.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just fear, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go give the invitation to the Sect Master." Qiyuan held the invitation, his mood suddenly improving.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he could see his master again.</p><p></p><p>After a few months of not seeing him, he missed him dearly.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan went up to the middle of the mountain, once again encountering the barrier blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>He held the invitation and shouted loudly, "Sect Master, the people from the Hall of Light have come to pay respects, this is the invitation."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he held the invitation up, his eyes looking towards the front.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see his Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gust of wind blew by, causing the invitation to flutter.</p><p></p><p>The moon on the mountain peak seemed to have poured out a ray of moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The light and shadow formed two words: Not Seeing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the light and shadow dissipated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Not Seeing, I understand." Qiyuan was a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He looked around but did not see the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>He held the invitation letter and felt the material: "It seems quite expensive, I'll sell it later and see if I can exchange it for a spirit stone."</p><p></p><p>A day later, in the market around the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>A figure in extraordinary attire appeared, accompanied by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>That Foundation Establishment cultivator had already reached the peak of Foundation Establishment, but in the presence of another Foundation Establishment cultivator, he appeared very obsequious.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhu, this is the market below the Divine Light Sect. </p><p></p><p>However, it's shabby and doesn't have much good stuff, not as good as your Radiant Palace."  The peak Foundation Establishment cultivator spoke out loud instead of using voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the people in the market had never heard of the Radiant Palace and were indifferent to his words.</p><p></p><p>Only a cultivator completely shrouded in a cloak seemed to have heard something, his heartbeat pausing momentarily before pretending nothing was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua swept his gaze across the market, saying lightly, "It'll do, I can set foot here, hoping to find some treasures."</p><p></p><p>This time he came to the Divine Light Sect, first, naturally, with the intention of paying respects to the peak master of the Seven-Colored Peak, the number one expert of the sect; second, there were recent rumors that a supreme treasure had appeared in the Divine Light Sect, manifesting several anomalies, and such a supreme treasure would be possessed by one of virtue.</p><p></p><p>He came from the Radiant Palace, so he was a man of great virtue.</p><p></p><p>The latter thought was the true purpose of his visit this time.</p><p></p><p>The peak Foundation Establishment cultivator chuckled upon hearing this: "Fellow Daoist Zhu has also come for that supreme treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"If it truly is a treasure of that level, I must personally take it away. </p><p></p><p>The Divine Light Sect's temple is too small, keeping such a treasure here, I'm afraid their strength is insufficient to control it, and it may bring calamity."  Zhu Lianhua said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>The peak Foundation Establishment cultivator Wang Shuang inwardly despised him, but still flattered, "Fellow Daoist Zhu is truly a person of the Radiant Palace, caring for all under heaven.</p><p></p><p>Although we have not yet established a relationship with the Divine Light Sect, you are already concerned for them."</p><p></p><p>"You said this Five Elements Supreme Treasure, has the Divine Light Sect already obtained it?" Zhu Lianhua asked.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang pondered, "Even if they have obtained it, they probably have not announced it publicly."</p><p></p><p>"You think, if I offer them a recommendation spot to enter the Radiant Palace in exchange for their treasure, would they agree?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang was also taken aback upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>A recommendation spot to enter the Radiant Palace was indeed precious.</p><p></p><p>But it was just that.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Palace was powerful, but too far from the Great Desolate!</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang revered Zhu Lianhua, but if Zhu Lianhua really pushed him to the edge, he would dare to kill Zhu Lianhua.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he hadn't been pushed to the edge, who would take such a risk? Wang Shuang was at a loss for words towards this cultivator from a great place, but still said, "I'm afraid the Divine Light Sect may not recognize the value of this treasure."</p><p></p><p>The implication was that the Divine Light Sect would not bring out the treasure.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua, upon hearing this, was not surprised: "Looks like I'll have to find another way."</p><p></p><p>He was usually arrogant.</p><p></p><p>But he also understood that he couldn't really push people to the edge.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his identity wouldn't count for much.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Desolate Kingdom, although he looked down on all Foundation Establishment cultivators, if a Nascent Soul cultivator came and took a risk, disregarding his life and property, he would also suffer.</p><p></p><p>The two walked through the market, sometimes communicating through voice transmission, sometimes "projecting" their voices.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang then said, "I've learned a secret treasure-seeking technique, though it's sometimes effective and sometimes not, but occasionally I can still find some treasures.</p><p></p><p>Today, I'll show off a bit for you, and find some treasures to offer to you."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang's attitude was very humble, he had already grasped some of Zhu Lianhua's personality.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Zhu Lianhua, upon hearing this, was very interested: "Let's see what you've got."</p><p></p><p>The technique Wang Shuang used was called the Heavenly Treasure-Seeking Art.</p><p></p><p>For some rare and precious treasures, he would have a sense of them.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that in this market, there wouldn't be anything too precious to be found, so he decided that if he couldn't find anything, he would pay for it himself.</p><p></p><p>Activating the technique, a golden light flashed in Wang Shuang's pupils.</p><p></p><p>About half an incense stick's worth of time passed, and Wang Shuang's brow brightened: "Unexpectedly, I really found a treasure here, Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment, I'll go buy it and show it to you."</p><p></p><p>The two went together, and the stall owner might see Zhu Lianhua's extraordinary attire and arbitrarily raise the price.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua nodded, he also consciously did not go with him.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Wang Shuang failed to find a treasure, he wouldn't have the opportunity to secretly replace it with something for him.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the market, waiting quietly.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before Wang Shuang returned with a joyful expression: "Fellow Daoist, I only spent one spirit stone and succeeded in finding a treasure. Quick, take a look, what is this!"</p><p></p><p>As Wang Shuang spoke, he held up what he had found: "Although it looks quite ornate, and is damaged and broken, the material..."</p><p></p><p>He trailed off, noticing Zhu Lianhua's expression was not good.</p><p></p><p>Had he said something wrong?</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang felt a bit afraid: "Fellow Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua snatched the item Wang Shuang had found from his hand, his expression unchanging: "Where did this thing come from?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang's heart sank, carefully asking, "Fellow Daoist, do you recognize this treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"This is no treasure at all!" Zhu Lianhua threw the item on the ground, "This is the invitation letter I gave to the Divine Light Sect!"</p><p></p><p>He was clearly furious, his anger evident.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang was also stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the "treasure" he had found was actually Zhu Lianhua's invitation letter to the Divine Light Sect!</p><p></p><p>This was just...too absurd!

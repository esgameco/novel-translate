        <h1>Chapter 290</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All the female stars were intently watching the sea surface, seemingly very eager to catch the "little cutie" Qi Yuan had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan seemed truly enthusiastic about that thing, Kuanghuan ordered all his subordinates to fish as well. </p><p></p><p>"Whoever catches it, I'll give them a small gift," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all the female stars and Kuanghuan's subordinates became tense.</p><p></p><p>A small gift from a big shot like Mr. Qi would surely be very valuable. </p><p></p><p>It might even be worth hundreds of thousands or millions of Qin yuan.</p><p></p><p>They placed their hands on the fishing rods, gazing at the sea surface full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan was also sea fishing. He lowered his voice and asked, "Is this little... cutie related to immortal cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>After all, anything that could attract Qi Yuan's attention should be related to the legendary immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all," Qi Yuan shook his head, "It should be related to martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts?" Kuanghuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>As a nobleman of the Qin Yuan country, Kuanghuan was naturally very familiar with martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He had once been interested in practicing some martial arts, but found that martial arts were really too weak, not even as practical as what a random military hand-to-hand combat instructor would teach, let alone genetic enhancement drugs.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't martial arts very weak?" Kuanghuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan had seen the strongest martial artist, the champion of the martial arts tournament before.</p><p></p><p>He had some strength, but it was just so-so.</p><p></p><p>"There are no weak paths in this world, only weak people," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuan still didn't understand in his heart: "Isn't sir on the path of immortal cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"I mainly cultivate immortality, but here... I want to take a look at martial arts. After all, I'm a man who wants to become the Martial God of Ten Thousand Paths."</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Martial God of Ten Thousand Paths was Qi Yuan's mission in coming to this world.</p><p></p><p>Before becoming the Martial God of Ten Thousand Paths, he still needed to become the Martial Lord of the Human Path, as well as the Martial Lord of the Spirit Path.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Martial Lord of the Human Path was still simple, but Qi Yuan had no clue about becoming the Martial Lord of the Spirit Path.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, if it's convenient for you, help me look into information about the Martial Lord of Ten Thousand Paths," Qi Yuan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Kuanghuan quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that doing things for Qi Yuan was also a happy matter.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the cultivation method I sold you is currently only an incomplete version, but it's enough for you to cultivate for a few years. When my wife comes down, I'll give you the subsequent cultivation method," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The "Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique" was currently only at the Qi Refining stage, and hadn't even perfected Qi Refining yet.</p><p></p><p>This was because Qi Yuan was still under a curse and couldn't think too deeply. Only when his strength was greater could he improve the subsequent cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many thoughts flashed through Kuanghuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, if it was a real immortal cultivation method, how could one buy the complete version for just 100 million? More importantly, was that money just buying the cultivation method? It was buying a connection with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Kuanghuan quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he knew Qi Yuan's true strength, forget 100 million to buy an incomplete method, even 10 billion, 100 billion or even 1 trillion would be an incredible bargain for him.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a cultivation method created by Qi Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>The value was beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Kuanghuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan said, "Since we're just sitting around, bring over some materials for me to process. Hmm, gold, water, wood..."</p><p></p><p>Now that they were fishing here.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't practice martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As for immortal cultivation, due to the curse, it was progressing very slowly.</p><p></p><p>Might as well get some materials to refine into medicinal liquids to increase his strength a bit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was also thinking of using other methods to attract the little cutie in the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Kuanghuan was excited internally, seeming to finally be able to see Qi Yuan in action.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he and some subordinates brought over a pile of materials.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the female stars looked puzzled, not knowing what this was for.</p><p></p><p>"Bring a blender, and a high-temperature pot, and also..." Qi Yuan said to the expectant Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuan was stunned, but still instructed his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his heart was full of confusion, what were these... for? Qi Yuan patted his hands and said: "If you can be lazy, you should be lazy."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the blender and other equipment were brought over. Qi Yuan took those plants and put them into the blender one by one.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the machine starting up was heard.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present looked on curiously, watching those plants being ground up.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some people were also watching the sea surface, wanting to fish up the little cutie.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it's done."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up a wine glass and poured a bunch of dark blue medicinal liquid into it.</p><p></p><p>He drank the liquid in the wine glass in one gulp, and his cultivation method began to operate frantically at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level was also constantly improving at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to have a drink... but well, you need to use it with the 'Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique'," Qi Yuan also poured a glass for Kuanghuan.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't much spiritual energy on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>It was far inferior to the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>So these medicinal liquids were needed to assist cultivation, with better effects.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan also vaguely sensed that the spiritual energy on Gongxing seemed to be slowly increasing.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the rate of increase was too slow.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuan was delighted internally: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>He immediately recalled the cultivation method Qi Yuan had sold him, and began to circulate it in his mind according to what the method said.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, when he wanted to circulate it, he felt as if his body was out of control, and that energy simply couldn't circulate, as if it was blocked by something.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's finger pointed at Kuanghuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan suddenly felt a sense of enlightenment, and the energy flowing inside his body began to circulate rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"Drink."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice came again, and Kuanghuan hurriedly swallowed a glass of green liquid.</p><p></p><p>A strange sense of exhilaration came over him, making him feel like he was floating. This feeling of pleasure was ten or a hundred times stronger than sexual climax.</p><p></p><p>Kuanghuan suddenly opened his eyes, his face showing a shocked and delighted expression: "Immortal technique, it must be an immortal technique!"</p><p></p><p>This feeling was addictive.</p><p></p><p>It even made Kuanghuan suspect if he had taken some hallucinogenic drug.</p><p></p><p>But these liquids were made from ordinary plants, without any prohibited elements at all.</p><p></p><p>"Your aptitude is too poor, it will probably take you a month or two to get started," Qi Yuan casually commented.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he wasn't cultivating Qi Yuan's self-created method, even with a cultivation method, this Kuanghuan would probably take ten years to get started.</p><p></p><p>His lifetime achievement would probably just be hovering at the early stages of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kuanghuan felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>One or two months, he could wait for that.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan picked up another glass of medicinal liquid, his hand lightly tapping the wine glass.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a red light emanated from the wine glass.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi, who was next to him, was stunned by this sight: "Is this... magic?"</p><p></p><p>The other female stars were also very surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a drink that had just been made, and suddenly it was glowing red.</p><p></p><p>This was very unscientific.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and said: "Added some bait, to see if it can attract the little cutie."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he tossed the wine glass towards the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>The wine glass suddenly exploded in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The red liquid fell like raindrops.</p><p></p><p>This scene stunned everyone present.</p><p></p><p>A female star covered her mouth and couldn't help saying, "Has Mr. Qi taken genetic enhancement drugs?"</p><p></p><p>Genetic enhancement drugs were very expensive, and there were different levels.</p><p></p><p>To achieve the effect Qi Yuan just demonstrated, it must be a high-level genetic enhancement drug. Even if ordinary people had money, they wouldn't have the channels to buy it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how even a hereditary viscount respected Qi Yuan so much, it seemed reasonable that Qi Yuan would have high-level genetic enhancement drugs.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>These celebrities were qualified and wealthy enough to buy and use ordinary gene drugs.</p><p></p><p>However, some gene drugs naturally conflicted with beauty drugs and would affect their body's flexibility, so few women would take gene drugs.</p><p></p><p>Low-level gene drugs might damage the aesthetic beauty of their bodies. So very few female celebrities would choose gene drugs.</p><p></p><p>Some male action stars, however, would use gene drugs for better performance effects.</p><p></p><p>"No." Qi Yuan shook his head, "Keep watching, my little darling might be about to take the bait."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others hurriedly continued fishing.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute, and Qi Yuan kept drinking the potion.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level was constantly improving.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he entered the middle stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this didn't mean much to him.</p><p></p><p>With more resources, he would quickly enter the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>None of this was important. For Qi Yuan, becoming a Myriad Dao Martial God was the purpose of coming to this Arching Star game.</p><p></p><p>The liquid splashed onto the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>The previously calm sea surface now had many more creatures.</p><p></p><p>Many fish swam towards this area.</p><p></p><p>More and more people caught fish, and many were precious fish.</p><p></p><p>However, to the disappointment of those who caught fish, none of them were the "little darling" Qi Yuan needed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a burly man in a suit turned red-faced: "The fish is so big, I can't pull it up."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his posture became unstable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, two or three of the other mercenaries came forward, wanting to help that mercenary catch the fish.</p><p></p><p>The female celebrities around all showed delighted expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a shark?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that mercenary's face became anxious: "Not good, the fishing rod is about to break!"</p><p></p><p>The creature at the bottom of the sea was too strong. Even with three or four mercenaries together, they couldn't pull it up, and the fishing rod was about to break.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that this fishing rod and line were made of special alloy, easily able to catch sea fish weighing hundreds of pounds.</p><p></p><p>For this situation to occur now showed that the creature in the sea was extremely unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Let me."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan stood up and grabbed the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>The previously deformed fishing rod suddenly straightened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sea surface, as if seeing through the water.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually... my little darling."</p><p></p><p>His hand suddenly shook.</p><p></p><p>The fishing rod that four or five mercenaries couldn't hold became extremely stable.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the other end of the fishing line retracted.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow was thrown into the reception room at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on that fish.</p><p></p><p>"So... so ugly!"</p><p></p><p>Some female celebrities covered their mouths, involuntarily showing disgust in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi's long legs pressed together, almost falling from fright. Her body half-squatted, her buttocks like a full moon tightly wrapped by her dress, seemingly intentionally or unintentionally about to fall towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The people present looked at that strange black shadow, all showing surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>That black shadow had a head like a chicken, but a featherless chicken. The blood-red fleshy protuberance on its forehead looked quite fierce.</p><p></p><p>Its lower body, however, was a black gelatinous mass, sticky and looking quite strange.</p><p></p><p>It didn't look like a normal creature from Arching Star.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a sea monster?"狂欢, being knowledgeable, recognized this creature at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Sea monster?"</p><p></p><p>"This is actually a sea monster!"</p><p></p><p>The female celebrities present all showed astonished expressions.</p><p></p><p>Some female celebrities showed disgusted and nauseated expressions, as they had drunk sea monster soup before.</p><p></p><p>But they had never seen the original appearance of a sea monster.</p><p></p><p>"My little darling is a sea monster?" Qi Yuan looked at this ugly-looking sea monster, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when he saw the sea monster, he swallowed a bit, feeling a desire to swallow it.</p><p></p><p>"No, this isn't an ordinary sea monster, this is a mutated sea monster!" 狂欢 showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>This sea monster was very small, barely the size of a soccer ball.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary sea monsters generally follow basic laws.</p><p></p><p>Even four or five mercenaries couldn't pull this sea monster up.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that this sea monster was very unusual, not following basic laws.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it must be a mutated sea monster.</p><p></p><p>Sea monsters are expensive, and mutated sea monsters are even more precious.</p><p></p><p>Just this soccer ball-sized sea monster was probably worth over a million.</p><p></p><p>"A mutated sea monster?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan bent down, wanting to reach out and touch the sea monster.</p><p></p><p>狂欢's face tightened: "Be careful, mutated sea monsters are very dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Mutated sea monsters represent the unknown and dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Their flesh might contain some kind of radiation. Touching them casually without protective measures could easily lead to death.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, it's not a mutated sea monster, it's my little darling.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... it will also become my true love."</p><p></p><p>A smile squeezed out of Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His hand stroked the slimy skin of the mutated sea monster. The arrogant and fierce sea monster now trembled, as if it had encountered its natural enemy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, 狂欢 was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had seen mutated sea monsters before and knew their temperament.</p><p></p><p>They were violent, chaotic organisms.</p><p></p><p>In their minds, there was no concept of fear.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was trembling like a frightened pet.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi, standing nearby, forced herself to approach despite her disgust: "Mr. Qi is so loving, treating such a... uniquely featured sea monster so gently."</p><p></p><p>She was trying to please Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had said this mutated sea monster might even be his true love.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it normal for such wealthy and powerful people to have some special preferences?</p><p></p><p>"This sea monster looks a bit strange at first glance, but the more you look at it, the cuter it becomes. The little guy looks quite... distinctive," Wu Qi lied through her teeth, trying to get closer to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but glance at Wu Qi, looking at the flesh-colored stockings on her long, round legs. He decided to have Ning Tao wear a pair when she came down, it would surely be quite charming.</p><p></p><p>"Deep fry it," Qi Yuan said at this point.</p><p></p><p>Deep fry... the little darling?</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he just say it was his true love? Hearing this, 狂欢 quickly gave orders: "Deep fry this mutated sea monster!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the mercenary who had caught the mutated sea monster.</p><p></p><p>The mercenary's face immediately showed uncontrollable joy.</p><p></p><p>"I'll reward you with a cup... a piece of paper."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he took out a napkin from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>He took out a twig, dipped it in the potion, and then drew something on this napkin.</p><p></p><p>After a few moments, a napkin with a ghost talisman drawn on it fell into the mercenary's hand.</p><p></p><p>"It can save your life once," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>This talisman he drew casually was a defensive talisman.</p><p></p><p>Even if a bomb fell on him, it could save his life.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and thank Mr. Qi!" 狂欢 quickly said.</p><p></p><p>The mercenary didn't quite understand, but still hurriedly accepted it with thanks.</p><p></p><p>He thought this might be an artwork created by the big shot, perhaps worth tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it might be worth tens of thousands, he felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>The other female celebrities also looked envious, especially Wu Qi.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 408</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, who in the world doesn't know about Qi Yuan eliminating the great calamity nowadays?</p><p></p><p>It was quite awkward that his son-in-law shared the same name.</p><p></p><p>When Wang Lingtong heard this, even though he was a great master, his heart started pounding at that moment. </p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked towards the stairs ahead, and saw a figure in a blood-red robe slowly coming down, his footsteps making tapping sounds on the steps.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu, in a plain white robe, was holding that figure's arm, with barely suppressed joy in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all the cultivators who were drinking in the place put down their cups and silently stood up.</p><p></p><p>In the tavern, only the sound of footsteps on the wooden stairs could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua didn't notice those cultivators standing up, but the sound of Qi Yuan's footsteps on the stairs made him blush a little.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, his son-in-law was indeed like him, coming from a small place, with similar quality - even his walking was so noisy. </p><p></p><p>Didn't he see how quiet it was here?</p><p></p><p>Quality! He decided that when they returned to the Eastern Land, he must educate Qi Yuan properly. When going out, one shouldn't embarrass the cultivators of the Eastern Land.</p><p></p><p>When that blood-colored figure came into view, revealing an exceptionally handsome face with a hint of laziness, as if still drowsy from spring slumber, Jiang Ruhua suddenly stood up. Seeing that young man holding his precious daughter, he was about to question him.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw all the cultivators present bowing in unison, and a deafening sound swept through at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Blood-robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"The elder eliminated the great calamity, his merits are boundless. He should be the human emperor of our Azure Waves Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The voices were in perfect unison, as if from one person, splitting rocks and flowing clouds, resounding to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the great masters in the tavern called out in unison. No matter how noble their former status or illustrious their background,</p><p></p><p>They were utterly humble before that figure in the blood-colored robe.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua blinked, as if doubting his own ears and eyes.</p><p></p><p>His heart felt empty, as if struck by lightning, his whole body tingling.</p><p></p><p>The voices of these cultivators turned into a ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan... was it Qi Yuan?!!</p><p></p><p>He felt at a loss, unable to think straight.</p><p></p><p>He was anxious, having just made harsh remarks about giving Qi Yuan a bloody nose.</p><p></p><p>Now he was in a dilemma, and could only play dead. Then... immense joy welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist... had made it big?</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong secretly glanced at Jiang Ruhua, still somewhat expecting this brother to actually go...</p><p></p><p>Of course, he only dared to think about it, not even daring to think too much.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person before them had eliminated three thousand great calamities!</p><p></p><p>He had thousands of Yang Spirit Celestial Lords under his command!</p><p></p><p>Even in the upper realms, he would likely be a supreme being! At this moment, Qi Yuan, with a lazy expression, yawned, his eyes still filled with intense weariness.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze over the great masters present, as well as Jiang Ruhua who seemed to need urgent care, and slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The title of Human Emperor represents responsibility. I... am not worthy."</p><p></p><p>To be Human Emperor is to shoulder the burden of Azure Waves.</p><p></p><p>He had swallowed the entire Azure Waves Realm, so how could he shoulder it?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, unworthy!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, all the great masters dared not speak, not even to object.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the Blood-robed Sword God who had eliminated the great calamity! His words were more effective than laws.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Jiang Ruhua was now certain that Qi Yuan was the real Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, were these cultivators here to... put on a show?</p><p></p><p>No wonder he couldn't discern these cultivators' cultivation levels. The weakest among them... were probably all great masters.</p><p></p><p>"The elder should be the common ruler of the world!" White Fish Great Master bowed deeply, this former number one of the Azure Waves Realm said.</p><p></p><p>The other great masters all echoed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Now that the great calamity had been eliminated, if the Blood-robed Sword God did not become the common ruler of the world, how could they exist? After all, in the current Azure Waves Realm, the myriad stars were gone, only ten suns hung in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Where was the future and the path ahead?</p><p></p><p>"Although the great calamity has been eliminated, you still bear the marks left by the one behind the calamity.</p><p></p><p>That's why I swallowed the Azure Waves Realm and placed it within my purple palace.</p><p></p><p>If you leave my purple palace, the one behind the calamity could take revenge with a single thought, and you would all perish.</p><p></p><p>So... you'll have to temporarily reside within my purple palace.</p><p></p><p>I'm very generous. This time I swallowed you without your consent, it's a bit like forced renting... so I won't charge you rent."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily, his voice calm.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding great masters looked at each other in surprise or with faces full of doubt upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Wang Lingtong stepped forward and said loudly: "Everything the Blood-robed Sword God elder said is true. I come from the Star Departure Realm. The Celestial Lord of my realm once said that the person behind the great calamity left marks within us living beings. Our lives and deaths are but a thought away.</p><p></p><p>Now that the great calamity has dissipated, if that person finds out, they may extinguish the marks and reap us all!"</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators broke out in cold sweat upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity was already so terrifying and unstoppable, the person behind it... was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>All the calculations and thoughts they had before coming here had turned to nothing.</p><p></p><p>White Fish Great Master stepped forward at this moment, his gaze determined: "The elder's will is the will of the Azure Waves Realm!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he did not mention the common ruler of the world.</p><p></p><p>After all, all living beings in the Azure Waves Realm owed Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested in these things. I'm just a cultivator with no ambition, weak power, barely able to protect myself, somewhat socially anxious and reclusive.</p><p></p><p>Alas, it's all forced by this damned social atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>If Black Mountain Sect hadn't been so rampant, Light Palace hadn't been so oppressive, Dark Sun hadn't been so arrogant, and the great calamity hadn't been so ruthless.</p><p></p><p>If some netizens hadn't been cursing me online every day, how would I have become so tired? I just hope to see a peaceful, friendly, harmonious cultivation world with positive atmosphere, that's all.</p><p></p><p>If it were like that, I could stay in the sect playing games every day, how nice that would be!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He was socially anxious to begin with, not suited to be a savior.</p><p></p><p>Being one in games was fine, but there was no need in reality.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this speech, the other great masters looked at each other, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-robed Sword God's words truly left them bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at her senior brother, her eyes twinkling with amusement.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother was still the familiar senior brother, always saying such peculiar things.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, elder. We will do our utmost to purify the atmosphere of the cultivation world!" White Fish Great Master spoke up, his voice resolute.</p><p></p><p>The great masters who used to like cursing broke out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to create a peaceful and loving cultivation world for the elder!"</p><p></p><p>"Very good, very good." Qi Yuan casually praised, then said, "Wait a moment. Earlier when fighting the great calamity, the aftermath caused many living beings to perish. Alas, this is all my fault."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed. Fighting the great calamity inevitably had aftereffects. Even with the yin-yang separation of the underworld, it was hard to avoid.</p><p></p><p>White Fish Great Master hurriedly said: "The guilt of this battle is not the elder's fault!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the crime of the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>No one dared to blame Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone did blame him, these great masters would not let those voices reach Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, clever as I am, I was prepared."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan in his blood-colored robe stretched out his palm. With his words, his previously lazy demeanor vanished completely. His aura became incomparably sacred, like a deity seated in the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>His arm around Jiang Lingsu remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan like this, Jiang Ruhua felt the urge to prostrate himself in worship.</p><p></p><p>The other great masters had the same thought.</p><p></p><p>The previous Blood-robed Sword God had been too approachable and amiable, too dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>This solemnity was more fitting for his temperament.</p><p></p><p>Infinitely sacred, mysteriously unfathomable. Suddenly, his aura became extremely dark.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a gate to the underworld had opened in the world, with endless mysterious energy permeating.</p><p></p><p>That majestic and towering deity opened his mouth, his voice vast and profound, like an ancient sacrificial chant.</p><p></p><p>"Soul, return!</p><p>The four directions cannot be relied upon!</p><p></p><p>Rootless and lush,</p><p>Duckweed floating up and down.</p><p></p><p>Helpless and alone,</p><p>Catkins drifting in the wind.</p><p></p><p>All my marks,</p><p>Return!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice sounded, the heavens and earth trembled at this moment.</p><p></p><p>An eerie aura intensified to the extreme. </p><p></p><p>It was as if the gates of the underworld had opened.</p><p></p><p>This voice spread throughout the Azure Waves Realm, heard by all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the voice of the Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators and mortals, as well as insects and beasts, were bewildered.</p><p></p><p>All the great masters also inexplicably investigated. They saw that nearby, the shattered mountains and rivers, and the dead mortals and cultivators, were all mysteriously summoned and called back from death.</p><p></p><p>"I'm... still alive?"</p><p></p><p>"No, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Father, you're alive!!"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were shocked, while some showed expressions of fear.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, all the living beings who had perished in this great battle were awakening at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies, some having become wandering souls, transformed back to their original form in an instant, fully restored.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators who witnessed this scene all revered it as a divine miracle.</p><p></p><p>And in the Azure Waves Realm, who else but the Blood-Robed Sword God Qi Yuan could perform such a miracle!</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>Countless people kowtowed in worship, while some cultivators trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>This had already surpassed their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those great masters, even in ancient records, there was no account of such a scene before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a trace of complex emotion flashed in the eyes of the divine-looking Qi Yuan: "The boundary between life and death, it turns out to be transformation. Sigh, another day of growing brains."</p><p></p><p>While using the Netherworld function, Qi Yuan seemed to gain some insight, understanding that life and death, from a certain perspective, is also a conversion of energy, a transformation of all things.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat similar to Ning Tao's realization when entering the Yang Spirit realm, that time does not exist, time is change.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had only gained a tiny bit of understanding. Regarding his Netherworld, there seemed to be much more unknown.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua, seeing this scene, swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>As for punching his sinuses, he didn't even dare to think about it.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God before him was powerful beyond his comprehension and imagination.</p><p></p><p>Those great masters felt it even more deeply than him.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful they were, the more they understood how astounding this divine miracle of the Blood-Robed Sword God was!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, is there anything else?" Qi Yuan spoke, his divine aura disappearing as he reverted to that ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator of the Divine Light Sect from before. "If not, I'm going back to catch up on some sleep."</p><p></p><p>He was still very tired and exhausted.</p><p></p><p>The previous battle had consumed too much of his mental energy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Lingtong suddenly knelt down, and Wang Lingshan beside him also knelt.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Blood-Robed Sword God senior... swallow our Star Departure Realm!"</p><p></p><p>They had come here for the purpose of seeking the Blood-Robed Sword God's help.</p><p></p><p>After all, though the great calamity was destroyed, the marks on their bodies remained.</p><p></p><p>If that person from the Supreme Radiance Palace wished, all living beings in the Star Departure Realm would perish in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Blood-Robed Sword God didn't speak, Wang Lingtong continued: "As long as senior Blood-Robed Sword God swallows the Star Departure Realm, all the cultivation techniques of the Star Departure Realm will belong to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't senior want to improve the atmosphere of the cultivation world? Alas, most cultivators in the Star Departure Realm have some flaws, including alcoholics and foul-mouthed individuals. It still requires senior to rectify the atmosphere!"</p><p></p><p>"There are other worlds affected by the great calamity where the cultivation world is in a state of oppression. Many cultivators have mental issues, which also need the Blood-Robed Sword God to rectify the atmosphere!"</p><p></p><p>"All the cultivation techniques of the Three Thousand Realms will belong to senior Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, swallow the Three Thousand Realms whole!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong's voice was low and his attitude reverent.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had made some preparations before coming, learning about some of the Blood-Robed Sword God's personality.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also knew that serving a ruler was like serving a tiger. Presumptuous guessing and trying to please a powerful being's preferences might incur their displeasure.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he could not afford to be cautious anymore.</p><p></p><p>The Three Thousand Realms could be destroyed at any time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered briefly: "You make some sense."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation techniques were secondary.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the techniques of the Three Thousand Realms were not as good as those collected by the Buddhist Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Now, if that person from the Supreme Radiance Palace learned about the fate of the great calamity, they might activate the marks and harvest the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>After harvesting the Three Thousand Realms, that person from the Supreme Radiance Palace would certainly become somewhat stronger.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to prevent this evil Supreme Radiance Palace from growing stronger, he had the obligation to swallow the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Qi Yuan was a lawful good person who never killed innocents indiscriminately and would even blink when killing people, a law-abiding good person.</p><p></p><p>So, these Three Thousand Realms had to be swallowed whole!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, these are the coordinates of the Star Departure Realm. We will provide you with the coordinates of the remaining Three Thousand Realms as soon as possible!" Wang Lingtong was extremely excited and also relieved.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was willing to swallow them, the Three Thousand Realms still had a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe nearby heard this and felt somewhat joyful, but more regretful and disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Because his homeland had already been swallowed by the great calamity, leaving nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>"No need. When I destroyed the great calamity, I obtained all the coordinates," Qi Yuan said calmly, then looked at Wang Lingtong, "If I swallow so many realms at once, what if I get a stomachache?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Lingtong fell silent, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough talk. I'm going to swallow the Three Thousand Realms. After that, I'll sleep a bit more to digest." </p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan disappeared with Jiang Lingsu, leaving behind the great masters with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blood-Robed Sword God swallowing the Three Thousand Realms whole... it's simply unimaginable!" Great Master Baiyu spoke, his voice strange.</p><p></p><p>The other great masters also found it hard to imagine what kind of scene this would be.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Azure Waves Realm's fortune to have produced senior Blood-Robed Sword God!" a great master sighed.</p><p></p><p>With the great calamity resolved, they still felt as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>They knew deeply how powerful the great calamity was. The Azure Waves Realm alone had no power to resist it.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that the great calamity would be even more powerful than imagined. The Three Thousand Great Calamities were enough to make all cultivators lose the will to resist.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was still suppressed by the Blood-Robed Sword God!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wang Lingtong looked at Jiang Ruhua, took a deep breath, and transmitted a message, his voice carrying a hint of flattery: "Senior, I didn't expect that the woman by Blood-Robed Sword God's side would be your daughter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ruhua was initially delighted, but then thought, such a thing... how could you transmit it?</p><p></p><p>You should say it out loud!</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from big places really lack insight!</p><p></p><p>Seeing these great masters discussing the Blood-Robed Sword God, Jiang Ruhua suddenly felt inexplicably emotional, but his emotional voice was very loud: "Sigh, my son-in-law has quite an appetite, wanting to swallow three thousand realms at once. If he comes to visit my Jiang family, how could we possibly entertain him?"</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Ruhua's voice fell, the gazes of all the great masters present suddenly turned towards him.</p><p></p><p>Shock, surprise, awe... all kinds of looks.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Jiang Ruhua felt extremely gratified.</p><p></p><p>"My Jiang family is really too poor, alas," Jiang Ruhua sighed again.</p><p></p><p>Recommending an interesting novel, link below.</p><p></p><p>"I Became a God Through Dream Cultivation".</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Shen Yan arrives in a world plagued by demons and monsters. Here, to establish oneself, one must walk the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial arts of this world are quite strange, and can only be obtained through inheritance from deities.</p><p></p><p>To receive martial arts inheritance from deities, one must pay with something extremely important to oneself.</p><p></p><p>Once, someone went to awaken martial arts in order to avenge a deep blood feud.</p><p></p><p>He successfully awakened martial arts, but forgot about avenging the blood feud.</p><p></p><p>Someone went to awaken martial arts to protect their loved one.</p><p></p><p>Upon successful awakening, they completely forgot about their loved one.</p><p></p><p>In this world where demons and monsters want to kill and eat people, and deities are toying with humans.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yan refuses to trade with deities.

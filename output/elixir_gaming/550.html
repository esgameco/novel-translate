        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light shone on his face, and his eyes also seemed to emit an eerie glow, appearing ominous and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"A ghost!" </p><p></p><p>The three of them were frightened and couldn't help but let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the night, in the cemetery, the cold wind howled, and a person crawled out of the coffin, saying that they had scared him from his sleep - this was too creepy.</p><p></p><p>Even the restrained Zhao Yan was trembling all over, terribly afraid.</p><p></p><p>Although he greatly respected his master, he still did not want his master's ghost to come and find him.</p><p></p><p>However, the constantly trembling Wang Tong suddenly lost his mind and decisively said, "Master, since you're dead, don't come back!"</p><p></p><p>He took a dagger and lunged towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I just want to cultivate in peace, why are there always so many people coming to harass me?" Qi Yuan was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>His original plan was to continue the cultivation of the white-haired man.</p><p></p><p>Since the white-haired man had died, he would continue to use his coffin to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>With his talent, lying in the coffin for a year or two, doing nothing, he estimated that he would break through to the Ancestor God realm. Qi Yuan's plan was perfect.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to Qi Yuan's understanding from watching TV dramas and reading comics, "cultivating in peace" is similar to secluding oneself, hiding in the mundane world, and not being disturbed by worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>But many people have failed in their cultivation in peace, and according to Qi Yuan's understanding, it's because they chose the wrong location. Although they were cultivating in peace, they were often disturbed by small ruffians and arrogant people, with endless troubles.</p><p></p><p>So to cultivate in peace, one must choose a good place, undisturbed and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>Then... where could be better than a coffin? After all, who would bother the person in the coffin? The coffin is the holy land for cultivating in peace! Qi Yuan's calculations were going smoothly, but who knew that even in the coffin, there would be people to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>He was very angry.</p><p></p><p>"It's all your fault for forcing me. I just want to lie in the coffin and sleep peacefully!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who forced me should all die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood up, glaring fiercely at the charging Wang Tong.</p><p></p><p>He raised the coffin lid and slammed it hard onto Wang Tong's body.</p><p></p><p>"That's for disturbing me!"</p><p></p><p>The coffin lid hit Wang Tong, directly knocking him senseless, his head buzzing and stars flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! Qi Yuan continued to slam him, looking very domineering.</p><p></p><p>A few hits, and he had flattened Wang Tong's head, blood flowing.</p><p></p><p>Holding the coffin lid, Qi Yuan's expression was fierce: "Don't disturb people's sleep in your next life!"</p><p></p><p>In the memories Qi Yuan had obtained, the white-haired man chose to cultivate in peace, and he truly cultivated in peace, hardly using any extraordinary powers to live.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan was continuing the cultivation in peace, he must do the same, not using any extraordinary powers.</p><p></p><p>What skills, what magical abilities, he definitely couldn't use.</p><p></p><p>But... he could still rely on his own hard training and the experience gained from killing monsters to obtain a strong physique, right?</p><p></p><p>He didn't use any extraordinary powers, he was just a little stronger and healthier, that's all.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the few people present looked at Qi Yuan with fear.</p><p></p><p>This person not only pretended to be a corpse, but also grabbed a coffin lid and beat Wang Tong to death!</p><p></p><p>"Continue, it's your turn now. You forced me!" </p><p></p><p>Holding the coffin lid, Qi Yuan looked like a ruffian, no, a ruffian ghost! Xu Jiaoyun was terrified and ran away.</p><p></p><p>She already had a shadow in her heart, this Zichenlin was full of graves, really too creepy.</p><p></p><p>But in her panic, she stumbled and fell directly onto the sharp bamboo spikes, a huge bloody wound on her abdomen, blood flowing.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, she didn't even care about the pain, struggling to get up and continue running.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Jiaoyun's wound, Qi Yuan's face showed a compassionate expression: "It looks so painful, I can't bear to see you suffer like this, so I'll just send you down there!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he was very kind and compassionate, just like the old master, and couldn't bear to see Xu Jiaoyun in such pain, so he decided to help her end her suffering.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised the coffin lid and slammed it down hard, and Xu Jiaoyun looked up to see a black shadow falling, forcefully crashing onto her body, the powerful force pushing her down and piercing her through the sharp bamboo spikes.</p><p></p><p>"Pu..."</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed from the corner of her mouth, and Xu Jiaoyun was dead.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three Blood Tiger Gang members were trembling in fear. They were just ruffians, not powerful cultivators at all, so they naturally feared the ferocious Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The short and sturdy man gritted his teeth and said, "Are you a cultivator? Our Blood Tiger Gang also has cultivators, you can't kill me, the Blood Tiger Gang won't let you off!"</p><p></p><p>This man was too fierce, there was no way to escape.</p><p></p><p>In such an emergency situation, he could still think of a way to threaten. </p><p></p><p>It can be seen that he still had some "quick wit".</p><p></p><p>As for the other two idiotic gang members, they were so scared they couldn't even speak.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, how am I a cultivator? I don't have any extraordinary powers, I'm just naturally strong!" Qi Yuan quickly denied it.</p><p></p><p>Just because he ate more and was a little stronger, how could he be a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If he revealed his identity as a cultivator, how could he continue his cultivation in peace?</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Qi Yuan picked up the coffin lid again and angrily knocked the three Blood Tiger Gang members to death.</p><p></p><p>"Phew... I'm so tired!" Qi Yuan pretended to be out of breath, his acting superb.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan looked at the white-haired man in front of him and couldn't help but tentatively say, "Master?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then looked at Zhao Yan: "I am your master, but I'm not."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan was confused, a little dazed. "Master, aren't you dead?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan cautiously looked at Qi Yuan. The man in front of him, with his white hair, was almost exactly the same as his master.</p><p></p><p>But if there was any difference, it was that the gloom in his eyes was not as much as his master's.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know that the so-called master he had was actually the blood that Qi Yuan had once dripped into the game, a blood clone of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, they looked exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>"My soul is dead, but my body is still alive," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Soul dead, body alive?" Zhao Yan was confused.</p><p></p><p>Why did the words make sense individually, but put together they didn't make sense?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the coffin, his face showing a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>Now, the plan had failed, and he couldn't lie in the coffin anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go home," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was going to continue his cultivation in peace at home.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan paused, his expression becoming anxious: "Master, you've killed the Blood Tiger Gang members, the Blood Tiger Gang won't let us go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan was very worried.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Blood City, apart from the Thorny Blood and the aristocrats, the Blood Tiger Gang was the largest force, ruthlessly exploiting the common people.</p><p></p><p>And behind the Blood Tiger Gang were the Blood Tiger Cultivators, members of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Cultivators were originally powerful cultivators, but after joining the Thorny Blood, they had transformed themselves into Blood Tigers.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a gang, ordinary civilians had no chance or qualification to resist.</p><p></p><p>They could only be exploited, or join the gang.</p><p></p><p>"What, the Blood Tiger Gang won't let me cultivate in peace?" Qi Yuan's eyes widened, very angry. "How can people be so bad? I didn't even offend them, I just wanted to be a normal person peacefully, and yet... they dare to retaliate against me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was truly angry.</p><p></p><p>The honest person was forced to become bad, enough to spill blood.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to lie in the coffin and sleep peacefully.</p><p></p><p>But he was disturbed.</p><p></p><p>Now, as he prepared to go home to continue his cultivation in peace, this Blood Tiger Gang was being too tyrannical!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan blinked, a little dazed, but he still cautiously said:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master... should we leave Cloud Blood City? Otherwise, if the Blood Tiger Gang comes to investigate, we might end up dying a horrible death."</p><p></p><p>Although the master's combat power was formidable just now, and not inferior to a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But in Cloud Blood City, the concept of the Thorny Blood being invincible is deeply rooted.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Thorny Blood can communicate with the Ominous Deities!</p><p></p><p>Those are the gods that hang high in the sky! "Fleeing won't solve the problem," Qi Yuan shook his head, his tone deeply meaningful, "If I run away, won't that mean they've bullied me in vain?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me... we're going to retaliate?" Zhao Yan muttered.</p><p></p><p>How can ordinary civilians fight against a gang?</p><p></p><p>Except for some loners outside the city, no one dares to provoke the gang.</p><p></p><p>And those loners don't dare to enter the city, as soon as they do, they will be captured by the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>"What retaliation, this is called legitimate self-defense," Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly, "But we may also be judging the noble with a petty mind, what if the Blood Tiger Gang doesn't come to bother me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it again.</p><p></p><p>Since he has become mortal, he can't have too much malice.</p><p></p><p>What if the members of the Blood Tiger Gang are all cute, and even the villains are very polite? After all, the great villain Cao Gongong in a certain TV series was also very polite.</p><p></p><p>He can't misjudge the good people.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, back to sleep," Qi Yuan prepared to go back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>After lying in the coffin for too long, he felt like he had the smell of the dead all over him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xi Street.</p><p></p><p>The morning light shone, like fresh blood spilled on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary people here got up early, wearing short clothes to go to work.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to eating too little and too poorly, the people here all looked pale and thin, with signs of malnutrition.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang was wearing a long robe, seemingly stripped from a dead person, he frowned and said,</p><p></p><p>"That white-haired man actually died?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Lian nodded: "He died just a few days ago, even the big shots of the Thorny Blood came to check."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Wu Lian felt a bit sad.</p><p></p><p>That white-haired man was her neighbor, and in this malnourished Li Xi Street, he could be considered a handsome man.</p><p></p><p>Wu Lian often peeked at him.</p><p></p><p>That white-haired man's appearance hadn't changed in over a decade, so Wu Lian guessed that he was a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, he was a cultivator, otherwise we could have recruited him to boost our strength," Wu Xiang said.</p><p></p><p>He came from outside the city, and was a member of the rebel army.</p><p></p><p>They recruited many cultivators, just to overthrow the rule of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>However, they were too far behind the Thorny Blood, and could only stay outside the city like stray dogs.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang pushed these thoughts aside, and lowered his voice to say, "Wu Lian, this time you have to come with me, I've opened up all the channels."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Lian's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>Although life inside the city is better than outside, you don't have to live in constant fear of being swallowed by the Ominous Deities.</p><p></p><p>But she was different, she had already been targeted by the Thorny Blood, and when she turns eighteen, she will be sent to the Reincarnation Hall to become a tool for hatching Ominous Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Wu Lian nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, Wu Xiang's expression changed slightly: "Oh no, the Blood Tiger Gang!"</p><p></p><p>He looked out into the courtyard and saw a group of more than a dozen people in Blood Tiger Gang uniforms walking towards them, with a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang's face turned deathly pale, he knew there was a traitor in the rebel army, and someone had betrayed him.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do!"</p><p></p><p>"What do we do!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, there was someone even more anxious than him.</p><p></p><p>That person was Zhao Yan.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the courtyard yesterday, he didn't feel sleepy at all, staring outside with panda eyes, afraid that the Blood Tiger Gang would come to trouble him.</p><p></p><p>Well, as soon as dawn broke, more than a dozen members of the Blood Tiger Gang came, with a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>And judging from their uniforms, they were inner court disciples.</p><p></p><p>The combat power of the inner court disciples is not something ordinary disciples can compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, oh no, Master, the people from the Blood Tiger Gang are coming to kill us!" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan shouted anxiously.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Qi Yuan, who was drinking porridge, felt that the porridge had lost its flavor.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... I guess I've imagined this world to be too good!"</p><p></p><p>"I just accidentally killed a few of you in legitimate self-defense, and you actually dare to come and retaliate against me!"</p><p></p><p>"You're forcing me to do this!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gritted his teeth, smashing the bowl in his hand to the ground.</p><p></p><p>He casually picked up the hoe by the wall and strode out of the courtyard, with a majestic and domineering aura.</p><p></p><p>"You scum of the Blood Tiger Gang, you've bullied people too much!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan walked out of the courtyard, his voice loud and clear, holding the hoe to block the more than a dozen inner court disciples of the Blood Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>The hoe slammed heavily on the ground!</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical and extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was that he might have used too much force, the wooden handle of the hoe came loose and fell off, leaving Qi Yuan with just a wooden stick.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang disciples were stunned, with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, isn't he that white-haired cultivator, didn't he die?"</p><p></p><p>"How is he alive?"</p><p></p><p>"Did he resurrect?"</p><p></p><p>The inner court disciples of the Blood Tiger Gang discussed in confusion.</p><p></p><p>In the neighboring courtyard, Wu Lian also covered her mouth: "How is he alive!"</p><p></p><p>She had personally mourned Qi Yuan, and even eaten his funeral feast.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan was holding a hoe and blocking the Blood Tiger Gang, what had happened? The little leader of the Blood Tiger Gang's expression kept changing, the situation in front of him was somewhat bizarre.</p><p></p><p>However, they were busy capturing the rebel, and had no time to waste on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, is there a misunderstanding, we're here to capture your neighbor, she's hiding a rebel in her courtyard!" the Blood Tiger Gang little leader said.</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him was a cultivator, and he didn't know how strong he was. If they delayed and let the rebel escape, that would be a big loss.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, do you think I'm an idiot?" Qi Yuan sneered, "You're pretending to capture the rebel, but in reality, you're trying to lower my guard and capture me!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang little leader was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Had they encountered a fool? "Hmph, I won't fall for the same trick twice," Qi Yuan said indifferently, "Last night, I trusted you too much, thinking you were magnanimous and wouldn't bother me. </p><p></p><p>But now, not only have you come to bother me, you're using the same trick again, trying to lower my guard, thinking I'll fall for it again!"</p><p></p><p>"???" The little leader was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>What last night, what trick? Why couldn't he understand the white-haired man's words? Not only him, Zhao Yan also half understood, feeling like he understood, but also felt like he understood nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang little leader's face turned gloomy, no longer polite: "Since you won't drink the wine we offer, brothers, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a look of wisdom appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "See, you've been exposed by my brilliance, no need to pretend anymore, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the handleless hoe, or rather, the wooden stick, blocking the members of the Blood Tiger Gang in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"All those who dare to obstruct my cultivation will die!"</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>If he's going to cultivate in peace here, there will always be people disturbing him.</p><p></p><p>What if... he kills all those who want to disturb him? Wouldn't that allow him to cultivate in peace? Thinking this, a new plan was forming in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

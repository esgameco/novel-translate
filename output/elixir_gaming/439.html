        <h1>Chapter 439</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to take on a mission and go out for a while," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>According to the information shown by the intelligent micro-detection bugs, there were three locations with Black Magic Ancestor Blood - two within the territory of the Black Magic Abyss, and one outside.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll need to seek Zi Yuan Xiaolu's help," Qi Yuan thought, and used a communication jade slip to contact Zi Yuan Xiaolu.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes to burn three incense sticks passed, and Zi Yuan Xiaolu's graceful figure appeared outside the cave dwelling. She was wearing a navy blue horse-face skirt, looking cute with a hint of allure.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Senior Brother, what did you call me for?" Zi Yuan Xiaolu looked quite happy.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this - today I dreamed about a treasure, and I want to take you treasure hunting. However, I don't know where the place in my dream is located. You're very familiar with the Black Magic Abyss, so I wanted to ask you," Qi Yuan casually made up an excuse.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Xiaolu looked quite excited. After all, for Blood Robe Senior Brother to tell her about such an important matter as treasure hunting showed he really trusted her.</p><p></p><p>"Please tell me, Blood Robe Senior Brother, where is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Here!" </p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan couldn't draw, he was good at copying and pasting. Without thinking, he showed Zi Yuan Xiaolu a corner of the broken image he had seen.</p><p></p><p>A projection of the land appeared in the air. There was black soil and black water everywhere, with only one straight, towering mountain peak wrapped in chains coming into view.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu looked at the projection, blinking her eyes, and looked at Qi Yuan in disbelief: "Blood Robe Senior Brother, are you sure it's this place?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm sure. The scene in my dream was very clear. This place looks extraordinary at a glance, with many treasures," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu took a deep breath: "There are indeed many treasures here, but... this is the Treasure Pavilion of the Black Magic Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"...Ah, what?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>No way, they built the Treasure Pavilion here?</p><p></p><p>"Can we sneak in and steal... I mean, take some things? The things I want to take... steal from the Treasure Pavilion might be in the ruins below," Qi Yuan still held onto a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zi Yuan Xiaolu's expression became anxious: "Blood Robe Senior Brother, you must never have such thoughts! This is not only the Treasure Pavilion, but also the ancestral grounds where our Black Magic Abyss originated! Our Black Magic Abyss was born from the ruins of this place! If we rashly sneak in, even as Demon Children, we would hardly escape death!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu's face was rarely so serious, her little face tense with worry.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt somewhat disappointed. </p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Black Magic Ancestor Blood in this location was probably... the Black Magic Ancestor Blood of the Black Magic Abyss itself.</p><p></p><p>The first location was taken, what about the second? Qi Yuan didn't have much hope.</p><p></p><p>After all, given the power of the Yang Spirit Celestial Lord, especially at the Great Ultimate Principle realm, there were almost no secrets in the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"What about this place?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan copied the scene of the second location for Zi Yuan Xiaolu to see.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu tilted her head, thinking for a moment: "I know this place."</p><p></p><p>"Take me there, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The two left Purple Origin Heaven, taking teleportation arrays towards other territories of the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>About a day passed as they transferred through six or seven teleportation arrays.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the two stopped at a basin.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place, Blood Robe Senior Brother. We need to hurry, this Brahma Realm is not friendly to our Purple Origin Heaven," said Zi Yuan Xiaolu, standing small beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the basin ahead, disappointment showing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure is gone."</p><p></p><p>Both his perception and his eyes told him that the Black Magic Ancestor Blood here had long been moved away.</p><p></p><p>No need to guess, it must have been moved back to the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zi Yuan Xiaolu was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's form turned into a stream of light, traversing the spatial cracks beneath the basin.</p><p></p><p>After about a hundred breaths, he appeared beside Zi Yuan Xiaolu: "However, it's not that we didn't find anything. I found some of this!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, and a large pool of blood-colored water appeared.</p><p></p><p>This blood water was the same as the blood river in the Ancestor Blood Pavilion, with many intelligent micro-detection bugs inside.</p><p></p><p>These detection bugs all stored data. If Qi Yuan received it, he might be able to get a lot of useful information.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... Ancestor Blood Spirit Water?" Zi Yuan Xiaolu was surprised, not expecting that the treasure Blood Robe Senior Brother was looking for was this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Zi Yuan Xiaolu and asked, "Do you know of other places that have it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, does Blood Robe Senior Brother need this? If you need it, I can help you collect it!" Zi Yuan Xiaolu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Blood Spirit Water was generally only found in the Ancestor Blood Pavilion, used to test one's progress in cultivating the "Ancestor Blood Scripture" and thereby gain merits.</p><p></p><p>This thing was actually quite useless. After all, how could one not know which level of the "Ancestor Blood Scripture" they had cultivated to? Was there really a need for testing? So, Ancestor Blood Spirit Water had almost no other use.</p><p></p><p>"How much money? I'll pay you!" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain enough Ancestor Blood Spirit Water, more intelligent micro-detection bugs, he might be able to find more whereabouts of Black Magic Ancestor Blood, and even... perhaps locate the terrifying body of that giant insect.</p><p></p><p>That would be a good thing. In the famine years on Blue Star, it could feed people for ten thousand years without running out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it might also crush Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"It's very cheap, not worth much. I can provide it," Zi Yuan Xiaolu said happily.</p><p></p><p>"No, free things are actually the most expensive. I'm a rich man now, I can't be stingy anymore."</p><p></p><p>With the Moluoyi clan wiped out, the treasures Qi Yuan had obtained were enormous.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan generously and painfully took out a celestial jade from his storage bag: "Is one celestial jade enough?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zi Yuan Xiaolu couldn't help but cover her mouth and laugh: "It's enough!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was still Blood Robe Senior Brother's style.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else saying those words, wouldn't they have taken out at least ten thousand celestial jades by now? But Blood Robe Senior Brother spoke so generously, yet only took out so little.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Yin Spirit cultivators, perhaps one celestial jade was quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>But for Demon Children, celestial jade... was like Golden Core cultivators looking at spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, one celestial jade wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>He quickly tried to make up for it to avoid embarrassment: "This one celestial jade is just a deposit!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Zi Yuan Xiaolu smiled as she took the celestial jade, her smile becoming even brighter.</p><p></p><p>After making arrangements with Zi Yuan Xiaolu, she returned to Purple Origin Heaven to collect Ancestor Blood Spirit Water.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then took on a mission, preparing to go out for a while.</p><p></p><p>The last location was not in the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>According to Zi Yuan Xiaolu's judgment, it was located at Sky Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Sky Cliff was a strange place in the Six Realms Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Strange places were the most special locations in the Six Realms Heaven.</p><p></p><p>There were various comments and speculations about strange places.</p><p></p><p>However, the most widely accepted view was that strange places were areas where the world outside the Six Realms Heaven bordered with the Six Realms Heaven's territory.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the stars that illuminated all heavens could not be seen in strange places.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, in the Six Realms Heaven, experts at the Great Ultimate Principle realm could retain all their power when going to other worlds, but in some strange places, even those at the Great Ultimate Principle realm would have their cultivation reduced.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were various inexplicable dangers in strange places, and some even had terrifying Holy Light Clan members appearing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, generally speaking, very few Yang Spirit cultivators entered strange places.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, very few cultivators were willing to explore strange places.</p><p></p><p>"Will the realm of Ten Thousand Dao Martial God have reduced cultivation when entering Sky Cliff?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered this, but without any hesitation, he took a teleportation array towards the location of Sky Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The giant city closest to Sky Cliff was called Sky Hanging City.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The name of this city comes from Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>This city can be considered a major transportation hub. </p><p></p><p>The three giant holy lands - Black Magic Abyss, Divine Luo Heaven, and Ghost Ruling Heaven - are all not far from this city.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators from the lower realms also come to this city for procurement and trade.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, wearing a black robe, arrived at Sky Hanging City via a teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he directly transformed into a streak of light and headed towards Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>About 100 breaths of time passed, and a burly woman dressed in golden clothes appeared in Sky Hanging City.</p><p></p><p>The aura on her body was as deep as the sea, clearly at the peak of the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>She was only one step away from the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>She crushed the communication jade slip in her hand, with a cold smile in her eyes: "He left so quickly, without stopping at all."</p><p></p><p>Just now, she received information that the newest demon son of Purple Origin Heaven in Black Magic Abyss had accepted a mission to come to Sky Hanging City.</p><p></p><p>Within Black Magic Abyss, the factions are complex, and information about the movements of demon sons is easily leaked.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups of Black Magic Abyss know this, but they simply turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>After all, for Black Magic Abyss, from a temporal perspective, if a powerful bloodline dies, perhaps an even more powerful bloodline will emerge in the future.</p><p></p><p>A powerful bloodline that hasn't been tempered should be quickly reforged - better to die early and let a newborn inherit an even stronger bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"He must be afraid of Senior Sister!" said a delicate-looking young man beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, among the younger generation in Black Magic Abyss, only Black Sword is somewhat formidable. The rest, except for Ice Sword, are all just chickens and dogs," the golden-clothed woman said coldly, her voice carrying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"It's perfect, my Ghost Ruling Heaven's path to Yang Spirit needs a spirit servant for the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. He barely qualifies!"</p><p></p><p>There was killing intent in the golden-clothed woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Ruling Heaven's miraculous treasure is the Ten Thousand Ghosts Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators of Ghost Ruling Heaven cultivate the Ten Thousand Souls Banner.</p><p></p><p>Within the Ten Thousand Souls Banner are endless dead souls, frames emitting black smoke.</p><p></p><p>Due to devouring too many dead souls, this type of magical treasure's chaotic thoughts can even affect the personality of its owner.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, cultivators of Ghost Ruling Heaven are also called demon cultivators, mostly murderous lunatics with problematic minds.</p><p></p><p>"Once I refine him and break through to the Yang Spirit realm, I'll go challenge Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>This time, I won't lose!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-clothed woman's face was twisted.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago, she challenged Black Sword and was defeated in three moves.</p><p></p><p>This became a great humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword had entered the Yang Spirit realm early on, while she was still stuck in the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, she naturally was no match for Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>But over these thousand years, she had been diligently cultivating, finding ownerless small worlds to slaughter and collect souls.</p><p></p><p>With twelve spirit servants in place, and then breaking through to the Yang Spirit realm, she was confident she could defeat Black Sword and wash away her past shame with blood.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword was her target, while Blood Robe was merely fodder.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan's figure appeared outside Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the bustling noise of Sky Hanging City, this place was particularly quiet, desolate, with almost no cultivators in sight.</p><p></p><p>"Except for some cultivators hiding from enemies, few cultivators come here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered for a moment, then entered the strange land.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he encountered a scene similar to entering the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was too big to squeeze in.</p><p></p><p>This was the will of the strange land, or rather the world rules preventing him from entering.</p><p></p><p>His Yang Spirit's immortal power had to be lowered to the Mythical realm to enter.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it were other worlds, he could choose not to enter, or even swallow the world.</p><p></p><p>But as long as he lowered his power to enter the world, an ordinary Yang Spirit would be at the Mythical realm level.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some supreme dao rule had set this condition.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in general worlds, great principles are not restricted.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan restrained his cultivation and entered Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, the Ten Thousand Dao Martial God is still unrestricted."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Due to the "Ancestral Blood Scripture", his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation was not much inferior to his immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was at the peak of the Great Heavenly Rank.</p><p></p><p>This gave Qi Yuan considerable peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Fire."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Qi Yuan spoke, using the simplest fire-based dao technique of the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of flame appeared in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The operation of dao techniques is somewhat obscure... It seems that strange lands are indeed parts of other worlds or universes that border the Six Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The area of this strange land was about twice as large as Arching Star.</p><p></p><p>The land below looked messy, like a junkyard, with various metals full of holes everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's powerful divine sense swept across, sensing about several thousand cultivators living there.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paid no attention to these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>His target was the Black Magic Ancestral Blood recorded by the intelligent micro-detection bug!</p><p></p><p>Following the recorded images, he entered the lowest level of Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>It was a place of chaos, with chaos condensed into various metals.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Qi Yuan's face lit up with a pleased expression.</p><p></p><p>"This trip wasn't in vain!"</p><p></p><p>In front of him, deep inside, there was a fist-sized blood crystal.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, even if he had swallowed this strange land, he wouldn't have discovered this blood crystal.</p><p></p><p>This blood crystal was condensed from the Black Magic Ancestral Blood.</p><p></p><p>"This should be enough for me to cultivate for a while?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt excited.</p><p></p><p>This blood crystal, converted to Black Magic Ancestral Blood, was estimated to be nearly a hundred drops.</p><p></p><p>Probably, if fully absorbed, it could allow him to cultivate the "Ancestral Blood Scripture" to the tenth layer within a month.</p><p></p><p>This way, his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation would be comparable to the Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>After collecting the blood crystal, Qi Yuan prepared to return to Black Magic Abyss to continue cultivating the Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>This outing had been too smooth.</p><p></p><p>No schemes or plots, no killing for treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, smiling men always have good luck."</p><p></p><p>"My exploration of this strange land was like child's play, without any danger!"</p><p></p><p>"Although not exciting, it was very steady and reassuring, the kind of secret realm I like!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't like fighting and killing.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't like having treasures he fancied being eyed by others, requiring him to go through countless difficulties to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>Although hard-to-get treasures are more cherished, Qi Yuan was different; he liked the feeling of effortless acquisition.</p><p></p><p>"Strive to perfect the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' within ten years!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan left Sky Hanging Cliff.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he left, his expression suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the distant Sky Hanging City, becoming cautious.</p><p></p><p>"I sense a strong killing intent, is it directed at me?"</p><p></p><p>At Qi Yuan's level, if someone harbored killing intent towards him or thought about him, he would sense it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had caught such a scent.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I just sneak out to explore for a treasure, and someone wants to ambush me!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a harmonious cultivation world is just my illusion!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the bloody world of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"For no reason, I have a face that provokes others to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"No good, I'm still too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan plunged back into the strange land.</p><p></p><p>He decided to cultivate the "Ancestral Blood Scripture" to the tenth layer before coming out again.</p><p></p><p>Facing a great enemy who dared to ambush him, he had to be careful and cautious.</p><p></p><p>He needed to quickly improve his strength and take this seriously!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

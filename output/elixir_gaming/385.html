        <h1>Chapter 385</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Countless images flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan opened his eyes again, he suddenly found himself on Seven-Colored Peak at Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the end of the game?"</p><p></p><p>The game had ended very abruptly. </p><p></p><p>With the departure of that bird, the Sea of Root Demons dissipated. Qi Yuan hadn't had a chance to see the Goldfinch and Ning Tao again, or return home to give Zero One some instructions.</p><p></p><p>He had simply exited the game and returned to Cang Lan.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what's the big idea? You can leave if you want, but why take my divine infant with you?!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to give that woman a Explosive Bird-Killing Punch! Although Qi Yuan was wrong to entrust Wu Shi to her physical body in the first place.</p><p></p><p>But according to some explanations.</p><p></p><p>Was there really nothing wrong with her corpse just lying there?</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of Wu Shi's special nature, Qi Yuan didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>His nearly 4,000 divine infants could find "grandchildren" on Arch Star and in the Origin Realm, and could rush out as grandparents.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi was special. </p><p></p><p>Only in the body of that expert above the Great Ultimate realm in the ruins would she choose to reside and slowly revive.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that without that expert's physical body, Wu Shi would likely have great difficulty awakening, or would awaken very slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I played a game and got my kidney stolen. Where can I go to complain?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very helpless.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, he had one divine infant taken away.</p><p></p><p>Although he did have quite a few divine infants, losing one was still a fact.</p><p></p><p>"Now, not only am I mentally shocked, I also need a disability certificate. My buffs are already maxed out."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided he would go get a disability certificate later.</p><p></p><p>But then he examined his inner self and a look of surprise flashed across his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm... in the Purple Palace realm now?"</p><p></p><p>Upon returning from the game, Qi Yuan had already entered the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the first Purple Palace cultivator since Shenguang Sect was founded.</p><p></p><p>"But... where's my Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He had entered the Purple Palace realm, but also hadn't.</p><p></p><p>Because he had no Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>The place where the Purple Palace should be was completely empty.</p><p></p><p>"My disability is quite severe!"</p><p></p><p>This time playing a game, he had thoroughly become disabled.</p><p></p><p>One of his divine infants was taken away, and his Purple Palace was empty.</p><p></p><p>The only thing worth being happy about was that the Innate Seed was truly too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Almost 99.9% of the cultivation he gained in the game was brought back.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Dao Martial God realm still existed.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Yang Spirit was also there.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this improvement was really huge, surpassing previous times.</p><p></p><p>"Since my Purple Palace isn't formed, my superpower hasn't activated either?"</p><p></p><p>With each realm breakthrough, Qi Yuan would activate a superpower.</p><p></p><p>Like eyes that could see hidden information, ears that could hear thoughts and strange murmurs, or a nose that could grow bigger and longer.</p><p></p><p>This time, there was no change at all.</p><p></p><p>This also meant his Purple Palace was not yet complete.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... so I'm just missing an Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The purple qi was there, but the Underworld was not.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the quest reward.</p><p></p><p>It was a straight pen, somewhat similar to a brush.</p><p></p><p>The pen shaft was ink-colored, seeming to have mountain and river patterns.</p><p></p><p>"It's a proper pen."</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, Qi Yuan had encountered an improper pen, shaped like a fox tail, called the Madness Pen, which was very improper.</p><p></p><p>"The Mountains and Rivers Pen... I understand now.</p><p></p><p>I just need to find an artist to draw out my Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Then my Purple Palace... will be complete."</p><p></p><p>The Mountains and Rivers Pen was a supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Lord had used this pen to draw the Mountains and Seas Scroll, creating countless worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now, this pen had fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>"So, the problem is still... I need land, a design plan, and an artist?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and seven PowerPoint presentations appeared.</p><p></p><p>These seven presentations were the Underworld design books that person on Arch Star had given him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at them casually: "Cultivating to the Purple Palace realm is too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Why can other people just go into seclusion, explore a secret realm, get enough resources, kick their legs, and enter the Purple Palace realm?</p><p></p><p>I have to go through so much trouble, buy land, find someone to design it, and have someone draw it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>The world was too unfair.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the hardships of the world are like this rushing river, never to return."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a crisp voice suddenly came from outside Qi Yuan's high-class cement house.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, have you come out of seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>The owner of the voice seemed to be lowering her tone, afraid of disturbing someone in seclusion, with a hint of worry mixed in.</p><p></p><p>This voice was very familiar to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a crimson robe, he strode out of the high-class but somewhat unfitting cement house.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, how did you know I just happened to come out of seclusion?</p><p></p><p>And how did you know that I accidentally broke through to the Purple Palace realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled faintly, his blood-red robe giving him the bearing of a Purple Palace great cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, the eyes of that purple-skirted graceful figure suddenly shrank, like a gentle breeze blowing lotus leaves, crystal-clear water droplets scattering.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you've finally come out of seclusion, you've been in seclusion for two and a half years!" Jiang Lingsu's eyes were full of joy and delight.</p><p></p><p>In her view, although Senior Brother Qi Yuan often went into seclusion, the periods were never long.</p><p></p><p>This time, it had been a bit long.</p><p></p><p>As a junior sister, it was normal to worry a bit and care about her senior brother, right? She would come to Qi Yuan's door every day, softly calling out to see if he had awakened.</p><p></p><p>Or she was afraid he had encountered some accident.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing Qi Yuan appear, her face was full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Two and a half years, that's a bit long, and somewhat inauspicious." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze unconsciously fell on Jiang Lingsu's body.</p><p></p><p>His expression froze slightly.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the violet-colored dress like a purple orchid, her fair skin was revealed. Light purple ribbons tied into two butterflies adorned her white and smooth shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Different from the dresses Jiang Lingsu wore before, this one had far too many cutouts. Long hair covered her bare back, with a body-revealing groove down the spine. On both sides was skin as white and delicate as porcelain, glowing without any excess flesh.</p><p></p><p>At the waist, there were also two cutouts, revealing that slender waist that could be encircled by one hand. The waistline was distinct, and looking down a bit further, one could faintly glimpse the curves of her thighs and upper body.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, exaggerated, towering, and round, forming a stark contrast with the slender waist, truly like slender branches bearing large fruit.</p><p></p><p>Completely different from the Goldfinch's gentle jade bowl turned upside down, not in the same league.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, there were two points that couldn't be mentioned. Someone said it right, purple is very charming.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed two and a half years have passed, Junior Sister, your dressing style has changed greatly, becoming somewhat bold.</p><p></p><p>Note, 'bold' here has no derogatory meaning." Qi Yuan always spoke considerately, giving himself buffs.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's face suddenly turned red. She put her hands on her hips: "I'm the only one on Seven-Colored Peak, what is there to fear? Besides, Senior Brother, you don't know how many strange things happened while you were in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Several more suns appeared in the sky, now there are eleven! It's too hot, I live here alone, and Senior Brother you set up formations on Seven-Colored Peak. Without my permission, no one can</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with dressing a bit lightly when people can come in but not be seen?</p><p></p><p>Hmph, you've seen me even more scantily clad before, why are you being so coy now!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sky. </p><p></p><p>Goodness, eleven suns.</p><p></p><p>He felt carefully - it was indeed a bit hot. </p><p></p><p>But not too much, it was mostly psychological.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like we need to find a divine archer to shoot down one of them!" Qi Yuan said thoughtfully, looking at the first sun.</p><p></p><p>There are too many impolite people in this world.</p><p></p><p>Can't they see the suns are already crowding here, yet they still come this way.</p><p></p><p>That person from Taihuan Palace has no manners.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, according to what you said, the suns in the sky are the sun gods reflecting all the heavens. Where in our Canglan Realm could we find such a divine archer? Besides, if we were to shoot them down, we'd definitely have to shoot down all the later ones!" Jiang Lingsu said with a light smile, her ample bosom quivering enticingly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swallowed hard: "The later suns are good and kind, don't shoot them. If we're shooting, just shoot the first one!"</p><p></p><p>That was his golden core after all. It would be awkward if someone shot it down.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's bright eyes were filled with laughter. Perhaps it had been too long since she'd bantered with her senior brother, or perhaps distance makes the heart grow fonder. Now hearing her senior brother talk nonsense, she felt very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Are there really bad suns?" Jiang Lingsu played along with her senior brother's nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, look at the other ten suns, they're all proper and upright. That one clearly doesn't belong with the group. Obviously, that sun is a bad sun, which is why it's being ostracized!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is right." Jiang Lingsu moved closer, boldly putting her arm around Qi Yuan's. She tugged at him, "Senior brother has been in seclusion for so long, you must be hungry. Your junior sister just made some food, I'll graciously let you have a taste!"</p><p></p><p>However, suddenly Jiang Lingsu glanced at Qi Yuan's blood-stained robe, her eyes filled with doubt: "Senior brother, I remember you were wearing a green robe before you went into seclusion. How did it suddenly turn red, and the style is different from what you used to wear? You didn't secretly come out of seclusion early to go gallivanting around and only just returned, did you!?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she seemed a bit angry, her chest heaving.</p><p></p><p>"No, I just changed outfits in the game," Qi Yuan said. </p><p></p><p>His descent into the game was his true self, but also somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>"Changed outfits?" Jiang Lingsu blinked, hearing Qi Yuan's denial, she believed him. </p><p></p><p>Although senior brother was unreliable at times, he was still quite reliable in many ways.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded, "Let's go try your cooking, and I'll ask you about something while we're at it."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Jiang Lingsu was intrigued.</p><p></p><p>This rich and beautiful junior sister was especially enthusiastic and generous towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Not only did she give him gold coins, but also cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, behind every successful man is a woman silently supporting him.</p><p></p><p>Behind Qi Yuan was his little junior sister giving him gold coins.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you while we eat." Qi Yuan lowered his head and saw something he shouldn't have again. "Junior sister, why don't you put on some more clothes?"</p><p></p><p>A blush crept up Jiang Lingsu's ears, hidden in her black hair. She also grew bolder: "It's not like you haven't seen before, what are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Often, once there's a first time, there will be a second.</p><p></p><p>"But..." Qi Yuan leaned close to Jiang Lingsu's ear and whispered something.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's face instantly turned bright red. Her arms immediately covered her front, squeezing out an exaggerated curve, trembling.</p><p></p><p>"You... didn't see anything!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I've forgotten already." Qi Yuan said warmly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Lingsu bit her silver teeth, stomping her feet in anger, but couldn't find a reason to bite Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She turned around and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Qi Yuan recalled the past, when his junior sister gave him cultivation techniques. </p><p></p><p>He said he would protect her in the future! Junior sister said she didn't need protection.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, junior sister doesn't need protection."</p><p></p><p>The crude joke suddenly popped out of Qi Yuan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A painter?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu sat upright in the bamboo chair. This time she was dressed conservatively, very covered up. If not for using magical techniques, she would surely be sweating profusely by now.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I need a painter to draw the underworld for me," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan could draw himself, his drawing skills were quite average.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of thing, it was better to find a professional.</p><p></p><p>Even PowerPoint presentations were made by others, how could he do the drawing himself?</p><p></p><p>He just needed to design the underworld according to his ideas, combined with others' constructions.</p><p></p><p>Finding someone good at drawing would do.</p><p></p><p>This was a small matter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was too lazy to find a painter himself, so if junior sister could find one, he'd leave it to her.</p><p></p><p>As long as the painting skills were good enough.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing at present was naturally the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Resolving the great calamity and finding a painter to draw the underworld - two tasks progressing in parallel.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of painters, I do know of one. Although she's not the most famous, she's definitely the most peculiar. She lives in the Bamboo Sea of Helan Prefecture in the Eastern Lands. Our Jiang clan also has some business in Helan Prefecture. When I was young, I once saw this painter," Jiang Lingsu recalled.</p><p></p><p>She was pondering what was peculiar about that painter.</p><p></p><p>Because normally, others would ask what was peculiar about her.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is her painting skill strong? Better than mine?" </p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he immediately drew a picture of a phoenix eating rice.</p><p></p><p>"Look, how does it compare to my level?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu couldn't help covering her mouth and laughing: "Senior brother, your picture of a chick pecking at rice is quite funny."</p><p></p><p>"You're laughing, haven't you realized this is a phoenix, and it's eating your family's rice!" Qi Yuan pointed at the rice, "See? It's exactly the same as your family's rice."</p><p></p><p>"How is it similar!" Jiang Lingsu thought the rice looked nothing like her family's spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>"It's not similar, it is!" With Qi Yuan's words, a large hen broke free from the painting, flapping its little wings and running towards Jiang Lingsu's kitchen, frantically pecking at Jiang Lingsu's rice.</p><p></p><p>The hen's appearance was somewhat crude, looking oddly shaped.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Lingsu's eyes widened: "Senior brother, aren't you being too childish!"</p><p></p><p>She ignored the chicken eating rice and said softly: "Her painting skills are probably better than yours. To say nothing else, lifelike depictions are no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>Senior brother's skills weren't just amateur, his drawing was very abstract - the phoenix didn't even look like... a chicken.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's find time to visit her. However, on the way there, I need to formulate a detailed, meticulous, unprecedented great plan. If there are any miscellaneous matters, I'll leave them to you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was serious, his eyes filled with gravity.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, he could finally formulate a flawless perfect plan against the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could defeat the great calamity, the atmosphere of the Canglan Realm would change, and he wouldn't have to live in constant fear day and night, having nightmares, afraid of becoming fodder.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could also break through the world's restrictions, ascend to the upper realms, see Jinli, and find his master!</p><p></p><p>Such a great plan must be detailed and meticulous, and also flawless.</p><p></p><p>"What great plan?" Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan, her eyes filled with a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a man is most attractive when he's serious.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother's charm increased even more when he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>PS: From now on, I'll post one chapter at midnight and one chapter at 6 PM to avoid keeping everyone waiting at night.</p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, to show my apologies, I'll release some monthly ticket red envelopes on this chapter later! (Qidian) Don't spread the word and let bots snatch them! (End of chapter)</p>

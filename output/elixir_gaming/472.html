        <h1>Chapter 472</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi was slightly surprised as he looked at the stone plate, then recalled: "Before entering the wind cave, I saw a black-robed fellow Daoist not far away, and I had even reminded him to enter the wind cave. </p><p></p><p>Before I entered the wind cave, he had not moved, perhaps... he went to other wind caves?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expression on the stone plate's face immediately turned deathly pale: "Around here... there is only this one wind cave, the others... are far away."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the stone plate was filled with deep regret.</p><p></p><p>Before he moved away from the entrance of the wind cave, he should have warned that gentleman!</p><p></p><p>In the strange land of Tian Kun, many newly arrived cultivators, underestimating their own cultivation, completely disregarded the yin ghosts, and even developed an interest in them, choosing to stay outside at night.</p><p></p><p>But now, that gentleman did not enter this wind cave. </p><p></p><p>According to the words of the cultivator beside him, that gentleman had not made any move before he entered.</p><p></p><p>It was already too late to go to the other wind caves.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the howls of the yin ghost army were constantly heard, ominous and terrifying. The stone plate had already imagined what would happen.</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi's expression remained calm: "It seems this fellow Daoist is new to this place, what a pity."</p><p></p><p>He had seen many such cultivators.</p><p></p><p>There was once a legendary strong one, even the offspring of a sun god, who came to the strange land of Tian Kun to search for treasures.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the sun god's artifact left by his revered mother, he completely disregarded the patrolling yin ghosts.</p><p></p><p>The result... he died.</p><p></p><p>Such things were very normal, he had seen many, so he was quite indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"There are still a few hours until dawn, fretting won't do you any good," Liu Xi, being a kind person, comforted the stone plate, "Wait until dawn, you can go and collect his remains, if his bones are strong, perhaps you can still salvage some fragments."</p><p></p><p>The stone plate: "..."</p><p></p><p>Within the wind cave, the voices of the yin ghosts continued to be heard.</p><p></p><p>The stone plate was anxious, stretching his neck to look outside the wind cave, but he dared not go out, worrying for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi, on the other hand, remained calm, finding a spot to sit down and closing his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the mountains, as far as the eye could see, the dark mountains concealed countless pairs of deep green, bat-like eyes.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of yin ghost soldiers, arrayed in formation, bowed their heads, as if holding a grand military assembly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the void, surrounded by the yin ghost army, and began to preach and brainwash them using the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The previous night had been an eventful one.</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of the yin ghost army, Qi Yuan had rushed for thousands of miles, slaughtering all the yin ghost envoys around him.</p><p></p><p>The yin ghost army had also been consolidated by him, their numbers now staggering.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the void, these yin ghost soldiers filled with fanaticism and madness, occasionally erupting into thunderous cheers, far more lively than any concert on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"To protect my mountains and rivers, we need a strong army, to become a well-disciplined military force.</p><p></p><p>What is well-disciplined? Hmm... first of all, it's the middle of the night, don't disturb the civilians, we need to be quiet."</p><p></p><p>What is well-disciplined? Qi Yuan himself was not exactly a model of discipline.</p><p></p><p>He would also get angry because of Niu Jiao's sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>As for how to build a disciplined army, he was not too sure.</p><p></p><p>At least... not disturbing the civilians should count, right?</p><p></p><p>To say... unifying their thoughts should also count?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as Qi Yuan's voice sounded, these yin ghost soldiers were like having their thoughts imprinted with steel, all holding their breath, not making a sound.</p><p></p><p>"With discipline, we also need combat power, this is the 36th set of radio calisthenics, begin the training."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt increasingly clever.</p><p></p><p>When he watched TV before, there were always warrior kings who dominated other realms with a set of military martial arts.</p><p></p><p>His radio calisthenics were just as impressive.</p><p></p><p>After passing on this radio calisthenics to the yin ghost soldiers, Qi Yuan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Next, train your bodies, build military camps, and construct armories!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>These yin ghost soldiers still had the shackles of the Holy Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could see that these yin ghost soldiers were originally harmless, and did not need to slaughter the living as yin ghost patrols.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Sect had polluted these yin ghost soldiers with strange creatures, seemingly wanting to accomplish some sinister purpose.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan passed on the 36th set of radio calisthenics to the yin ghost soldiers, slowly grinding down the controlling bells and erasing the marks controlling them.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, once these yin ghost soldiers are fully normalized, they can work in the Underworld during the day, and when needed, they can join my Imperial Banner and fight for me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a kind-hearted person, and he couldn't bear to see these yin ghost soldiers without jobs, like unemployed vagrants.</p><p></p><p>So he generously provided them with job positions, reducing the unemployment rate.</p><p></p><p>If this happened on the Blue Star, he would be called a "living Bodhisattva" for providing so many job opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's guidance, these yin ghost soldiers quickly dispersed, very orderly.</p><p></p><p>Some began to practice the radio calisthenics, while others started chopping trees and building military camps and armories.</p><p></p><p>However, they all had good discipline, not making any noise.</p><p></p><p>Everything was progressing in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>The sky was also gradually brightening.</p><p></p><p>In the wind cave, the stone plate had dark circles under his eyes, having not slept all night, his mental state not very good.</p><p></p><p>Outside the wind cave, the roars of the yin ghost army had long since dissipated, leaving a sense of tranquility, but faint strange sounds could still be heard.</p><p></p><p>He was very anxious in his heart, wanting to go see what was happening outside.</p><p></p><p>How was the great person who had been protecting them doing now?</p><p></p><p>"The day has dawned, the yin ghost army has dispersed, how wonderful." Liu Xi spoke cheerfully, getting up and walking out of the wind cave.</p><p></p><p>The other refugees in the wind cave also got up one by one and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Especially the stone plate, his heart was extremely anxious. He was originally closest to the entrance of the wind cave, and now hearing the sounds, he no longer hesitated and rushed out towards Qi Yuan's location.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths later, the stone plate suddenly let out a cry of terror.</p><p></p><p>His legs were trembling and instantly lost strength, plopping down on the ground, a look of horror on his face.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" The mother of the stone plate in the wind cave called out anxiously, quickly running out.</p><p></p><p>"Don't... yin ghosts, so many yin ghosts!" The stone plate was shocked and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the mountain ranges were densely packed with terrifying beings.</p><p></p><p>They were very ethereal, their eyes shining with green light, like wisps of smoke.</p><p></p><p>Now, these terrifying beings, some were chopping trees, some were carrying wood, and some were gathered together, seemingly performing an extremely strange set of movements, appearing particularly absurd and comical.</p><p></p><p>The stone plate had never seen yin ghosts before, but seeing those beings, the first thought that came to his mind was that they were yin ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"You child, it's broad daylight now, how could there be yin ghosts? You must have scared yourself." Liu Xi smiled, slowly walking out of the wind cave.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he thought this was the stone plate, a mere mortal, being overly frightened and scaring himself.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he stepped out of the wind cave and took a look, his expression immediately froze.</p><p></p><p>The refugees in the wind cave saw a white figure frantically retreat back into the wind cave.</p><p></p><p>They heard Liu Xi, with a shocked expression, say: "Yin ghosts in broad daylight? "</p><p></p><p>He was extremely puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the strange land of Tian Kun, he had been here for over a hundred years, what had he not seen?</p><p></p><p>Encountering yin ghosts in broad daylight, he had truly never encountered this before.</p><p></p><p>And just with a casual glance, he saw the number of yin ghosts break into the thousands.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely frightening.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the little stone plate is still outside..." Liu Xi was slightly anxious.</p><p></p><p>Last night, he had exchanged a lot with the stone plate and had some appreciation for this young man.</p><p></p><p>Now, the stone plate was outside, according to the terrifying nature of the yin ghosts, the stone plate was surely doomed.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... but he's still not dead? At this time, the other refugees in the wind cave were all shocked, some stumbling, some terrified.</p><p></p><p>"How can there be yin ghosts in broad daylight!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, the yin ghosts have seen me, I'm going to see the Grandfather!"</p><p></p><p>These people were terrified.</p><p></p><p>The terror of the yin ghosts was like a dark cloud looming over them.</p><p></p><p>And Liu Xi, looking out, had a curious expression on his face: "How come the stone plate hasn't died yet, these yin ghosts are so powerful, they should have noticed us long ago... and what are they doing?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi looked at the yin ghosts, his expression strange and grave.</p><p></p><p>What was happening today was truly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a thunderous roar suddenly came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to kidnap my yin ghosts!"</p><p></p><p>A purple-robed cultivator shouted, his voice echoing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Last night, he had led the yin ghost army on a patrol, and on the way, he encountered a desolate ridge, suddenly feeling "amorous", so he went into a dilapidated wind cave and had a wild outdoor tryst with his concubine.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, after the tryst, his yin ghost squad had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This was no small matter.</p><p></p><p>Following the mark on the bell, he rushed towards where his yin ghost squad was.</p><p></p><p>But just as he finished cursing, the yin ghost envoy froze.</p><p></p><p>He saw the endless sea of yin ghost soldiers, too many to count.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... I was just passing by, passing by, got it wrong!"</p><p></p><p>If it was just his one yin ghost squad being taken away, he would still dare to face the Holy Light Sect's wrath.</p><p></p><p>But this... was uncountable, truly uncountable.</p><p></p><p>He quickly fled.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a slightly lazy voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Disturbing people's peaceful sleep in the early morning, how lacking in discipline."</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the yin ghosts who were doing radio calisthenics, chopping trees and building camps, all stopped their actions, moving in perfect unison.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He roared at the ghostly messenger.</p><p></p><p>"Have some... class!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Liu Xi watched this farcical scene and felt his brain was not working properly.</p><p></p><p>Was he not fully awake? Or had this cultivation world gone mad?</p><p></p><p>With the collective howl of the ghostly army, the body of the ghostly messenger suddenly shattered, turning into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>A faint voice came.</p><p></p><p>"This is the fate of those without class."</p><p></p><p>The voice was calm, with a hint of indifference.</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan heard the voice and his face lit up with joy: "This is... the master, the master's voice!"</p><p></p><p>"What, is this the black-robed cultivator from last night?" Thinking of this, Liu Xi's body trembled involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The ghostly army here, with just a few dozen, could easily subdue and slay mythical beings.</p><p></p><p>The number of ghosts here, not less than tens of thousands!</p><p></p><p>That fellow cultivator... to be able to subdue so many terrifying ghosts, he must be at least... a Dao Sovereign! Even Celestial Immortals might not be enough! Thinking of this, an excited expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He hesitated a bit, then gathered his courage: "Shi Pan, can you take me to meet that senior expert?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan's face showed both surprise and delight, and he finally nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and Liu Xi, full of trepidation, finally wove through the ghostly army and saw the black-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He quickly bowed down: "Scattered Cultivator Liu Xi pays respects to the Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Pan's eyes were shining: "Master, how did you subdue all these ghosts?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi's eyes also showed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>Ghosts were so mysterious that even Celestial Immortals seemed powerless against them.</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi had heard that there was once a Dao Sovereign Immortal who was very interested in the ghosts here, but dared not enter himself, and spent a huge price to buy a ghost back to study, ultimately concluding that ghosts were unfathomable, hiding great terror.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a kind-hearted person, I can't bear to see them wandering around like homeless ghosts at night, so I took them in," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This world still has more good people.</p><p></p><p>Some lords would drive away the homeless, some would even rename them, but Qi Yuan chose to take them in and let them work.</p><p></p><p>This kindness could never be repaid in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Xi really wanted to sneer.</p><p></p><p>This was not like homeless ghosts at all, these were real ghosts! And giving ghosts a job, what was the meaning of that? He couldn't keep up with Qi Yuan's way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>"These ghostly armies were originally kind-hearted, but... evil people have polluted them, using bells to control them to patrol the heavens and slaughter the innocent," Qi Yuan said, taking out a bell.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shi Pan's eyes lit up: "Grandpa Niu was right, the ghosts of the past... were protecting us, they must have been controlled by bad people."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Shi Pan, his thoughts drifting far away.</p><p></p><p>These ghostly armies had guarded the borders in life.</p><p></p><p>Later, they were defeated, the world shattered, with their clan nearly wiped out, only a few escaping to the Heavenly Chasm Realm.</p><p></p><p>And they became ghosts, still guarding their clansmen, clearing obstacles for the continuation of their clan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Holy Light Sect appeared, and these ghosts were brought under control.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Xi narrowed his eyes, as if he had thought of something, and said in a low voice, "In the Heavenly Chasm Realm, the one with the power to control the ghostly armies must undoubtedly be the Holy Light Sect. Senior, you have offended the Holy Light Sect, and must be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi had also vaguely heard some rumors about the ghosts.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Sect was backed by a Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>Truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"No worries, I'm quite familiar with the Holy Light Clan," Qi Yuan grinned.</p><p></p><p>He had once hunted the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Xi's heart tightened, feeling that this senior was mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan thought of something and suddenly said, "Fellow Daoist, how about you help me with a task?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi heard this and felt a sense of being favored.</p><p></p><p>This Venerable One actually called him "Fellow Daoist", how could he not be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I want to collect some rare treasures, not caring about the quality, only the quantity.</p><p></p><p>Originally, I wanted these ghosts to help me collect them, but alas... people in the world always have prejudices, and I'm afraid others will be frightened by the sight of ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, you are a lone cultivator, so you can take some ghosts with you to collect some treasures for me.</p><p></p><p>I don't lack spirit stones or other treasures."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, casually tossing a storage bag to Liu Xi.</p><p></p><p>He didn't lack money.</p><p></p><p>Especially after killing so many Celestial Immortals, he even cleaned out the Demon Roc Clan.</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi's expression was a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Doing tasks for the Venerable One naturally had many benefits, but... there were also risks.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Venerable One had slapped the face of the Holy Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>If they retaliated, he dared not.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating a bit, he struggled: "Apologies, senior, I'm usually reclusive and don't interact much with others, I'm afraid I'll hinder your task."</p><p></p><p>Liu Xi gritted his teeth and refused.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the opportunity, his life was more important.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Shi Pan couldn't help but say, "Master, how about me?"</p><p></p><p>He was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he was still very young.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he had no cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shi Pan's words, Liu Xi couldn't help but want to laugh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This little guy, he really dared to dream, he was courting death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to ponder for a moment: "Of course... it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Even Liubang's Pei County could produce so many talented people.</p><p></p><p>So to Qi Yuan, apart from top-tier talents, what this world lacked the most was "capable people".</p><p></p><p>For a person, the scarcest thing is opportunity.</p><p></p><p>As long as it's not too abstract, after being in that position and tempering for a while, they may not do badly.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't care about other people's abilities anyway.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have let Sister Niujiao join his little team?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shi Pan's face lit up with ecstatic joy: "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"This talisman is for you, it will protect you," Qi Yuan said, casually tossing a talisman to Shi Pan, "I'll give you a ghostly army, you can go trade with them.</p><p></p><p>Handle everything as you see fit, don't disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had an air of a hands-off boss.</p><p></p><p>His main target was the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner after all.</p><p></p><p>Everything else was secondary.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" Shi Pan took the storage bag and talisman, his heart overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"If you can't open the storage bag, let the ghosts open it for you," Qi Yuan said, tossing over a jade slip as well, "Go cultivate this technique on your own."</p><p></p><p>This cultivation technique was collected from the Demon Roc Clan.</p><p></p><p>To Qi Yuan, it was almost like junk.</p><p></p><p>But for the cultivators outside, this cultivation technique was enough to make even Yin Deities go mad with envy.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Liu Xi looked at Shi Pan with some envy, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many benefits there were, it was a pity he couldn't use them. </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Holy Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Remnant Venerable frowned, his body hunched over like an old servant.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a mythical being lowered his head, his forehead beaded with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday's ghostly patrol had a major loophole, causing the loss of tens of thousands of ghostly armies.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be afraid.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Remnant Venerable's eyes were hazy: "The ability to control the ghostly armies is no longer something we can manage."</p><p></p><p>This matter had also exceeded Celestial Remnant Venerable's expectations.</p><p></p><p>In the past, for the sake of his son, he had no choice but to enter the Heavenly Chasm Realm, only to be trapped by the Holy Light Clan, becoming a slave to that Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Celestial Immortals in the Sixth Heaven knew about the Holy Light Clan in the Heavenly Chasm Realm.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, they should not enter the Heavenly Chasm Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if they did enter, they would avoid the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>But that person, not only did he not avoid it, he even imprisoned the ghosts.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be alarmed? Was that Celestial Immortal suicidal?</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, what should we do now?" the mythical being said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Remnant Venerable narrowed his eyes: "For the next ghostly patrol, stay further away from that person, and wait for the master to emerge from seclusion before deciding."</p><p></p><p>The mythical being heard this and finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But the worry in his brows never dissipated.</p><p></p><p>If the master emerged and blamed him, he might not escape with his life.</p><p></p><p>Spring came and went, autumn followed.</p><p></p><p>The years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the military camp, Qi Yuan was sleeping restlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, these ghostly messengers have become smart, they're patrolling underground now!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, all these years, Qi Yuan not only secretly watched the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, but also constantly gathered ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Giving those homeless ghosts proper jobs.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Sect also wasn't as arrogant as imagined, the patrols had been avoiding Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At first it was fine, they just stayed far away from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It wasted a lot of Qi Yuan's effort to bring those homeless ghosts back.</p><p></p><p>The other side's patrols became more and more remote and hidden, they didn't dare to be open and aboveboard.</p><p></p><p>This time, it's even better, they're not patrolling the heavens, they're patrolling underground directly!</p><p></p><p>Luckily, Qi Yuan's senses were sharp, he immediately discovered the traces of those ghostly messengers and rescued his ghostly brothers from underground.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Shi Pan requests an audience!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came, and in the distance, a tall, somewhat heroic-looking young man appeared. </p><p></p><p>This man was Shi Pan.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his youthful innocence six years ago, he had matured a lot and become a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>It seems there will be another harvest this time.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

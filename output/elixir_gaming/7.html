        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he saw the flaws in this elixir formula.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the method to improve the elixir formula also appeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this improvement is not the optimal solution.</p><p></p><p>If the elixir formula is shown to him again tomorrow, new improvement methods will appear.</p><p></p><p>The improvement effect will also be better.</p><p></p><p>It's just that, for the same item, he can only see the hidden information once a day.</p><p></p><p>And the Seven-Color Refining Flame Technique he cultivated has been constantly revised.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the Seven-Color Refining Flame Technique still has major problems.</p><p></p><p>"The Nourishing Elixir formula has many issues," Qi Yuan directly answered.</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu's eyes showed an expectant expression: "Please, junior brother, teach me."</p><p></p><p>"Replace the cinnabar and yellow with female sophora."</p><p></p><p>"Female sophora?" Zhuge Miu was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Because what he most wanted to ask was what the lacking parts were, but Qi Yuan's junior brother directly modified the elixir formula.</p><p></p><p>However, recalling the last time he went to exchange with Qi Yuan's junior brother, Qi Yuan's unrestrained thinking still amazed him.</p><p></p><p>That time, Qi Yuan's junior brother had helped him a lot.</p><p></p><p>And it was he who actively sought help from Qi Yuan's junior brother, so he had to hold back any opinions.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Zhuge Miu sensed something, and he spoke, "Qi Yuan junior brother, wait a moment, I have a transmission."</p><p></p><p>"Is it a phone call?" Qi Yuan didn't mind, "You go ahead and take it."</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, there is no invention of the telephone, but there is transmission.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators can contact each other through transmission.</p><p></p><p>But this transmission has distance limitations, the farther the transmission, the higher the price.</p><p></p><p>And when entering certain secret realms, the usual effect is lost.</p><p></p><p>So not all cultivators can afford to use it.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with my junior brother?" Zhuge Miu lowered his voice to receive the transmission.</p><p></p><p>"The complete elixir formula, have you found it?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, don't get involved in this matter."</p><p></p><p>With one transmission, Zhuge Miu's face had a hint of joy, but then he heard his junior brother's persuasion, and he had some anger.</p><p></p><p>He cut off the transmission and looked at Qi Yuan, calming his mood: "Junior brother, please continue."</p><p></p><p>"The lacking part is the ram's horn.</p><p></p><p>But the ram's horn has a yang nature, which is quite conflicting, so it can be replaced with small marigold, with a better effect."  Qi Yuan finished speaking and extended his hand, "The foundation treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu was still digesting Qi Yuan's words, and when he heard Qi Yuan asking for the foundation treasure, he quickly took out a jade bamboo.</p><p></p><p>The jade bamboo was purple in color, like purple jade, and only had a touch of transparency at the joints.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo, an eighth-grade foundation treasure."</p><p></p><p>Foundation treasures have grades.</p><p></p><p>They are divided into lower three grades, middle three grades, and upper three grades.</p><p></p><p>As for the grades above the upper three, there are even more legendary higher grades.</p><p></p><p>The higher the grade of the foundation treasure, the better the foundation building effect and the greater the potential.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the cultivation world is a place where miracles exist, and there are surprises everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Nothing is a certainty.</p><p></p><p>There is no such thing as being stuck in a certain stage for the rest of one's life just because a low-grade foundation treasure was used for foundation building.</p><p></p><p>Every foundation treasure is of great value.</p><p></p><p>The eighth grade is the foundation treasure of the lower three grades.</p><p></p><p>But even so, most of the ordinary qi-refining disciples of the Divine Light Sect have exhausted their family fortunes, yet still cannot afford the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Zhuge Miu can use the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo as remuneration shows his financial strength.</p><p></p><p>This is the gap between the peak disciples and the ordinary disciples.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even for Zhuge Miu, taking out the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo still makes him feel a bit of pain.</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu continued, "The grade of the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo is a bit low. Qi Yuan junior brother, if you're not in a hurry, you can gather some more spirit stones and exchange it together with the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo for a higher-grade foundation treasure."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo, although extremely precious among the other disciples, for the peak disciples of each peak, using a low-grade foundation treasure for foundation building would be a bit inadequate.</p><p></p><p>For example, Zhuge Miu used the fifth-grade Seeking Dragon Ruler, a middle three-grade foundation treasure, for his foundation building.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo and nodded: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Crystal Jade Bamboo was not his first choice for a foundation treasure.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, even if he didn't need it, he could still exchange it for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the eldest disciple of the Seven-Colored Peak, but... he was truly poor.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the other peak's chief disciples, the gap was not just a little.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Thinking of something, Zhuge Miu said, "Shidi Qi Yuan, if you hadn't offended your master, you might have had a mid-grade spiritual item, or even a high-grade foundation-building spiritual item, and entered the Foundation Establishment realm by now."</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu's words carried a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Qi Yuan was really audacious, to even dare offend the peak master of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect was in awe of the peak master of the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu had once heard his master say that the Divine Light Sect originally only had four peaks, but after Ruan Yixie came, the Divine Light Sect gained an additional peak, called the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>This peak had a history of over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the peak master of the Seven-Colored Peak might have lived for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>A lifespan of a thousand years, that must be at least at the Spirit Embryo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert could walk freely in the Great Liang Empire.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took Ruan Yixie as his master, what a bold move was that? As a result, Qi Yuan's audacity offended Ruan Yixie.</p><p></p><p>All the resources were cut off for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's situation was truly miserable.</p><p></p><p>If it were Zhuge Miu, he would have been begging for forgiveness in front of his master long ago.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, on the other hand, didn't even have the intention to apologize.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about it, Qi Yuan was a cultivator of the Foolish Lineage, so it was easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of this lineage were unrestrained and their thought processes were not quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhuge Miu's words, Qi Yuan's eyes became gentle: "I didn't say anything wrong, why should I apologize?"</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat flowed down Zhuge Miu's back.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi Qi Yuan, let's stop here!"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that Qi Yuan would commit another outrageous act and offend the lofty and aloof immortal beauty on the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, it would implicate him, and that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "You are all afraid of Ruan Yixie, but I'm not afraid, because she is my..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say it!" Zhuge Miu's heart raced, hastily stopping Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the one on the Seven-Colored Peak got angry, he wouldn't have a good ending.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't continue, bid farewell to Zhuge Miu, and continued to wander while holding his vegetable knife.</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu then heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an anxious voice came: "Elder Brother, have you made the exchange?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Langhu, in a blue robe and cloth, had a gourd tied to his waist, and his steps were hurried.</p><p></p><p>He said, taking out a yellowed piece of paper, "This is a pill formula I found in the market today, the same as the Nourishing Element Pill you obtained in the secret realm, so I quickly contacted the Elder Brother."</p><p></p><p>Xu Langhu handed the pill formula to Zhuge Miu, and when he saw the purple crystal bamboo on Zhuge Miu's waist was gone, he said with distress:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, we already have the pill formula here, why did you still trade with Qi Yuan? Qi Yuan is not one of our Divine Medicine Peak's people, what ability does he have to help Elder Brother examine the pill formula? He should not have left yet, I'll go catch up and get the purple crystal bamboo back!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Langhu said a lot, completely unaware that Zhuge Miu's face had darkened.</p><p></p><p>"My trade with Shidi Qi Yuan, what right do you have to judge? And even if Shidi Qi Yuan didn't help me, so what? I'm willing to give him a favor."</p><p></p><p>Previously, the message Zhuge Miu received was the one Xu Langhu had sent out.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Zhuge Miu had already learned that his shidi had the complete pill formula, he had the opportunity to terminate the trade, but he didn't.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother..." Xu Langhu's voice was a little uneasy, "I'm just worried that you'll return empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, I obtained the complete pill formula.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother, you have saved my life, so I'll offer the pill formula to you."</p><p></p><p>He no longer mentioned Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his view, how could Qi Yuan understand the pill formula?</p><p></p><p>He had studied medicine for ten years in the Divine Medicine Peak, and still couldn't complete the pill formula, Qi Yuan could?</p><p></p><p>Zhuge Miu took the pill formula: "Let me take a look, compare it with what Shidi Qi Yuan said, and refine a few batches of Nourishing Element Pills."</p><p></p><p>"This is a bit too wasteful of medicinal materials," Xu Langhu muttered, obviously feeling that using Qi Yuan's method, they wouldn't be able to refine any Nourishing Element Pills.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

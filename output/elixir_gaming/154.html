        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mourn for 30 breaths for the Blood-Robed Sword God"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God is gone, but his spirit remains!"</p><p></p><p>"Remembering the past, when I was little the Blood-Robed Sword God once held me..."</p><p></p><p>"There is true feeling in this world, I will abstain from sex for 3 days for the Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan logged into the Divine Flower Society forum and saw these posts, his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm not dead yet, why are you mourning for me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He guessed these people probably all thought he would definitely lose in his battle with the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>That's why they were making such posts.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it was still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then used the Blood-Robed Sword God's account to make a post.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Blood-Robed Sword God, have good news for everyone - the Palace of Light has been destroyed, justice has finally triumphed over evil!"</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the four words "Blood-Robed Sword God" were a hot topic. Even when Qi Yuan made a post, he had to include his own name in the title to ride the popularity.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he posted, replies quickly appeared below.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Blood-Robed Sword God is still alive?"</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light is destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>"Did the sun fall from the sky today and make me go crazy?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this a fake Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God's post coming back from the dead caused the Divine Flower Society forum to explode.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Divine Flower Society were spread all over the Cang Lan Realm, so the news of the Blood-Robed Sword God destroying the Palace of Light hadn't reached many of them yet. Many people didn't know.</p><p></p><p>In their view, the Blood-Robed Sword God fighting against the Palace of Light with its Yin God foundation was sure to lose.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blood-Robed Sword God had won. How could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>"Elder, I knew you would definitely win this battle!" Fox Den Little Li replied, then secretly deleted her own post mourning the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>The forum was in an uproar, contributing to warming up the Cang Lan Realm, then erupted in joyous celebration.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, news of the Blood-Robed Sword God destroying the Palace of Light also began to slowly spread throughout the Emerald Cloud Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Elder... how did you win?" </p><p></p><p>Someone asked at this time.</p><p></p><p>Many people were also puzzled and curious.</p><p></p><p>How did the Blood-Robed Sword God defeat the Palace of Light?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many Purple Mansion cultivators were also paying attention to this question.</p><p></p><p>"At the time, the Palace of Light used the Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown, and the Grand Palace Master used the Divine Finger.</p><p></p><p>I thought I was going to die.</p><p></p><p>But then I remembered the thousands and millions of people supporting me.</p><p></p><p>So I found the big shots in the Divine Flower Society and borrowed Immortal Golden Pills, Nine Revolutions Golden Pills, millions of Golden Pills, as well as Stellar Golden Pills...</p><p></p><p>Countless Golden Pills fell, even summoning the sun, and destroyed the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embellished, half-truth and half-fiction.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was currently only a Stellar Golden Core cultivator, not even comparable to a perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Building. He had to hide his true abilities and conceal his trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Everyone paying attention to this post was stunned.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect to get such an answer.</p><p></p><p>"The sun in the sky was summoned by a big shot?"</p><p></p><p>"...Is this real or fake?"</p><p></p><p>Some people were silent, some were confused, and some spoke the truth in a joking tone.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. When the Divine Flower Society big shots appear, I can only be considered a small shrimp. If it wasn't for the big shots lending me Stellar Golden Pills to use, I might have died," Qi Yuan replied seriously.</p><p></p><p>Using your own things can't be called borrowing?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Eastern Lands, inside a cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>A man in golden robes looked at the contents of the jade slip in silence.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Blood-Robed Sword God battle the Palace of Light, he had already concluded halfway through that the Blood-Robed Sword God would definitely lose, so he left directly.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't watched the latter half of the battle, and didn't expect the situation to change drastically at the end.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man beside him asked the golden-robed man: "Is what he said true or false?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man recalled the blood-colored figure he had seen that day, and said slowly: "The blood qi on his body was overwhelming, he should be a demonic path giant who has slaughtered tens of millions.</p><p></p><p>From my distant observation, I also didn't detect any divine nature on him, so he couldn't possibly be a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>Summoning the sun... is too shocking.</p><p></p><p>In our Cang Lan Realm, besides the legendary one, who else can hold up a divine position in the myriad realms and illuminate all worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Speaking of that person, deep wariness appeared in the golden-robed man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even dare to mention that person's name.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man's heart also sank.</p><p></p><p>Because that person... could not be spoken of.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying he summoned the sun, I'm more inclined to believe he had help.</p><p></p><p>When killing the envoy of Venerable Ye Qiong, he mentioned the name of Lord Wind.</p><p></p><p>If it was Lord Wind, it would be... normal.</p><p></p><p>It's just that... with the great calamity approaching, all the Yin Gods try not to take action if they can avoid it, to conserve their strength.</p><p></p><p>Why would Lord Wind take action?"</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying that miserly old man Lord Wind took action, I'd rather believe the Blood-Robed Sword God summoned the sun." The old man was an elder of the Dao Seeking Palace, of the same generation as Lord Wind. The two had known each other in their youth.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, one became a Yin God, while the other was still seeking at the late stage of the Purple Mansion realm.</p><p></p><p>He was most familiar with Lord Wind's personality.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you came back too quickly. A powerhouse like the Blood-Robed Sword God should be recruited into our Dao Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>His strength is even greater than Old Man Wutian." The white-haired old man lamented.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wutian was among the top tier of late stage Purple Mansion cultivators in the Dao Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>"He survived this time, but he has thoroughly offended Venerable Ye Qiong. I estimate he's not far from death!" The golden-robed man couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>"If he could destroy the Palace of Light, why couldn't he kill Venerable Ye Qiong?" The white-haired old man smiled.</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man glared at the white-haired old man: "How can the Palace of Light with just one incomplete Yin God artifact be compared to the real Venerable Ye Qiong?"</p><p></p><p>"How do you know that someone who could easily destroy the Palace of Light can't kill Venerable Ye Qiong?" The white-haired old man still smiled. "It's a pity I can't get away recently, otherwise this old man would definitely go meet this Blood-Robed Sword God."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was enjoying everyone's praise, feeling elated.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a comment caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God, I heard you killed Venerable Ye Qiong's envoy on your way to the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I did." Qi Yuan replied briefly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's response, some people were confused, as they didn't know who Venerable Ye Qiong was.</p><p></p><p>But there were many big shots gathered in the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>"You even dare to kill a Yin God's envoy, big shot... you're truly strong!</p><p></p><p>Elder, you should leave the Eastern Lands quickly!" That person replied.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators following this thread were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Fox Den Little Li looked at the content, her expression dazed.</p><p></p><p>She had just commented on the thread that she was with the Blood-Robed Sword God, defeating all enemies who came.</p><p></p><p>But no one told her the enemy was a Yin God? She went crazy, pulling her hair: "Wuwu, I'll never reply to you again!"</p><p></p><p>But then thinking about how she was getting close to the Blood-Robed Sword God, and others called her Sister Li, she couldn't resist.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the comments below and replied.</p><p></p><p>"His envoy threatened me, claiming he would kill me, so I had no choice but to strike first.</p><p></p><p>If Venerable Ye Qiong is also so blind, I'll have to let him know why the sun is so red!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society cultivators below, seeing the Blood-Robed Sword God's reply, were completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>If killing Venerable Ye Qiong's envoy had offended Venerable Ye Qiong,</p><p></p><p>These words now were completely provocative!</p><p></p><p>"Elder is too fierce!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder, please be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually glanced at the comments, then switched accounts and logged into the Divine Flower Four Emperors chat group.</p><p></p><p>"I have good news for everyone, the 'Hundred Days to Destroy the Palace of Light Plan' has been completed ahead of schedule!"</p><p></p><p>"Big shot 666!"</p><p></p><p>"This queen said it, the Origin Heavenly Venerable is no ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Venerable and Ice Mountain Domineering Woman praised enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the Great Sun Flame Emperor?" Qi Yuan asked. Missing one person to praise him felt not quite right.</p><p></p><p>"He was here a few hours ago, but later he said his old man was looking for him, so he didn't show up. Probably had some urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>Based on my years of experience, he likely offended his old man and got confined."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Qi Yuan felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Heavenly Venerable, those sisters of mine earned nearly a million spirit stones because of you. They all want to meet you in person to thank you," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, no need to meet in person to thank me."</p><p></p><p>"It's right not to meet. If those flirty hooves see you, they'll probably strip your clothes off." Ice Mountain Domineering Woman spoke as domineeringly as ever.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Venerable looked at this and swallowed.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to be stripped by immortal sisters.</p><p></p><p>"One sister's family runs the Seven Sounds Pavilion. She said from now on when you go to her place to have fun, it's all free."</p><p></p><p>"Seven Sounds Pavilion?" Rogue Immortal Venerable drooled enviously.</p><p></p><p>That was even more high-end than the Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean the Origin Heavenly Venerable can freeload in the future?</p><p></p><p>"I don't lack any of these things. What I lack most now are cultivation techniques - the more the better, and the higher level the better," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't interested in freeloading.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivation techniques were what he needed most.</p><p></p><p>Originally,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He went full of expectations to meet with the old men and women of the Light Palace, but... they were too weak and frail, and disappeared while sunbathing. </p><p></p><p>They didn't leave behind any cultivation techniques or inheritance. The Light Palace headquarters was also dragged into the void realm, and everything was gone.</p><p></p><p>With the long-awaited cultivation technique gone, Qi Yuan had to look elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said: "Leave it to me, I'll squeeze some juice out of them today!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ice Mountain Domineering Woman. </p><p></p><p>I'm logging off now, the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle is about to start. I need to work hard, otherwise it would be embarrassing if I don't make the top 20.</p><p></p><p>Oh, when the Great Sun Flame Emperor comes online, remember to tell him for me that I didn't let everyone down, I destroyed the Light Palace."</p><p></p><p>When the Rogue Immortal Lord saw this, he was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable... you're still participating in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle?"</p><p></p><p>The person who destroyed the Light Palace said he was going to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle?</p><p></p><p>Is this just playing house? You should know that participants in the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle can't be over 200 years old.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable must be at least a thousand years old, right?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was naturally unaware of the Rogue Immortal Lord's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he returned to his cave dwelling and continued to refine the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>"The path of the Elemental Core is to grow bigger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>My Golden Core is a fixed star, so continuously devouring other stars in the universe will make me stronger."</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the True Fire of the Sun, Qi Yuan had a clear idea of how to proceed on his Elemental Core path.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation technique was not yet perfected.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Core is a fixed star, so what is the Divine Infant?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stumped.</p><p></p><p>Although he had read many secret manuals, his understanding of the Divine Infant was only superficial.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Qi Yuan looked at the small sun in the sky and thought of Ning Tao again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was still very little spiritual energy in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Killing a Purple Palace cultivator was no problem, but summoning the Golden Core and Ning Tao was still far from enough.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the 'Qi Yuan Scripture' is too lacking, so spiritual energy recovery is too slow," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and looked at Jiang Ya not far away, his eyes lighting up.</p><p></p><p>She was a rich woman, and the direction of her wealth was very similar to what Qi Yuan lacked.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Jiang Ya, you are widely read. I have a question, may I ask for your guidance?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan and spoke concisely: "You may."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have reached the Elemental Core stage, I'm still confused about the path of the Divine Infant." Qi Yuan looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>"The path of the Divine Infant..." Jiang Ya was about to say.</p><p></p><p>At this time, she heard Qi Yuan say:</p><p></p><p>"I used the Five Elements Qi to build the foundation of Qi Refinement; I used the Heavenly Dao to build the foundation and form a fixed star Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>What kind of Divine Infant would be worthy of my level?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The words she had organized in her mind could not be spoken.</p><p></p><p>Smile, be elegant.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya told herself this in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan and said: "Perhaps there is someone who can give you an answer."</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" Qi Yuan asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth on the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking, Great Wisdom True Lord," Jiang Ya said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Good name, must be a smart person!" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Knowing a person by their name, he could already imagine that this was a truly great talent.</p><p></p><p>"He is like you, a cultivator obsessed with the Dao, and... he has already stepped into the Divine Infant realm, perhaps he can give you a lot of advice," Jiang Ya said, "If Junior Brother Qi Yuan wants to meet him, I can contact him for you now."</p><p></p><p>"Meet!" Qi Yuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>Of course he wanted to meet!</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Jiang Ya turned around and took out a communication jade slip.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As night fell, a flower boat stopped by the shore.</p><p></p><p>A man with a big pompadour, floral shorts, and an ill-fitting long robe.</p><p></p><p>He looked out of place on the flower boat.</p><p></p><p>However, when the people on the boat saw the man, they all showed reverent expressions.</p><p></p><p>Because this man was the fourth ranked on the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking, Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Great Wisdom True Lord's gaze was clear as he stared at the hand of a female cultivator next to him, making her feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>The woman's delicate hand had long, slender fingers, snow-white and smooth skin, with long nails painted a light rouge, looking pure and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Moon Immortal's pair of jade hands are beautiful and priceless. Is Great Wisdom True Lord also versed in this?" A prodigy in hemp clothes next to him said, wanting to get closer to Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord looked at those jade hands, his gaze clear and thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"Are her nails so long for picking her nose?"</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence on the flower boat, and even the prodigy who had just spoken couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Wind Moon Immortal's face turned red with embarrassment, her expression constantly changing, wanting to sink into the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cheerful voice came: "My suggestion is, if you're picking your nose, don't paint your nails, it will hurt your nose."</p><p></p><p>A man in black clothes boarded the flower boat.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Great Wisdom True Lord with reverence: "My name is Qi Yuan, Senior Sister Jiang Ya asked me to come seek guidance from Great Wisdom True Lord regarding the Divine Infant!"</p><p></p><p>The others looked at Qi Yuan, then at Great Wisdom True Lord, with complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>Wind Moon Immortal glared fiercely at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare offend Great Wisdom True Lord, but she dared to offend this unknown Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes lighting up: "How do you think Wind Moon Immortal should pick her nose better?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Qi Yuan sat down next to Great Wisdom True Lord and pondered, "Using nails to pick is indeed inelegant.</p><p></p><p>Immortals don't defecate or pick their noses.</p><p></p><p>So why not create a special Dao technique specifically for picking noses?"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist is truly talented!" Great Wisdom True Lord looked at Qi Yuan with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Great Wisdom True Lord, feeling a sense of meeting a kindred spirit.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a voice suddenly came:</p><p></p><p>"Not good, Wind Moon Immortal has fallen into the river!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Wind Moon Immortal in the river with pitying gazes.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord saw this and slowly said: "Wind Moon Immortal must have been inspired by Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan and entered the river to comprehend the flow of water, and then create a special Dao technique for picking noses."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone present silently mourned for Wind Moon Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Probably by tomorrow, Wind Moon Immortal would have a new nickname, Nose-Picking Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and went straight to the point: "Fellow Daoist, regarding the path of the Divine Infant, I've always felt the road ahead is vague.</p><p></p><p>I've heard that to form the Divine Infant, one must shatter the Golden Core to form the infant.</p><p></p><p>But I worked so hard to form my Golden Core, I'm reluctant to shatter it.</p><p></p><p>What should I do about this?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had worked so hard to form his fixed star Golden Core, how could he bear to shatter it? That was his child.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the others were stunned when they heard Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Is there anyone who doesn't want to shatter their core to form the infant? Has this person gone crazy from cultivation?</p><p></p><p>No wonder... he could communicate so smoothly with Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord looked at Qi Yuan and pondered: "Sigh, I didn't expect great minds think alike.</p><p></p><p>When I first built my foundation, I pondered this question."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but look at Great Wisdom True Lord with newfound respect.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a far-sighted prodigy!</p><p></p><p>When he built his foundation, how could he have thought about the Divine Infant? But this person had thought about it at the Foundation Building stage.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, after much thought, I created a Two Core method," Great Wisdom True Lord said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"I first formed a false core, then formed a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when breaking through to the Divine Infant stage, I shattered the false core and kept the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>So now, inside my body, I have both a Golden Core and a Divine Infant!"</p><p></p><p>A false core is when a Foundation Building cultivator, with no hope of breaking through to the Golden Core stage, uses external objects to form a false core.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was shocked by Great Wisdom True Lord's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>This is what it means to be a prodigy, this is what it means to have great wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"However, this method has a flaw, which is that the Golden Core and Divine Infant in my body often fight," Great Wisdom True Lord said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>The prodigies beside him looked at Great Wisdom True Lord speechlessly.</p><p></p><p>Not only do your Golden Core and Divine Infant fight, but you yourself often fight with yourself.</p><p></p><p>They knew that Great Wisdom True Lord had a split personality, and two personalities had already appeared in his body.</p><p></p><p>"Such small problems are not problems," Qi Yuan said carelessly, "Excellent techniques will always have some issues. The technique I created also has flaws. After cultivation, it causes mental confusion and poor memory.</p><p></p><p>But aren't I in good spirits now? I can eat eight steamed buns in one sitting!"</p><p></p><p>The people present looked at Qi Yuan and instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>This is called being in good spirits?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they felt even more sorry for Wind Moon Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Why was she targeted by two mentally ill people? Too pitiful.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I have already entered the Elemental Core realm and cannot cultivate the Two Core method," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord's path was not suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>Those who understand, understand. Six o'clock tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

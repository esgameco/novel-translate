        <h1>Chapter 433</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue smiled gently: "Little Lu is a very nice and kind person. As for An Xunlu... well, she's quite gossipy and very jealous. She likes to talk behind people's backs, so you need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Ziyuan Daxue, I not only like to talk behind people's backs, I also like to badmouth people to their faces!" An Xunlu glared at Ziyuan Daxue, not even trying to hide her murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>This further confirmed Qi Yuan's suspicion that there was something off about the bloodline of this Ziyuan Clan. The cultivators here were all a bit crazy. Compared to them, cultivators from places like the Moon Palace and other areas seemed much more normal. On the surface, they were polite and courteous when interacting.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, he just arrived in Ziyuan Heaven and is already placed at the head of us demon children. I'd like to see what abilities he really has!" An Xunlu was also a fierce character, quick to action.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Qi Yuan blink in surprise. This was the true flavor of the cultivation world. In his previous experiences cultivating, the people he encountered had all been too friendly. For example, during this trip to the Jiang family, no punks had jumped out to provoke him.</p><p></p><p>"What's your cultivation level? I'll lower mine to match yours, otherwise you can't say it's unfair."</p><p></p><p>"I'm at the Purple Palace stage," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu's face instantly flushed red with anger: "You shameless bastard!" This guy was too shameless! Pretending to be at the Purple Palace stage.</p><p></p><p>"I really am at the Purple Palace stage, I'm not lying," Qi Yuan said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue, seeing An Xunlu at a loss, laughed heartily: "I can vouch for him, he really is at the Purple Palace stage."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" An Xunlu was so angry her chest heaved, revealing a large expanse of cleavage. She turned and flew away in a huff.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Qi Yuan disappointed. He had wanted to see what level a "Purple Palace" cultivator from a major power was at.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue squinted her eyes and said suggestively: "White? Big?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was confused, not understanding Ziyuan Daxue's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Her... don't you want to have a taste?"</p><p></p><p>"...Hey, can you not be such a female pervert?" Qi Yuan was exasperated. </p><p></p><p>These Black Demon Abyss people really had abnormal minds.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Ziyuan Xiaolu's face was bright red, her hands clutching the hem of her clothes. If she wasn't so shy, she probably would have covered her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Sis was just joking, don't get any ideas. Even if you wanted to, you wouldn't have a chance. The person An Xunlu likes... is Black Sword." At the mention of Black Sword, Ziyuan Daxue's face took on a rare serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't spread false rumors about me, I never said I wanted to... do that with An Xunlu!" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>These Black Demon Abyss people were too good at spreading rumors! Though this kind of situation was also common on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>A typical case: Someone posts asking if XX has erectile dysfunction. Then others post saying they heard XX has erectile dysfunction. </p><p></p><p>Hmm... and so the rumor spreads successfully.</p><p></p><p>However, this usually takes time to develop. </p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue's rumor-mongering had no build-up at all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that the Ziyuan Clan's ability to survive so long despite their loose tongues must be due to their strong bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you have no sense of humor. Sis said all that just to bring up Black Sword."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, how do you know about cells?" Qi Yuan blinked in surprise. </p><p></p><p>Could she be a fellow earthling?</p><p></p><p>"We in the Black Demon Abyss have been researching bloodlines, so it's not too much to create the term 'cell', is it?" Ziyuan Daxue looked at Qi Yuan like he was a country bumpkin.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately understood. </p><p></p><p>Having reached the Yang Spirit stage, if their eyes weren't better than microscopes, that would be too pathetic.</p><p></p><p>"You need to work harder and cultivate the Ancestral Blood Scripture diligently to surpass Black Sword. That guy is called the light of the Black Demon Abyss. I'm quite rebellious and don't like him," Ziyuan Daxue said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword was hailed as the number one genius of the Black Demon Abyss, capable of becoming a Great Principle. And not just any Great Principle, but one like that person from the Tai Huang Palace who had comprehended the Supreme Principle.</p><p></p><p>In all the years the Black Demon Abyss had been one of the six major powers, they had never produced a Great Principle who comprehended the Supreme Principle. So they placed great importance on Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses like Ziyuan Daxue had also been indoctrinated with many ideas. After reaching the Yang Spirit stage, they were expected to follow Black Sword's lead. </p><p></p><p>Naturally, she was unwilling to accept this.</p><p></p><p>"Ox Horn Sis, don't worry. You helped me last time, so next time I'll help you deal with Black Sword," Qi Yuan said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"You're really taking this seriously?" Ziyuan Daxue said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>But then she thought that since Blood Robe considered that person from Tai Huang Palace his main enemy, it was normal for him to look down on Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>"I was just joking, don't actually go looking for trouble with Black Sword. That guy is terrifying. He's... the disciple of the Black Demon Ancestor. Even our patriarch has to call him junior brother when they meet," Ziyuan Daxue said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Ancestor was the senior among the Nine Elders of the Black Demon Abyss. Most of the other eight elders were his disciples. </p><p></p><p>So Black Sword's seniority was higher than all of theirs.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Daxue shrugged: "Your cave dwelling is up ahead. I won't go any further. Ziyuan Xiaolu is very virtuous and good at housework, so let her help you tidy up your dwelling."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ziyuan Daxue left while yawning.</p><p></p><p>Although the patriarch thought highly of Blood Robe, Ziyuan Daxue also understood that no matter how strong Blood Robe's bloodline was, it couldn't compare to Black Sword's. The Black Demon Ancestral Blood was limited.</p><p></p><p>In the now empty space, only Qi Yuan and the shy Ziyuan Xiaolu remained.</p><p></p><p>"Pink Horn Little Sis, I'll have to trouble you with the cleaning!" Qi Yuan said to Ziyuan Xiaolu, his expression gentle.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Xiaolu's face reddened, seemingly embarrassed by Qi Yuan's form of address.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head and said softly: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Ziyuan Xiaolu flew towards Qi Yuan's steel cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, thousands upon thousands of Ziyuan Xiaolus appeared in the air, dispersing to various parts of the steel dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan put his hand on his chin with a serious expression, as if pondering something extremely important.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after several dozen breaths of time had passed, an excited look appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"If I could trick Ziyuan Xiaolu into going to Blue Star, I could have some of her work in electronics factories screwing in screws to make big money. And I could send some to be homeless in a certain country and eat them out of house and home!"</p><p></p><p>The more Qi Yuan thought about it, the more clever he felt he was, having discovered another huge business opportunity.</p><p></p><p>This made him quite excited.</p><p></p><p>But then he didn't think about it further. Thinking too much could lead to mental excitement and insomnia.</p><p></p><p>He entered the tidied-up cave dwelling and made some minor adjustments.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Ancestral Blood Scripture and looked at it carefully for a few moments.</p><p></p><p>[This is a bloodline transcendence cultivation method with several flaws. If... corrections were made, cultivation speed could be increased over a hundredfold.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes returned to his old profession, immediately spotting the flaws in the Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>He also gained more information about the Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>"So the Myriad Path Martial God actually contains a special bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"The Devouring Primordial Body... turns out it's not."</p><p></p><p>After being approached by Ziyuan Daxue, Qi Yuan had actually made many guesses.</p><p></p><p>At first, he thought the Devouring Primordial Body given to him by the No Food Holy Mother was an extremely special bloodline.</p><p></p><p>But it turned out to be the Myriad Path Martial God.</p><p></p><p>"So cultivating this Ancestral Blood Scripture can also enhance the potential of my Myriad Path Martial God bloodline, thereby increasing my strength?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Since returning from Arch Star, his Myriad Path Martial God cultivation had stagnated.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts seemed to have reached its end.</p><p></p><p>Now, here he saw a way to enhance the Myriad Path Martial God.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan squinted his eyes as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Path Martial God seems to place more importance on bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"The immortal path focuses on enlightenment and the Dao."</p><p></p><p>These were two different paths.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Myriad Path Martial God won't turn me into a huge muscle freak?" Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, he had already swallowed stars. </p><p></p><p>His dharma body was already incredibly muscular.</p><p></p><p>"Time to start adapting the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' and cultivate!" </p><p></p><p>Without further thought, Qi Yuan began seriously adapting the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>Outside the steel cave dwelling, Zi Yuan Xiaolu's tens of thousands of avatars were still diligently using magic to clean, being extremely careful and meticulous. Qi Yuan closed his eyes and began to focus on his task.</p><p></p><p>Three days passed, and Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A trace of black swirled in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>He had a surprised expression on his face: "The 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' is actually this powerful?"</p><p></p><p>After adapting the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture', he cultivated quickly and finally broke through to the first level through his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>With this breakthrough, he discovered the power of this cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>His Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation... had actually doubled! This was extremely terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that increasing cultivation at the Yang Spirit stage was as difficult as climbing to heaven? How is it this simple?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Just the first level was already this formidable.</p><p></p><p>When mastered fully, wouldn't it allow him to easily defeat a Great Ultimate Principle?</p><p></p><p>Or even stronger?</p><p></p><p>However, at this point, Qi Yuan stopped cultivating.</p><p></p><p>He felt he had cultivated too intensely and was a bit drained, needing to rest for a while.</p><p></p><p>Work and rest in moderation.</p><p></p><p>Using an imperfect analogy, this type of cultivation required the use of a certain type of blood cell, and once those cells were depleted, one had to wait for them to regenerate before cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>This situation actually objectively existed.</p><p></p><p>However, most cultivators of the Black Demon Abyss wouldn't encounter it.</p><p></p><p>After all, they cultivated slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what gift their ancestor gave me?"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Qi Yuan remember that Zi Yuan's ancestor had also given him a small gift.</p><p></p><p>He carefully opened the storage pouch that Zi Yuan Tan had handed him and looked inside.</p><p></p><p>One had to be cautious with things given by a Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a drop of pitch-black blood fell into Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This drop of blood emanated an extremely terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that if it fell, it could crush an entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also sensed an intense feeling of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Through this drop of blood, he seemed to see a supreme powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>[Black Demon Ancestral Blood, the source of the Black Demon Abyss clan's bloodline, a bloodline treasure, blood left behind when a certain being underwent metamorphosis.]</p><p></p><p>His left eyebrow twitched frantically.</p><p></p><p>Indicating this was a good thing, and not dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Smells so good..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a bit hungry.</p><p></p><p>He directly swallowed half of the blood drop in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>He left the other half.</p><p></p><p>Because... he was full.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan felt an intense sense of satiety, and also felt his energy become vigorous again.</p><p></p><p>Countless changes occurred and transformed within his body.</p><p></p><p>He felt his body become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Even without fairy spirit power protecting him, if he encountered past enemies, he wouldn't feel pain even if they punched him in the nose.</p><p></p><p>"I feel incredibly powerful now!"</p><p></p><p>"I could eat 100 million plain steamed buns in one sitting, without even drinking water!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my family's well wanted to swallow the Black Demon Ancestral Blood, this is a great tonic!"</p><p></p><p>"Coming to this Black Demon Abyss was the right choice, it's my lucky place!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was deep, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>With his abundant energy, he now wanted to run a few laps around the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>However, he hesitated again.</p><p></p><p>Why was Zi Yuan Tian's ancestor being so good to him? When things are abnormal, there must be a reason!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered this as he flashed out of the cave dwelling bedroom.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Zi Yuan Xiaolu was lowering her head, the pink horns on her head glowing, seemingly using her head to butt against a door.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a cow plowing a field.</p><p></p><p>"Pink Horn Sister!" Qi Yuan called out.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu stopped what she was doing and ran over to Qi Yuan, panting: "Blood Robe Senior Brother, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe was the leader of the Five Demons, so it was appropriate for her to call him senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"I want to secretly ask you about something important, you absolutely can't tell anyone else!" Qi Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu nodded vigorously, feeling a bit delighted inside.</p><p></p><p>This senior brother still trusted her.</p><p></p><p>She clenched her small fists and moved closer to Qi Yuan: "Please speak, Blood Robe Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"I want to ask, does that ancestor of Zi Yuan Tian have any relatives left outside, like his father... or his ancestors or something?" Qi Yuan voiced his doubts.</p><p></p><p>This question confused Zi Yuan Xiaolu: "This... this junior sister doesn't know."</p><p></p><p>How could she, a mere mythical being, know about the private affairs of Zi Yuan Tian's ancestor, an existence on the level of a Great Ultimate Principle?</p><p></p><p>"Why is Blood Robe Senior Brother asking about this?" Zi Yuan Xiaolu felt some trepidation in her heart.</p><p></p><p>More than that, she was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>In Zi Yuan Tian's territory, discussing the ancestor like this - if the ancestor wanted to, he could sense it at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the ancestor give me a welcome gift?" Qi Yuan looked suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zi Yuan Xiaolu was still confused, and also felt a bit jealous.</p><p></p><p>"The welcome gift he gave me is quite precious, I'll secretly show you a glimpse, don't tell anyone else!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he lifted a corner of the storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu leaned in, her eyes widening: "Black! Demon! Ancestral! Blood!!"</p><p></p><p>Her mind was shaken, and her face showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This was Black Demon Ancestral Blood!</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Spirits at the Ultimate Principle realm weren't qualified to obtain it without establishing a massive industry for the Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Only existences on the level of the Nine Elders had a share.</p><p></p><p>But... it was given to Blood Robe?</p><p></p><p>How could she not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's next words made her even more unable to keep her composure.</p><p></p><p>"Since Black Demon Ancestral Blood is so precious, your ancestor must have a reason for being willing to give it to me.</p><p></p><p>I strongly suspect that I might be an ancestor of your Black Demon Abyss who was left outside for many years." Qi Yuan pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>As for him being Zi Yuan's ancestor's son?</p><p></p><p>That didn't even need to be considered.</p><p></p><p>He had been an orphan since childhood.</p><p></p><p>Since he wasn't someone else's son, there was only one truth - he was someone else's ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would others treat him so well for no reason?</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Xiaolu blinked her eyes, her moist lips parted as her small tongue slid across them, seeming quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>She said pitifully: "Blood Robe Senior Brother, this kind of thing... I don't know."</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare respond to Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>If the ancestor found out, with one angry outburst, she would be finished.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..." Qi Yuan sighed, "I won't trouble you further."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Xiaolu breathed a sigh of relief: "Blood Robe Senior Brother, you absolutely must not speak carelessly about this kind of thing. If the ancestor hears... I'm afraid...</p><p></p><p>Also, Little Lu's mouth is the tightest, please rest assured Blood Robe Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Mm, you continue cleaning, I'll go out and take a look."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his form vanished.</p><p></p><p>He planned to go ask Zi Yuan Daxue, An Xunlu, and other cultivators of Zi Yuan Tian - since the ancestor gave him Black Demon Ancestral Blood, was he the ancestor's wild father from outside?</p><p></p><p>Humans all have curiosity, and Qi Yuan was no exception.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the sky, Zi Yuan's ancestor's body twisted, his Ultimate Principle twisting into a knot.</p><p></p><p>The conversation between Qi Yuan and Zi Yuan Xiaolu involved him, so naturally it couldn't escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>"You... brain!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking!"</p><p></p><p>He was already quite old, having lived for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly have a father or ancestor left outside?</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he thought of something, and his gaze became doubtful again.</p><p></p><p>"He couldn't really be my little ancestor, could he?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

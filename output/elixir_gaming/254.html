            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan say this, the Great Sun Flame Emperor breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, Jasmine Venerable's strength is very powerful. Moreover, due to her father, she has a deep reputation in the Three Realms. Even some old seniors have to give her face. Don't offend her lightly."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor's eyes were complex when mentioning Jasmine Venerable. </p><p></p><p>He was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>In the Three Realms, Jasmine Venerable's strength may not be the strongest.</p><p></p><p>But she is definitely the one who cannot be provoked.</p><p></p><p>Because of the Mythical Treasury, Jasmine Venerable has many admirers.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, when did you hook up with Jasmine Venerable?" the Rogue Immortal Venerable couldn't help but ask beside him.</p><p></p><p>After all, when it came to gossip about the private lives of Yin Gods, this little newbie was especially interested.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know her," Qi Yuan answered frankly.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't know Jasmine Venerable.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't very interested in Jasmine Venerable's Mythical Treasury, he was interested in the techniques within it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Sun Flame Emperor frowned: "Then why would she say such things..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Origin Venerable is too good-looking. If I were a woman, I would fall for Origin Venerable too!" said the Rogue Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Stay away from me!" Qi Yuan glared angrily at the Rogue Immortal Venerable. A gay man was actually beside him.</p><p></p><p>Everyone laughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, "Regarding Jasmine Venerable's matter, I can ask my junior sister for advice. She's also a rich woman, and can probably give me a lot of help."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he took out a jade slip and sent a message to his junior sister Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, I recently encountered a rich woman.</p><p></p><p>I haven't seen her, and she hasn't seen me.</p><p></p><p>But she publicly said she likes me.</p><p></p><p>I really want the things she has.</p><p></p><p>What do you think I should do to trick her into giving me her things?"</p><p></p><p>This rich junior sister had given him a lot of family wealth.</p><p></p><p>She even secretly gave him Jiang Ya's techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's early success was inseparable from the financial support of his rich junior sister.</p><p></p><p>Since his junior sister was so good at showering him with gold coins, he thought to ask her how to get another rich woman to shower him with gold coins.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on Seven-Colored Peak, Jiang Lingsu widened her eyes, looking especially cute.</p><p></p><p>She frowned and said fiercely: "Didn't you say you were meeting some friends from the Divine Flower Society? How come there's another rich woman now?"</p><p></p><p>"What bullshit rich woman, saying she likes my senior brother without even meeting him. She must be a slutty bitch with ulterior motives!"</p><p></p><p>She looked at the message sent by her senior brother, pondering how to answer.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, didn't she say she likes you?</p><p></p><p>You should go directly and ask her, if she likes you, she should give you her things.</p><p></p><p>If she gives them to you, you'll get what you want.</p><p></p><p>If she doesn't give them, it proves she's just playing with you!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan saw the message sent by Jiang Lingsu, and couldn't help but smile: "Junior Sister has big breasts and brains, her wisdom is no less than Great Wisdom True Lord."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really felt that what his junior sister said made sense.</p><p></p><p>He would find time to meet Jasmine Venerable directly.</p><p></p><p>You say you love me, right? If you love me, how can you not be willing to give me even the Mythical Treasury? What kind of love is that?</p><p></p><p>As long as Jasmine Venerable notes that it's a gift when giving him the Mythical Treasury, even if it goes to court, Qi Yuan won't have to return it.</p><p></p><p>This is really a good idea, simpler and more brutal than getting married.</p><p></p><p>The other three emperors looked at each other, not knowing the content of Jiang Lingsu's message to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I already have a complete solution for Jasmine Venerable's matter. Now let's discuss how to get the techniques from the Dao-Seeking Palace!" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang.</p><p></p><p>With four people here, they must be able to come up with a very good plan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Immortal-Gazing Tower, an old man with white hair appeared, his eyes suppressing anger.</p><p></p><p>"Is Wind Xie in this tower?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man was Elder Xiang Yun.</p><p></p><p>His relationship with the Great Sun Flame Emperor had always been bad, and they could even be considered mortal enemies.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his fear of Lord Wind, or rather, uncertainty about Jasmine Venerable's attitude, he would have dismembered the Great Sun Flame Emperor long ago.</p><p></p><p>Last time, when he came out of seclusion, he immediately received messages from many friends.</p><p></p><p>Those friends all asked him how, after 300 years of seclusion, he had an 18-year-old son? At that time, he was extremely angry, thinking his concubine had cuckolded him.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he found out it was completely a rumor.</p><p></p><p>The source of the rumor was Wind Xie, which was a post made by the Great Sun Flame Emperor in the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>"Shocking! After 300 years of seclusion, Elder Xiang Yun has an 18-year-old young son!"</p><p></p><p>Although it was a rumor, many cultivators believed it to be true.</p><p></p><p>They even thought he had killed that "young son" to save face.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Great Sun Flame Emperor, he truly had killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, since then, the Great Sun Flame Emperor had been in seclusion and not coming out, under Lord Wind's protection.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiang Yun had never found a chance for revenge.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Great Sun Flame Emperor had come out of seclusion and invited friends to gather.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was his best opportunity for revenge.</p><p></p><p>"He's in room 12 on the ninth floor of Heaven," the second shopkeeper said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From Elder Xiangyun's tone, he knew it was nothing good.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, go and drive him out, give me his room. Isn't he entertaining guests? Let him lose face in front of his friends!" Elder Xiangyun said viciously.</p><p></p><p>The attitude from above was unclear. He didn't dare kill Feng Xie now, but humiliating him should be fine.</p><p></p><p>"This... doesn't seem right. And among them, there seems to be a Purple Palace cultivator of unknown background. If we offend them..." the second manager hesitated. </p><p></p><p>He didn't want to do too much of this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>"In the Phoenix Sky Domain, is there anyone the Phoenix Palace can't afford to offend?" Elder Xiangyun said tyrannically.</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Palace was the number one power in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>The master of this power was Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Palace was founded by Great Venerable Jasmine's father, that legendary figure.</p><p></p><p>It had a history of several hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Phoenix Palace was the undisputed hegemon of the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>Even legendary powerhouses would give face to the old palace master and Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xiangyun's father was a Yin God of the Phoenix Palace, so naturally he was arrogant and domineering.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, suppressing the Great Sun Flame Emperor was politically correct within the Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>Because... there were rumors that Lord Feng was the illegitimate son of the old palace master of the Phoenix Palace, that legendary figure, and thus the younger brother of Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>But Great Venerable Jasmine didn't seem to like that younger brother.</p><p></p><p>So on the surface, Elder Xiangyun was suppressing the Great Sun Flame Emperor for personal revenge, but in reality... he was acting on behalf of those above to make life unpleasant for the Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the second manager could only say helplessly: "Everything as you wish."</p><p></p><p>With the Phoenix Palace invoked, how could he refuse?</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what are the backgrounds of the other three?" Elder Xiangyun asked.</p><p></p><p>"Those three are not from the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>One is a Purple Palace cultivator, judging by his attire, he should have an illustrious background.</p><p></p><p>One seems to be someone from the Eastern Earth Minor Prodigy Ranking, named Gao Xiaoyu, from a Purple Palace power.</p><p></p><p>As for one... unknown, but the magical robes on his body are not even as good as Gao Xiaoyu's, at most also from a Purple Palace power."</p><p></p><p>The second manager was well-informed.</p><p></p><p>He had memorized the names and appearances of the young prodigies on the Eastern Earth Prodigy Ranking, Demon Prodigy Ranking, and Phoenix Sky Prodigy Ranking, so he recognized the Rogue Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Earth Minor Prodigy Ranking?" Elder Xiangyun was stunned, "So trash?"</p><p></p><p>For the Eastern Earth Prodigy Ranking, he would only pay attention to the top twenty, the rest he wouldn't even bother with.</p><p></p><p>As for the Minor Prodigy Ranking, that was trash among trash.</p><p></p><p>"Since those two people are so useless... let's kill the chicken to scare the monkey!" A cold light flashed in Elder Xiangyun's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't kill the Great Sun Flame Emperor, but dealing with two nobodies was no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Phoenix Palace found out about this, the higher-ups would only approve of him.</p><p></p><p>After all, making life difficult for Lord Feng and the Great Sun Flame Emperor was the consensus of those above in the Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>The second manager hesitated upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He understood Elder Xiangyun's meaning.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Domineering Woman was suspected to have a Yin God behind her, so she couldn't be offended too much.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Sun Flame Emperor couldn't be killed.</p><p></p><p>Just driving the Great Sun Flame Emperor out of the Wangxian Tower wasn't enough to humiliate him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Gao Xiaoyu, who had no power or background, were the best targets.</p><p></p><p>They could be framed with some crimes, then driven out of Wangxian Tower and beaten to death by the guards.</p><p></p><p>This way, it would serve to humiliate the Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Work for me, and there will be benefits for you.</p><p></p><p>Didn't you have your eye on Yang Li's granddaughter? If you do this well for me today, I'll send Yang Li's granddaughter to your bed!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a greedy look appeared in the second manager's eyes, and he couldn't help but swallow: "This matter... I'll do it!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder Xiangyun laughed heartily: "Feng Xie... offending me was the stupidest thing you've ever done in your life!"</p><p></p><p>After all, he was acting on the wishes of those above in the Phoenix Palace to teach the Great Sun Flame Emperor a lesson.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the Great Sun Flame Emperor would dare to resist, injuring him several times.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be furious? Meanwhile, in Wangxian Tower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand: "We're all brothers, your business is my business!</p><p></p><p>Back then, when I was pressured by the Palace of Light, didn't you all strongly support me and cheer me on?"</p><p></p><p>A grateful look appeared on the Great Sun Flame Emperor's face.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship on the way here, the Great Sun Flame Emperor had mentioned his predicament.</p><p></p><p>His rash emergence from seclusion might provoke retaliation from Elder Xiangyun of the Phoenix Palace.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan had said carelessly: "If he dares to come, when the grass on his grave is ten meters tall, he'll surely have one more illegitimate son."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable." The Great Sun Flame Emperor breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was just afraid that Elder Xiangyun would suddenly come looking for trouble, and then these three good friends would misunderstand that he had deliberately drawn out Elder Xiangyun to borrow Qi Yuan's strength to fight his enemy.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine as long as things are made clear, just like how I formed the Fixed Star Golden Core and condensed over four thousand divine infants, I didn't hide it from you, right?" Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Over four thousand divine infants?" The Rogue Immortal Venerable swallowed, "You have so many divine infants, how about giving me one?"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, are you planning to have children?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, the door to the private room was suddenly pushed open.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

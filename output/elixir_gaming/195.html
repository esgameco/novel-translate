        <h1>Chapter 195</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The five old dragons gathered, their words filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Has his identity still not been investigated?" The leader, wearing a golden robe, spoke with a fierce gaze.</p><p></p><p>"No," another old dragon replied, his voice rather helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Calling himself 'Dragon Subduer', how arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, our North Sea Dragon Clan has suffered such a great blow, it's truly frustrating!"</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Golden Flood Dragon and those six flood dragons were already the most capable core strength of the North Sea Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Dragon Lord present who had taken three steps to heaven, the rest of the old dragons had only taken one step to heaven, and they were the kind without potential.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Lord in his golden robe glared angrily: "Breaking the backbone of our dragon clan, even if his father is a Great Venerable, this matter cannot be left unsettled!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this matter cannot be left unsettled." Just then, a calm voice came. A spatial ripple appeared, and a group of ancient gods appeared in the palace. Qi Yuan looked at the five old dragons with a smile in his eyes, "You haven't compensated yet."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Dragon Lord's pupils suddenly contracted: "You... Qionghua Great Venerable, how are you awake?!"</p><p></p><p>He instantly understood that it was Qionghua Great Venerable who had brought this group to his palace.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, never expecting Qionghua Great Venerable to awaken.</p><p></p><p>"Whether she wakes up or not is none of your business. I'm here now to demand compensation from you. That so-called Golden Flood Dragon offended me. Today, if you don't bring out some treasures, my anger won't subside." Qi Yuan spoke lazily, like a spoiled rich kid.</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable is speaking with Qionghua Great Venerable. Who are you to interrupt?" The Dragon Lord couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Verbal offense against a Heavenly Venerable deserves execution." Qionghua Great Venerable acted instantly, opening her divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Within the divine realm, even the Dragon Lord who had taken three steps to heaven was like a mortal.</p><p></p><p>Qionghua Great Venerable gently pushed with her delicate hand, and a palm made of divine power fell on the Dragon Lord's body.</p><p></p><p>There was no sound.</p><p></p><p>Blood spewed from the Dragon Lord's mouth as one of the divine apertures in his body exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Destroying one of your divine apertures as a lesson," Qionghua Great Venerable said, withdrawing her divine realm. She then stood quietly beside Qi Yuan like a loyal servant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Qionghua Great Venerable approvingly, then glanced at the Dragon Lord: "You have no sense at all. Didn't you see that the four old dragons beside you didn't dare to speak when they saw me?"</p><p></p><p>With one of his divine apertures destroyed, the Dragon Lord's aura collapsed. He looked at Qi Yuan, not daring to speak anymore.</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Why was Qionghua Great Venerable treating Qi Yuan like this?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan was Qionghua Great Venerable's son? But seeing how respectful Qionghua Great Venerable was to Qi Yuan, it couldn't be explained by him being her son.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the five old dragons: "You've offended me. Tell me, open your treasure vault. I'll choose some items, and this matter will be considered settled."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Lord lay on the ground, not daring to speak at all.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the five old dragons were quickly communicating in secret, seeking a way to resolve the situation.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, an old dragon stepped forward with an extremely low posture: "Heavenly Venerable, Golden Flood Dragon brought this upon himself. Offending the Heavenly Venerable and being killed by the Venerable's people, he got what he deserved."</p><p></p><p>The wise adapt to circumstances. At this point, how could these old dragons dare to mention revenge?</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way to the treasure vault," Qi Yuan wasn't interested in those grudges and resentments. Now he just wanted to get supreme treasures. "If the supreme treasures can't satisfy me, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chuckled, but it made the five old dragons' hearts tighten, feeling the crisis of death.</p><p></p><p>The old dragon in the green robe hunched over, no longer showing the dragon clan's domineering attitude: "Heavenly Venerable, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Dragon Lord lying on the ground like a dead fish: "Actually, I preferred your previously arrogant appearance."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Dragon Lord's blood surged to his head, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, seemingly fainting from anger.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the treasure vault," Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The group looked at the old dragon in the green robe and headed towards the treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qionghua Great Venerable spoke: "This Dragon Lord might harbor resentment. Should I find a time to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>She said these words not through telepathy, but openly in front of the old dragon in the green robe.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old dragon's dragon body trembled.</p><p></p><p>"If he's not obedient, you can kill him as you see fit," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"As you command," Qionghua Great Venerable said, feeling relieved in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The group, under the guidance of the old dragon in the green robe, soon arrived at the North Sea Dragon Clan's treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was somewhat surprised: "Building the treasure vault inside the prison, quite creative. Aren't you afraid that the prisoners might escape with the treasures?"</p><p></p><p>The North Sea Dragon Clan's treasure vault wasn't an independent palace, but deep within the prison.</p><p></p><p>The old dragon in the green robe hurriedly explained: "I heard from other ancient gods that the Heavenly Venerable likes supreme treasures that can break through to the True God realm. Such supreme treasures are all stored in the dragon prison. In the dragon prison, there's a spring eye that can produce supreme treasures."</p><p></p><p>This spring eye was similar to the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>The supreme treasures in Qionghua Palace were mostly obtained in this way.</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone arrived at the spring eye.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over.</p><p></p><p>[North Sea Spring Eye, occasionally supreme treasures spurt out from here.]</p><p></p><p>"Only seven, that's a bit few," Qi Yuan took the seven supreme treasures, his eyes showing neither excitement nor disappointment.</p><p></p><p>He had already received twenty-five precious items before, so getting 7 more indeed couldn't move him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan seemed unsatisfied, sweat was about to form on the old dragon's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't there other treasure vaults?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The old dragon in the green robe hurriedly said, afraid that Qi Yuan would be dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Eighteen Arhats and the Four Heavenly Kings.</p><p></p><p>"You go and take a look around his treasure vaults, see if there are any suitable treasures."</p><p></p><p>"As you command!"</p><p></p><p>The Four Heavenly Kings and the Eighteen Arhats accepted the order and left under the guidance of the old dragon in the green robe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the treasures in his hand, tried them for a moment, and then showed a disappointed expression: "It still doesn't work."</p><p></p><p>That's right, even with thirty supreme treasures, he still couldn't break through the restriction to reach True God.</p><p></p><p>"Qionghua Great Venerable, do you know of any way to break through to the True God realm without using these supreme treasures?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qionghua Great Venerable was surprised in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She roughly understood that the Heavenly Venerable's talent was too terrifying, far surpassing the Wushi Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he couldn't break through to True God.</p><p></p><p>She replied without hesitation: "After the collapse of the Heavenly Pillar, in the Mortal Heart Realm, only supreme treasures can break through the restriction. To break through to True God, there are only two paths to take. One is to leave the Mortal Heart Realm, the other is to repair the Heavenly Pillar. However, both these paths... are very difficult. I once heard that outside the barrier of the Mortal Heart Realm, there's a... being above True God waiting."</p><p></p><p>"Above True God?" Qi Yuan was surprised. He looked up at the starry sky and immediately saw that blood-colored star. "If I remember correctly, there's also a being above True God in the Heavenly Pillar? Is the Mortal Heart Realm such a delicacy that so many Yang Gods are eyeing it?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter involves mysteries. Perhaps only beings at the level of Wushi Holy Mother know the reason," Qionghua Great Venerable said. Her eyes also showed endless bewilderment, as if worrying about the future of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why don't they give me a game synopsis?" Qi Yuan sighed helplessly. "Does this mean I can't break through to the True God realm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qionghua Great Venerable seemed to think of something and said thoughtfully: "I've heard of a few secrets that might be useful to the Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me."</p><p></p><p>"There's a clan called the Ancient Clan. This clan has a long heritage, existing even before the Great Flood War. In their clan, there's an ancestral ground. Once, a peerless genius accidentally entered this ancestral ground..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This peerless prodigy's talent surpassed even that of the Foodless Holy Mother, and he was unable to break through to the next realm using treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, when he emerged from the ancestral lands of the Ancient Clan, he had astonishingly entered the realm of True Divinity. Later, this person was abducted by the Evil God and became the Evil God's pawn.</p><p></p><p>Now, the ancestral lands of the Ancient Clan are all under this person's control. This person is known as the Arrogant Supreme Lord." When mentioning this person, there was anger in Supreme Lord Qionghua's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, this person had extraordinary talent, yet betrayed the Mortal Heart Realm and joined the Evil God.</p><p></p><p>"How did he break through?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Unknown," Supreme Lord Qionghua shook her head. "Even the Arrogant Supreme Lord himself doesn't know how he broke through, which is why he has surrounded three sides of the Ancient Clan's ancestral lands, constantly experimenting with ancient gods to find the reason."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll need to visit these ancestral lands of the Ancient Clan sometime," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't go now. </p><p></p><p>At present, his wings were not yet fully grown.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan walked and chatted with Supreme Lord Qionghua, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards a cage not far away, his eyes showing curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Monkeys? What a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>In the prison of the North Sea Dragon Clan, Qi Yuan saw several monkeys, which surprised him.</p><p></p><p>Two of the monkeys were ordinary, sitting in meditation or sleeping.</p><p></p><p>One was covered in chains, on its feet and head.</p><p></p><p>When it moved, the chains all over its body clanked loudly.</p><p></p><p>He curiously looked at the chained monkey.</p><p></p><p>In the prison, that monkey looked at Qi Yuan, baring its teeth.</p><p></p><p>A dragon clan member hurriedly came forward: "Supreme Lord, this monkey is from the Ancient Ape Clan. It has an unruly nature and once attacked our Dragon Clan. We captured it and confined it here."</p><p></p><p>"Let it out for a look," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>If he had encountered monkeys elsewhere, it would have been unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>But encountering them in the North Sea Dragon Clan made him think.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the dragon clan member hurriedly went to open the cage.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, three monkeys walked out of the cage. Two of them looked at Qi Yuan with wariness.</p><p></p><p>Only the one covered in chains looked at Qi Yuan without restraint.</p><p></p><p>The dragon clan member quickly said: "Supreme Lord, this monkey has extremely strong talent. It's the most talented of the younger generation of the Ancient Ape Clan. Although it's only at the late Purple Palace realm in strength, it has the potential to become a Supreme Lord."</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because this golden-haired monkey had such strong talent and was the strongest of the younger generation of the Ancient Ape Clan.</p><p></p><p>So even though it had offended the North Sea Dragon Clan, the Dragon Clan didn't kill it, but merely confined it, waiting for the Ancient Ape Clan to come ransom it.</p><p></p><p>And this golden-haired monkey, due to its strong talent, plus its originally mischievous nature, acted recklessly without fear of consequences.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired monkey looked at Qi Yuan and said casually: "Did the clan leader send you to rescue me?"</p><p></p><p>"No," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I understand," the golden-haired monkey said, then couldn't be bothered to speak further.</p><p></p><p>In its view, Qi Yuan was trying to curry favor with the Ancient Ape Clan, which is why he rescued them.</p><p></p><p>Beside it, the remaining two monkeys came forward.</p><p></p><p>"I will remember this life-saving grace!" said a thin monkey.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" the other monkey also expressed gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just felt we had a connection," Qi Yuan said. He always acted according to his whims.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired monkey impatiently said at this point: "Little Six, Little Seven, why are you wasting words? Come here!"</p><p></p><p>To the golden-haired monkey, the other two monkeys were just followers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan smiled lightly and said: "Indeed very unruly."</p><p></p><p>The accompanying dragon clan member said: "This child has extremely high talent. Once a Supreme Lord wanted to take him as a disciple, but was refused.</p><p></p><p>With such a prodigy, if properly nurtured, he will certainly become a powerful True God.</p><p></p><p>Having some pride and being a bit domineering is normal."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, not caring at all about these small matters.</p><p></p><p>The group walked towards the outside of the North Sea Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired monkey was not polite at all, looking at Qi Yuan: "I smell supreme treasures on you, give me a few?"</p><p></p><p>"I need them," Qi Yuan calmly refused.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired monkey wanted to say more, but seeing the unfathomable Supreme Lord Qionghua beside Qi Yuan, it swallowed its words.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Lord."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of people walked over.</p><p></p><p>It was the Eighteen Arhats and Four Heavenly Kings.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they were all holding treasures from the Dragon Palace, smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Four beautiful women stood at Qi Yuan's side, like attendants.</p><p></p><p>Their auras were hidden; those who weren't True Gods wouldn't discover they were True Gods.</p><p></p><p>The two monkeys looked at the treasures in the hands of these twenty people, their eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired monkey looked at the treasure in Wang Wenqi's hand, which was a blood-red spear.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you won't give me supreme treasures, but I'll take the treasure in your attendant's hand!" The golden-haired monkey looked at the long spear in Wang Wenqi's hand, its eyes filled with fervent light.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment: "What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you trying to build a relationship with my Ancient Ape Clan?</p><p></p><p>If you want to build a relationship with my Ancient Ape Clan, you need to please me.</p><p></p><p>I am the future king of the Ancient Ape Clan.</p><p></p><p>That spear, I want it!" said the golden-haired monkey.</p><p></p><p>Due to its high talent, even when it caused trouble, others generally wouldn't do much to it, only capture it and wait for the Ancient Ape Clan to ransom it.</p><p></p><p>So, the golden-haired monkey's personality became more and more domineering and unruly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that because you released me, I'll be grateful to you and see you as a benefactor.</p><p></p><p>You think I don't know what you're thinking? Even without you, with my powerful talent, the North Sea Dragon Clan wouldn't dare to really do anything to me.</p><p></p><p>Don't think you can use this favor to threaten me!" the golden-haired monkey continued.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help but say: "A monkey learning the wrong things, insisting on learning to overthink, turning itself into an internet keyboard warrior.</p><p></p><p>How strange, you clearly don't have a keyboard, yet how can you say these words? In reality, shouldn't there not be such idiots?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan letting this monkey out was naturally not because he saw potential in its talent, or to build a relationship with the Ancient Ape Clan.</p><p></p><p>It was simply because he encountered monkeys in the Dragon Clan and felt it was a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Was talent important to him? Just the talent of the Dragon-Subduing Arhat and Tiger-Taming Arhat surpassed that of the number one person in this world, the Foodless Holy Mother.</p><p></p><p>But this monkey jumped up and down, being very irritating.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired monkey was a bit surprised, not expecting Qi Yuan to answer like this: "You released me from the North Sea Dragon Clan, but don't think you can use this to build a relationship with my Ancient Ape Clan. I will personally..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to build a relationship with the Ancient Ape Clan, I even want to offend them," Qi Yuan spoke, interrupting the golden-haired monkey's words. "A good monkey not being content with that, insisting on imitating the Tang Monk from 'A Chinese Odyssey', talking non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Not as good-looking as Sun Wukong, but with quite the temper.</p><p></p><p>Am I your father? Why should I indulge you?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan finished speaking, he immediately drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red long sword left its sheath, with lightning speed, directly killing this golden-haired monkey with one strike.</p><p></p><p>After killing it, Qi Yuan felt refreshed. He pointed his sword at the corpse on the ground: "I've been annoyed by you for a long time. Say one more word?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that golden-haired monkey was already dead and couldn't answer him.</p><p></p><p>Its proud talent and reliance were nothing before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The nearby dragon clan members saw this scene and broke out in cold sweat on their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>Hadn't they just met less than a quarter of an hour ago? How had he been annoyed by it for a long time?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

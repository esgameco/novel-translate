        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white looked at the young girl in front of her, with a helpless expression in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"High Priestess, do you really want to go with him... to the Azure Waves Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"You're going to the Upper Realm alone, I have to stay here." Qi Jianjun's face bore a sweet smile. </p><p></p><p>This was different from the High Priestess the woman in white had seen before.</p><p></p><p>All of this was because of that man.</p><p></p><p>"High Priestess, do you think his... current state is a side effect of swallowing this realm's Heavenly Dao?" the woman in white asked.</p><p></p><p>She was actually reminding Qi Jianjun to be careful.</p><p></p><p>After all, a deranged person might hurt others at any time.</p><p></p><p>"In such a dreamlike world, isn't it nice to be a crazy person?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun answered irrelevantly.</p><p></p><p>The woman in white fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun continued: "Alright, the transmission formation has been activated. You should go to the Upper Realm now. </p><p></p><p>If you can reach the Moon God Palace, tell Mother that I've found Father."</p><p></p><p>The transmission formation for ascending to the Upper Realm was random, and one couldn't be certain which area it would transport to.</p><p></p><p>It might take the woman in white hundreds or thousands of years to find the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess glanced at the woman in white, then walked outside.</p><p></p><p>When she saw that figure in blood-red robes, her eyes lit up with an excited smile.</p><p></p><p>"Father, are we going to... the Azure Waves Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, he had planned to visit the world of the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the gate had already closed.</p><p></p><p>He threw a punch from afar at the Moluo Realm, but nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>Later, in one day, he traveled all over the Wangyue Continent, wanting to find traces of the past.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, whether it was Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, Yiguan Forbidden Land, Five Elements Forbidden Land, Yin-Yang Forbidden Land or Tianjue, they were all empty.</p><p></p><p>He didn't see any of his old acquaintances, nor did he see any familiar traces.</p><p></p><p>Without the power of reincarnation, without becoming a Yin Spirit, there was almost no possibility of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Death meant complete annihilation, dissolving into the world.</p><p></p><p>No one in the world remembered them anymore.</p><p></p><p>Except for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan could only prepare to return, back to the Azure Waves Realm, and also back to Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before going back, he wanted to visit the Ascending Heaven Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya still owed him quite a few cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone's here, let's go." Qi Yuan looked up and gazed deeply at the ancient Qichun tree.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant tree was covered in silver, piled with snowflakes, a beautiful sight.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, time to return." Qi Yuan glanced at Great Wisdom True Lord, Xu Tongchen and Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Four people came, five were returning, with the addition of a child.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it's time to leave." Great Wisdom True Lord sighed, "Am I leaving this world, or is the world leaving me."</p><p></p><p>The group of five instantly arrived at the desert from before, and quickly entered the world passage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also felt that the terrifying power he wielded over the Wangyue Continent was slowly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>However, he remained calm and unhurried.</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into the Azure Waves Realm again, Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few people, could they be Ye Qiong's helpers?" Qi Yuan held Qi Jianjun's hand, sensing four terrifying presences.</p><p></p><p>These four terrifying presences were all Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Elder Blood Robe Sword Immortal!" Cloud Gathering Venerable spoke.</p><p></p><p>The others also bowed in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, we are not acquainted with Venerable Ye Qiong."</p><p></p><p>"This junior Leichen pays respects to Elder."</p><p></p><p>The four Yin Spirits present all looked at Qi Yuan with respect.</p><p></p><p>The lofty Yin Spirits faced Qi Yuan as if they were Purple Mansion cultivators facing Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Many people also noticed the young girl Qi Yuan was holding hands with, their eyes filled with strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Are you all Yin Spirits from the Eastern Lands?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that there were three publicly known Yin Spirits in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"No, this junior has come to apologize." The elderly Tiger Roar Venerable was like a child before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Tiger Roar Venerable, who hurriedly explained the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Tiger Roar Venerable added: "I knew nothing of Venerable Ye Qiong's schemes."</p><p></p><p>"Those who don't know are not guilty." Qi Yuan's eyes held a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, strength was everything.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Palace of Light initiated the Hundred Nations Blood War, wanting to incite war in the Hundred Nations, not a single Yin Spirit was willing to speak up for the Hundred Nations.</p><p></p><p>Now, just because Ling Jiao had spoken a few harsh words to him, Cloud Gathering Venerable had stopped the Water Cloud Palace from sending troops.</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan could even express an opinion, the master of Water Cloud Palace had been restrained and brought here, to be dealt with as he saw fit.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Tiger Roar Venerable breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was truly afraid of the Blood Robe Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Through the descriptions of Gu Xiaoyao and other Divine Infants, they had confirmed that the Blood Robe Sword Immortal had swallowed the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>And to swallow the Heavenly Dao, one needed at least Great Venerable level strength.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Blood Robe Sword Immortal was at least a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The power he possessed in the Wangyue Continent was even higher than that of an ordinary Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"You've come to find me, not just to welcome me back, right?" Qi Yuan looked at these four Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he had a feeling similar to when those Purple Mansion cultivators sought him out after he destroyed the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Gathering Venerable stepped forward and said: "Regarding Elder's affairs, we have already sealed off the information. Currently, besides us four, only Ice Soul Venerable knows."</p><p></p><p>"I've noted your and Ice Soul's kindness." Qi Yuan said, as Tiger Roar Venerable had just explained the circumstances, informing him of Cloud Gathering Venerable's assistance to the Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Gathering Venerable's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sighed inwardly that sometimes it was better to be a bit timid.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he had gone with Venerable Ye Qiong and Venerable You Qing to deal with the Blood Robe Sword Immortal this time, it would have been like sheep entering a tiger's den.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, we have come with a request," Cloud Gathering Venerable spoke up at this time.</p><p></p><p>Because the other Yin Spirits present were all looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Qi Yuan knew there were no free lunches in this world.</p><p></p><p>"When the great calamity approaches, we hope Elder will open the way for us to enter the Wangyue Continent for shelter!" Cloud Gathering Venerable looked at him expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Even a Great Venerable would be powerless against the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary Wangyue Continent, entering it would not protect them from the calamity.</p><p></p><p>But if it were a Great Venerable who had swallowed the Heavenly Dao, that would be different.</p><p></p><p>If they took shelter there, there was a high chance of avoiding the calamity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these Yin Spirits: "If you want my help, it's simple. I need cultivation techniques, the more the better!"</p><p></p><p>After all, there were still hundreds of years until the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>It was still early.</p><p></p><p>Getting the benefits in hand first was the most real.</p><p></p><p>"Does Elder have any other conditions?" Leichen Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>Because what the Blood Robe Sword Immortal said was really too simple.</p><p></p><p>"That's all for now, I'll think about others later," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The other Yin Spirits were all somewhat apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>They very much wanted to tell Qi Yuan, why don't you make more demands?</p><p></p><p>With too few demands, they couldn't feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Flower Society forum.</p><p></p><p>Little Li from Fox Den was engaged in a war of words.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Blood Robe Sword Immortal is a righteous person. He opposed the Palace of Light to stop the Hundred Nations Blood War, for the greater good."</p><p></p><p>"What bullshit greater good, cultivators like that only care about benefits. Arrogant and domineering cultivators like Blood Robe Sword Immortal deserve to be killed by Venerable Ye Qiong. </p><p></p><p>I bet those Yin Spirits gathering at the Blood Robe Alliance are there to divide up Blood Robe Sword Immortal's treasures.</p><p></p><p>You can see how many ordinary cultivators Blood Robe Sword Immortal must have killed to obtain those treasures."</p><p></p><p>"You're slandering him!" Seeing these comments, Little Li from Fox Den was furious and quickly recorded them with her image stone.</p><p></p><p>"If Blood Robe Sword Immortal thinks I'm slandering him, he's welcome to come confront me.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't dare answer me, isn't that admitting it?</p><p></p><p>No, actually he's just not capable. He's probably long dead."</p><p></p><p>"You!" Seeing this, Little Li from Fox Den was enraged.</p><p></p><p>She could only record these posts.</p><p></p><p>After arguing for too long, she felt mentally exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to exit the forum, a post suddenly caught her eye.</p><p></p><p>Her pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>《Thank you all for your concern. I, Blood Robe Sword Immortal, was indeed ambushed by Yin Spirits, but unfortunately they were too weak.》</p><p></p><p>"After entering the Wangyue Continent, one day I heard people talking bad about me behind my back.</p><p></p><p>I looked and saw it was Ye Qiong and You Qing.</p><p></p><p>They were badmouthing me together with people from the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>I couldn't stand it and executed them on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Blood Robe Sword Immortal is indeed still alive!" Little Li from Fox Den was excited.</p><p></p><p>She quickly replied: "I knew the big shot would survive. Big shot, you're awesome! Can I have a friend spot?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure, I'll add you." At this moment, Blood Robe Sword Immortal replied to her.</p><p></p><p>Little Li in the Fox Den widened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The big shot actually added me as a friend!" She was elated and overjoyed in her heart. She wanted to tell the elders of her clan about this.</p><p></p><p>But on second thought, she decided against it.</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, after you left, many people in the Divine Flower Society were slandering you behind your back!" After adding him as a friend, Little Li from Fox Den quickly recounted what had happened on the Divine Flower Society forum.</p><p></p><p>"What? People are badmouthing me behind my back!" Qi Yuan took a look and immediately became agitated. "The internet is not lawless. These people must pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even cursed anyone online yet, and someone was already cursing him.</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, I've recorded it all. Do you want me to send it to you?" Little Li from Fox Den sent the message, then worried, "How should I send the image stone to the big shot?"</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dan, where are you now? Give me a specific location, and I'll have my daughter create an avatar to meet you!" Qi Yuan was not currently a Yin Spirit, so he couldn't use spiritual power to instantly create an avatar and traverse tens of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>"The boss's daughter?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Little Li in Fox Den felt extremely nervous. </p><p></p><p>The boss's daughter... was coming to see her.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly sent the address to Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"In about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, my daughter will arrive. Just show her the memory stone."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Little Li of Fox Den felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't expected to meet the boss's daughter without meeting the boss himself.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly she thought of something, and her face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, Fox Den is a forbidden area, outsiders aren't allowed in.</p><p></p><p>If Grandmother finds out someone else came to see me, she'll definitely scold me."</p><p></p><p>Little Li of Fox Den was on pins and needles.</p><p></p><p>She was considering whether to tell Grandmother that a friend was coming to see her.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, in the forbidden area of Fox Den.</p><p></p><p>A sharp aura spread.</p><p></p><p>An elderly figure flew out, her voice full of wariness: "Which esteemed expert has come to our Four Elements Fox Den? Please show yourself."</p><p></p><p>Fox Den's Grandmother was a Purple Palace powerhouse. Just as she was cultivating, she suddenly sensed a powerful aura approaching.</p><p></p><p>Definitely stronger than her.</p><p></p><p>She felt worried, afraid it was an enemy attacking.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, that sharp aura became even more terrifying. </p><p></p><p>Fox Den Grandmother's expression changed drastically: "...Yin...Yin Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>Such fluctuations were clearly those of a Yin Spirit without doubt.</p><p></p><p>How could a Venerable One come to her humble Fox Den? She felt terrified, fearing she would be destroyed with one palm by a passing Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In front of Fox Den Grandmother, a petite figure appeared, which was an illusory image.</p><p></p><p>However, Fox Den Grandmother knew that even just this illusory image could destroy Fox Den.</p><p></p><p>Facing a Venerable, she was on edge, extremely afraid.</p><p></p><p>The petite and adorable little girl revealed a bright smile: "Don't be afraid, I'm here on my father's orders to get something from Little Li of Fox Den."</p><p></p><p>The petite and adorable little girl was Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>Under Grandmother's confused and bewildered gaze, she entered the Fox Den where Little Li was.</p><p></p><p>Grandmother's expression was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Since when did Little Li know a Yin Spirit?</p><p></p><p>No, she knew the father of a Yin Spirit!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Little Li of Fox Den couldn't help but tremble, also extremely fearful when facing a Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Ven...Venerable, this is the memory stone." Little Li quickly showed the memory stone to Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun looked at the contents of the memory stone, and the smile on her face froze: "Well well, they dare to badmouth my father behind his back, they're finished!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Little Li dare to speak boldly: "These people are really too much. After Blood Robe Sword God posted on the Divine Flower Society forum, some people even said privately that how could the Venerable Blood Robe Sword God, as a mighty Yin Spirit, bully the weak and care about such trivial matters?"</p><p></p><p>"Why not bully the weak?" Qi Jianjun said, "Should we fight the strong instead?</p><p></p><p>Daring to badmouth my father, and they call this trivial? They're finished."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun memorized all the contents.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Little Li of Fox Den bid farewell. Before leaving, she glanced at Grandmother.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li is my father's friend."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Jianjun's avatar also dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The shock in Grandmother's heart took a long time to subside.</p><p></p><p>She entered Little Li's den, speaking much more gently than before, her face full of a kind smile: "Little Li, how did you get to know that Yin Spirit Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>This was something Little Li had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, I met him in the Divine Flower Society..." Little Li honestly recounted how she met Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Grandmother's smile grew even wider: "Little Li, you've done well."</p><p></p><p>Grandmother seemed to think of something and continued: "I remember you've always wanted to get Nine-Tailed Fruit, but didn't have enough contribution points. </p><p></p><p>As it happens, Grandmother has eight extra ones with no use, so I'll give them to you."</p><p></p><p>Grandmother gave eight Nine-Tailed Fruits to Little Li.</p><p></p><p>Little Li looked at the Nine-Tailed Fruits, her face showing a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>This delight was like a cat seeing catnip.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grandmother!" How could she not be happy to suddenly receive eight of the precious Nine-Tailed Fruits that would normally take at least a hundred years to obtain one?...</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sneered: "They dare to badmouth me behind my back and even morally bind me, they're really asking for death!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya stood to the side without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Because she didn't take this seriously.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Great Wisdom True Lord spoke up, his expression solemn: "I think now, the Blood Robe Alliance should begin its first expedition, to nip this trend of badmouthing people behind their backs in the bud!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, I'm not being selfish and vindictive, I'm rectifying the atmosphere of the cultivation world!" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, once again elevating his realm, "The cultivation world is in chaos, and the atmosphere should start changing from me!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Jianjun appeared: "Father, I've already obtained their general information from the vice president of the Divine Flower Society."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun held out her small hand, looking quite proud.</p><p></p><p>The three people in the room immediately discussed how to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya in the room watched the three discussing how to rectify the atmosphere of the cultivation world, feeling quite out of place.</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat puzzled... You're a great Venerable, why care about these... trivial matters?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Eastern Lands, Water Immortal Continent.</p><p></p><p>Liqi City was a rather remote cultivation city.</p><p></p><p>The strongest cultivation sect nearby was only at the late Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wang Shenghai was seeking pleasure in Red Lip House, but his brows were furrowed, unable to relax.</p><p></p><p>A group of cultivators were also drinking and making merry.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, why so gloomy?" a Yuan Dan cultivator asked, feeling curious.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, didn't I join that Divine Flower Society? Originally, I thought Venerable Yiqiong would successfully kill that great demon Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that useless Venerable Yiqiong would be killed by Blood Robe Sword God instead, what a waste!"  Wang Shenghai spoke crudely.</p><p></p><p>He held forth to the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>He often talked about big events he saw in the Divine Flower Society, which earned him a lot of flattery.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yuan Dan cultivator felt some contempt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This Wang Shenghai does these things himself every day, yet he has the nerve to call others, even a Yin Spirit Venerable, a great demon?"Brother Wang, you should be more careful. If that Yin Spirit Venerable hears about this, he might come looking for trouble." The Yuan Dan cultivator advised.</p><p></p><p>"In this godforsaken place of ours, even a Divine Embryo cultivator coming would be talked about for years. How could a Yin Spirit Venerable possibly come?" Wang Shenghai was all talk, not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could such a big shot have the free time to pay attention to a small fry like him?</p><p></p><p>It's like, would an ordinary person go next door to swat a flying mosquito?</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, suddenly, a desolate sound of suona horns rang out.</p><p></p><p>The few Yuan Dan cultivators in Red Lip House were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Because in front of them, over a dozen cultivators wearing blood-colored robes and playing suona horns suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The aura of each cultivator was unfathomable, they couldn't discern their cultivation level at all.</p><p></p><p>At least Divine Embryo stage!</p><p></p><p>At this time, a man in blood robes appeared, looking at Wang Shenghai with a smug expression in his eyes: "So it was you badmouthing me behind my back?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shenghai was dumbfounded, instantly sobering up: "Venerable... is?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't recognize the person before him, but their cultivation was definitely very high.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you the one who said on the Divine Flower Society forum that I should be cut into pieces by Venerable Yiqiong, that if I died, the skies of the Eastern Lands would brighten?" Qi Yuan looked at Wang Shenghai, smiling brightly.</p><p></p><p>"You... you're Blood Robe Sword God!" Wang Shenghai looked at Qi Yuan in his blood robes, and at the people playing suona horns behind him.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized, with this setup, wasn't this Blood Robe Sword God?</p><p></p><p>He, a mighty Yin Spirit Venerable, was not fighting fair!</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators present also had shocked and dumbfounded expressions.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirit... this was actually a Yin Spirit bigshot! Such a bigshot, coming to their small place!</p><p></p><p>It was like a billionaire coming to study at an ordinary vocational college.</p><p></p><p>"Correct answer, I'll reward you with an extra bullet." Qi Yuan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun then took out a jade slip and read coldly: "Wang Shenghai, seventy years ago, in order to obtain a first-grade Foundation Establishment spiritual item, plotted to kill his junior brother Li Xiangyang's entire family; twenty years ago, forcibly abducted women...</p><p></p><p>Six days ago, spouted nonsense on the Divine Flower Society forum, slandering Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>His crimes are heinous, punishable by multiple offenses, to be executed by... firing squad."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, making a gun-firing gesture: "Don't badmouth people behind their backs in the future.</p><p></p><p>Also, after you die, you'll become the biggest celebrity in this city, no need to thank me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fired.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Wang Shenghai died instantly.</p><p></p><p>Until death, he never imagined he would die at the hands of a legendary Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present felt both terrified and shocked.</p><p></p><p>A Yin Spirit had actually come to Liqi City.</p><p></p><p>This Wang Shenghai would definitely become the biggest celebrity in Liqi City from now on.</p><p></p><p>After all, a Yin Spirit Venerable brought a group of subordinates, traveled tens of thousands of miles, to personally execute a mere Yuan Dan cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over everyone present and said softly: "Rectifying the atmosphere of the cultivation world starts with me.</p><p></p><p>As for you all, do not commit evil, no matter how small."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan left directly with this group of Purple Palace musicians.</p><p></p><p>Only those cultivators who could remain dazed for a day were left in Red Lip House.</p><p></p><p>What happened today was too outrageous!</p><p></p><p>PS: Sorry for the late update.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

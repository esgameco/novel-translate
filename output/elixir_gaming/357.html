        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's modern way of speaking made Wang Yuanyu's head spin, as she couldn't understand it at all.</p><p></p><p>However, she had learned from Wang Niang that these bloodline holders came from the Land of Endings, and were people on the verge of death, so it was normal for them to use some strange language.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a meme," Qi Yuan explained briefly. "Jie mei means sisters, and nei da means..."</p><p></p><p>After listening, Wang Yuanyu's face turned red under her black veil: "How vulgar! Who's your sister!"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you're catching on to memes now," Qi Yuan smiled, then continued, "Since this world is illusory, and I'm also illusory in your eyes, what's wrong with looking at undergarments? I don't really exist anyway."</p><p></p><p>"No way!" Wang Yuanyu said forcefully. But suddenly, she seemed to realize something, and her expression froze as if she had suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>There is no clear boundary between illusion and reality. </p><p></p><p>Or rather, does true and false even matter?</p><p></p><p>What's important is one's own heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wang Yuanyu like this, Qi Yuan seemed to recall something: "Your current state reminds me of a famous saying - I think, therefore I am.</p><p></p><p>Even if I'm illusory in your eyes, I believe I'm real, so... I am real."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu looked at Qi Yuan, and much of her previous melancholy dissipated.</p><p></p><p>At first, when she heard Wang Niang say that the Scroll of Mountains and Seas was illusory, created by the Eastern Lord, she felt quite dazed.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean her entire life's experiences were just a dream?</p><p></p><p>But now, hearing Qi Yuan speak this way, she understood many things.</p><p></p><p>If she truly believed everything was illusory, she could disregard Qi Yuan's words and calmly reveal her undergarments.</p><p></p><p>Since she cared, what difference was there between the other party being illusory or real?</p><p></p><p>"True or false doesn't matter, what matters is me," Wang Yuanyu couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded. He looked at Wang Yuanyu and said softly: "You asked me a question earlier, now... isn't it my turn to ask you a question?"</p><p></p><p>"Please ask, sir!"</p><p></p><p>"This world... how does one go to other worlds? We've been waiting for Ma Longhun, but he still hasn't shown up. He didn't go to another world, did he?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>When he first arrived in this world, he had sent people to look for Ma Longhun while he focused on improving his own strength.</p><p></p><p>But Ma Longhun had been missing from the start.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu hesitated, then said: "That's possible. Don't worry sir, Ma Longhun will definitely appear within a year."</p><p></p><p>According to the original trajectory, within half a year, she would fall in love with Tu Kongming.</p><p></p><p>Ma Longhun would also appear and kill her and Tu Kongming.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? A year isn't that long," Qi Yuan glanced at Wang Yuanyu and brought up an old topic, "Are you interested in me giving you a grandmother?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu smiled: "Thank you for your kindness, but no need."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many thoughts ran through Wang Yuanyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Ma Longhun was very powerful. According to Wang Niang, when he appeared, he would be at the peak of the Martial King realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, the peak of Martial King was already the ultimate, the strongest level.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert probably couldn't even be matched by the head of the Demon Suppression Court.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan would likely face danger because of his mission to find Ma Longhun.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't let Qi Yuan be endangered because of her.</p><p></p><p>So she thought that once she got news of Ma Longhun, she would leave this place to prevent Qi Yuan from encountering danger.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with Ma Longhun, she would bring his head to Qi Yuan to help him complete his mission.</p><p></p><p>Then she would return to the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, looks like we're not fated to be together," Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He didn't insist. Or rather, except for things he particularly cared about, he let everything else happen naturally.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu smiled without saying more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly. The monotonous life of guarding the cemetery didn't leave much of an impression on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Late at night, the cemetery was pitch black, looking especially eerie.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand, slaying a demon that had mistakenly wandered in.</p><p></p><p>Thirty drops of demon blood were credited to his account.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a demon raised by the Holy Principle Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually glanced at the corpse without paying it further attention.</p><p></p><p>"You consumed 100 drops of demon blood to open a divine aperture. Opening failed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned, looking pained.</p><p></p><p>"This demon blood is too useless, it can't even open a divine aperture. I can only pursue the martial path."</p><p></p><p>He tried using the demon blood to improve his immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious - it failed.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to curse at the demon who provided the blood: your blood is too useless, its function is too limited, it can only improve martial arts cultivation and not immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Ning Tao's help, plus the rapid awakening of the divine infant in his body feeding back power to him, Qi Yuan's immortal cultivation was progressing by leaps and bounds. He had already reached the second step of Treading the Heavens, becoming an Yin Spirit Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was mostly due to the feedback from the divine infant in his body.</p><p></p><p>Especially the divine infant that had entered the Origin Land and borrowed the corpse of a fallen Martial Sovereign was awakening at an astonishing speed.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, those Martial Sovereigns had some foundation, being stronger than the people on Arching Star. Secondly, the time flow was different - the time flow in the Origin Land was about ten times that of Arching Star.</p><p></p><p>One year on Arching Star was nearly forty years in the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, the strongest had already reached the level of Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>These greatly boosted Qi Yuan's improvement.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan felt that his status as an Yin Spirit Venerable was somewhat hollow, with mediocre combat power. If it was himself from the Azure Waves Realm, he definitely wouldn't be able to defeat his current self.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I'm just an ordinary, mediocre Yin Spirit who can't even fight above my level."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he could kill Mythic realm experts as a divine infant.</p><p></p><p>In the game, he would have to kneel before a Mythic realm expert now.</p><p></p><p>"Divine infants, work harder and let me quickly enter the Yang Spirit realm!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>In this game, the martial path had demon blood, while the immortal path had divine infants to level up for him. As long as the divine infants performed well, he might be able to enter the Yang Spirit realm just by lying down.</p><p></p><p>After all, his divine infants had profound foundations.</p><p></p><p>The Mortal Heart Realm and Azure Waves Realm were special and couldn't break through to the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Origin Land didn't have this limitation.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>In the Thunder Grave, hundred-zhang long lightning bolts struck and shattered rocks, with crackling sounds ringing out non-stop.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Grave was where the Thunder Martial Sovereign had ascended, but it was also his burial ground.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the great battle began, countless Martial Sovereigns died in battle, and the Thunder Martial Sovereign was one of them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of uninvited guests arrived outside the Thunder Grave.</p><p></p><p>The leader had a thin figure like a bamboo pole, with two large heads hanging on the pole-like body - one male and one female human head.</p><p></p><p>"The Call of Dawn is getting closer. Strange things keep happening in the Origin Land. Hopefully the anomalies in the Thunder Grave are unrelated to the Scroll of Mountains and Seas," the male voice spoke hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>"I smell the aura of more and more old fellows. Could it be that this Thunder Martial Sovereign has awakened too?" the female head on the bamboo pole spoke in a shrill voice.</p><p></p><p>In the past hundred years, the Origin Land had not been peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Many Martial Sovereigns who had died in battle were reappearing one after another.</p><p></p><p>This brought some liveliness to the previously deathly quiet Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>However, some Martial Sovereigns were also surprised - how could those who died in battle be revived and awakened?</p><p></p><p>"If he's awakened, it would be best to recruit him into our Eastern Alliance!" the Fat Egg Martial Sovereign spoke up.</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, the most powerful faction among the Martial Sovereigns was the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The founder of the Eastern Alliance was the legendary Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>That expert who had reached an indescribable realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Eastern Lord alone could sweep away all the Martial Sovereigns in the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Alliance? This old man is not interested..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Interest." In the Thunder Tomb, an elder covered in lightning appeared, the flashes of lightning obscuring his form.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Martial Lord, you're indeed alive!" The thin voice contained surprise and delight.</p><p></p><p>But the hoarse voice was full of caution: "You've actually broken through and become a Great Martial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Martial Lords of ranks one to three are called Lesser Martial Lords. </p><p></p><p>Ranks four to seven are called Great Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Rank seven is also known as a Titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>This is similar to the realms of Yin spirits.</p><p></p><p>Before his supposed death, the Thunder Martial Lord was a rank three Lesser Martial Lord. Now he had unexpectedly become a rank four Great Martial Lord, how could he not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>"I had some insights between life and death, and luckily broke through," the Thunder Martial Lord's voice was full of uncertainty, as if he had been through a lot.</p><p></p><p>"There are less than 3000 years until the Dawn's Call. I hope the Thunder Martial Lord will consider the bigger picture and join our Eastern Alliance!" The thin man extended an invitation.</p><p></p><p>Great Martial Lords were considered powerful forces within the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Each Great Martial Lord could provide their own blood essence to the Mountain and Sea Scroll, which could accelerate its operation.</p><p></p><p>According to what the Eastern Lord said, as long as the world truly restarted successfully before the Dawn's Call, the Origin Land would gain vitality.</p><p></p><p>"This old man's blood essence is insufficient, so I won't join the Eastern Alliance." After the Thunder Martial Lord finished speaking, his form directly dissipated without even saying goodbye.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Eastern Alliance Martial Lords present looked at each other, but didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>The thin man's expression fluctuated, then he said: "What a pity, this world is full of selfish people who enjoy the fruits of our labor."</p><p></p><p>To maintain and accelerate the operation of the Mountain and Sea Scroll, the Eastern Alliance Martial Lords would regularly inject their blood essence into it.</p><p></p><p>"After the Dawn's Call ends, we'll settle accounts with these people," the shrill female voice carried killing intent, "It's not appropriate to start a war now."</p><p></p><p>Currently, the most important thing was to deal with the Dawn's Call.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Fat Egg Martial Lord looked up and asked: "Dual Phase Martial Lord, what's the current progress of the Mountain and Sea Scroll?"</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords also looked towards the Dual Phase Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>This Martial Lord was the offspring of a Titled Martial Lord, and knew more about the progress of the Mountain and Sea Scroll than they did.</p><p></p><p>"40% have entered the game, 40% are being conquered, 20% have failed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone's hearts eased a bit.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we successfully conquer 20% before the Dawn's Call, we can survive!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, 3000 years for 20%, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>The thin man looked at the Fat Egg Martial Lord: "You've worked hard these hundred years, injecting blood essence into the Mountain and Sea Scroll."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Fat Egg Martial Lord's face twisted into a bitter expression: "I'm completely drained now, squeezed dry, I don't have anything left."</p><p></p><p>The Fat Egg Martial Lord was originally also a Titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>But he was severely injured in a great battle, and his strength was reduced to only rank two Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Being able to maintain his strength without declining after regularly injecting blood essence into the Mountain and Sea Scroll was already fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the thin man felt somewhat smug inside.</p><p></p><p>Before the Great Calamity, the Fat Egg Martial Lord was someone he looked up to, but now he was just his subordinate, following his orders.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case..." The thin man was about to speak when suddenly his eyes widened as he looked at the Fat Egg Martial Lord, "You... what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords also looked at the Fat Egg Martial Lord in shock.</p><p></p><p>They saw that the Fat Egg Martial Lord's round egg-shaped body had turned bright red, with the blood vessels clearly visible on his skin.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored light spread.</p><p></p><p>Golden blood flowed like swimming dragons.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from the Fat Egg Martial Lord's body surged at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Bloodline Leap!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a Bloodline Leap!"</p><p></p><p>"How could the Fat Egg Martial Lord undergo a Bloodline Leap!"</p><p></p><p>The scene before them was all too familiar to these Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the Martial Lord realm, every time their cultivation increased by a rank, their descendants would undergo a Bloodline Leap.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Fat Egg Martial Lord was actually undergoing a Bloodline Leap.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he supposed to be the Bloodline Progenitor?</p><p></p><p>How could the source of a bloodline undergo a leap?</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords stared with wide eyes, their faces a mix of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>While these Martial Lords were surprised, the Fat Egg Martial Lord also looked confused: "I... underwent a Bloodline Leap?"</p><p></p><p>"Fat Egg Martial Lord, you wouldn't happen to not be the Bloodline Progenitor and secretly have a father, would you?" one Martial Lord asked.</p><p></p><p>This was difficult to explain.</p><p></p><p>Generally, it was the descendants who underwent Bloodline Leaps. How could a Bloodline Progenitor undergo a Bloodline Leap?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I was born from heaven and earth, how could I have a father?" The Fat Egg Martial Lord shook his head hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Then how do you explain your Bloodline Leap?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that you have a descendant who broke through to Martial Lord, becoming a second generation progenitor?</p><p></p><p>In the Land of Termination, the martial way has declined, this is impossible.</p><p></p><p>There are only Martial Lords in the strongholds.</p><p></p><p>Even those few at the peak of Martial King, unless they enter the Origin Land and receive the blessing of ancestral blood, they won't break through to the Martial Lord realm."</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the breakthrough to Martial Lord had been monopolized now.</p><p></p><p>One needed to enter the Origin Land and receive the blessing of ancestral blood to do so.</p><p></p><p>But now, the strongholds had not yet connected with the Origin Land, so how could anyone break through to the Martial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the greatest possibility was that the Fat Egg Martial Lord was actually not a first generation progenitor, but a second generation progenitor.</p><p></p><p>He actually... had a father.</p><p></p><p>"So, you definitely have a secret father!"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the former Titled Martial Lord Fat Egg, quietly gaining a father without anyone knowing."</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily a father, could be an ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords laughed and joked, some envious of the Fat Egg Martial Lord for apparently having a father who could still break through.</p><p></p><p>In the current Origin Land, Martial Lords who could break through were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... I really have a long-lost father?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In one page of the Mountain and Sea Scroll.</p><p></p><p>Wang Niang frowned, her expression quite complex.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Niang, how's the progress?" A man not far from Wang Niang asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The young miss... hasn't fallen for Tu Kongming."</p><p></p><p>"What? Hasn't fallen for him? This won't do.</p><p></p><p>She must fall in love with Tu Kongming for this painting to return to the correct timeline and for our mission to be completed.</p><p></p><p>Which part went wrong? We need to fix it quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"The young miss... seems to be closer to a bloodline holder."</p><p></p><p>"A bloodline holder?" The man frowned, "Go talk to him, tell him to stay away from the young miss. We'll help him with his task."</p><p></p><p>"This bloodline holder seems to have some mental issues. The young miss has been by his side for years and seems to have been somewhat affected. I'm afraid that even if he stays away from her, she won't fall for Tu Kongming in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"If that doesn't work, use harsher methods. Drug her directly, turn the rice into cooked rice. At that point, she'll have to comply whether she wants to or not!" The man said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Wang Niang hesitated, feeling somewhat reluctant.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think this is wrong. We are saving the world. For the sake of saving the world, what's wrong with using some extreme methods?</p><p></p><p>We're not asking for the young miss's life, just her chastity. It's a necessary sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the original timeline, the young miss and Tu Kongming were in love anyway.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the world, we can sacrifice everyone, including all bloodline holders, even destroy this Mountain and Sea Scroll!" The man spoke passionately.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, to save the Origin Land, he was willing to pay any price.</p><p></p><p>Sacrificing some people was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>Wang Niang, who was hesitant before, now had determination in her eyes after hearing this: "Alright, I understand what to do now!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

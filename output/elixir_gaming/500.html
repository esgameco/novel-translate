        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The morning sunlight shone lazily on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang still had a steamed bun in his mouth, chewing it in a muffled manner.</p><p></p><p>In the Shen mansion, on the training ground, groups of young men and women gathered together, whispering.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I have the talent of a weapon master?"</p><p></p><p>"If I'm selected to go to Yeshan Lake, and I come up with an excellent plan to restore the Weilong Xuantuan, how glorious that would be!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that last night, that son-in-law wanted to bathe the mistress... actually, I want to too..."</p><p></p><p>These voices, some spoken out loud, some just thoughts, did not escape Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan's figure appeared, the thoughts in many people's minds about "bathing water" increased.</p><p></p><p>However, no one dared to say it out loud, because it concerned the mistress's dignity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lazily stretched, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"My progress in playing the role of the son-in-law is too slow. Not only have I not poured the bathing water for the mother-in-law. These people's cultivation is also not bad, no one has come to bully me, how can I continue to play the role?"</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's thinking, in order to play the role of the son-in-law, he needs to be bullied, otherwise the progress will be slow.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan's appearance did attract the gaze of many people.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Ti looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze shifting, many thoughts flashing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Xuan is a beauty of the heavens, how could she have married such an incompetent scoundrel? Why didn't he die in Ninghe County?"</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday he caused a ruckus in the Shen mansion, yet the patriarch didn't punish him, how despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, he is the patriarch's son-in-law after all, can't offend him casually. I need to find a stupid person to stir up some trouble and let him go bother Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Look at how carefree he is, it makes me so jealous!"</p><p></p><p>"Shen Bai Hu would be good, but a pity, last time I told him... he said he doesn't bully trash."</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Ti's thoughts were gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He had long disliked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In fact, towards his own sister Shen Ling Xuan, he had always regarded her as a goddess, harboring a strong possessive desire.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shen Bai Ti's thoughts, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He found... someone who could bully the son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, go get a wooden board..." he secretly instructed Chen Kang.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Chen Kang hurriedly finished eating the steamed bun and ran off.</p><p></p><p>At this time, under the gaze of many people, Qi Yuan walked towards Shen Bai Ti's little circle.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Ti's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Hu was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The people around were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Brother Qi!" </p><p></p><p>No matter what, they all addressed Qi Yuan as "Brother Qi" and had friendly smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>This is the power of being the husband of the mistress.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan sigh, some people from great families are really good at pretending.</p><p></p><p>Especially that Shen Bai Ti, he hated Qi Yuan to death in his heart, yet his face wore a kind smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a son-in-law, yet you all treat me so well." Qi Yuan revealed a lotus flower-like smile.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi is joking, you are Ling Xuan's husband, we are all family, how could we not treat you well?" Shen Bai Ti said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Qi Yuan sighed mournfully.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, do you have any worries?" Shen Bai Ti asked concernedly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm lamenting that there is too much scheming and backstabbing in a great family. You clearly want me dead, yet you greet me with a smiling face." Qi Yuan looked at the young man in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Ti's smile froze, then he said in a pitiful tone, "Brother Qi, are you framing me? I don't know when I have offended Brother Qi, that you would hate me so much. Tell me, I will immediately make amends!"</p><p></p><p>When it comes to acting like a white lotus, Shen Bai Ti is far better than Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This performance, even a man would find it "heartbreaking".</p><p></p><p>Many people even glared angrily at Qi Yuan, feeling that Qi Yuan was bullying someone.</p><p></p><p>In their hearts, just a son-in-law, how dare he be so bold.</p><p></p><p>Against Shen Bai Ti, a person who likes to scheme behind the scenes, ordinary people are usually powerless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "If you didn't hate me to death, why would you incite Shen Bai Hu, wanting him to attack me?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, Shen Bai Ti's expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Hu also frowned deeply, thinking of something, his tiger eyes looking at Shen Bai Ti suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, how could I incite him?" Shen Bai Ti was a bit flustered, the things he said to incite Shen Bai Hu against Qi Yuan were only known to Shen Bai Hu.</p><p></p><p>This big and fierce Shen Bai Hu, how could he have told Qi Yuan those words?</p><p></p><p>He must have misunderstood him, his schemes were also very deep? "Ah, Bai Hu, it was I who misjudged you." Shen Bai Ti lamented, "When Ling Xuan married Qi Yuan, I did have some resentment in my heart, it was just a drunken slip of the tongue, I never thought you would actually tell those words to Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly distanced himself from the matter.</p><p></p><p>He even sought the recognition of the other people.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan married Shen Ling Xuan, and there were many in the Shen family who had resentment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Shen Bai Ti's resentment was even greater.</p><p></p><p>As a branch family member, he considered himself very outstanding.</p><p></p><p>The branch families can also intermarry with the main family.</p><p></p><p>He had just gained the opportunity to enter the core of the Shen family, and as soon as he saw Shen Ling Xuan, a strong possessive desire arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was arrogant, feeling that if given time, he could definitely get Shen Ling Xuan, and then he could gain more resources in the future, eventually taking control of the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that halfway through, Qi Yuan showed up, disrupting his plan.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Hu heard Shen Bai Ti's words, his expression changing constantly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some of the Shen family's young scions also came to plead for Shen Bai Ti.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, Bai Ti's drunken words were nonsense, please don't take them seriously!"</p><p></p><p>Many young scions in the Shen family had resentment towards Qi Yuan's entry into the family.</p><p></p><p>They also felt that Shen Bai Ti was like them, but was reported on by Shen Bai Hu.</p><p></p><p>Now, three or four young scions came to plead for Shen Bai Ti.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Ti hunched over, inwardly very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Shen Bai Hu, with just this level of scheming, how can you compete with me?"</p><p></p><p>He naturally felt that Shen Bai Hu was jealous and reported him, causing the son-in-law Qi Yuan to come bother him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Kang quickly ran over.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the board!"</p><p></p><p>He handed over a wooden board.</p><p></p><p>There was a rope hanging from the wooden board. Qi Yuan hung the board on himself.</p><p></p><p>He flipped the board over, and suddenly two large characters appeared.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a son-in-law, very easy to bully!"</p><p>"Shen Bai Ti, if you want to bully me, just bully, don't hide your thoughts!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pointed to the large characters on the board, looking at Shen Bai Ti.</p><p></p><p>The people around were all startled, feeling utterly bewildered by Qi Yuan's actions.</p><p></p><p>"This son-in-law... has really gone mad?"</p><p>"His behavior is simply... too unruly."</p><p></p><p>Yes, Qi Yuan's behavior left them completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bai Ti's expression was gloomy and unsightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Qi Yuan to find him and bring out a wooden board to write like this.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Chen Kang blinked his eyes, because he remembered the wooden board didn't have any writing on it before.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Bai Ti, I'm very easy to bully, come bully me quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Me!" Qi Yuan said to Shen Bailing, his face filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The performance of Qi Yuan as the son-in-law had reached 29% progress.</p><p></p><p>If he could go a step further, he had a feeling there would be a reward, so he was quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>As long as Shen Bailing bullied him, perhaps the progress would exceed 29%.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bailing took a deep breath: "Brother Qi, if I have displeased you, Bailing acknowledges his mistake and hopes Brother Qi can let go of your anger!"</p><p></p><p>He solemnly bowed and apologized to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The people around them looked at Shen Bailing with sympathy.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, are you a man? If you want to bully me, just say it directly. Pretending every day like a hypocrite, isn't it tiring?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Bailing still had a look of grievance: "Brother Qi, you have misunderstood me too much!"</p><p></p><p>The people around looked at Qi Yuan with a hint of resentment, as if they were angry that Qi Yuan was bullying Shen Bailing.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was an outsider, yet he was so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a hurried voice came: "Brother-in-law, I've found Old Zhong's residence!"</p><p></p><p>The voice carried a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng ran over and grabbed Qi Yuan's arm.</p><p></p><p>His arrival also seemed to pause the ongoing argument.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at Shen Bailing: "Bailing, wait for me to come back, then you can bully me again. I have something to attend to first."</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, what are you saying?" Shen Lingfeng was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, let's go to Old Zhong's place first."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pulled Shen Lingfeng and left.</p><p></p><p>After all, Old Zhong's death was a bit suspicious, and Qi Yuan needed to investigate who the mastermind was. This was one of the tasks he had to do as the son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Shen Bailing watched the retreating figures of Shen Lingfeng and Qi Yuan, his expression unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"How did their relationship suddenly become so good?"</p><p></p><p>"This Qi Yuan is really detestable. Is he pretending to be crazy or what?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the moral high ground is on my side. I'll be more careful these days, let's see how he wants to fight me."</p><p></p><p>Shen Bailing thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, he was the victim, and even if the matter was brought to the Elder Council, the advantage would still be on his side. He was not afraid of Qi Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, I know you want to investigate the cause of Old Zhong's death, so I specially found you a helper. He's now in Old Zhong's house, examining the body," Shen Lingfeng said earnestly, like a child seeking praise.</p><p></p><p>"You're thoughtful." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course I have to be diligent in serving my brother-in-law!" Shen Lingfeng said, then secretly added, "Brother-in-law, I've already received seventeen reply letters today."</p><p></p><p>He said it proudly, as if showing off.</p><p></p><p>He had sent out more than a hundred letters, and now he had received seventeen replies.</p><p></p><p>"But Miss Li and Miss Lin haven't replied, sigh..." Shen Lingfeng lamented.</p><p></p><p>"It means they are not destined to be with you, so forget about them from now on." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll listen to my brother-in-law!" Shen Lingfeng responded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at Old Zhong's residence outside the Shen mansion.</p><p></p><p>The place was quite remote, the house was not large, and it was dark and damp.</p><p></p><p>There was a faint smell of decay in the house, as well as a scent like that of a dead snake.</p><p></p><p>The coffin was placed inside, and as the lid was lifted, a man dressed like a constable was frowning in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qinghe, how's the investigation going? Who killed Old Zhong?" Shen Lingfeng shouted as he entered.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe was interrupted from his thoughts. He looked at Qi Yuan and Shen Lingfeng, his gaze briefly passing over Qi Yuan with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>However, he still answered truthfully: "The victim has been dead for too long, and there are too few clues left.</p><p></p><p>But there is a small, neat cut on his throat. Based on my analysis, it should be the work of a skilled swordsman who struck a fatal blow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe's expression was one of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Old Zhong had been dead for too long, and there were too few clues left in this house. Even if the best detectives came, it would be difficult to determine who the killer was.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed him and framed my brother-in-law?" Shen Lingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe shook his head: "I need more time to investigate and find more clues."</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look." At this moment, Qi Yuan spoke up and approached the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe was somewhat surprised, but he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, do you know how to solve cases?" Shen Lingfeng asked beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm very suited for solving cases." Qi Yuan answered seriously, "If I were a constable, there would be almost no case in this world that I couldn't crack!"</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't appeared in the immortal cultivation world, his supernatural abilities would have been most suitable for being a detective or a policeman.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe heard this and was somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>He naturally recognized the young man in front of him as Qi Yuan from Ninghe County. He didn't expect Qi Yuan to have come out of the asylum and returned to the Shen family.</p><p></p><p>But considering the Shen family's power, this was normal.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan, he knew, was just an ordinary, even somewhat useless person. How could he solve cases? Now he was boasting grandly, which was truly laughable.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, do you know... why there is a missing bone fragment in the victim's abdomen?" Lin Qinghe casually asked, as if wanting to test Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Does that matter?" Qi Yuan glanced at Lin Qinghe, "It has nothing to do with his death. You're actually paying attention to these things? It seems your skills are lacking."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe was stunned, feeling a mix of amusement and exasperation. This son-in-law Qi Yuan... couldn't he tell I was trying to test him? If he couldn't even recognize this simple injury, yet claimed there was no case in the world he couldn't solve, how ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't bother with Lin Qinghe anymore, his gaze falling on the decomposed body of Old Zhong.</p><p></p><p>He took a look at the fatal wound on the neck.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a message entered Qi Yuan's eyes:</p><p></p><p>[This sword mark was made by the hand of Fang Shisan of the Guangyao Society.]</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, have you found any clues?" Shen Lingfeng asked from a distance, not daring to come closer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe watched Qi Yuan, inwardly sighing. This person had only glanced at it, not even carefully examining the bones, how could he have found any clues?</p><p></p><p>"No clues, but I've found the one who killed Old Zhong." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe was taken aback and couldn't help but ask, "The murderer is someone you know, Brother Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"The murderer is Fang Shisan of the Guangyao Society. Do you two know him?" Qi Yuan asked in return.</p><p></p><p>"Guangyao Society? Fang Shisan?" Lin Qinghe was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>These two names he had never heard of before. Could it be that Qi Yuan was just making things up?</p><p></p><p>"We don't know them." Shen Lingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I see, so you don't know them." Qi Yuan said indifferently, "Let's go back home. Now that we know the murderer, we just need to find him."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's face showed admiration: "Brother-in-law, you're really amazing! Just one look at the body and you knew who the murderer was!"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lin Qinghe was still in a state of speechlessness.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to refute Shen Lingfeng, but thinking about it, there was no need to argue with Shen Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After all, he naturally felt that Qi Yuan was just talking nonsense. How could someone just look at the body once and know who the murderer was, when he didn't even recognize the murderer?</p><p></p><p>Unless the victim's bones were carved with the murderer's name?</p><p></p><p>"Brother, please help me issue a wanted notice for this Fang Shisan from the Guangyao Society!" Shen Lingfeng said before leaving.</p><p></p><p>"...Okay." Somewhat conflicted, Lin Qinghe reluctantly nodded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

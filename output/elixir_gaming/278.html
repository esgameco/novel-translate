        <h1>Chapter 278</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Good brother, how generous!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided that he couldn't eat alone, and wanted to leave the bones for Grand Master Dazhi.</p><p></p><p>He ate the meat of the chaotic filthy bird, eating slowly.</p><p></p><p>The sweet fragrance spread, filling his senses, making his mouth water. It wasn't tough at all, surpassing any delicacy Qi Yuan had ever eaten.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he forgot his previous thoughts and directly swallowed the chaotic filthy bird into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he felt as if a hot stream entered his belly, and his mind became clearer.</p><p></p><p>"This is really good stuff. After eating it, my senses have sharpened.</p><p></p><p>Whose bird is this? They must be a good person, knowing it was mealtime and I was hungry, specially feeding me."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Before eating, he had thought about leaving some bones for Grand Master Dazhi.</p><p></p><p>But he got carried away while eating and swallowed even the bones.</p><p></p><p>He felt quite ashamed.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the remaining feathers on the ground, his eyes lit up. He picked up the feathers, seemingly making a big decision: "There are still some feathers left, why don't you eat them?</p><p></p><p>This bird was too delicious, absolutely a worldly delicacy!"</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Dazhi looked at the feathers, many emotions flashing through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of wisdom passed through his gaze, and his expression became unprecedentedly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Did you notice that this bird was very strange, problematic?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Could there be a conspiracy? "This bird was crazy and frenzied. I suspect it... was sick!"</p><p></p><p>The words "was sick" fell into Qi Yuan's ears, deafening.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed dramatically, as if he had discovered something terrible.</p><p></p><p>His forehead turned pale, and sweat rolled down at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's over, this damn bird must have had rabies!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan panicked.</p><p></p><p>"There's no vaccine here, what should we do!"</p><p></p><p>He was really anxious.</p><p></p><p>What should one do after eating a bird with rabies? Grand Master Dazhi remained silent, seriously pondering something.</p><p></p><p>At this time, anger appeared on Qi Yuan's face: "Damn it, who is so vicious to use a sick bird to harm me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very angry, and the consequences were serious.</p><p></p><p>The world is getting worse.</p><p></p><p>Letting a sick bird run around without a leash.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit immoral for him to eat it.</p><p></p><p>But what if this crazy bird had pecked him! The bird's owner had no morals at all.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was furious and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>His powerful divine sense also spread at this moment, sweeping across the entire Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>All the yin spirits in Qinghong City sensed this overwhelmingly strong aura and their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Who angered the Blood Robe Sword God senior!"</p><p></p><p>Not only did the yin spirits sense it, but all the cultivators also noticed this scene, shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Who was so bold as to anger the Blood Robe Sword God like this.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the Blood Robe Sword God was a god of killing.</p><p></p><p>He never got angry before killing, he just killed people on sight.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he showed anger! At this moment, in the courtyard, Shi Rulan heard this cold shout, her eyes frenzied and satisfied, as if experiencing a hundred thousand times that kind of pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, he has finally gone mad, we have completed our mission!"</p><p></p><p>"The task is done, we can leave safely now!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity for the people of Qinghong City, they will all die by his hand.</p><p></p><p>This is a necessary sacrifice, the root of everything is the Blood Robe Sword God, blame him if you must!" Shi Rulan sneered, her eyes fanatical, mixed with pity for the ordinary cultivators of Qinghong City.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, a terrifying aura spread.</p><p></p><p>The two people in the room froze, immediately seeing a blood-red figure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Shi Rulan's eyes suddenly widened in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Rushan was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>Once the chaotic filthy bird was released, shouldn't the Blood Robe Sword God have gone mad and started killing?</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly appear here?</p><p></p><p>"So it was you who used a sick bird to harm me, well, well, how bold!" Qi Yuan looked at the two, extremely angry.</p><p></p><p>Shi Rulan's eyes were wide open, her face full of disbelief: "What's going on, why didn't the chaotic filthy bird affect you?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Rushan also had a confused and disappointed expression, wondering where things had gone wrong to lead to this result.</p><p></p><p>"You two little brats, using a sick bird to harm me, wanting me to get rabies, huh?</p><p></p><p>But I'm not afraid, I'm a cultivator, I can even make a vaccine! What damn chaotic filthy bird, it can't affect me at all!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was really angry, even swearing.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was a cultivator and could even make a rabies vaccine by hand.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What if other ordinary people ate this bird? This is a matter of life.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan's appearance, Shi Rulan felt dejected.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's current behavior, although his words sounded a bit confusing to her, he showed no signs of frenzied killing, nor any hint of madness in his demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"You ate the Chaos Filth Bird?" Shi Rushan looked at Qi Yuan with horror.</p><p></p><p>That was an ancient divine bird, a legendary mythical creature. And it was actually eaten.</p><p></p><p>How was he unharmed?</p><p></p><p>He became flustered, then thought of something, and his expression turned reverent again.</p><p></p><p>Since the assassination attempt failed, he would use fate and righteousness to persuade the Blood-Robed Sword God! Of course, persuasion was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted the Blood-Robed Sword God to lower his guard before attempting another assassination.</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword God, do you believe in fate? </p><p>Would you like to see visions of the future?" Shi Rushan calmed down, emanating the aura of a spiritual guru.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Grand Wisdom True Lord hurriedly said,</p><p></p><p>"Quickly tear his mouth to shreds!"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm about to lose my mom!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also understood Grand Wisdom True Lord's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"You still dare to insult my cyber parents!</p><p>You're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>He hesitated no longer.</p><p></p><p>With one spell, both of their mouths were torn apart.</p><p>Dense needles and threads then sewed their mouths shut.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shi Rulan and Shi Rushan felt regret and pain in their hearts.</p><p>Their plan had actually failed.</p><p>The opponent would certainly not listen to them speak now.</p><p></p><p>This pain was twice the negative of their previous pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Search their souls, then kill them," Qi Yuan said coldly, looking at the two. "Still trying to assassinate me, you really don't know who's in charge here."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the two Fate Cultivators looked dejected.</p><p>They weren't afraid of death, but of dying without completing their mission.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them cried out in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't give them any chance at all.</p><p></p><p>His domineering divine consciousness rushed into their souls, conducting a soul search.</p><p></p><p>The two's expressions became blank and pained.</p><p></p><p>"Fate Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"Fate Cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Gate of Fate?"</p><p></p><p>"These two are actually mentally ill!"</p><p></p><p>After seeing all of their memories, Qi Yuan concluded that these two were mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>"What is this Fate Mountain good for, letting mentally ill people out to harm others instead of keeping them at home!"</p><p></p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He hated it most when people used mental illness as an excuse to bully others.</p><p></p><p>Bullying people and then producing a certificate of mental illness to avoid all responsibility.</p><p></p><p>His hand suddenly grabbed, pulling out a peculiarly shaped small door from Shi Rulan's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This was the tool Fate Mountain used to summon the Gate of Fate.</p><p></p><p>"The mentally ill cannot be held responsible, it seems your Fate Mountain must bear full responsibility!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lineage Summoning, Curse Killing Technique!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan immediately unleashed a powerful divine ability.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability traveled thousands of miles, appearing on an unremarkable small mountain.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, continuous screams of agony came from that mountain.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators cried out in pain, their expressions terrified.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what was happening.</p><p></p><p>They could clearly see the fate of the Canglan Realm, continuing along the trajectory of fate.</p><p></p><p>Who knew they would be unable to predict the fate of Fate Mountain itself.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, those cultivators had all been cursed by Qi Yuan and perished.</p><p></p><p>If they were Yin Gods, Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't be able to curse-kill them so easily.</p><p></p><p>But they were merely Purple Palace Divine Infants, easily curse-killed.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Shi Rulan's eyes swelled and bled.</p><p></p><p>She sensed everything that happened to Fate Mountain.</p><p></p><p>You devil! She was furious in her heart, and deeply regretful.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she couldn't break free at all.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, your guardians have taken responsibility... so you..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, I'm not a court, so you must also be held responsible."</p><p></p><p>His hand lightly flicked.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, two heads exploded.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard became utterly silent.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>An old man sat in a wheelchair, a hint of a smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How interesting... so it was them causing trouble back then."</p><p></p><p>"Past life... I wonder if it was a blessing in disguise, or what."</p><p></p><p>He recalled wanting to take his past life self as a disciple, but being refused.</p><p></p><p>P.S.: I've been a bit busy lately, so the word count is lower. My apologies!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

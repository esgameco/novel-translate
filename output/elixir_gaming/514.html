        <h1>Chapter 514</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The burly man was named Wind Iron, a peak-level earth-grade military commander.</p><p></p><p>He was acquainted with the notorious bandit Sect Master Heng Shan, and the two had once explored a secret place together.</p><p></p><p>The secret place was filled with great difficulties, and several earth-grade military commanders had perished there.</p><p></p><p>Only he and Sect Master Heng Shan managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>Through this, he also learned Sect Master Heng Shan's greatest secret.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Heng Shan had once obtained the inheritance from an extraterrestrial visitor, imitating the Thorns of Blood, and transformed the ghostly spirits, ultimately fusing himself with the ghostly spirits and gaining a strange ability.</p><p></p><p>Illusion!</p><p></p><p>The reason why Sect Master Heng Shan had become the notorious bandit who terrorized the land, yet never met with any mishaps, was because he had mastered an art of illusion.</p><p></p><p>He could always leave freely.</p><p></p><p>This secret was probably only known to Wind Iron.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Wind Iron was different from the other earth-grade military commanders who were focused on the Shen family's stronghold - even if a cat came out from there, he would pay attention.</p><p></p><p>The chameleon that Chen Kang Bao transformed, if the others did not pay special attention, the other earth-grade military commanders would have overlooked it.</p><p></p><p>But Wind Iron was different.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the chameleon with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Heng Shan, what, are you afraid that I'll get a share?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao, carrying a cleaver, was somewhat anxious, and he stood in place, very hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Motionless.</p><p></p><p>The burly man in front of him exerted great pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the chameleon not moving, Wind Iron's smile grew wider: "Could it be that Sect Master Heng Shan wants to monopolize the Mysterious Yin Body?"</p><p></p><p>The reason why Heng Shan was a sect master was mainly due to his strange illusion art.</p><p></p><p>But once it was known, Heng Shan's combat power would drop significantly.</p><p></p><p>If Heng Shan was Wind Iron's opponent, how could he let Wind Iron, who knew his greatest secret, live?</p><p></p><p>"You've mistaken me, I'm not Sect Master Heng Shan." At this moment, Chen Kang Bao did not hide, his figure transforming into an old man, his voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't answer, with Wind Iron's temperament, he probably wouldn't let this chameleon live.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you... and you also know illusion art?" Wind Iron was surprised, his face showing a hint of wariness.</p><p></p><p>If the other party was Sect Master Heng Shan, he would boldly admit it, there was no need to be like this.</p><p></p><p>"There doesn't seem to be such a person in Ning Country... nor in Moshan Country..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just passing by, can I leave?" Chen Kang Bao said tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Leave the item behind." Wind Iron looked at the cleaver and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>This old man used illusion art to sneak into the Shen family's stronghold and steal a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>This cleaver must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Since he had seen it, he had to take a look at what was so special about this cleaver.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>To Wind Iron's surprise, Chen Kang Bao did not hesitate at all, directly throwing the cleaver towards him.</p><p></p><p>After throwing it, Chen Kang Bao quickly left.</p><p></p><p>This left Wind Iron very surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just leaving the cleaver like that? That's too easy to talk to? Could there be a plot?</p><p></p><p>But even so, he still quickly caught the cleaver.</p><p></p><p>He carefully looked at the cleaver, his eyes flashing sharply: "Such a sharp cleaver, it's probably not inferior to an earth-grade spiritual artifact in sharpness!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Iron believed that Chen Kang Bao had stolen a treasure and was forced to throw the cleaver to him to delay time in order to escape.</p><p></p><p>"No, but there's a gap on the edge of this cleaver?" </p><p></p><p>He looked at the cleaver, his eyes revealing a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>That gap was the zipper opening of Qi Yuan's outer shell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Chen Kang Bao were in a hurry to leave, so they didn't notice these details.</p><p></p><p>"A tool within a tool?" Wind Iron's eyes flashed with delight.</p><p></p><p>The outer shell here was comparable to an earth-grade spiritual artifact, what kind of treasure could be inside?</p><p></p><p>He was excited and forcefully pried at the gap, wanting to pry out the cleaver inside.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, a helpless voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"You're really a pervert, even prying at a cleaver!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a beam of light suddenly flashed.</p><p></p><p>Wind Iron incredulously clutched his throat, with blood constantly gushing out.</p><p></p><p>His huge body crashed to the ground, and he never imagined that this cleaver would be so sharp, and also have its own intelligence.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual artifact with intelligence, that was a legendary divine artifact! But how could Ning Country have a divine artifact? With a sneak attack, he couldn't even resist before dying on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure changed back to his original form: "I didn't expect the cleaver to be able to kill someone and slightly increase my proficiency."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the fallen Wind Iron, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>If it was a direct confrontation, with Qi Yuan's current strength recovery, it would still take some effort to subdue him.</p><p></p><p>But transformed into a cleaver, a sneak attack would be simple.</p><p></p><p>It was too close, and the opponent was unprepared, one slash and he was dead.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, and began to search Wind Iron's body.</p><p></p><p>Three earth-grade spiritual artifacts were found.</p><p></p><p>A soft armor, a short sword, and a lamp.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this, there were also 110,000 silver taels in the storage spiritual artifact.</p><p></p><p>This should be his entire fortune.</p><p></p><p>"There's even a letter from the bandit Sect Master Heng Shan?"</p><p></p><p>In the storage spiritual artifact, Qi Yuan saw several letters.</p><p></p><p>The earlier ones were a few years old, written by Heng Shan to Wind Iron, inviting him to explore a secret place together.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>This secret place was called the Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss, located in the no-man's-land between Ning Country and Moshan Country.</p><p></p><p>There were ten thousand towering mountains, continuous and steep, with dense miasma, and various strange ghostly spirits hidden there.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that even sky-grade military commanders could not cross the Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"According to Heng Shan's words, he discovered a newly built underground palace in the Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>A newly built underground palace, this was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss, why do I feel it's a bit familiar?" Chen Kang Bao murmured beside him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm: "Probably you've triggered your side quest."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Chen Kang Bao didn't understand what he meant by his side quest.</p><p></p><p>"According to the usual practice, we'll have to go take a look at this Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss in the future.</p><p></p><p>Heng Shan and Wind Iron were very interested in this Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss.</p><p></p><p>They had also agreed that after kidnapping Shen Ling Xuan, the three of them would go to that palace in the Ten Thousand Mountain Abyss, and after dual cultivation and breaking through to the sky-grade military commander level, they would explore it again."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, even wanting to kidnap my son-in-law Qi Yuan's wife, this bandit really wants to die!"</p><p></p><p>"They also agreed to meet at the Immortal Cloud Temple in five days to discuss how to capture Shen Ling Xuan."</p><p></p><p>"They really have big dreams."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Miss, your husband... is missing."</p><p></p><p>Zhi Shuang's eyes were filled with anxiety as she stood on the small boat, handing a letter to Shen Ling Xuan. Her appearance was cold and bright, but standing in front of the Miss, that icy aura was completely covered.</p><p></p><p>The Miss's coldness could freeze one's soul.</p><p></p><p>"A delicacy from the human world?" Shen Ling Xuan looked at the letter, her expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"It should be that Chen Kang Bao who took the young master away, but... I don't know how Chen Kang Bao took him away?" Zhi Shuang voiced her speculation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Investigate Chen Kang's identity, and if... he has no ill intent towards Qi Yuan, then let this matter rest for now." Shen Lingxuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qi Yuan is not in danger, let things be as they are.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Zhifrost nodded and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan held the letter, her thoughts complex: "With... the Guardian Warrior, he should be safe."</p><p></p><p>She knew many secrets, including some of Qi Yuan's father's secrets.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Qi Yuan's father mysteriously disappeared, then suddenly reappeared and gave something to Qi Yuan before passing away.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Shen Lingxuan had, Qi's father left something to protect Qi Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>"According to the Heavenly Mandate, you and I are fated, but this fate..." Shen Lingxuan's thoughts were complex.</p><p></p><p>She married Qi Yuan, of course, not only because of Qi's father, but also because of the Heavenly Mandate.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mandate is elusive and profound, unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Even in her previous life, Shen Lingxuan could not fathom it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a small flat-bottomed boat came towards Shen Lingxuan, and a young man in a blue robe stood calmly on the boat. He saw Shen Lingxuan and his eyes were filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, it's been a while, your cultivation has become even more profound."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was named Xie Danran, a true disciple of the Heavenly Sect, one of the top three in the Heavenly Sect's true disciple hierarchy. Though young, he was already a Level-Earth Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Shen Lingxuan did not conceal his admiration and affection.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the number one flower thief of the Moshan Kingdom, Master Hengshan, is coming to the Armorer's Convention. I'm worried for you, Sister. </p><p></p><p>Master Hengshan is cunning and treacherous. You are only a Mysterious-Level Armored Soldier now. If you suddenly encounter Master Hengshan, you may not even have time to give a warning before being kidnapped by him.</p><p></p><p>I happen to be patrolling the Yishan Lake, why don't you come with me, Sister? Although my strength is not as great as Master Hengshan's, if we encounter him, I can still hold him off for a while and call for help from the sect."</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's voice was elegant, and his words were full of adoration.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I already have a husband, I should keep my distance from men. Thank you for your kindness." Shen Lingxuan's voice was icy, keeping him at arm's length.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's face changed slightly, and a burning anger arose in the depths of his eyes: "Sister, I just closed my eyes for three months, and you've already gotten married. Is it because I angered you before I closed my eyes, and you married that Qi Yuan just to spite me?"</p><p></p><p>"......" Shen Lingxuan's shoulders trembled slightly. "Brother, you are being utterly nonsensical. My marriage to my husband is the will of Heaven, and has nothing to do with you."</p><p></p><p>The sense of detachment in Shen Lingxuan's words was very clear.</p><p></p><p>"Please leave, Brother. I'm afraid my husband will misunderstand."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid that Master Hengshan will kidnap you?" Xie Danran said angrily. "If you are kidnapped, do you know what will happen to you? That useless husband of yours, how can he protect you?"</p><p></p><p>"Leave!" Shen Lingxuan waved her hand, and Xie Danran's boat suddenly retreated and drifted away.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran stood on the boat, his fists clenched, a raging fire burning in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"A Mysterious Yin Body, this is a Mysterious Yin Body. How can I let that waste enjoy it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Xianyan Temple stood in the southeastern mountains, a small, dilapidated and abandoned temple.</p><p></p><p>Outside the temple, there was a decrepit pavilion made of marble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a light rain was falling in the southeastern mountains. Shen Lingxuan, in a blue dress, sat in the pavilion, looking at the rain, her thoughts endless.</p><p></p><p>In the rain, there seemed to be a sword intent hidden.</p><p></p><p>After the rain stops, this sword intent will gain strength and unleash its mightiest strike.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan sat in the pavilion, her expression icy. She seemed to have merged with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If someone passed by outside, they would not even notice her presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the aura she was emanating was not that of a Mysterious-Level Armored Soldier, but a Level-Earth Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>Just then, two figures, one old and one young, emerged from the curtain of rain. The young man was holding a paper umbrella and splashing through the muddy ground.</p><p></p><p>"Is that him?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man, Shen Lingxuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>This young man, she had seen him near Kunling Ferry before, and even encountered him in the Ghost Market.</p><p></p><p>And now he was coming here? Her expression suddenly became even colder.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those heading to the Xianyan Temple must be the villains in contact with Master Hengshan, the flower thief. Shen Lingxuan knew what schemes those scoundrels were hatching.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, that man also seemed to be one of them.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the young man stopped and looked at the pavilion: "Miss, what a coincidence, we meet again. May I come in to shelter from the rain?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan heard this and a flash of surprise crossed her beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>He can see me?</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Shen Lingxuan had already reached the realm of Heaven-Human Unification. </p><p></p><p>In terms of combat power, she was not as strong as a Level-Celestial Armored Soldier, but in terms of realm, she was even higher than ordinary Level-Celestial Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Under the Heaven-Human Unification, she was hidden in the pavilion, and it was impossible for anyone to discover her.</p><p></p><p>Now that she was discovered, she had a vague sense of crisis in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"This place does not belong to me, if the young man wishes to take shelter from the rain, then please come in." Shen Lingxuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the pavilion and looked at the graceful figure: "Miss, about what I said last time, would you reconsider being my mount?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... so cold!" Suddenly, Chen Kang Bao felt a piercing chill.</p><p></p><p>"Are you with the people in the Xianyan Temple?" Shen Lingxuan asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Originally, her plan was to slowly build up her strength and then strike out with a single sword, severely injuring those thieves in the Xianyan Temple. </p><p></p><p>Now that she had been discovered, if she made a move, it would definitely be exposed, and today's plan could be considered a failure.</p><p></p><p>She felt a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>The man in front of her, she could not see through him at all.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, only by truly reaching the Heaven-Human Unification and restoring her previous life's strength, could she see through him.</p><p></p><p>"How about this, I'll help you deal with the people in the Xianyan Temple, and you can be my mount. How about it?" Qi Yuan made the invitation again.</p><p></p><p>He rarely encountered someone he liked, how could he let this opportunity slip away.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's eyes revealed a suspicious look: "Aren't you all together?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I'm discriminating against their appearance, but they look so ugly, how could they be with me?" Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I'm ugly too!" Chen Kang Bao couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Qi Yuan was speechless, this Chen Kang Bao was always talking back.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan shook her head: "In any case, this young lady will not become a mount."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Qi Yuan heard this and was a little disappointed. He said, "Your sword intent is not bad, may I borrow it?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's vigilance increased even more.</p><p></p><p>The man in front of her could even see her sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that if he wanted to kill her, she would have a hard time even escaping?</p><p></p><p>"As you wish."</p><p></p><p>"Good, watch closely."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stretched out his white, slender palm and grabbed into the air.</p><p></p><p>The rain curtain seemed to have stopped.</p><p></p><p>The water droplets hung suspended, like a string of pearls.</p><p></p><p>A sword appeared in his hand, cold and icy.</p><p></p><p>He held the water sword and thrust it into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the rain stopped.</p><p></p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

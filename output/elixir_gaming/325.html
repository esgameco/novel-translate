        <h1>Chapter 325</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You... Luo Bufan?"</p><p></p><p>The young man looked at Luo Bufan, his face showing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The village chief possessed by the sea god also looked stunned, clearly today's events were beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan, collapsed on the ground, looked at Chen Fan's familiar face and also felt momentarily confused.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao widened her eyes, then smiled bitterly: "So, the protagonist of this mission is the captain."</p><p></p><p>Earlier when talking with Qi Yuan, An Qiao had referred to the mission world as a parallel world. </p><p></p><p>This wasn't just a casual remark, but truly parallel.</p><p></p><p>The mission world they were in seemed to be a replica of events that had happened in the real world in the past.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had returned to the past, to different historical timelines, to complete missions.</p><p></p><p>So, during missions, they had seen many parallel versions of historical figures, and also knew of many brilliant but unlucky minor characters who had left no trace in the history books.</p><p></p><p>History is so vast and weighty, and every minor character is so insignificant in the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying the captain once experienced the same things Luo Bufan did." The man in black tight-fitting clothes looked at Chen Fan, his eyes showing a hint of wariness.</p><p></p><p>After all, Luo Bufan was a ruthless person who had killed his entire family to forcibly increase his own power in order to slay demons.</p><p></p><p>If he could kill even his closest kin, who wouldn't he dare to kill?</p><p></p><p>"The captain isn't that kind of person, I don't believe it!" An Qiao gritted her teeth, her gaze complex. "There must be some hidden circumstances!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's eyes fell on Chen Fan.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan looked at Luo Bufan, his expression resolute: "I am another you, you from another world.</p><p></p><p>Once, I also encountered the same things as you.</p><p></p><p>I was in pain, felt guilty, regretful, and even thought about dying.</p><p></p><p>But... I eventually got through it.</p><p></p><p>If I had died, wouldn't the deaths of my parents and family have been in vain?</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan, you need to think about the hundreds of thousands of people in Yunyun County behind you.</p><p></p><p>Do you want to watch this great demon completely submerge Yunyun County?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's voice was hoarse but firm, with a hint of desolation.</p><p></p><p>He had once experienced the same things.</p><p></p><p>But in the end he had recovered and sealed away the great demon.</p><p></p><p>After coming to this world, long-sealed memories were unlocked.</p><p></p><p>He appeared calm and carefree, but in reality, every word drained his mental strength, bloodily tearing open past memories.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Bufan, are you willing to use the Luo family's ultimate technique, Wuming Shou, with me today?" Chen Fan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>The enemy they faced today was even stronger and more cunning than the one he had encountered in the past.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chen Fan's words, the last trace of doubt disappeared from Luo Bufan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Wuming Shou was the Luo family's secret technique, only passed down to the next family head.</p><p></p><p>Besides his father, he was the only one in the Luo family who knew it.</p><p></p><p>This technique was unknown to outsiders, and those of other bloodlines could not practice it.</p><p></p><p>So Chen Fan was not lying to him.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan glanced at Chen Xinlian's corpse, his eyes filled with endless guilt and regret, but finally his gaze suddenly became determined: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Wuming Shou, as its name suggested, meant certain death after using it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the past Luo Bufan and the present Chen Fan both chose the same path.</p><p></p><p>The faces of his family, relatives, fiancée, and all those who had died tragically flashed through Luo Bufan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Now, the blood flowing through him was not his own, but theirs.</p><p></p><p>"Wuming Shou!" </p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan at the Jade Blood realm shouted.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan at the peak of the Qi Blood realm roared.</p><p></p><p>On the beach, two terrifying figures charged unhesitatingly towards the body possessed by the sea god.</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored palm prints flew everywhere, like falling leaves in a maple forest.</p><p></p><p>Long ago, the Luo family ancestor had created Wuming Shou in a maple forest and died.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Luo family had this ultimate technique, but no descendant had ever used it.</p><p></p><p>Today, Luo Bufan would bring Wuming Shou back to life.</p><p></p><p>This martial art that surpassed the Jade Blood realm displayed its terrifying power in this moment.</p><p></p><p>That unmatched power, that melancholy feeling like falling leaves, even somewhat resembled the innate divine abilities of Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The sea god let out a great roar, unable to move its body in the face of the two palms.</p><p></p><p>Even its powerful physical cultivation seemed to have lost all effect at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Its most prized illusion techniques also vanished uselessly.</p><p></p><p>The two blood palms forcefully struck its body.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>The village chief's body shattered, flesh and bones turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>This strike even landed on the sea god's soul.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The sea god let out an agonized scream.</p><p></p><p>Its spirit form floated in the air, its eyes filled with rage.</p><p></p><p>"You actually... destroyed one of my physical bodies, unforgivable, unforgivable!"</p><p></p><p>The sea god was extremely distressed, but even more angry.</p><p></p><p>It had schemed for many years, using illusions to lure and devour Kun Laoda, turning him into one of its avatars.</p><p></p><p>But now, the two had attacked simultaneously with immense power, striking directly at its soul.</p><p></p><p>It could only use Kun Laoda's avatar to block the two Wuming Shou attacks.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but many of its other possessed bodies also exploded and were lost.</p><p></p><p>In Sea Stone Village, over a hundred strong young men instantly perished.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it had still suffered no light injuries.</p><p></p><p>This martial technique used at the cost of one's life had directly depleted decades of its accumulated power.</p><p></p><p>Especially Kun Laoda's avatar, which was at the Jade Blood level of strength.</p><p></p><p>Today's events could be said to have cost it dearly in both manpower and resources.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you'll all die, you'll all die!"</p><p></p><p>The sea god's eyes turned blood-red as it roared in fury.</p><p></p><p>The distant sea surface suddenly churned violently, waves rising to the sky like a dragon sucking up water.</p><p></p><p>Atop the giant waves, an ugly soft-bodied monster opened three eyes, each eye as large as a lantern, representing three types of martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>The white eye controlled illusions.</p><p></p><p>The red eye controlled attacks.</p><p></p><p>The purple eye controlled manipulation.</p><p></p><p>This was the sea god's true form, the "spirit blood child" Kun Laoda had spoken of.</p><p></p><p>The so-called spirit blood child was just a deception.</p><p></p><p>After devouring Kun Laoda and turning him into its avatar, the sea god had spread rumors of a spirit blood child, vainly hoping to devour all the demons in Yunyun County.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, things had not gone according to plan.</p><p></p><p>Now, it had even lost a powerful avatar.</p><p></p><p>It had lost nearly a third of its combat power.</p><p></p><p>How could it not be furious?</p><p></p><p>With its schemes in ruins, it decided to no longer hold back and directly carry out its plan to flood Yunyun County.</p><p></p><p>This was the information Luo Bufan had obtained in the past.</p><p></p><p>That's why he had been so anxious and sought help from the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>However, the hundred thousand taels of silver had produced no results.</p><p></p><p>Under the sea god's control, water from the sea continuously gathered, growing more and more, higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to want to submerge Yunyun County beneath the sea.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do, the sea god didn't die!"</p><p></p><p>"We're finished, it's enraged!"</p><p></p><p>"Captain!"</p><p></p><p>The three from the Demon Suppression Department rushed towards Chen Fan.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's face was as pale as paper. He looked at the distant seawater, a trace of worry flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yunyun County... is probably doomed."</p><p></p><p>In the past, the enemy he had faced was even stronger than this one.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, with the help of others, he had managed to seal that great demon.</p><p></p><p>But today... Yunyun County...</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan's hair was disheveled as he stared at the ever-rising mountain of water before him, his eyes blood-red: "I... failed, how regretful..."</p><p></p><p>His loved ones had died tragically, and the demon he most wanted to eliminate was still alive. He had failed to take it down even at the cost of his life.</p><p></p><p>Such regret, such remorse, such...</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan stared wide-eyed at the sea, seemingly unwilling to close his eyes even in death.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan gasped for breath, but coughed up fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao pressed on Chen Fan's shoulder, her eyes misting over: "What's going on, the mission is clearly completed, why can't we go back yet!"</p><p></p><p>She wanted to go back, not just to escape the sea god, but also to exchange for some medicine to treat Chen Fan's injuries. She thought Chen Fan could still be saved.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan, who had lived for hundreds of years, clearly understood her thoughts: "I should have died long ago, I can't be saved."</p><p></p><p>His heart meridians were already severed, his blood essence depleted. He was only one step away from death.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." A self-mocking smile appeared at the corner of Chen Fan's mouth. "The heavens spoken of by later generations..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seems that in all worlds... he was useless. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't even protect his own family."</p><p></p><p>The past events seemed to be the most painful thing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now, finally, he no longer had to endure such pain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the seawater was gathering, with more and more massive waves.</p><p></p><p>The entire Yunyun County was in imminent danger.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, not many people noticed this.</p><p></p><p>The Sea God sat on the waves, looking extremely arrogant and proud, as if he controlled everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a calm voice cut through the roaring waves, clearly reaching everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, in this game, I'm not the protagonist who arrives last to save the world.</p><p></p><p>Instead, I'm an opportunist... stealing kills and snatching heads.</p><p></p><p>King of Moli Sha Fish, old friend, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared, looking relaxed.</p><p></p><p>As if he wasn't facing a terrifying monster, but a weakened target ripe for the taking.</p><p></p><p>The Sea God's gaze finally fell on Qi Yuan, with a look of surprise in his eyes: "We've... met before?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I suppose we have met.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, I've eaten you before.</p><p></p><p>Well... a more delicious version of you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the King of Moli Sha Fish he ate in reality, savoring the memory.</p><p></p><p>That was a great demon of the Wu Ying level, far beyond the Jade Blood realm demon before him.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" The Sea God raged, his blood-red eyes glaring at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a blood-red arrow shot towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I'm also at Jade Blood realm. Dodge!" Qi Yuan easily sidestepped, avoiding the arrow.</p><p></p><p>A flash of surprise crossed the Sea God's eyes, then turned to mockery: "Mere early Jade Blood realm, how dare you be so impudent!"</p><p></p><p>Boss Kun was a mid Jade Blood realm great demon.</p><p></p><p>The combined attack of Luo Bufan and Chen Fan had power approaching late Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the Sea God had still survived.</p><p></p><p>"If you were at full strength, I might be a bit wary. But now you're just a weakened target, looking fierce but actually insignificant," Qi Yuan said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>He loved targets like this.</p><p></p><p>Being an opportunist, taking out a weakened enemy from behind was perfect.</p><p></p><p>The contempt in the Sea God's eyes grew stronger: "Perfect timing, since Kun Feng's avatar has fallen, you... can become my new avatar!"</p><p></p><p>Although losing Kun Feng's avatar had reduced the Sea God's power by a third,</p><p></p><p>His proudest illusion abilities remained intact.</p><p></p><p>To deal with Kun Feng and the current Luo Bufan, he still needed to set up a trap.</p><p></p><p>But for someone like Qi Yuan who had just entered Jade Blood realm, he could simply overwhelm him with illusions.</p><p></p><p>As the Sea God spoke, his white eyes turned towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan felt the world go silent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he squinted his eyes and smiled happily: "Do you want to hear my inner thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea God's illusion attack was meant to invade Qi Yuan's mind, collect his memories, and hear his inner voice.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, too weak, can't even open the door. Come on, be good, let me open it for you."</p><p></p><p>As they say, a confidant is hard to find.</p><p></p><p>How could Qi Yuan not quickly open the door when he encountered someone who wanted to hear his inner thoughts?</p><p></p><p>As soon as the door opened, countless... divine infants suddenly entered the Sea God's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Countless chaotic, frenzied, disordered curses, murmurs, and cries of pleasure rushed into the Sea God's mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The Sea God's white eyes suddenly burst, scattering white fluid everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh... you are... ahh..."</p><p></p><p>The Sea God's thoughts also became somewhat deranged.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had finally broken through Qi Yuan's mental defenses with his illusions and heard Qi Yuan's inner voice.</p><p></p><p>But what he heard... what on earth was it?</p><p></p><p>"Ahh..." </p><p></p><p>He frantically clawed at his own white eye sockets, as if trying to completely crush them.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, why not stay a while longer? My divine infants are feeling a bit lonely. It's rare to have someone go in to keep them company," Qi Yuan said with a somewhat desolate expression, like a lonely left-behind elder. But soon, he smiled again like an opportunist, "Now do you understand why I called you a weakened target? Without Boss Kun, you're... nothing!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Moli Sha Fish was most skilled at illusions, bewitching people's hearts and creating environments.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan feared deception and illusions least of all.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - he was quick-witted and very clever.</p><p></p><p>He also had eyes that could see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't be fooled by illusions.</p><p></p><p>So he was the natural counter to the King of Moli Sha Fish.</p><p></p><p>Without Boss Kun's protection, wasn't the Sea God just a weakened target waiting to be slaughtered?</p><p></p><p>"Someone once said you can never step in the same river twice, or eat the same fish twice.</p><p></p><p>Today, I'll prove that person wrong and taste... which of you is more delicious."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Blood level Explosive Bird-Killing Fist activated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Without any fancy moves, just an ordinary punch.</p><p></p><p>It penetrated all illusions, striking directly at the Sea God's heart.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The frenzied Sea God had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>The divine infants inside Qi Yuan murmured like the whispers of evil gods, directly driving him to mental disorder.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's single strike, he fell straight down, his life force slowly extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the massive waves once again calmed, like fireworks in the sky fading away.</p><p></p><p>Over thirty drops of jade-white blood appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>This mission had been very easy, and he had even watched a... TV drama.</p><p></p><p>His gaze also fell on Chen Fan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chen Fan's internal organs were completely shattered. His eyes held an expression that was hard to tell if it was relief or lifelessness.</p><p></p><p>The crazed Luo Bufan also lay on the ground, his face smiling but looking worse than if he were crying.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you. Dying like this... may be easier to accept," Chen Fan said faintly, looking at this familiar yet strange Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had long lost all color.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to no longer care about anything in this world.</p><p></p><p>Dying like this was also a kind of release.</p><p></p><p>At least Yunyun County had survived, right?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Chen Fan and said calmly, "Before you leave, do you want to hear some hidden plot of the game?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's life force was constantly fading. He didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>Luo Bufan also lay on the ground, quietly waiting for death to arrive.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan continued speaking on his own: "The mission isn't complete yet. Actually, it's very simple. The Luo family and Chen family were actually killed by... the King of Moli Sha Fish.</p><p></p><p>Didn't the game mission say to investigate the truth behind the extermination of the Luo and Chen families by demons?</p><p></p><p>Obviously... a demon did it.</p><p></p><p>Actually... your father, your mother, your family, and your fiancée were not killed by your hands.</p><p></p><p>It was the King of Moli Sha Fish who killed them. It's just that he was skilled in illusions and tricked you, making you think you had killed them.</p><p></p><p>As for the motive, it's also simple. The King of Moli Sha Fish's combat power was too weak, so he needed people to protect him.</p><p></p><p>Boss Kun was his choice, and Yunyun County's prodigy Luo Bufan... was also someone he had his eye on."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luo Bufan's body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's face showed joy: "I knew the captain wasn't that kind of person. How could he possibly kill his own parents!"</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Fan, whom she was holding down, remained calm upon hearing Qi Yuan's words and asked softly, "Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao wept with joy: "Captain, let's go back. There must be some item that can save you."</p><p></p><p>The other two men in black uniforms also smiled happily. This mission had been thrilling but without danger.</p><p></p><p>As long as the captain could be healed, it would be a big win, a perfect ending.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan seemed not to have heard An Qiao's words. He kept coughing, with crimson blood mixed with organ tissue flowing from the corner of his mouth. He looked at An Qiao: "After the mission is complete... go to my residence, give my things to... him... as... payment..."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he glanced at the young Luo Bufan in the distance. For the first time, his eyes showed a relieved, relaxed smile. His hand finally fell limp.</p><p></p><p>The world had chosen to reconcile with him, but he seemed not to have reconciled with himself yet.</p><p></p><p>Chen Fan's death didn't cause much emotional fluctuation in Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just an NPC, and one without much screen time at that.</p><p></p><p>"The mission is finally over... where do we go back to?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, before we go back, let's bury them first. Show respect for the dead."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

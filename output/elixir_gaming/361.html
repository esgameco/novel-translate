        <h1>Chapter 361</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A cycle of sixty years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Worldly affairs are like floating clouds, disappearing in an instant. </p><p></p><p>Time can wash away everything, even the deepest marks struggle to resist its erosion.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to contestant Qi Yuan for defending his championship title at the Martial Arts Tournament once again!"</p><p></p><p>As the clear voice rang out, Qi Yuan looked calmly at the 90-year-old man lying on the ground in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, very impressive, you're even stronger than last year!" The old man's face showed a helpless smile. "Alas, I've lost again."</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, you may have lost but you still fought honorably. You're the runner-up, aren't you?" Qi Yuan consoled the old man, showing respect for his elders.</p><p></p><p>"What use is being runner-up when there are only two of us competing?" The old man said dissatisfied. "This Martial Arts Tournament... how has it not gone bankrupt yet? It's really strange."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the old man glanced around the arena.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the arena was large, but somewhat dilapidated. </p><p></p><p>Although the tournament wasn't very popular even in his youth, at least half the seats would be filled back then.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, if the organizers were willing to spend money, they would even hire some fake spectators to boost the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>But now... there wasn't a single spectator.</p><p></p><p>No, there was one.</p><p></p><p>In the stands, a beautiful young woman was waving a glow stick, her face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"So strong, champion again!"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you're amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"This young lady is your fan!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, this sole spectator was the golden canary who always went crazy for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At every competition, she would act as Qi Yuan's cheerleader, fan, and family member, cheering him on enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the 90-year-old man's face grew even more bitter: "Immortal master, could you please stop participating in the Martial Arts Tournament? This old man's childhood dream was to be champion just once. You've already defeated me nearly sixty times, can you give me a chance?"</p><p></p><p>The old man was very frustrated.</p><p></p><p>In his youth, he loved watching action-packed TV shows. He would grab a wooden stick and torment the rapeseed flowers in the fields.</p><p></p><p>However, his martial arts talent was mediocre, and he couldn't even qualify for the official competition.</p><p></p><p>Later, as immortal cultivation revived and martial arts declined, fewer and fewer contestants joined the Martial Arts Tournament. </p><p></p><p>That's when he rekindled his desire to participate.</p><p></p><p>His rankings improved, and he had hope of winning the championship.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately... he lost every time.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal master, I don't have many years left to live. Could you let this old man win? After all, the Martial Arts Tournament is cruel - the flowers, applause and prestige all belong to the champion. No one remembers the runner-up who exits the stage in disappointment." The old man tried to reason emotionally and logically.</p><p></p><p>For nearly sixty years, Qi Yuan's appearance hadn't changed. If he wasn't an immortal cultivator, what else could he be? An immortal cultivator participating in a martial arts tournament - wasn't that bullying?</p><p></p><p>"You're different. You've always been the runner-up, people will remember you," Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>With that, he walked towards the golden canary and took her delicate white hand. "Young man, see you next year."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary excitedly clung to Qi Yuan and waved her hand. "Look, what's this?"</p><p></p><p>"An invitation?" Qi Yuan looked at the object in the golden canary's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm. You've been wanting to break through to the Purple Palace realm, right? This young lady has been paying attention lately and discovered... cultivators from the Three Realms, as well as some demon cultivators from Canxing, are holding a conference together to discuss the Dao of the Purple Palace. To participate, one must be a Divine Infant cultivator. If you go, you might gain some insights."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Although in this game, Qi Yuan had long since reached the Purple Palace realm, his breakthrough had been muddled and unclear.</p><p></p><p>His true self was currently just a weak Divine Infant cultivator in terms of martial power.</p><p></p><p>He still had to look up to Purple Palace powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect. After attending this conference, I'll consolidate what I learn and then ask online friends. I'm sure I'll be able to get the correct answers!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very clever. He knew that listening to many opinions leads to clarity.</p><p></p><p>Just hearing lectures from Divine Infant or Purple Palace cultivators wasn't enough. The wisdom of the common people is endless.</p><p></p><p>Making a post to ask around might spark some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady also has an invitation. I'll accompany you," said the golden canary. With a wave of her hand, two masks appeared. "Put this on quickly. At this gathering, we can't show our faces. We need to hide our identities."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the masks with an odd expression. "Are you sure this conference is legitimate?"</p><p></p><p>These masks... he seemed to have only seen them in certain short videos before.</p><p></p><p>"What are you imagining?" The golden canary's face turned red.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, for fun, she would also wear masks. She knew exactly what Qi Yuan was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing. Let's go attend the conference." Qi Yuan embraced the golden canary and their forms disappeared.</p><p></p><p>By now, the missions in this game were almost complete.</p><p></p><p>He was close to beating the game.</p><p></p><p>However, regarding the Purple Palace realm, he still had no clue.</p><p></p><p>Although he had learned quite a bit when he consulted the Great Wisdom True Monarch before, he still felt it wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>He needed creativity.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he cultivated a garbage-tier Purple Palace, it would be rather embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was about to become the first Purple Palace cultivator of the Divine Light Sect, unprecedented in history! He needed to have some real strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The conference was set to begin in a sea area.</p><p></p><p>Above the sea floated a dilapidated cruise ship.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, one could see flashes of light descending onto the ship.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang's face was covered with a black cloth, her expression rather melancholic.</p><p></p><p>After sixty years, she had become a Divine Infant level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuantian Sect, she was the strongest after the sect leader.</p><p></p><p>As for her senior sister... well, there was still no trace of her.</p><p></p><p>With the heavy responsibilities of the sect falling on her shoulders, she had matured.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there are so many powerful cultivators here," Wang Zhiwei looked curiously at the old cruise ship ahead.</p><p></p><p>This neighbor of Qi Yuan's had now reached the peak of Foundation Establishment. Sixty years had passed, yet she still maintained the appearance of a young girl.</p><p></p><p>"Conceal your aura well, don't let anyone discover your identity!" Xie Tang warned, her star-like eyebrows furrowed into a knot.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Gu Wu and Qin Yuan were still at war.</p><p></p><p>This war had lasted for nearly sixty years.</p><p></p><p>The Three Realms Alliance had also fallen apart, with internal attacks escalating into real conflict.</p><p></p><p>Add to that some demon races entering the fray, and the world situation had become chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Among those attending this gathering, there might well be enemies. If identities were exposed, it could provoke lethal attacks from foes.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!" Wang Zhiwei quickly concealed her cultivation level again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Tang's brow suddenly twitched, because not far ahead, a couple had just landed. Although their faces couldn't be seen clearly, their aura was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, for some reason, she felt she detected a familiar scent from this couple.</p><p></p><p>But exactly what was familiar, she couldn't recall for the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, are you also here for the small gathering? Why don't we go together? We can look out for each other," Xie Tang quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiwei also followed, her face full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>She too sensed something familiar.</p><p></p><p>That perfect couple was, of course, Qi Yuan and the golden canary.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xie Tang and Wang Zhiwei approaching and nodded: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiwei was Yang Shan's daughter.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan first came to this game, his martial cultivation wasn't deep. Yang Shan had given Qi Yuan a lot of help on his martial path.</p><p></p><p>The first time he participated in the Martial Arts Tournament was thanks to Yang Shan pulling some strings.</p><p></p><p>Towards his daughter, Qi Yuan still felt goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang looked at the two of them, her expression curious.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through her mind.</p><p></p><p>Because in the Three Realms and among the demon race, divine infant couples like the one before her were rare.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, none matched the physiques of these two.</p><p></p><p>However, judging by their apparent age, they should be like her - newly ascended divine infants, not old monsters.</p><p></p><p>Her enemies were all old monsters, so she was wary of Qi Yuan, but not overly so.</p><p></p><p>"The path of immortality is truly difficult, especially the Purple Palace realm... it's on a completely different level from divine infant. I don't know if I'll have the chance to enter Purple Palace in this lifetime," Xie Tang sighed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I agree completely," Qi Yuan nodded. "Every stage of the immortal path is full of hardships and dangers. </p><p></p><p>To break through to Foundation Establishment, I once battled 2,700 old men and nearly died there.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to Golden Core was even more perilous. My golden core was a bit large and almost burst me open.</p><p></p><p>When reaching Divine Infant, I encountered the greatest crisis of my life - that person almost crashed the game I was playing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's reflections were sincere. </p><p></p><p>His journey had been incredibly difficult.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Xie Tang felt something was off, but she also agreed.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to Foundation Establishment and nearly being killed by 2,700 old men, though exaggerated, was still acceptable. </p><p></p><p>But... what did he mean by crashing a game when breaking through to Divine Infant?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you must be an independent cultivator. Your path of breakthrough has been quite difficult," Xie Tang remarked.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi's eyes also showed sympathy: "Although Senior is an independent cultivator and faced more hardships in the early stages compared to us sect disciples, you can now be considered to have endured the bitterness to taste the sweetness, transforming from mortal to dragon."</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi also offered timely flattery.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan became unwilling.</p><p></p><p>He did have a sect.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Shenguang Sect a sect?</p><p></p><p>He was about to break through to Purple Palace, becoming Shenguang Sect's first Divine Infant in all of history - such a glorious achievement!</p><p></p><p>"I'm not an independent cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Wang Zhiqi was stunned. "If you're not independent, why was your breakthrough so difficult?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her gaze becoming admiring again.</p><p></p><p>It must be due to poor talent.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is a late bloomer!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>This daughter of Yang Shan, already a little old lady in her 70s or 80s, still didn't know how to speak properly and lacked emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that my Foundation Establishment is different from yours?" Qi Yuan looked at Wang Zhiqi, a desire to show off suddenly surging, "Your level of Foundation Establishment is really too weak. I could defeat ten thousand of you!</p><p></p><p>If you don't believe me, shall we have a little contest?"</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand," the golden canary chimed in gleefully.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi was stunned, somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>No way, Senior. You're a Divine Infant powerhouse - isn't it bullying to compete with a Foundation Establishment cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Senior, how could this little woman dare to compete with you?" Wang Zhiqi quickly said, also somewhat flustered. "This little woman is not worthy."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the Qing Dynasty fell so many years ago, how can someone still have a queue on their head?</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, we advocate equality for all, equality between men and women.</p><p></p><p>You and I are both people, we are equals. How can there be any unworthiness in us competing?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to properly "educate" Yang Shan's daughter. This Wang Zhiqi was younger than him, yet her thinking was so feudal, not at all like an independent woman of the new era.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi was slightly stunned. She didn't know why, but she felt that what this senior said seemed... very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>But at the thought of competing with a Divine Infant senior, she immediately made a bitter face, speechless, and looked towards Xie Tang with a pleading gaze.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang smiled: "Senior, why joke with juniors?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking, I'm serious," Qi Yuan said earnestly. "You're from ancient times, so it's understandable that your thinking is feudal, but she's from modern times and still so old-fashioned."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang was also at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>The originally harmonious atmosphere became awkward at this moment, and the four people fell silent, without much further exchange.</p><p></p><p>After presenting their invitations, everyone boarded the cruise ship to attend this small gathering.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that quite a few cultivators attended this gathering, with a full thirty-plus Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>As for junior disciples like Wang Zhiqi, there were even more.</p><p></p><p>All the Divine Infant cultivators were assigned seats, while juniors like Wang Zhiqi stood. Nearly a hundred people gathered in one hall.</p><p></p><p>An old man wearing a pure red mask entered, emanating a powerful aura - clearly a Divine Infant at the peak stage.</p><p></p><p>He scanned everyone present, passing over them one by one, then spoke: "Since everyone has arrived, without further ado, let this small gathering begin. I'll start things off, and everyone can discuss and exchange ideas together."</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked old man sat in the main seat, his face indiscernible. He slowly began to speak, his voice ethereal, like celestial music.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Infant transforms into Purple Palace, with the core key being the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Only when the divine soul is refined to the extreme can one break through.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between Divine Infant and Purple Palace is in divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Divine Infant uses dao law divine abilities, while Purple Palace tends towards primordial divine abilities of heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I believe that for Divine Infant to break through to Purple Palace, one must temper the divine soul and comprehend the primordial.</p><p></p><p>The most difficult part of this is comprehending the primordial. Throughout history, countless cultivators have been stuck at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the primordial can only be done by oneself; outsiders cannot assist. Even if deities descended to the mortal realm, they could not help.</p><p></p><p>Both are indispensable.</p><p></p><p>If the divine soul is sufficient but comprehension of the primordial is lacking, one cannot enter.</p><p></p><p>If one succeeds in comprehending primordial divine abilities but the divine soul is lacking, one can use Soul Ignition Pills to stimulate the divine soul and still enter Purple Palace."</p><p></p><p>As the pure red masked elder spoke, many cultivators present lowered their heads in agreement, or appeared lost in thought, feeling they had gained much.</p><p></p><p>Especially some independent cultivators, who had never been exposed to such knowledge before.</p><p></p><p>But hearing this, Qi Yuan was greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Not even as good as a hair of Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you said you were 'throwing out a brick to attract jade', I originally thought you were being modest.</p><p></p><p>But you really meant it, you really threw out a brick.</p><p></p><p>I have to say, you're quite honest."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that if they continued exchanging ideas like this, he definitely wouldn't gain anything. Should he... guide them in the right direction?</p><p></p><p>These words immediately drew the attention of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi's eyes widened as she looked at Qi Yuan. She felt this senior... had such a poisonous tongue.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone speak like that?</p><p></p><p>"This senior is a peak Divine Infant, willing to share experiences with us. This is a good thing. Why must fellow Daoist disparage him?" A Divine Infant independent cultivator couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>Frustration welled up in the eyes of the pure red masked Divine Infant cultivator: "Since my words are bricks, does the esteemed one have any jade to offer?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't have any jade to offer, but... your brick is a bad brick.</p><p></p><p>For example, you said using Soul Ignition Pills to enter Purple Palace when the divine soul is insufficient - is this feasible?</p><p></p><p>Well... not to speak in absolutes, but perhaps one in a hundred million might succeed.</p><p></p><p>As for comprehending the primordial, who says others can't help with that?</p><p></p><p>I know many people who were stuck at peak Divine Infant, unable to break through, but entered Purple Palace with the help of others," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>When in the Flowing Wind Realm, he had imparted teachings, helping many powerful beings comprehend primordial divine abilities and enter the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>"Preposterous, nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"Primordial divine abilities are one's own dao, how can others teach them?"</p><p></p><p>"Find such people and bring them here!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words immediately sparked discussion and incomprehension among those present.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a man completely shrouded in a purple robe, upon hearing Qi Yuan's words, suddenly felt his heart skip a beat, as if he had heard something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with an expression of fear and suspicion.</p><p></p><p>PS: The pace has already been sped up a lot, with many setups and side plots cut. This side story will probably end this month, returning to Cang Lan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

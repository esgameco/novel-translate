        <h1>Chapter 145</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man with slanted eyes frowned and said solemnly, "Junior brother, you're not a child anymore. You should prioritize the interests of our sect. The current situation of our sect is not very good. We need to build good relationships widely. The Palace of Light is the hegemon of Cuiyun Continent, with powerful strength. We should befriend talents like Huang Tu - you never know when they might become helpful to our sect."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Master heard this and felt helpless inside, but could only say, "I understand, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud City was located in the southwest region of Cuiyun Continent. </p><p></p><p>In the past, this city was remote and did not belong to any major power.</p><p></p><p>The most famous places in the city were just a pavilion and a tower.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Pavilion and the Soaring Sky Tower.</p><p></p><p>One was a high-class brothel business, the other collected information from all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Now, Cloud City had many more people than before.</p><p></p><p>The location for the Eastern Lands Genius Competition was chosen to be in Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the geniuses from the entire Eastern Lands had gathered in this city now.</p><p></p><p>More geniuses were still arriving successively.</p><p></p><p>This once remote small city had suddenly become the most prosperous city in Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed behind Jiang Ya, casually glancing around, and saw a Divine Infant stage cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the Hundred Countries region, Divine Infant cultivators were very rare.</p><p></p><p>In some small towns, Foundation Establishment cultivators could claim to be kings.</p><p></p><p>But in today's Cloud City, forget about Foundation Establishment, even some Golden Core realm True Persons might be working as greeters at some pill pavilions.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of the Cloud Pavilion, the most famous thing is that Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred charming Golden Core True Persons, wearing see-through gauze, dancing gracefully in the misty pavilions and towers.</p><p></p><p>When night falls, they don't need to light lanterns, but directly summon three hundred golden cores.</p><p></p><p>That scene... alas, unfortunately I have no fortune to witness it." Kang Fulu spoke endlessly in Qi Yuan's ear, with a longing expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this but didn't feel much.</p><p></p><p>Back in No Return City, after his last lecture ended.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Yang Hun specially prepared a grand singing and dancing feast.</p><p></p><p>At that time, one thousand six hundred beautiful female Supreme Beings, dressed in red skirts, graceful and charming, performed a dance.</p><p></p><p>The scene was spectacular, but compared to the three thousand suona bands, it was still slightly lacking.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, another three hundred charming female Supreme Beings performed a dance, but this time it was a private occasion, not public.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Hun didn't know the content of the dance, it was choreographed by those three hundred female Supreme Beings themselves.</p><p></p><p>The dance moves were naturally more seductive and bolder.</p><p></p><p>The audience was only Qi Yuan and Little Jia, and Little Jia watched with great interest.</p><p></p><p>After watching the dance, Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh, no wonder the emperors in ancient Blue Star all liked to make those bootlickers high officials.</p><p></p><p>Which leader, which high official, could resist such temptation?</p><p></p><p>Compared to Golden Core dancers, Qi Yuan felt that Supreme Beings dancing was more interesting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a loud dragon-like roar came.</p><p></p><p>Many people in Cloud City looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw a rabbit carriage appear in the sky, flying over Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>This immortal vehicle was drawn by eighteen cloud rabbits with ancient dragon bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was like a rainbow, galloping like the sea.</p><p></p><p>Looking out, there were a full 54 heads and 144 feet.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, immortal light filled the air and divine sounds descended.</p><p></p><p>Extremely noble.</p><p></p><p>"That's True Person Huang Tu's mount!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually True Person Huang Tu, he's ranked 27th on the Eastern Lands Genius List."</p><p></p><p>"He's the strongest young genius in our Cuiyun Continent. This time, he might have a chance to enter the top 20!"</p><p></p><p>"The lead rabbit of his carriage is a Divine Infant stage giant beast, it's really terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Below, many cultivators exclaimed in admiration, with envious looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the rabbit carriage, Xu Tongchen's gaze suddenly shrank, as if he noticed something.</p><p></p><p>"Tongchen, what's wrong?" Huang Tu opened his eyes and looked at Xu Tongchen. Although his gaze was somewhat restrained, that arrogant aura could not be concealed at all.</p><p></p><p>"No... nothing." Xu Tongchen quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu glanced at Xu Tongchen: "Train hard during this time. I'll need you to work for me in the Eastern Lands Genius Competition."</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu spoke more directly compared to his master.</p><p></p><p>When his master Qian Yuan pressured Xu Yeli, he used soft words.</p><p></p><p>But Huang Tu was too lazy to say that much.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was of noble birth and had strong talent.</p><p></p><p>To him, it was only natural for those peers in Cuiyun Continent to serve him.</p><p></p><p>He was very direct with Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that inviting Xu Tongchen to ride in the same carriage was a great favor from him to Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when Xu Tongchen heard Huang Tu's words, his heart sank, but his expression remained unchanged: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>He had long been dissatisfied with Huang Tu in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But for the sake of his master and the Seven Words Sect, he could only endure this dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he recalled the strange feeling he had just now.</p><p></p><p>Where the rabbit carriage passed, the Solar True Fire in his body leaped.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had seen the real sun.</p><p></p><p>Was it an illusion? Recalling that man's face, Xu Tongchen was filled with doubt and uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why he would have such a feeling.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan watched the cloud carriage fly away and couldn't help but sigh: "As expected of people from big cities, their travel is so classy. </p><p></p><p>Alas, I can only be stronger than him in games. In reality, I'm completely outclassed by him."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya beside him remained calm and unmoved.</p><p></p><p>The rabbit carriage in the sky was nothing to her.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu patted Qi Yuan's shoulder: "Junior brother, what's so interesting about rabbit carriages? How can it compare to the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Kang Fulu's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan originally wanted to use his techniques to show Kang Fulu the dance of three thousand female Supreme Beings, to let him see what taste and class really meant.</p><p></p><p>But on second thought, pearls before swine, so he gave up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly a man with a small mustache came over: "Is this your first time visiting Cloud City?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Kang Fulu looked at this mustached man warily.</p><p></p><p>"I just heard you two discussing the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance, hehe." </p><p></p><p>The mustached man gave a lecherous smile.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to add my communication jade slip?</p><p></p><p>I not only have the Fish Dragon Golden Core Dance, but also various immortal fairy private collections, passionate stolen recordings, holy maiden n*de, forbidden secret techniques, beast girls and fox girls, master on top, and even some young talents.</p><p></p><p>Reasonable prices, honest business, bulk discounts."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was stunned for a moment, his eyes lit up, glanced at Qi Yuan and Jiang Ya beside him, then immediately extinguished the light.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan showed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Is this a porn seller? "Do you really have them?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Seeing a potential business, the mustached man became enthusiastic, "If you want to buy, let's talk in the alley, here ahem..."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan agreed, then looked at Kang Fulu and Jiang Ya, "You two, I'm going to discuss some business, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Yuan left with the mustached man.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu laughed awkwardly: "Our Divine Light Sect still has gentlemen."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya glanced at Qi Yuan's back, her expression calm, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the mustached man into a small alley.</p><p></p><p>The mustached man lifted his clothes, revealing dense jade slips in Qi Yuan's sight.</p><p></p><p>On the jade slips, various texts floated in the air, along with images that seemed hidden in clouds.</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly became extremely obscene.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they had to trade in the alley. If this scene was on the main street, it might be humanely destroyed by some righteous swordsman who couldn't stand it.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, which ones do you want?" The mustached man patted his storage bag proudly.</p><p></p><p>There was more merchandise in the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, do you also help sell on consignment?" Qi Yuan wasn't interested in those goods, he stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Consignment?" The mustached man's enthusiasm diminished, "Young brother, you didn't secretly record something exciting and want me to sell it for you, right? But we don't take ordinary goods."</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed very exciting." Qi Yuan took out his previous recording stone, "I've already come up with a name... </p><p></p><p>Shocking! Seventeen Divine Infant cultivators of the Palace of Light engaged in group debauchery, suffered divine punishment, private video leaked!"</p><p></p><p>"Palace of Light?" The mustached man's heart tightened. He took the projection stone from Qi Yuan's hand and watched it carefully. After watching, he swallowed, "Heavenly thunder? Damn, heavenly thunder is actually striking the Divine Infant cultivators of the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light has done countless evil deeds, isn't it normal to be struck by heavenly thunder? This is iron-clad proof of the Palace of Light's evil deeds!" Qi Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The video had already been edited by him.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, anyone who watched it would think the cultivators of the Palace of Light had committed too many evil deeds and brought divine punishment upon themselves.</p><p></p><p>As for him, the instigator, he was completely innocent.</p><p></p><p>Releasing this video would undoubtedly provide strong evidence for the righteousness of the Blood-robed Sword Saint destroying the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, there must be a just cause.</p><p></p><p>The slogan must be loud!</p><p></p><p>"What, are you afraid?" Qi Yuan said casually when he saw the mustached man not speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, who has my Soaring Sky Tower ever feared? I'll take this business, but about the profit sharing..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want a share, all the income is yours."</p><p></p><p>The mustached man's eyes lit up: "How can I accept that?"</p><p></p><p>This business was indeed risky</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dangerous, but the profit is absolutely high.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant of the Palace of Light, as well as the rare heavenly thunder in the world, are both enough to attract people.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these are genuine goods.</p><p></p><p>Putting them in his inventory would definitely attract quite a few buyers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, many people may also be deceived by the title and find out it's just this after buying it. But that's not his concern anymore.</p><p></p><p>Just ask if the title is true or not? Anyway, this will definitely make a big profit.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a good person, happy to help. If you feel embarrassed, just look at the little sun in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Little sun?" The mustached man was puzzled, but still took a look.</p><p></p><p>When he lowered his head, his eyes showed a confused expression.</p><p></p><p>The alley was empty, with only him there.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Who was I just talking to?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, selling... Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>The mustached man looked excited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, sigh." </p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, Kang Fulu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya had a calm expression: "Alright, let's go to the inn."</p><p></p><p>As if what just happened didn't occur.</p><p></p><p>The group of four came to the inn that Jiang Ya had booked in advance.</p><p></p><p>Though called an inn, it was actually an immortal mountain, with many pavilions and palaces, as well as immortal caves.</p><p></p><p>The caves of Jiang Ya, Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan were adjacent to each other.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya said goodbye to the two and went to her own residence with the old woman.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "Junior brother, just now you... really damaged the image of our Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing... you should first secretly transmit sound, and then add his communication jade slip."</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu said a lot, seeming to be exasperated with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he changed the subject: "Oh right... did you buy the Fish Dragon Golden Pill Dance?</p><p></p><p>Senior brother just entered the Yuan Dan stage, and doesn't know how strong the Golden Core cultivators of Cuiyun Continent really are, wanting to observe a bit."</p><p></p><p>"The price was too expensive, I didn't buy it," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kang Fulu showed a disappointed expression.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, Qi Yuan stretched out his hand, and a jade slip fell into Kang Fulu's hand: "I stole one while he wasn't paying attention."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan still paid for it.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu looked at the jade slip, his eyes shining: "Junior brother, if I achieve great success in the Golden Core stage, it will all be thanks to you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and returned to his own cave.</p><p></p><p>Entering the cave, Qi Yuan casually glanced around: "Sigh, worthy of being in the city."</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave, it was magnificent and splendid.</p><p></p><p>Jade pillows, gold silk blankets, osmanthus fragrance... everything one could want.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened the jade slip of the Divine Flower Association, preparing to contact the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The person with the ID "Spirit Girl" had sent him some messages.</p><p></p><p>It was his junior sister Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, we cultivators should concentrate our essence and energy to achieve great things, and cannot sink into desires!"</p><p></p><p>"Especially those jade slip images, many of them are actually illusions, all deceptive.</p><p></p><p>Watching too many of these fake ones is not good for the body."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this and was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>Did Jiang Ya tell junior sister?</p><p></p><p>Junior sister knows so much.</p><p></p><p>What does she mean? Is she saying that many of the things sold by that mustached man are fake? Is she reminding him? Junior sister is quite nice.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, why don't you show me the real ones?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the Seven-colored Peak, the jade slip hanging at Jiang Lingsu's waist flickered with light.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly took out the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the contents inside, her face turned crimson and she gritted her teeth: "Qi Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan didn't know Jiang Lingsu's reaction.</p><p></p><p>He said in the group: "Rogue Immortal Lord, I've arrived in Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Worthy of being a big city, bustling with activity, truly prosperous."</p><p></p><p>At this time, seeing Qi Yuan's message, the Rogue Immortal Lord had an uneasy and hesitant expression: "Origin Heavenly Lord, I'll be coming in a few more days."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, we'll meet then." Qi Yuan was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"Well... Origin Heavenly Lord, do you want to attend a banquet with me then?" the Rogue Immortal Lord said haltingly.</p><p></p><p>He knew about the sect's predicament and remembered his senior brother's warning.</p><p></p><p>But the Origin Heavenly Lord was after all his good friend, so naturally he couldn't abandon him.</p><p></p><p>"Banquet, what banquet?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's... Huang Tu's banquet, he will invite some geniuses to attend.</p><p></p><p>Origin Heavenly Lord, don't misunderstand, when we attend then, we just need to eat some spirit fruits, no need to mind other people." The Rogue Immortal Lord was very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, it's actually him, I know him, the strongest genius of Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>Today he was riding a rabbit carriage, looking majestic and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord, you really are a big shot, able to invite me to attend such a high-level banquet!</p><p></p><p>Rest assured, I'll still give you face. As long as he doesn't provoke me, I won't be so domineering. After all, he and I... have no grudges, right?" Qi Yuan said casually, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord felt moved.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Heavenly Lord really treats him as a friend.</p><p></p><p>Able to temporarily put aside his grudges with Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I've also arrived in Cloud City. These days, I should continue my hundred-day plan," Qi Yuan said in the city.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord felt quite confused.</p><p></p><p>He really couldn't understand the Origin Heavenly Lord's words.</p><p></p><p>Is he at Foundation Establishment, Yuan Dan, or Purple Palace stage?</p><p></p><p>"Today I've planned another big scheme, brewing for two days, then making a move against the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan exited the group chat.</p><p></p><p>When dawn broke the next day, he seemed to notice something and logged into the Blood Robe Sword God account to enter the forum. He posted a thread.</p><p></p><p>"Palace of Light Rampages Through Hundred Countries, Suffers Heaven's Punishment in Return, I Blood Robe Sword God, Represent Justice to Destroy It!"</p><p></p><p>The title was concise, but the content was extensive.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light has truly committed countless evil deeds. Just arriving in Cuiyun Continent, I bought some jade slips through the Soaring Sky Pavilion, which record the evil deeds of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>They rampaged through a hundred countries, finally incurring heaven's punishment, with heavenly thunder killing over ten divine infants! This is the result of doing too many bad things, incurring heaven's punishment! The Palace of Light's luck has run out, they should be executed!"</p><p></p><p>After posting, Qi Yuan exited the jade slip and continued adapting the techniques his junior sister sent.</p><p></p><p>The path of Yuan Dan, the continuation of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" would be even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's ambitions were great.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to refine all the other stars in that universe into golden pills!</p><p></p><p>A day passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was mentally exhausted: "It's too difficult, the techniques of the Golden Core stage are simply not on the same level as Foundation Establishment!"</p><p></p><p>He stopped adapting techniques and entered the Divine Flower Association forum.</p><p></p><p>He took a look and showed a pleased expression, there were actually nearly a thousand comments.</p><p></p><p>"It seems justice is on my side!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could now stand on the moral high ground and sweep through the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>He carefully read the comments.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect Blood Robe Sword God to also... hehe."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anymore, early in the morning my little brother begged me to buy something, so I bought the latest version of the jade slip to observe, but it's just this... By the way, cultivators from my Imperial Sacred Continent love to watch."</p><p></p><p>"Friend above, aren't you from Cuiyun Continent? Give some keywords!"</p><p></p><p>"Palace of Light Nascent Soul... Soaring Sky Pavilion's hidden pavilion has it, don't go to their main pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"Hidden pavilion? Selling... that!!"</p><p></p><p>The comments were urgent, all kinds of requests.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also some serious comments.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually real heavenly thunder!"</p><p></p><p>"What on earth did the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Palace of Light do to incur heavenly thunder!"</p><p></p><p>"Did you see, something seemed to fall from the sky, and then they suffered heaven's punishment."</p><p></p><p>"Can't see clearly, a layer of Dao techniques was added on top, making it very blurry, but it looks big and round. Based on my years of experience, it should be... breasts."</p><p></p><p>"??"</p><p></p><p>"This falls from the sky, then the Palace of Light suffers heaven's punishment. What utterly unconscionable thing did the Palace of Light do!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they added a layer of Dao techniques to blur that, it's really too cruel and bloody!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He opened the backup video to watch.</p><p></p><p>After watching, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"It was clearly a thrilling, satisfying video, why did adding a mosaic make it erotic?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a bun falling down, and the divine infants of the Palace of Light suffering heaven's punishment.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to expose the bun, so he added a layer of mosaic.</p><p></p><p>As a result... no matter how you look at it, it's breasts.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, anyway justice is on my side now. It's time for me to keep the appointment and meet those Purple Palace cultivators of the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light had set up a formation to challenge him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't back down.</p><p></p><p>Now, justice was on his side, and he had a righteous cause.</p><p></p><p>It was time to meet those old Biden white moonlights.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder young guys all like 80-90 year old rich women."</p><p></p><p>"When these old Bidens kick the bucket, won't all their techniques be mine?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a qualified white moonlight!"</p><p></p><p>"How can young people like Po Lang be considered white moonlights, expel them from my white moonlight ranks!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

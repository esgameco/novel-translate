        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An indiscriminate punch directly fell into the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The speed of this punch was not very fast, but its power was infinite.</p><p></p><p>Many of the Yuan Dan elders of the Fighting God Sect were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Demon! It's definitely a demon!"</p><p></p><p>"He's come to destroy our sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, kill this scoundrel!"</p><p></p><p>The expression of Saint Fighter True Lord was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power on his body poured out as if it cost nothing, and the divine technique Heavenly Lotus surged towards the blood-red sky.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the sky was a mix of red and white.</p><p></p><p>"Those who trespass into the Fighting God Sect shall die!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who slander this god shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The Ten Kills Tyrant Fist didn't follow any logic.</p><p></p><p>This punch had traces of immortal techniques and divine powers, as well as traces of martial arts and skills.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent hidden and concealed by Ning Tao erupted at this moment, condensing into a single punch.</p><p></p><p>This punch was like the queen of an insect colony searching for its kind.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Saint Fighter True Lord's divine technique shattered directly.</p><p></p><p>The powerful killing intent of the Ten Kills Tyrant Fist rushed straight towards his eyes and ears.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he felt the wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves, seeming to see countless piles of white bones and corpses.</p><p></p><p>Saint Fighter True Lord was known for being decisive in killing, but he had never seen such mountains of corpses before.</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed uncontrollably from his ears, mouth, and nostrils.</p><p></p><p>Now he no longer looked like an immortal cultivator, but more like a small mortal old man.</p><p></p><p>His face was full of disbelief and terror.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster are you?!"</p><p></p><p>"I am a god, a great god!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan threw out the red certificate again.</p><p></p><p>Saint Fighter True Lord was confused and powerless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand why such a powerful and mysterious person would tease him with a mortal world certificate. Before he could think more, the terrifying Ten Kills Tyrant Fist directly pierced through his body and rushed towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As the punch landed, a blood shadow appeared, and killing intent boiled.</p><p></p><p>Those elders and stewards in the Fighting God Tower all felt a sense of doomsday approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Those who abuse and kill ten mortals shall die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice came at this time, like the voice of a heavenly god.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, killing intent surged on more than 99% of the elders, stewards, and disciples of the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>Behind them was a small blood curtain.</p><p></p><p>This blood curtain was like a coordinate, attracting the Ten Kills Tyrant Fist.</p><p></p><p>The elders and disciples in the tower had their bodies continuously shattered, like firecrackers.</p><p></p><p>Even if they exhausted all their magical power, they couldn't resist, and could only let this punch annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>Even among the mortals who had not yet entered the sect and came to seek teachers, eight were killed by the Ten Kills Tyrant Fist.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shaken and in chaos again.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the Fighting God Tower became like purgatory, with a layer of dense blood mist rising.</p><p></p><p>Of the disciples and elders of the Fighting God Sect, less than one in a hundred survived.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood under the blood-colored sky curtain, his expression calm, murmuring: "The sects in the game are still a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>Not like the Palace of Light, where I still had to write essays and carefully plan.</p><p></p><p>But the feeling of not liking beef is really not bad."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's eyes scanned the remaining survivors through his mask.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people and even immortal cultivators who were examined by this gaze couldn't help but be startled.</p><p></p><p>The body of the Nascent Soul stage wandering cultivator outside the blood curtain also trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>"What realm is this exactly? Is it Purple Palace? But it doesn't seem like it, this isn't an origin divine technique.</p><p></p><p>But if it's not an origin divine technique, how can it have such power?</p><p></p><p>Saint Fighter True Lord was comparable to late-stage Nascent Soul, yet he couldn't even withstand one punch."</p><p></p><p>His mind was in chaos, shocked, confused, and terrified.</p><p></p><p>The Fighting God Sect, which had been passed down for ten thousand years, was destroyed in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Then the man in the blood robe spoke, his voice calm but with legal authority.</p><p></p><p>"I am a certified god!"</p><p></p><p>"If any more immortal cultivation sects dare to challenge the dignity of gods like the Fighting God Sect, they shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The voice rolled out, entering the ears of tens of thousands of ordinary people present, as well as those wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Nascent Soul wandering cultivator's expression froze, then he muttered bitterly: "Such a domineering god, is he destroying the Fighting God Sect to warn us outsiders?"</p><p></p><p>This Nascent Soul wandering cultivator thought a lot.</p><p></p><p>This "god" should be a native of Gong Xing.</p><p></p><p>After coming out of seclusion, he found that there were many more immortal cultivators on Gong Xing.</p><p></p><p>To ensure his authority and control,</p><p></p><p>He acted boldly, destroying the Fighting God Sect to establish his might.</p><p></p><p>As for the sect's name being inappropriate or "mental illness", those were just excuses.</p><p></p><p>When such a powerful being acts, there must be deep meaning behind it.</p><p></p><p>This was destroying the Fighting God Sect to warn other sects.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we immortal cultivators also need to keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul wandering cultivator took a deep look at this place, then his figure dispersed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, several figures flickered, emitting subtle auras.</p><p></p><p>The leader, completely shrouded in a black robe, made it impossible to see his face.</p><p></p><p>"What do you all think about the destruction of the Fighting God Sect?" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed man spoke, his voice hoarse, as he looked around at the men and women hiding their identities.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were Nascent Soul cultivators from the Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Fighting God Sect alarmed all directions, and they also woke up from their seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"This person is not a cultivator from the Three Realms, he should be a native, and his actions should be to establish authority," said a female Nascent Soul cultivator, her voice calm and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>"To establish authority by destroying a sect, how domineering!"</p><p></p><p>"His strength should be comparable to the Purple Palace realm!"</p><p></p><p>At this, the cultivators present all changed their expressions slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace realm was almost the peak of the lower realms.</p><p></p><p>In general cultivation worlds, reaching Purple Palace meant being able to dominate a realm.</p><p></p><p>Above that was the Yin Spirit realm, which could ascend to the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>The Three Realms were adjacent to each other and interconnected.</p><p></p><p>In recent thousands of years, spiritual energy had been depleted, and Purple Palace cultivators had become legends.</p><p></p><p>Nascent Soul was already the peak.</p><p></p><p>Now, encountering a Purple Palace cultivator, how could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Saint Fighter True Lord died, if he had brought the sect's supreme treasure to this realm, how could he have been killed by a mere Purple Palace cultivator?" A man in green robes spoke, his voice cold and stern.</p><p></p><p>The founders of their sects were all Yin Spirits who had ascended to the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>These founders left behind supreme treasures to protect their sects.</p><p></p><p>So, even facing a Purple Palace cultivator, they still had the power to fight.</p><p></p><p>Facing the fierce person who destroyed the Fighting God Sect, they were afraid, but not too afraid.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what he didn't know was that Saint Fighter True Lord actually had a supreme treasure, but didn't have time to use it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had used it, the outcome couldn't have been changed.</p><p></p><p>"He is after all a living Purple Palace cultivator, we need to be careful and cautious," a female cultivator spoke.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators nodded.</p><p></p><p>"With him here, our plans... may have become more difficult," the leading black-robed man spoke, his voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators fell silent, seeming to be pondering something.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Three Realms coming to Gong Xing were certainly not here to do good deeds and teach immortal techniques.</p><p></p><p>For example, these dozen or so Nascent Soul cultivators present represented ten major sects, and the ancestors of these sects had long been in collusion.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky-Overturning Plan cannot fail, and the new world must appear!" the woman said coldly, her voice carrying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the Three Realms was becoming more and more depleted.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If this continues, it won't be long before even Spirit Infant cultivators can no longer appear.</p><p></p><p>These dozen or so Spirit Infant cultivators deliberated and formulated the Heaven-Overturning Plan to change their fate.</p><p></p><p>Within the Three Realms, there is a vast and spacious secret realm called the Heaven-Overturning Realm.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Heaven-Overturning Plan is to extract all the spiritual energy from the Three Realms... as well as from Arching Star, and pour it into the Heaven-Overturning Realm, thereby creating a world rich in spiritual energy for immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This world would be led by their dozen or so sects.</p><p></p><p>As for the Three Realms and Arching Star, they would be sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>They already have arrangements in place within the Three Realms. Now they only need to perfect the arrangements on Arching Star before implementation.</p><p></p><p>Now that spiritual energy is reviving on Arching Star, the energy here cannot be wasted.</p><p></p><p>"For now, we need to carry out the Heaven-Overturning Plan discreetly, and not provoke him yet."</p><p></p><p>"Agreed, the mission takes priority. Let him be arrogant for a while. </p><p></p><p>After a few hundred years, he will understand how weak and powerless he truly is."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who obstructs the Heaven-Overturning Plan shall be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Infant cultivators present reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>They decided to let Qi Yuan off for now.</p><p></p><p>Once everything was prepared, they would make their move against Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The body of a Purple Palace cultivator should make good fertilizer, able to significantly enrich the spiritual energy of the Heaven-Overturning Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this point, a curvaceous female cultivator spoke up: "The Heavenly Origin Stone of the Heavenly Origin Sect seems to have detected our Heaven-Overturning Plan.</p><p></p><p>Recently, they have been constantly asking the royal family of Arching Star to establish the Reversal of Heavenly Origin Formation, in order to gather more information."</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>The crisis on Arching Star that the Heavenly Origin Sect detected was not the Heaven-Overturning Plan.</p><p></p><p>But she thought it was them.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Origin Sect... is somewhat troublesome. This True Lord has a pawn in the Heavenly Origin Sect who has passed on an important piece of information.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Origin Sect has already communicated with their ancestor in the Upper Realm. That ancestor is quite interested in Arching Star, and will likely descend in about a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"What? A Yin Spirit descending?"</p><p></p><p>Those present felt a heavy weight in their hearts, shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, with their ancestral treasures, dealing with Purple Palace cultivators was no problem.</p><p></p><p>But before a Yin Spirit, all schemes and tricks seemed fragile and laughable.</p><p></p><p>"According to my information, the ancestor of the Heavenly Origin Sect will descend to the lower realm in as little as a hundred years, or at most two hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this information reliable?"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely true, my pawn..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems we must complete the Heaven-Overturning Plan within a hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Fighting God Sect caused an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the old ancestor of the Fighting God Sect had once resisted the Fighting God Tower, shocking the world.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was killed with one punch by a mysterious expert who appeared out of nowhere carrying a certificate of mental illness.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but the entire Fighting God Sect was also brutally exterminated.</p><p></p><p>The world was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The mentally ill, who were already a cut above the rest, became even more superior. Everyone who saw this dared not provoke them.</p><p></p><p>The world was in an uproar, shocked by the destruction of the Fighting God Sect.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, all the people of Arching Star felt the cruelty of the immortal cultivation world, where entire clans could be wiped out at a moment's notice.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the "Spreading Love to the World, Bringing Warmth to Humanity" campaign of the [Grandpa Delivery Network] was in full swing.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood samples were being sent to Tianyue.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also selecting suitable candidates, sending them a grandfather or grandmother.</p><p></p><p>As for those who were not suitable, Qi Yuan was not stingy.</p><p></p><p>He simply recorded voice messages.</p><p></p><p>"Granddaughter, Grandpa is with you."</p><p></p><p>"Grandson, Grandpa is still here."</p><p></p><p>Anyone who visited the Grandpa Delivery Network and sent a blood sample would receive these two recordings on their phone.</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't send different messages based on gender, this was because Qi Yuan didn't assume anyone's gender.</p><p></p><p>What if the guy had a really nice body, soft hands, and was a little femboy?</p><p></p><p>For a year, the [Grandpa Delivery Network] was in full swing, then quickly faded into obscurity.</p><p></p><p>After all, those who wanted to send samples had already done so.</p><p></p><p>Those who didn't want to, Qi Yuan didn't force them.</p><p></p><p>In any case, with so many people, his Spirit Infant would always find grandsons and granddaughters.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the world where that ancestor was, there were still many dead ancestors waiting for him to "revive".</p><p></p><p>He was running a bit short on Spirit Infants.</p><p></p><p>In just a few years, the [Grandpa Delivery Network] disappeared without a trace, gradually forgotten by people.</p><p></p><p>After all, most people only received Qi Yuan's customized voice message and five hundred yuan.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what the Grandpa Delivery Network was actually doing.</p><p></p><p>Those who received a "grandfather" or "grandmother" were overjoyed and kept a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Seasons passed, with begonia rain and pear blossoms whitening year after year, as countless years passed in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>On Arching Star, ordinary people gradually became more accepting of the existence of immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Cultivation Alliance was established, and immortal cultivation academies were built one after another.</p><p></p><p>As for martial arts, they became a niche pursuit.</p><p></p><p>One martial arts gym after another closed down, replaced by small immortal cultivation schools for scattered practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Even though martial artists fell out of favor, martial arts tournaments continued to be held.</p><p></p><p>However, the participants were mostly old men, people left behind by the times.</p><p></p><p>They had no talent for immortal cultivation, and stubbornly held on to the passion of their youth.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts tournament went from niche to niche within niche.</p><p></p><p>Few spectators bought tickets for the finals each time.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts tournament matches were mockingly called "punching the nursing home" by some people.</p><p></p><p>This was because for years, the champion of the martial arts tournament had always been one person.</p><p></p><p>His name was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, the champion of the martial arts tournament, also had a nickname: "The Elderly Killer".</p><p></p><p>As time passed quickly, Qi Yuan's opponents in the martial arts tournament gradually became elderly.</p><p></p><p>Young people had all gone to study immortal cultivation, with no one remaining in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts became a preserve of the elderly.</p><p></p><p>Every martial arts tournament was just Qi Yuan beating up old men or old women.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that Qi Yuan would be the champion.</p><p></p><p>How could those old men and women be a match for Qi Yuan? The martial arts tournament fell into complete obscurity, while the spiritual energy on Arching Star grew more and more abundant.</p><p></p><p>However, undercurrents were also surging stronger.</p><p></p><p>But none of this had anything to do with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because at this time, Qi Yuan was completing a mission in the Death Energy World.</p><p></p><p>In the Death Energy World, Qi Yuan had also made a name for himself, known as the "Bloodclad Demon".</p><p></p><p>Well, it was somewhat similar to his previous title of Bloodclad Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Why was he called the Bloodclad Demon? This was because every time he entered a mission world, he would first be taken away by the mission target, and then start killing demons.</p><p></p><p>He would travel all over the world, killing demons everywhere.</p><p></p><p>This made those who accompanied Qi Yuan on missions both happy and worried.</p><p></p><p>They were happy because they didn't have to do the mission themselves, and could just treat it like a vacation.</p><p></p><p>They were worried because they didn't know how long it would take the Bloodclad Demon to slaughter all the demons in the mission world. They estimated they would have to stay for a long time before they could leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, in one mission world, there were far too many demons, and it took the Bloodclad Demon a full five years of killing to eliminate them all.</p><p></p><p>This also made those people wait for five years.</p><p></p><p>One mission participant even gave birth to a child in the mission world.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the mission world.</p><p></p><p>In a great mountain, the forest was lush, with straight cedar trees, many needle-like leaves hanging down.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a cemetery that seemed to have no visitors.</p><p></p><p>However, this cemetery was very clean, clearly with a caretaker who frequently tidied it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man in a green robe yawned, looking relaxed. He ate a watermelon while muttering softly.</p><p></p><p>"I've been guarding this tomb for three years now, how come no one has come to pay respects?</p><p></p><p>If no one comes to pay respects, how am I supposed to kill their entire family?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

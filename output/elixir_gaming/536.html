        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The rumors about Dingbo State are true after all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Wan looked at the towering figure, her breathing rapid.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, she had heard the news of the Judgment God's revival, but she had only taken it as a piece of interesting gossip.</p><p></p><p>After all, at her age, the Judgment God was really just a legendary story.</p><p></p><p>But now, the terrifying giant over a hundred meters tall appeared, his divine voice booming.</p><p></p><p>She believed it.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, this Judgment God seemed to be the young master who had traveled with her in the carriage before.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, her mind was a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>When she regained her senses, she saw that the bloody scene had disappeared, and only a setting sun was visible in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The carriage had also vanished.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of her vision, there was only a vast desert and a setting sun.</p><p></p><p>The setting sun was infinitely beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, let's go and help the Judgment God finish up, and send these commoners back home!" Li Wan made up her mind.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li paused for a moment, pondering for over a dozen breaths, and finally nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Great Feng.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Pool.</p><p></p><p>The blood was like pool water, the chains swaying and rippling, the roars and angry cries incessant, like terrifying monsters.</p><p></p><p>Within a radius of ten li, apart from the servants, there were almost no people.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two slender figures descended.</p><p></p><p>The man had white hair and white eyebrows, with a sense of Tao and nature about him.</p><p></p><p>The other was a woman, wearing a fiery red long dress, the slit reaching high up to the thigh, as if one could carefully look and catch a glimpse of the scenery.</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to look, for she was one of the top three powerhouses of Great Feng, a divine-level Armament Wielder.</p><p></p><p>The fiery woman looked at the frenzied figure in the blood pool, her expression pensive: "Just a single sword strike, and the Blade Demon has been insane for a century. I wonder how powerful the Judgment God was back then."</p><p></p><p>The white-browed man heard this and a look of trepidation appeared in his eyes: "At the peak of his power, even all of our divine-level Armament Wielders in Great Feng combined would not be his match.</p><p></p><p>He has already refined his own domain and walked his own path."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, his expression became expectant and longing.</p><p></p><p>The divine-level Armament Wielders had the Seven Steps of Heavenly Ascension.</p><p></p><p>Only by condensing a divine domain could one step into the Fourth Step of Heavenly Ascension, entering another realm.</p><p></p><p>But in the two thousand years since the founding of Great Feng, no one had ever stepped into the Fourth Step of Heavenly Ascension.</p><p></p><p>And the Godly Advent, which was merely a divine artifact, was already very close to the Fourth Step of Heavenly Ascension.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the Blade Demon allied with other divine-level Armament Wielders to attack the Godly Advent, and he was struck in the arm by a sword. Although the Blade Demon decisively cut off that arm, the power of the Godly Advent still pierced through his vital channels, constantly consuming him," the white-browed man spoke.</p><p></p><p>Just a single sword strike, and the Blade Demon, who had once terrorized Great Feng as the number one powerhouse, had fallen to this state, becoming a madman.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Great Feng built the Blood Pool to imprison the Blade Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Blade Demon did not eat ordinary food, but drank the blood from the Blood Pool day and night.</p><p></p><p>"Was it... him in Xianle State?" the voluptuous woman asked.</p><p></p><p>The white-browed man was silent for dozens of breaths before slowly saying, "I don't know, but... it should have divine-level combat power."</p><p></p><p>In fact, judging whether the person was the former Judgment God was very simple. They only needed the divine-level Armament Wielders who had seen the Godly Advent to go and take a secret look, and they would know.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine-level Armament Wielders of Great Feng did not dare to go and look, nor did those of the Raksha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"The Blade Demon's past should be enough to test his bottom line," the voluptuous woman said with a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>A talisman appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>This was a veil as thin as cicada wings, a peak-tier divine artifact, only one step away from a true divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Its main function was to bewitch divine-level Armament Wielders.</p><p></p><p>The voluptuous woman could easily manipulate a divine-level Armament Wielder like the Blade Demon, whose mind was shattered and lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Blade Demon, I've come to see you."</p><p></p><p>Wearing the veil, a bewitching light flashed in the woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the blood pool, the one-armed man bound by chains the size of tree trunks roared fiercely, his expression ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? Die, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>He struggled constantly, the blood in the pool churning, the Blade Demon looking like a blood-soaked monster.</p><p></p><p>"I am... your closest friend," the woman's voice was enchanting.</p><p></p><p>The Blade Demon seemed to be affected by the talisman and calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to take revenge?" the woman asked.</p><p></p><p>"Revenge?" The Blade Demon's eyes flashed with light, but then he looked terrified, "No! No! No!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, that previous battle had left a deep shadow in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The chains rolled and the blood splashed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, the Godly Advent is dead, and you're facing one of his successors," the woman tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Successor?" The Blade Demon finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he is now in the Raksha Kingdom territory.</p><p></p><p>The divine-level Armament Wielders of the Raksha Kingdom do not restrict your entry!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sacred Wood Order, the Thorn Blood staff member sent a message.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuyun immediately showed a nervous rabbit-like expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I am the Godly Advent, and I'm just short of some believers. You two, would you like to believe in me?" Qi Yuan did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>To play the role of the Godly Advent, he could be said to be doing his best.</p><p></p><p>Now, even the gods have to send group messages to recruit believers.</p><p></p><p>It's comparable to Qin Shi Huang's level 50 VIP.</p><p></p><p>"The Judgment God is a divine artifact, without self-awareness, how can it be talking to us here?" Jie Wuyun quickly refuted.</p><p></p><p>She naturally did not believe that a person could be a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>"I, Cai Dao, am chatting with you, why can't a divine artifact chat?" Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuyun didn't want to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Thorn Blood staff member continued.</p><p></p><p>"Cai Dao brother, I'll give you a free message, and you owe me a favor."</p><p></p><p>"What message?"</p><p></p><p>Freeloading was one of the few "hobbies" that Qi Yuan liked.</p><p></p><p>"The Blade Demon has departed from Great Feng and is heading to Xianle State to find the Judgment God and fight him."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? The Blade Demon has long been insane. If the Judgment God has truly revived, how would he dare to go find him.</p><p></p><p>And how would the Raksha Kingdom allow an enemy divine-level Armament Wielder to enter?"</p><p></p><p>"It's naturally to deal with the Godly Advent."</p><p></p><p>"But the Blade Demon is crazy, if his beast nature erupts, and he massacres the innocent, how many commoners in the Raksha Kingdom will die in vain?" Jie Wuyun was indignant.</p><p></p><p>"Better the commoners die than us," the Thorn Blood staff member said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuyun fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, she asked, "How do you know so much?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's because... there are also members of the Thorn Blood in Great Feng, a friendly reminder from a divine-level Armament Wielder."</p><p></p><p>A divine-level Armament Wielder? Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Tell this divine-level Armament Wielder to cultivate harder, otherwise... he can't even beat a malnourished child." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuyun didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The vegetable knife is truly a knife demon, crazy and deranged.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Vegetable Knife, I'm becoming more and more interested in your identity," the Thorn Blood staff member was curious.</p><p></p><p>The "Blue Mountain Book" recorded the destruction of the Deity.</p><p></p><p>Later, according to the timeline, during this period, the fragments of the Deity did awaken, but did not cause a major uproar.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the fragments of the Deity briefly appeared and then fell into the Divine Wood Abyss, which was also its birthplace.</p><p></p><p>"Let me give you a friendly reminder, be careful of that extraordinary old emperor of the Rakshasa Kingdom, the Fifth Extraordinary... Over these years, he has received heavenly gifts, and his strength has reached an extremely terrifying level."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly gifts?" Qi Yuan pondered, "Thank you for the information, when I get to the Divine Wood Abyss, I'll treat you to some buns."</p><p></p><p>On the official road, the carriage was still traveling.</p><p></p><p>As this official road approached the Xianlong Prefecture, there were more merchant caravans, making Qi Yuan's carriage less conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the death of the Deity... is quite complex."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The gap between divine-level Armored Warriors is vast.</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's judgment, with the Deity's strength, it would have been difficult for it to be surrounded and killed in the battle at the Fallen Phoenix Slope.</p><p></p><p>"So, could there have been a third-party force involved?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up at the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In order to play the role of the Deity well, he naturally had to figure out the cause of the Deity's death.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, as long as I'm strong enough, I'll just keep killing my way through, the more I kill, the clearer the truth will become, the more I fight, the closer I'll get to the real answer."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>During this period, his public display of divinity has been growing at an extremely fast rate.</p><p></p><p>And through the Deity, he has continuously slaughtered evil spirits and some evil people, also gaining a lot of experience.</p><p></p><p>His level has been constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>But the biggest improvement was the gift he received when the Deity's impersonation reached 50%.</p><p></p><p>[Descend of the Deity].</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, when using this gift, Qi Yuan will gain 90% of the Deity's power, but only for a hundred breaths of time.</p><p></p><p>He can only use it once a day.</p><p></p><p>This is very useful for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He is currently only at level 145, and although the Heaven-Human Unification of a Heaven-level Armored Warrior is useless to him, a Heaven-level is still a Heaven-level, his overall physical fitness is far behind a Divine-level Armored Warrior.</p><p></p><p>But with [Descend of the Deity], everything is different.</p><p></p><p>And... most importantly, he can also merge with Little Marry, using "Comrades-in-Arms", and his level can directly increase by six.</p><p></p><p>In this way, his level will continue to rise.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... he might even be able to unleash a power that surpasses the Three Steps of Stepping on the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, slow down a bit." At this moment, Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>He needs to wait for the Knife Demon to come.</p><p></p><p>This Divine-level Armored Warrior is the true white moonlight, coming all the way from the Great Feng to deliver a head.</p><p></p><p>Love is a mutual pursuit, if he doesn't wait, how will the Knife Demon come? Chen Kang Bao hurriedly nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>On the official road, the old woman's expression was solemn, her gaze fixed on the front.</p><p></p><p>"The Knife Demon, the Great Feng actually let him in, and the Rakshasa Kingdom did not obstruct him either!"</p><p></p><p>The old woman was the vice-president of the Judgment Hall, the brothel woman who once slashed the Third Prince, or the Washing Silk Woman.</p><p></p><p>However, now she can only be considered the Washing Silk Old Woman.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of court will one day perish!" Next to her, a mid-level Armored Warrior of the Judgment Hall spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Washing Silk Old Woman looked at the back of the Knife Demon, her gaze complex and apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Ever since she learned of the news about the Deity, she had rushed to the Dingbo Prefecture, and then came to the Xianle Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even though she was the Deity's most loyal believer, she could not recognize the current Deity.</p><p></p><p>In the end, she could only take a secondary measure, following the Knife Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Knife Demon, due to his insanity, was being led by a death knight who had been forcibly promoted to the Heaven-level, so his speed was not very fast.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the Deity's revival is going... Is he a match for the Knife Demon!" The Washing Silk Old Woman was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, she had encountered a strange person.</p><p></p><p>That strange person had prophesied to her, mentioning that three years later, which is now, the Deity would revive.</p><p></p><p>However, this revival is only a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>Regarding fate, the Washing Silk Old Woman was helpless, but she did not want to follow the original trajectory.</p><p></p><p>She did not hope that this would be the Deity's last battle.</p><p></p><p>She hopes that the Deity can truly and completely revive.</p><p></p><p>But this is just a hope.</p><p></p><p>When the Deity was destroyed, not even a fragment was left behind.</p><p></p><p>The imperial court mobilized the entire country to erase the traces of the Deity's existence.</p><p></p><p>The current Deity, even if revived, is like a candle in the wind, can only illuminate a room, how can it illuminate a country? A Knife Demon, the Deity may have difficulty dealing with.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, this time I absolutely will not allow the Deity to die in front of me!" The Washing Silk Old Woman's aged voice was firm.</p><p></p><p>When the Deity fell back then, she began to cultivate and become an Armored Warrior.</p><p></p><p>Her talent is very high, and she is now a Heaven-level Armored Warrior.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Knife Demon, she is naturally not a match, but... perhaps she can buy the Deity a moment of time and opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But just then, her expression suddenly changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the Knife Demon has accelerated, could it be... the Deity!"</p><p></p><p>She was tense in her heart, without any hesitation, she quickly increased her speed and flew towards the location of the Knife Demon.</p><p></p><p>As a Heaven-level Armored Warrior, her speed is close to the speed of sound, but the distance from the Knife Demon is getting farther and farther.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the Knife Demon has drawn his blade!"</p><p></p><p>The Washing Silk Old Woman was startled.</p><p></p><p>Under the half-crescent moon, a terrifying and ferocious one-armed man was swinging a blade with all his might.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent contained in this blade was enough to shock and move everyone.</p><p></p><p>This blade could split a mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the Deity has not fully revived, how can he withstand such a terrifying blade?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Washing Silk Old Woman's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>In the cold moonlight, a beam of light flashed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This beam of light was a blood-red sword light! The originally terrifying and ferocious Knife Demon, his head and body were separated.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the enemy had not even seen it, only a sword light appeared, and the Knife Demon... was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Deity... slay the Knife Demon with a single sword strike!" The Washing Silk Old Woman's thoughts changed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Just now, she was going to say how the Deity could resist, but immediately it changed to the Deity slaying the Knife Demon with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened too fast, and now she was still in a state of shock.</p><p></p><p>She naturally did not know that at this moment, there were many pairs of eyes staring at the Knife Demon.</p><p></p><p>The result, all were amazed and shocked by this single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The Knife Demon, even if insane, was a Divine-level Armored Warrior.</p><p></p><p>Slain with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>The Deity is stronger than before... On the other side, Qi Yuan felt the influx of a massive amount of experience, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing the Descend of the Deity, and combined with Comrades-in-Arms, this single sword strike even surpassed the peak period of the Deity.</p><p></p><p>Effortlessly slaying the Knife Demon was naturally not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Chen Kang Bao's body was trembling, the trembling amplitude was particularly large: "Young master, you... are invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Even Chen Kang Bao, who was quite foolish, was greatly shocked by this scene.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave him a disdainful look: "Stop shaking, you're shaking too lewdly, someone who doesn't know might think you have something stuffed in your pants."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, young master, how did you know I have a bun stuffed in my pants?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

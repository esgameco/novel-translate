        <h1>Chapter 512</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The massive ship, nearly a hundred meters long, sailed forward, the magical artifacts emitting cicada-like sounds that propelled the giant vessel.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Weiwater, many sinister spirits lurked, but in the face of this mighty ship, none dared to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Tuo stood on the deck, gazing at the surging river waters: "Life... is ever-changing."</p><p></p><p>He now felt that the recent events had been too twisting and extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>First, he had struck it rich and obtained a light saber.</p><p></p><p>Then, he had the misfortune of being extorted twice by the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>The first time, he had managed to avoid the danger, but the second time... he really had no choice but to hand over the silver.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Tuo, do you think we might have a chance to see Miss Floating Cloud at the Artisan Convention this time?" Zhan Wenyu said with a lovestruck expression.</p><p></p><p>Floating Cloud was a renowned beauty on the Hundred Fragrance List and also an exceptionally gifted artisan.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Zhan Wenyu was deeply infatuated with such a woman.</p><p></p><p>"Most of the talented artisans from our Jining Prefecture will be attending the Artisan Convention this time. Floating Cloud, being from Jiangzhou, should also be there," Tuo replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Tuo had hoped that if his light saber had cooled down, he might be able to use it once to slay the Water Lord of Yeshan Lake, thereby earning the gratitude of the Heaven Sect. This would also significantly boost the strength of the Tuo family.</p><p></p><p>Alas, this was just a fantasy, as his light saber had never fully cooled down. Now, he couldn't even activate its glow, let alone summon its power.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Floating Cloud is more beautiful than Shen Lingxuan. The world has hardly seen Shen Lingxuan's face, yet she ranks so highly on the Hundred Fragrance List - her beauty must be truly captivating," Tuo sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, such a rare beauty, yet she has married a waste. What a pity!" Zhan Wenyu said, glancing disdainfully at a figure dozens of meters away on the deck, who was leisurely fishing. "The ship is moving, making a deafening noise, and there are hardly any fish around, yet he dares to fish at this time. How ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>Tuo also looked towards the distant figure.</p><p></p><p>There, a young man was reclining on a chair, peacefully fishing.</p><p></p><p>"Since he has nothing better to do, I'm going to go stir up some trouble for him. Young Master Tuo, would you like to join in the fun?" Zhan Wenyu said.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'd rather not get involved in such frivolous matters. Zhan, you shouldn't offend him recklessly - his wife is a true disciple of the Heaven Sect," Tuo warned.</p><p></p><p>"As a dissolute scion, how can I not offend anyone? And in the Zhan family, I can't cultivate the way of the artisan or become a military commander, so what else can I be but a dissolute scion?" Zhan Wenyu said matter-of-factly, a hint of disappointment in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man nearby, a disciple of the Ancient Thunder Gate, remarked with surprise, "So he is Shen Lingxuan's husband? I never expected Shen Lingxuan's husband to be so unworthy."</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat disappointed, for in two years, the true disciples of the Heaven Sect and the Ancient Thunder Gate would engage in a great battle. He greatly admired his Third Martial Sister, who would face Shen Lingxuan. Since Shen Lingxuan was a true disciple of the Heaven Sect, she must be of extraordinary talent, yet she had married so poorly.</p><p></p><p>"However, it is likely related to Shen Lingxuan's constitution. Rumor has it that she has a Mysterious Yin physique, and if someone could be intimate with her, they might attain the realm of Heaven-Human Unification and have a chance to reach the Heavenly Realm as a military commander," the white-robed man said casually.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Heavenly Realm as a military commander was the most difficult challenge, requiring the comprehension of the Heavens and Earth, to achieve the state of Heaven-Human Unification.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-Human Unification, how arduous it is. In nearly a hundred years, our Ning Country has not produced a single Heavenly Realm military commander. It is said that upon reaching the Heavenly Realm, one might even have the chance to venture beyond the Heavens," the white-robed man said, his eyes filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Heavenly Realm military commander was the lifelong pursuit of all military commanders in Ning Country. Shen Lingxuan's appearance had given many old-timers a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>However, the Shen family was powerful, and with the backing of the Heaven Sect, no one dared to make a move on Shen Lingxuan. Additionally, she had not yet fully matured, and her Mysterious Yin physique was not yet at its peak. To take advantage of her now would be a true waste of a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu, hearing this, felt even more frustrated: "That fellow is so lucky. If he weren't so useless, how could this opportunity have fallen to him?"</p><p></p><p>Tuo smiled: "Why make life harder for the already unfortunate?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if I can't make things difficult for him, should I make things difficult for my elder brother instead?" Zhan Wenyu said, heading towards Qi Yuan's location.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man looked at Tuo: "Do you want to go and watch the commotion? It's quite boring on this ship."</p><p></p><p>Tuo shook his head: "I'm not in the mood."</p><p></p><p>Previously, he would have been interested in the spectacle, but now his mind was occupied by the merchant he had encountered at the ghost market. He had been searching for him, but to no avail. This had left him quite dejected. He knew the merchant could easily change his appearance, making him difficult to find. Only when within three meters could Tuo's magical artifacts detect any trace of him.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhan Wenyu approached Qi Yuan with an aggressive demeanor, intent on living up to his reputation as a dissolute scion.</p><p></p><p>"Fish swimming in the water, whether head or tail, is the Taiji. The fish have their bubbles, round and glossy - is this not the Golden Elixir? So, my dear fish... you are the innate seeds of the Dao," Qi Yuan's voice was faint and ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu's steps faltered, momentarily taken aback. What was this nonsense he was spouting? Zhan Wenyu had intended to retort, but as he drew closer, he glanced down at the ship's underside and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds, even thousands of fish were eagerly following and surrounding him, as if listening to a teacher imparting knowledge to his students.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhan Wenyu momentarily forget his original purpose. And Qi Yuan's voice reached his ears once more.</p><p></p><p>"The great Dao of the world is manifold, and the Dao of this realm is indeed peculiar. Yet, the myriad paths all converge. I have created a technique called the 'Transformation Dragon Technique'..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was ethereal, like the sound of a celestial being. During the time he had spent in this world, Qi Yuan had not merely been killing. After all, he had attained enlightenment before the Wall of Truths and had assimilated countless Daos.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad gates of divergence, he had also gained insights into various primal essences. His vision, knowledge, and intellect had reached a remarkably high level.</p><p></p><p>After staying in the Qingshan Realm for so long, he had now created his own extraordinary Dao. Of course, this path was still not fully mature, filled with obstacles and thorns.</p><p></p><p>Now, as he shared his insights with the river fish, it was a way for him to integrate his own realizations.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the captivated Zhan Wenyu had fallen under his spell, and the fish beneath the ship continued to gather in greater numbers.</p><p></p><p>However, most of the artisans remained in the ship's cabins, cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Way of the Vessel, he did not witness this scene.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had seen it, he would have thought it was a natural phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a crisp voice suddenly woke Zhan Wenyu from his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"What, are you here to bully me?" Qi Yuan lazily stretched and looked at Zhan Wenyu.</p><p></p><p>It's indeed not easy being a son-in-law, just lying there without moving, and someone already wants to step on you.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu was startled, his face showing an embarrassed expression: "Sir... no, no."</p><p></p><p>His attitude towards Qi Yuan had completely changed. At first, he had indeed treated Qi Yuan as a waste.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing Qi Yuan's discourse, he felt something stirring in his heart, feeling that the world had opened a great door for him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here to steal my stuff?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also amazed at his own captivating charm - even as a son-in-law, with the mocking halo above his head, he could still make people submit.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what you just said... why?" Zhan Wenyu solemnly paid his respects and humbly asked for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a dissolute young master, he was not stupid.</p><p></p><p>"The Longevity Dao." Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>The supreme truth Qi Yuan had realized was absolute adaptation.</p><p></p><p>For him, whether it was the martial dao, the immortal dao, or the art of commanding soldiers, the ultimate pursuit was survival and longevity.</p><p></p><p>In this world, a Grade Earth Commanding Soldier was already considered a bigshot, but their lifespan was merely two hundred years, which was truly too short.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Qi Yuan combined his own insights and created the "Transformation Dragon Technique", which could be considered a small experiment.</p><p></p><p>The main function of this technique was to enhance the lifespan of living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Can this truly grant longevity?" Zhan Wenyu hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>Now, when he looked at Qi Yuan, it was as if he was gazing at a transcendent immortal.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of his elder brother, he could only be a dissolute young master or read some biographical novels. He had seen many stories.</p><p></p><p>There were people beyond the heavens, and even more mysterious and extraordinary beings in the heavens beyond the heavens, possessing various special abilities.</p><p></p><p>The existence of Diabolical Spirits was born from the heavens beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>And some legendary heroes had even encountered mysterious visitors from the future, who had even predicted some of the history of the Azure Mountain Realm, all of which were verified, leaving people astonished.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu felt that he might have encountered such an extraordinary encounter.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity is difficult, but if you cultivate it to perfection, you can obtain a lifespan of hundreds or even thousands of years, no problem." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Zhan Wenyu's breathing suddenly became rapid.</p><p></p><p>If he could have a lifespan of hundreds of years, wouldn't he be able to dance in front of his elder brother's grave? "Sir, teach me!" Zhan Wenyu hurriedly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>This left the distant Tu Sangong and the white-robed man dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What is Zhan Wenyu doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't he looking for trouble? How come he's paying respects now?"</p><p></p><p>They were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The two were curious, and ultimately decided to go take a look.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu looked at Qi Yuan with a devout expression.</p><p></p><p>He was not interested in improving his strength. No matter how strong he became, could he defeat his elder brother? Since he couldn't defeat him, he just needed to live longer than him.</p><p></p><p>His elder brother could live for two hundred years, so if he lived for four or five hundred years, that would be a windfall!</p><p></p><p>The discourse Qi Yuan had just delivered was like the melodious sound of immortals, and he had already placed the utmost trust in Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He said as he took out his silver notes: "Sir, teach me!" This was his entire savings, a full eighty thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>As the second young master of the Zhan Family, he was not allowed to cultivate, but he had accumulated a lot of silver.</p><p></p><p>This was also a unique form of subsidy from his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the silver notes and coughed.</p><p></p><p>The nearby Chen Kangbao immediately understood, stepping forward to take the silver notes.</p><p></p><p>"Considering the silver, I'll give you a copy of the 'Transformation Turtle Technique'. If you cultivate it to perfection, you'll have the strength of ten thousand turtles and live for three thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years?" Zhan Wenyu took a sharp intake of breath.</p><p></p><p>Even the legendary gods were said to not be able to live for three thousand years, right? This was not just transforming into a turtle, this was transforming into a god! As for the strength of ten thousand turtles, that might not be enough, but the lifespan was the key point.</p><p></p><p>"Carefully study it, I'll only recite it once. If you don't remember, find Chen Kangbao to repeat it, and he'll charge..."</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred steamed buns!" Chen Kangbao quickly supplemented.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhan Wenyu was even more convinced that Qi Yuan was a high-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Because the actions of high-level experts were often unconventional and carefree, leaving people bewildered.</p><p></p><p>In the biographical novels, Zhan Wenyu had seen a mysterious old gentleman who liked to collect ladies' stockings.</p><p></p><p>The other party might not like silver, but prefer steamed buns instead.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan didn't bother to argue about the steamed buns. "Although the divine turtle lives long..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately fabricated.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had reached the peak of the Purple Palace, and his combat power was comparable to the Great Truths.</p><p></p><p>To take the next step, it was actually quite difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>This required him to comprehend his own Dao, his own divine path.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Qi Yuan's strength was very powerful, but his paths were diverse - the Golden Dan Dao, the Myriad Dao Martial God, and the Immortal Dao, etc.</p><p></p><p>To truly become a divine being and enter the Yin God Realm, Qi Yuan guessed that he needed to clarify his own great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind an extraordinary Dao in this game world could also be considered his own attempt.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu listened attentively, not daring to miss a single word.</p><p></p><p>Even if he remembered it completely, he still decided to use the five hundred steamed buns to have Chen Kangbao repeat it, both to reciprocate and to verify if he had done anything wrong.</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing in this 'Transformation Turtle Technique' is to accumulate abundant blessings and do good deeds, remember that." Qi Yuan instructed further.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Tu Sangong and the white-robed man also approached.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man had a smile on his face: "Young Master Zhan, weren't you here to cause trouble for this son-in-law? How come you're kneeling and worshiping him like a student?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man's smile contained some mocking and puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sangong was also puzzled, but when he got closer to Qi Yuan, his heart suddenly raced.</p><p></p><p>Because his spiritual artifact had turned red again, and this time the redness was ten or even a hundred times stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>He... he... he suddenly had a bold idea in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be... the mysterious bigshot?" </p><p></p><p>His heartbeat was racing frantically. When the mysterious figure had gone to Ninghe County, it was precisely when the Diabolical Spirit incident occurred at the Red Cloud Stronghold. Everything matched up! This was no ordinary son-in-law, this was a domineering and powerful son-in-law! His gaze towards Qi Yuan had changed, becoming respectful and cautious.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu's expression changed slightly: "What nonsense are you spouting, I see the sir as my teacher, how could I bully him?"</p><p></p><p>He secretly glanced at Qi Yuan, afraid of offending him.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man's puzzlement only grew, his heart perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu's change was indeed quite drastic.</p><p></p><p>As for Tu Sangong, he remained silent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan spoke: "I'm the son-in-law, isn't it normal to bully me? Come, quickly bully me, I promise I won't resist, but... you have to be gentle, I'm afraid of pain."</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu: "..."</p><p></p><p>Tu Sangong: "...???"</p><p></p><p>White-robed man: "????"</p><p></p><p>The three of them all had question marks in their hearts, but the meanings were different.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

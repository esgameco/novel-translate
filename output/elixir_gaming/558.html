        <h1>Chapter 558</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Swallowed by the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Lord of the Three Woods had a bitter expression, tinged with a hint of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"How could Wudong have ventured into the depths of the Black Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>If he were to be swallowed by the Black Heavens, there would be nothing he could do.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he summoned stronger experts, they would be unable to rescue Wudong.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Black Heavens, the Radiant Light Patriarch had once said that it was an unconscious cosmic phenomenon, devouring everything it came into contact with.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the Radiant Light Realm had a brilliant presence in the Divine Wood Realm, no Realm Lord dared to descend there. Or rather, they were unable to.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would risk bringing disaster to the Radiant Light Realm as well.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Heavens could also devour Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>If one were to die in the Black Heavens, it would be a futile death.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right... Given Wudong's strength and the time flow in the Divine Wood Realm, even if Wudong had rushed there with all his might, he should not have reached the depths of the Black Heavens yet."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Three Woods discovered something, but he saw that the Lord of Time had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Lord of Time had been cultivating in the mortal realm and rarely awakened, so he did not disturb him further.</p><p></p><p>"Strange... How did Wudong die?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I should ask the Void Paradise?"</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Realm, the Radiant Light faction was powerful, but its distribution was far less extensive than the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>The Void Travelers could be said to be ubiquitous throughout the various domains of the Divine Wood Realm, and they were the best at gathering information.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've finally killed them all."</p><p></p><p>"I almost became a soulless murder machine."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped the slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Qihao and the other ninety-nine Devilish Gods had finally been completely annihilated and extinguished, after an unknown number of deaths.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens are still quite difficult to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Although, due to the existence of the Devilish Source, the Black Heavens and Black Earth were essentially a supreme delicacy for him.</p><p></p><p>This was because Qihao and the others were far weaker than him, and he could easily annihilate them, gaining experience and improving himself.</p><p></p><p>However, if he were to encounter opponents at the Realm Lord level, it would be very difficult to slay them.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Realm Lord-level experts could revive infinitely.</p><p></p><p>"It's remarkable that the Divine Wood Realm has been able to endure for so long."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan imagined what would happen if the Black Heavens and Black Earth were to reach the Immortal Realm, and he reckoned that the Immortal Realm would not be able to withstand them for long either.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens... What exactly are they?" A complex expression flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A cosmic calamity, or a cosmic phenomenon?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his communication talisman flashed with light.</p><p></p><p>A message from the Handsome Immortal arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi Yuan, I've recently taken on a task and will be coming to the Quejin Realm soon.</p><p>As a mighty Realm Lord, you should be able to ensure my safety, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal's words were tinged with playfulness.</p><p>He naturally did not believe that Qi Yuan was truly a Realm Lord, as Realm Lords would have already comprehended the Laws of Time.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with me here, the Quejin Realm will be very safe." Qi Yuan was still quite accommodating towards this tutorial NPC.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Void Space.</p><p></p><p>The tall, slender woman stood with her arms crossed, looking quite heroic and imposing. She looked at the Handsome Immortal and said, "Are you sure your friend can protect us completely?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my friend is extremely powerful. Even Fengti, who possessed nine lives, was slain by him." The Handsome Immortal said confidently, puffing out his chest.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the golden-haired man, Tong Chang, had a look of surprise in his eyes: "So powerful, there is actually such a genius in the Divine Wood Realm."</p><p></p><p>He had heard of the Radiant Light faction's Fengti, who was ranked among the top three in the Radiant Light Realm's Stepping into the Heavens power hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this world to produce such a prodigy." The tall woman murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice in her mind sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I would love to take this talent as a disciple." </p><p></p><p>Of course, she was merely captivated by his talent and had a fondness for cultivating talents, nothing more. Currently, she was busy breaking through to the second layer of the Yang God Realm and had no time to take on a disciple, let alone one from another universe, which would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Handsome Immortal were to tell her about Qi Yuan's nascent comprehension of the Universal Laws, her thoughts might be quite different.</p><p></p><p>"But the Quejin Realm has ninety-nine Devilish Gods, and there is also the existence of Qihao, so we still need to be cautious." The tall woman added.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired man nodded: "Yes, the other Devilish Gods are not a concern, but that Qihao... His uncles are quite numerous, and it's unclear which one is his real father."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the golden-haired man burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>The mystery surrounding Qihao's lineage was often discussed in the Void Paradise's exchange area. He had many uncles, but no father. Those uncles were kind to him, but none were certain if they were Qihao's real father.</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal also laughed: "Can the Black Heavens and Black Earth even have children? How interesting?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough with the idle chatter, the mission is the priority."</p><p></p><p>"Go to these coordinates, my good friend Qi Yuan is there."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The spatial transmission waves rippled, and the three present disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When they reappeared, they were in the Quejin Realm, in a secluded courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal scanned the area and immediately spotted the familiar figure. His eyes shone with delight: "It's been a while, your bearing is still the same. This is Wu Chun, and the golden-haired one is Tong Chang."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang also nodded to Qi Yuan, a sign of recognition.</p><p></p><p>The tall woman, Wu Chun, looked at Qi Yuan with a coquettish smile: "Handsome Immortal, your name should be given to this brother of yours."</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired man Tong Chang also expressed his agreement with a nod.</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged a few casual words, and the atmosphere was relatively amiable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "What kind of task are you here for? If there's anything I can help with, this Quejin Realm... I still have some influence here for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Turning to the task, the Handsome Immortal became more serious: "I'm looking for someone named Guan Ku, he is a member of the Rebel Army."</p><p></p><p>"This Guan Ku is the third leader of the Rebel Army, his identity is shrouded in mystery, and he has never revealed his true self." The tall woman, Wu Chun, supplemented.</p><p></p><p>This mission was of average difficulty, the key was to avoid Qihao and the others and find Guan Ku.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple, just wait a moment." Qi Yuan smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, in the Quejin Realm, all the Rebel Army members and other beings suddenly heard a voice in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Guan Ku?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was perplexed and became wary.</p><p></p><p>In a mountain cave, a man whose body was completely rotten had a look of terror in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is that one... looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, a satisfied expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Go three million miles to the east, and then proceed to... There is a cave, he is there. Do you want me to escort you there?" Qi Yuan revealed Guan Ku's location.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you're so fast?" The Handsome Immortal was somewhat surprised, then he looked at Wu Chun and Tong Chang. "I told you my brother is highly capable! He's been in the Quejin Realm for a few years, and he has everything in this Quejin Realm under his control!"</p><p></p><p>The Handsome Immortal boasted.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang were also surprised, not expecting to find Guan Ku's whereabouts so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Although they were a bit skeptical about the accuracy of the address, this person was the Handsome Immortal's friend, and they couldn't openly doubt him, as that would be disrespectful to the Handsome Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"We have Spirit Travel Talismans, so we can reach Guan Ku's location in a moment. There's no need to trouble Brother Qi Yuan." The golden-haired Tong Chang said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll watch over Guan Ku for you. He won't leave before you arrive," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Tong Chang was a bit confused, but remembering that Xian Ling Yingjun often said strange things, he could understand it.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Movement Symbol was used.</p><p></p><p>The three people at the scene disappeared in a flash of golden light.</p><p></p><p>Tong Chang's face was filled with joy: "If Guan Ku is there, our mission this time will be too simple."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we just need to find him, record the aura of the Anomaly Source on him, and our mission will be completed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you mustn't be greedy, just record the aura of the Anomaly Source, and don't bring the hidden Anomaly Source back."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if we bring the hidden Anomaly Source back, we can't hide it from the scrutiny of the Void Paradise."</p><p></p><p>Their mission this time was related to the mysterious Anomaly Source.</p><p></p><p>If one had to say who had the most Anomaly Source in the Kui Jin Realm, it would undoubtedly be Qi Huang.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't dare to provoke Qi Huang, after all, Qi Huang had many uncles.</p><p></p><p>As for the rebel Guan Ku, due to special reasons, he had obtained a strand of Anomaly Source and was polluted by it.</p><p></p><p>As long as they found this person and recorded the Anomaly Source aura on him, their mission would be completed.</p><p></p><p>"It really is Guan Ku, Qi Yuan didn't lie to us!"</p><p></p><p>In the midst of their conversation, they had already crossed thousands of miles through the Divine Movement Symbol and arrived at the place where Guan Ku was.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Guan Ku was wearing a black robe, completely covered from head to toe, with a rotten back covered in dense boils.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three people, he did not become nervous, but calmly said, "Guan Ku has been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired Tong Chang was surprised: "You knew we were coming?"</p><p></p><p>A bad idea flashed through his mind, but after thinking it through, it didn't seem plausible.</p><p></p><p>"The voice of that gentleman just now sounded in my head, and I knew that someone would come looking for me," Guan Ku said.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what voice?" The tall woman Wu Chun also felt something strange.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired man looked at Guan Ku, his eyes flashing with a sense of vigilance, and he said, "It's not suitable to stay here for long, we'll just record it and leave."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he could smell a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>Now, it's best to just finish the recording and leave.</p><p></p><p>Their recording only required taking out a copper mirror and flashing it at Guan Ku, which was very simple.</p><p></p><p>As long as they took the photo and recorded the aura of the Anomaly Source, they could leave at any time.</p><p></p><p>The others nodded.</p><p></p><p>This matter was strange, so it's best to complete the mission and leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired Tong Chang took out the copper mirror and flashed it at Guan Ku.</p><p></p><p>A special aura permeated, as if recording something.</p><p></p><p>The speed was fast, and the duration was short, but the people present seemed to smell a dangerous aura and wanted to finish quickly.</p><p></p><p>However... at this moment, Guan Ku, who was originally covered in boils, suddenly grinned, his smile chilling.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to really catch some fish, but unfortunately... they're just small fry."</p><p></p><p>As his voice fell, a seemingly ethereal figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>This figure looked ordinary, formless and shapeless, and the few people present changed drastically in expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Shen!" </p><p></p><p>They didn't expect to encounter a Yang Shen in this mission.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, they hurriedly fled back to the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately... it's too late..." The voice of this Yang Shen was particularly chilling.</p><p></p><p>The three people present were horrified to find that the space seemed to be confined, and they couldn't leave at all.</p><p></p><p>"It's a plot!" The golden-haired Tong Chang's face was filled with terror and a hint of anger.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this mission was so simple. That Qi Yuan was obviously in cahoots with this black-robed Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun's eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the strand of divine soul in her mind burst out with terrifying power, sweeping away like autumn wind and falling leaves.</p><p></p><p>This power, if unleashed in the universe, would be enough to make the stars fall.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun and Tong Chang were delighted, not expecting Wu Chun to have such a trump card. Her body actually contained the soul of a Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a mere Yang Shen of the first layer, wanting to break my confinement? Go cultivate for another hundred million years!" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed Yang Shen's eyes flashed with a mocking look, and a strange power burst forth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Yang Shen's soul of the Greater Heavenly Realm was injured, and blood also oozed from the corners of Wu Chun's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"He's a Yang Shen of the second layer, the Attainment Realm!" Wu Chun's expression was bitter, even desperate.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect this mission to encounter a Yang Shen, and moreover, a terrifying existence of the Yang Shen's second layer.</p><p></p><p>Without the Realm Lord, the Yang Shen of the second layer was already the strongest existence in the universe, worthy of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, three little bugs and one big bug... should be enough... to bring some Anomaly Source into the Void Paradise," the black-robed Yang Shen said with a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun and the others were desperate, and they also immediately realized what was going on.</p><p></p><p>This black-robed Yang Shen was obviously using the Anomaly Source as bait, wanting to smuggle the Anomaly Source into the Void Paradise.</p><p></p><p>If the Anomaly Source entered... they didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Zhou Universe would become the second Shen Mu Universe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, now was not the time to think about these things, now the priority was to survive.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to die here, aren't I?" Xian Ling Yingjun's voice was filled with grief, not expecting such a simple mission to end in disaster.</p><p></p><p>"What, you're going to die? Can I eat your share?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice came.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Yingjun was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Qi... Yuan?</p><p></p><p>How did he come here?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he not have the Divine Movement Symbol?</p><p></p><p>Wu Chun and Tong Chang also looked at Qi Yuan, their expressions varying.</p><p></p><p>Especially Tong Chang, he was almost grinding his teeth, because he felt that Qi Yuan was an accomplice of the black-robed Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>But... when Qi Yuan arrived, the black-robed Yang Shen saw that upright figure, and dangerous omens kept rising, his scalp tingling, feeling as if he was being stared at by a terrifying giant.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>This happened so fast that the three people and the Yang Shen present had no time to react.</p><p></p><p>But they saw Qi Yuan stretch out his hand, a look of satisfaction in his eyes: "I've been watching the show for so long, just to cut off your retreat. If you can still leave, where's my face?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice fell, his pure and flawless hand fell.</p><p></p><p>The dissipated form of the black-robed Yang Shen condensed again.</p><p></p><p>Thousand changes, myriad transformations.</p><p></p><p>A turtle!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used his own technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this powerful and terrifying Yang Shen of the second layer was instantly transformed into an overturned turtle.</p><p></p><p>It was lying on its back, struggling constantly, just like a real turtle, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The three people present were horrified, their faces filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying existence of the Yang Shen's second layer... was solved with a single move, turned into a turtle? Wait, what realm was this Qi Yuan in? Xian Ling Yingjun's shock was the greatest. Could it be... that Qi Yuan was truly the Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan patted his hands and looked at the turtle on the ground, his voice calm: "I didn't expect there to be a Gui daring to fish in the Kui Jin Realm, not knowing that... the mantis catches the cicada, while the oriole waits behind."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Qi Yuan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>Could there be another oriole?</p><p></p><p>But his brow didn't twitch, and he let out a sigh of relief, then looked at the few people: "I told you, if I sent you, there wouldn't have been this kind of trouble."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the sect's main hall, Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan walked side by side.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you haven't traveled far from home in so many years. Now suddenly leaving Da Shang to go to Cuiyun Continent, not knowing what lies ahead... and not knowing when we'll be able to return," Kang Fulu sighed, his expression lost.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the bloody war of a hundred nations approaching, Da Shang was in turmoil. </p><p></p><p>The sect leader sending the two of them to participate in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle may have been intended to help them escape this vortex.</p><p></p><p>By relying on the Prodigy Battle to attract the attention of some major sects, joining one of them, and escaping the cage of the hundred nations and Cuiyun Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light has been destroyed. We'll return right after the Prodigy Battle ends, very quickly," Qi Yuan said casually, his expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan so calm, Kang Fulu couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>People are better off being a bit foolish, able to live without worries.</p><p></p><p>Unlike him, who was always anxious even after forming a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, do your best in this Prodigy Battle," Kang Fulu said, a hint of pride flashing in his eyes. "Even though I've formed a first-grade Golden Core, unprecedented in Da Shang's history, I'm still far behind the prodigies of the Eastern Lands."</p><p></p><p>Though Kang Fulu was being modest, he was actually humble-bragging.</p><p></p><p>"Among the top hundred on the Eastern Lands Prodigy Ranking, some have condensed Mysterious-grade or Earth-grade cores, and there are even those who have condensed Heaven-grade cores. It's simply unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at Kang Fulu with a comforting expression: "Senior Brother Kang, don't be discouraged. A first-grade Golden Core is indeed a bit weak, but... in our Divine Light Sect, you're still in the top ten, right?"</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu: "..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to speak. He had come to show off, not to seek comfort.</p><p></p><p>He very much wanted to tell Qi Yuan, do you know how valuable a first-grade Golden Core is in a small place like the Hundred Nations? At this moment, Kang Fulu's eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the head disciple of Ten Thousand Laws Peak, Xu Yiyi, was passing by in front.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu ignored Qi Yuan and flew directly over.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, your Senior Brother has recently obtained a treasure. Would you like to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"What treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"My... first-grade Golden Core!"</p><p></p><p>"Golden Core? Senior Brother, you've formed an Elemental Core?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched this scene from afar and sighed: "It's good that I'm from humble beginnings, but my heart aspires to the stars and sea. A first-grade Golden Core can't dazzle my eyes."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at his own Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, wondering when his Golden Core would be able to devour more planets, large stars, neutron stars and the like.</p><p></p><p>That way, all the stars in the sky, except for those reflecting the gods, would be part of his Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene must be very awe-inspiring, right? He looked at the small sun in the sky and muttered: "It's a pity my Golden Core is too far from me, otherwise I could show it off like Senior Brother Kang Fulu and receive a lot of praise."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it might not be praise.</p><p></p><p>If he brought out his Golden Core, anyone who saw it would probably die.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Palace of Light, Yuan Qian's face looked particularly grim.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly a hundred Divine Infant cultivators, dead in the Hundred Nations? Simply useless!"</p><p></p><p>In recent days, nearly a hundred Divine Infant cultivators sent to the Hundred Nations had been ambushed and killed by powerful experts within two days.</p><p></p><p>The loss of nearly a hundred Divine Infant cultivators was a serious blow even for the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>"The Mad Daoist, the Seven Desires Demon Lord, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint... the people of the Divine Flower Society, how vicious!" Black Rope's body was shrouded in spiritual energy, like a powder keg about to explode. The Divine Infant cultivators present looked at him, afraid he might lash out in anger.</p><p></p><p>"When did our Palace of Light offend so many... 'terrifying' enemies?" Yuan Qian raged.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, people from the Hundred Nations background appeared in the Divine Flower Society targeting them.</p><p></p><p>They all appeared at once, and each one was a prodigy, which was really outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think they might all be one person, playing several roles to ambush us?" the red-bearded elder voiced his speculation.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be," Elder Black Rope's voice was gruff. "The Mad Daoist has a strange treasure shaped like a cleaver. It's with this treasure that he kills Divine Infant cultivators like chickens. The Seven Desires Demon Lord has cultivated some kind of forbidden technique that can summon heavenly lightning to kill enemies. As for the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, needless to say, he controls Origin Divine Abilities and is a Purple Palace Realm powerhouse. These people are all extraordinary, and shouldn't be the same person!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present agreed with Elder Black Rope's words.</p><p></p><p>This time, there were a full ten people who slaughtered the Divine Infant executors of the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Each person had very distinct characteristics, and each was extraordinary, with their own special techniques.</p><p></p><p>This level of extraordinariness, any one of them could be considered a young prodigy.</p><p></p><p>How could they possibly be the same person?</p><p></p><p>"How could such a tiny place as the Hundred Nations produce so many middle-aged prodigies? Clearly, they are all people from the Divine Flower Society!" Yuan Qian stated his judgment.</p><p></p><p>Middle-aged prodigies generally referred to those who were on the previous generation's Prodigy Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Those who attacked the Palace of Light's Divine Infant cultivators all had the strength of middle-aged prodigies.</p><p></p><p>This was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they were all people from the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Flower Society..."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this organization, the executors present exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>This was a very loose but powerful organization.</p><p></p><p>Its headquarters was not in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>If the Divine Flower Society wanted to move against them, it would be somewhat troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qian saw the wariness of the executors below and said, "Rest assured, everyone. Even the Divine Flower Society cannot interfere in the affairs of our Eastern Lands. The Grand Palace Master has already gone to the Imperial Saint Continent to meet with the Eastern Lands Branch Master of the Divine Flower Society to demand an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone present breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Qian continued, "The Mad Daoist, Seven Desires Demon Lord, and others have already been put on our Palace of Light's wanted list. If they dare to set foot in Cuiyun Continent, they will surely die! As for the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, the three of us have already issued a challenge through the Divine Flower Society. If he dares to come, he must die! Before the Blood-Robed Sword Saint falls, there's no need to send executors to the Hundred Nations!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" The executors present breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They were really afraid of being sent to the Hundred Nations now.</p><p></p><p>That would be suicide!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan logged into the Divine Flower Four Emperors chat group, he saw many flattering messages.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, you're truly fierce, killing nearly a hundred Divine Infant cultivators just like that!"</p><p></p><p>"Traveling thousands of miles in one night, truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"We should all aspire to be like this."</p><p></p><p>Seeing these praises, Qi Yuan felt elated but also a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the big shots in the group who can make things happen just by speaking, I'm much weaker!" Thinking of the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman's words about Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, speaking things into existence, and gods falling, Qi Yuan felt that he was actually quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"You're being modest!" Rogue Immortal Venerable, now acting as Qi Yuan's number one fan, said, "Origin Venerable has already started slaughtering in all directions, killing Divine Infant cultivators like dogs, while I still have to go participate in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle. The difference between people is too great."</p><p></p><p>"You're also participating in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"What's this, Origin Venerable, do you also have a descendant participating?" Rogue Immortal Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still young, I haven't even gotten married..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was about to say he wasn't even married yet.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, isn't Little Wife his wife?</p><p></p><p>"I don't even have children yet," he said instead.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to participate in this Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle. Rogue Immortal Venerable, let's meet up then! I haven't met any of the big shots in the group yet!" Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This left Rogue Immortal Venerable a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, aren't you killing Divine Infant cultivators like slaughtering dogs? You already have Origin Divine Abilities, so why are you still participating in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle?"</p><p></p><p>"As a mere Elemental Core cultivator, isn't it reasonable for me to participate in the Eastern Lands Prodigy Battle?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's reasonable, but... what's the deal with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint? Aren't you a Purple Palace Realm powerhouse?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm at the Elemental Core stage."</p><p></p><p>"But you have Origin Divine Abilities and kill Divine Infant cultivators like dogs!"</p><p></p><p>"Is there a rule that Elemental Core cultivators can't have Origin Divine Abilities? Is there a rule that Elemental Core cultivators can't kill Divine Infant cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"...No one made such rules."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I haven't even brought out my Golden Core yet. If I were to bring out my Golden Core, it would scare the Yin spirits to death!" Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Venerable was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Is it my brain that has a problem, or is it Origin Venerable's brain? But Origin Venerable is clearly a Purple Palace Realm powerhouse, and a Purple Palace Realm powerhouse's brain couldn't possibly have a problem. So does that mean... my brain has a problem? Rogue Immortal Venerable felt he needed to find a doctor sister to comfort his fragile mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I'm not in the Eastern Lands now, otherwise I would definitely go when Origin Venerable and Rogue Immortal Venerable meet up," Great Sun Flame Emperor said regretfully, seeming quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, the world is so big, there will always be chances to meet. After all... we're all in the same era. As long as we don't die, there will be opportunities to meet," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"It's just meeting up, why does Origin Venerable make it sound so heavy?" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Just some spring melancholy."</p><p></p><p>Exiting the Divine Flower Society jade slip, Qi Yuan's consciousness once again entered the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a while, he showed a disappointed expression: "Still nothing... no new games?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Flowing Wind Realm, Qi Yuan tried to enter the game jade slip to access new games. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the game jade slip was empty, as if new games had not yet been created.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept through the game jade slip, but did not discover any new games.</p><p></p><p>"Is the game jade slip too big, and my divine sense not enough to find new games?"</p><p></p><p>"Or does it need some medium to trigger?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't enter new games, and temporarily can't return to the Golden Core level.</p><p></p><p>At least there's the Light Palace toy to play with, otherwise life would be too boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>There were four people on the huge spirit ship.</p><p></p><p>They were Qi Yuan, Kang Fulu, Jiang Ya, and the old woman with a divine infant.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya would also be participating in this Eastern Lands Genius Battle.</p><p></p><p>Since they were going the same way, Qi Yuan and Kang Fulu hitched a ride with Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, Jiang Ya's spirit ship flew much faster than ordinary spirit ships.</p><p></p><p>What would normally take half a month to reach Emerald Cloud Continent now only took five or six days.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the huge spirit ship, Qi Yuan looked at the vast desert below with curiosity: "This combination of desert and sea... is really strange."</p><p></p><p>Below the spirit ship was an endless desert, but occasionally seas could be seen.</p><p></p><p>The desert and sea were connected, creating an odd scene.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya, who had her eyes closed, opened them and slowly said: "This strange scenery was... caused by battles between Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>When power exceeds the Purple Palace realm, the battle's might is too great and enters the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm is empty and has nothing, so it won't harm mortals. </p><p></p><p>But... every so often, some products of the Void Realm fall down, forming scenes like this."</p><p></p><p>"What if a Yin God attacks someone in the Purple Palace realm? Would they also enter the Void Realm?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Why would a Yin God need to use power beyond Yin God to kill someone in Purple Palace?" Jiang Ya raised her eyes, which held ambition.</p><p></p><p>That realm was what her master pursued all his life.</p><p></p><p>Once one enters Yin God, they are no longer limited by the world.</p><p></p><p>"What if that Yin God wants to use power beyond Purple Palace?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Then that entire area would be passively drawn into the Void Realm," Jiang Ya patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>Although, for a Yuan Dan cultivator to ask about these things was too early.</p><p></p><p>"Passively?" Qi Yuan's gaze focused, "Is it pulled in by the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>If so, it seems Yin Gods aren't that strong.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya glanced at Qi Yuan, somewhat surprised: "Yin Gods have strong and weak ones, just as Heavenly Daos do.</p><p></p><p>Powerful Yin Gods may be able to break free of this restriction."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan somewhat understood.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what a pity. If I had known earlier, I should have used the Heavenly Dao of the Cang Lan Realm for my Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, not the one from Wangyue Continent. How regrettable!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of Wangyue Continent clearly seemed weaker than that of Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya looked at Qi Yuan but didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>She had long known through Jiang Lingsu that Qi Yuan was a cultivator of the Path of Foolishness, and his mind seemed to have some issues.</p><p></p><p>The spirit ship flew quickly. Jiang Ya didn't speak with Qi Yuan again, fully immersing herself in a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>She frowned, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>The master of Ascending Heaven Pavilion, Old Man Wutian, who was her master,</p><p></p><p>Had left each of his personal disciples a difficult problem.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya's problem was the heaven-grade technique "Heartless Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Her master had said this technique contained several flaws.</p><p></p><p>If she could find the flaws and revise it satisfactorily, she would qualify to enter the Ascending Heaven Tower and complete a great task with her master.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Old Man Wutian had five personal disciples, and only one had completed the test and entered the Ascending Heaven Tower.</p><p></p><p>Since receiving the "Heartless Scripture", Jiang Ya studied it daily, but with little result.</p><p></p><p>So far, she had only found three flaws.</p><p></p><p>As for revising it, that was even further off.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a heaven-grade technique, and one specifically given by Old Man Wutian. It was no ordinary heaven-grade technique.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Ya beside him and seeing her worried expression, couldn't help asking: "Has Senior Sister Jiang encountered some difficulty? Why not discuss it?"</p><p></p><p>According to his junior sister, Jiang Ya was a personal disciple of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion master.</p><p></p><p>Ascending Heaven Pavilion collected all kinds of techniques.</p><p></p><p>And what Qi Yuan lacked most were techniques.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya carried immense wealth, and he couldn't help but be tempted.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan prepared to act as an enthusiastic sycophant.</p><p></p><p>Although sycophants don't get houses, as long as he didn't fawn on just one person, but on all wealthy women in the world, he would be a sea dog.</p><p></p><p>Towards Jiang Ya, Qi Yuan was naturally much more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya opened her eyes again. Her expression looked very gentle, but Qi Yuan still saw the rejection in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter, no need to trouble Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>The test given by her master would be difficult even for a Purple Palace powerhouse to pass.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan came from the Hundred Countries and probably hadn't seen many mystic-grade techniques.</p><p></p><p>With shallow foundations, he likely couldn't even understand the "Heartless Scripture".</p><p></p><p>As for what her sister Jiang Lingsu said about Qi Yuan being skilled at revising techniques, the content of those revisions was hard to describe.</p><p></p><p>She naturally wouldn't seek his help.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>If only all wealthy women were as easy to fawn on as Junior Sister Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>For several days, Qi Yuan was bored.</p><p></p><p>He either secretly looked at the techniques brought by Junior Sister Jiang Lingsu, or persistently slandered the Light Palace on the Divine Flower Society forum.</p><p></p><p>By now, his alt account as the Blood Robed Sword God had become a celebrity on the forum.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he posted, dozens of people would praise him.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel elated, even thinking of abandoning his main account and just being the Blood Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a thought.</p><p></p><p>"Rogue Immortal Lord, I'll arrive at Cloud City in a few days. When will you get there? Let's meet up!" Qi Yuan asked Rogue Immortal Lord in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate I'll arrive later. I have to come with my senior brother," Rogue Immortal Lord said in the group.</p><p></p><p>Where he was wasn't in Emerald Cloud Continent, so it would take longer to get there.</p><p></p><p>"Is your senior brother some great power, some Immortal Lord?" Qi Yuan couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"No," Rogue Immortal Lord quickly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he still can't compare to you, Rogue Immortal Lord." Rogue Immortal Lord had praised him so many times, shouldn't he praise back? This was reciprocity.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise when he bragged in the group later, having no one to flatter him would easily make things awkward.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Thunder Travel Continent of the Eastern Lands, Rogue Immortal Lord sat on an immortal ship.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Origin Heavenly Lord's flattery, he felt very helpless.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a small fry. My senior brother is ranked in the top 300 of the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings. We can't compare."</p><p></p><p>"Top 300? That's too weak, can't compare to a hair on you, Rogue Immortal Lord." With Jiang Ya, ranked 17th on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings beside him, Qi Yuan felt as if he was also ranked 17th and spoke arrogantly, looking down on those below 17.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Rogue Immortal Lord awkwardly replied.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a tall man walked over.</p><p></p><p>The man wore a green robe and had upturned eyes, his looks not very handsome: "Junior brother, we'll reach Emerald Cloud Continent in ten days. Remember to set aside personal grudges. Let's go pay respects to Huang Tu, the genius of the Light Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing his senior brother's words, Rogue Immortal Lord looked hesitant: "Senior brother, I'm a member of the Divine Flower Society. The Divine Flower Society is in conflict with the Light Palace, so I'd better not go."</p><p></p><p>Currently, Origin Heavenly Lord was at war with the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>As one of the Four Emperors of the Divine Flower Society, he couldn't support with combat power, but shouldn't he at least stand united?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The upturned-eyed man snorted coldly, "Junior brother, Emerald Cloud Continent is the Light Palace's home base. How can we not meet the geniuses there when we go? How can we miss such a good opportunity to make connections with geniuses and expand our network?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what major conflict has occurred between the Divine Flower Society and Light Palace? That Blood Robed Sword God, a mere Purple Palace realm provoking the Light Palace, is simply seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Rogue Immortal Lord was quite helpless: "Senior brother, I've already made plans to meet a good friend."</p><p></p><p>The upturned-eyed man's brow twitched hearing this: "That friend of yours, if I remember correctly, isn't even on the main list of the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings, like you."</p><p></p><p>"His strength is enough!" Rogue Immortal Lord defended Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"How about this - when we pay respects to Huang Tu this time, let him come along?" the upturned-eyed man said magnanimously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Rogue Immortal Lord quickly said: "No!"</p><p></p><p>Origin Heavenly Lord and the Light Palace were like fire and water!</p><p></p><p>Who knows what would happen if he went to pay respects to Huang Tu!</p><p></p><p>P.S. There's one more chapter that probably won't be out until 5 or 6 in the morning. Everyone go to sleep soon and read it in the morning!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

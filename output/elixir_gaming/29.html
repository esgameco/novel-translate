        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan returned to the Seven-Colored Peak with a Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit, the Yellow Flower Fruit.</p><p></p><p>He soon arrived back at the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister Jiang Ling Su was cultivating, seemingly at a critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at his junior sister's thatched hut, where white mist was swirling, indicating that she had reached an important stage in her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept past the thatched hut and headed up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a barrier appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was a restriction set up by his master, Ruan Yi Xi, blocking Qi Yuan from ascending the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Open Sesame!" Qi Yuan called out experimentally.</p><p></p><p>But the restriction remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I misunderstood my master's intentions?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>His master had obtained the Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit for him, so how could the intention behind it be unclear?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that he had been too reserved? Seeing this, Qi Yuan cupped the Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit in his hands.</p><p></p><p>He then raised the Yellow Flower Fruit up.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple Qi Yuan has brought a betrothal gift!"</p><p></p><p>The restriction remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up, and at that moment, the clouds in the sky seemed to converge, as if hiding a supreme fierce beast within.</p><p></p><p>A cold wind blew, stinging Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>It took a while for these abnormal phenomena to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wore a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I misunderstood my master's intentions?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it must be that the meaning of the Yellow Flower Fruit is inauspicious, yellow flowers, flowers of death!"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, it's possible that she's already my wife, so why would I need to bring a betrothal gift?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan became excited again.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had clearly seen...</p><p></p><p>[She is called Ruan Yi Xi, who appears to be your beautiful master, but may actually be your wife.]</p><p></p><p>What he had seen with his own eyes could not be false.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, the eyes do not lie, and what the eyes see cannot be photoshopped.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the people of his homeland heard Qi Yuan's words, they might say he was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put down the Yellow Flower Fruit and prepared to return to his own thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Ling Su emerged from the hut, her face bearing a suspicious expression. "Big Brother, did you feel anything unusual just now?"</p><p></p><p>During her cultivation, she had suddenly sensed a shift in the changes of the four seasons.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the fluctuations of a powerful cultivator's emotions had caused a disturbance in the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"It must be the master." Qi Yuan did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"The master?" Jiang Ling Su felt that this was normal. She looked at Qi Yuan, feeling that it was this abnormal elder brother who had somehow offended the master.</p><p></p><p>If it was the master, it was understandable.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's gaze fell on the box in Qi Yuan's hand, and her little nose twitched as she sniffed. "A Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Fruit, the Yellow Flower Fruit?</p><p></p><p>Big Brother, wow, not bad."</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, her elder brother had talent, but his combat abilities were probably lacking.</p><p></p><p>After all, playing games, how could he have the opportunity to improve his practical skills?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked at Jiang Ling Su with a puzzled expression. "You wouldn't happen to be surnamed Zhou, would you?"</p><p></p><p>"???" Jiang Ling Su was bewildered, her elder brother's thought process was strange and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"You know, the one living in Xia Luo's shadow." Qi Yuan tried to recall.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was at a loss for words, she felt that her elder brother had played too many games and could no longer distinguish between games and reality.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, are you going to go stroll with your knife again later?" Jiang Ling Su changed the subject, not wanting to engage in some nonsensical conversation with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Not today." </p><p></p><p>"Eh? Aren't you going every day?"</p><p></p><p>"Today I need to sharpen my knife!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to eat fish."</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother... I don't know why, but the things you say..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I always feel so cold," he said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Light Sect, Zheng Jianghe's face was somewhat pale, indicating that his previous injuries had not yet fully healed.</p><p></p><p>The physician from the Divine Medicine Peak spoke softly, "Your injuries have not yet fully recovered. Are you still going?"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe's face was gloomy as he replied, "As the on-duty disciple of the Golden Light Hall, I must go. Otherwise, if such an incident were to happen again in Rongcheng, how could I continue living in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you are just too unyielding in character," the physician sighed, applying the medicinal liquid he had prepared onto Zheng Jianghe's body.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Jianghe had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage and had not yet cultivated any secret healing techniques. Moreover, he was not adept in wood and water-based Dao techniques, so his healing progress was exceedingly slow.</p><p></p><p>"Today, the Black Mountain Sect has made a move, which shows their arrogance! I heard the elders on the peak discussing that the old demon Black Chicken may have already reached the Divine Infant Realm. That Chu Tianxiong is likely to become even more arrogant. They have chosen to stay overnight in Rongcheng, which is undoubtedly harboring evil intentions!" the physician expressed his concerns for Zheng Jianghe.</p><p></p><p>"I will go, and they will certainly be cautious. Do they really dare to kill me?" Zheng Jianghe said, his eyes filled with a dense killing intent. "The people of the Black Mountain Sect all deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of the Black Mountain Sect's evil deeds. It could be said that not a single disciple in their sect was a good person, as they were all demonic cultivators with blood-stained hands.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, a Foundation Establishment Elder of the Black Mountain Sect had refined a Soul-Summoning Banner, draining the souls of an entire town's inhabitants. Afterward, that Foundation Establishment Elder had the audacity to claim that he had simply given the idle townspeople something to do.</p><p></p><p>These demonic heads had long since lost their humanity.</p><p></p><p>The physician also understood Zheng Jianghe's thoughts, but he still couldn't help but say, "They may not dare to kill you, but they can still harm you. Be careful this time."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Rongcheng.</p><p></p><p>A spacious manor had already been abandoned, with broken windows and shredded red paper cuttings still clinging to them.</p><p></p><p>In the pond within the courtyard, a few fish were swaying their tails, as if waiting to be fed.</p><p></p><p>On the moss-covered marble, there were faint traces of blood.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong stepped into the manor, laughing heartily, "Elder, let's stay here tonight."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch Bai Chicken looked at the manor with a satisfied smile, "Tianxiong, you really know how to handle things. Staying here will certainly vex those hypocritical righteous sects."</p><p></p><p>The other disciples of the Black Mountain Sect then stepped forward and asked, "Tianxiong Executor, what is the significance of us staying here that will upset the Divine Light Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong, upon hearing this, let out a loud laugh, "That's because, half a month ago, the owner of this manor just got married. The bride he married was truly beautiful, even more so than my own Sect Mistress!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Black Mountain Sect disciples' eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"More beautiful than the Sect Mistress? Tianxiong Executor, you are truly blessed!"</p><p></p><p>"I was about to... but unexpectedly, that woman was quite fierce, and she ended up dashing her head against a pillar. See, it's that pillar over there. I spent half an incense stick's worth of time here, and then I slept with her corpse for a night."</p><p></p><p>"Tianxiong Executor, how was the scent of the corpse?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," Chu Tianxiong snorted coldly, "You people, do you all think I'm the kind of lustful and murderous villain? If you view me in that way, you are greatly underestimating me. I did not seize the newlywed bride and kill her family for simple human desires, but to cultivate a certain Dao technique! A person who is controlled by mere desires is not worthy of treading the path of immortality!"</p><p></p><p>The other Black Mountain Sect disciples heard this and expressed their admiration, "Tianxiong Executor speaks well!"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao is supreme!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

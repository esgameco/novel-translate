        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because a sun was eaten, all the people of Canxing felt their bodies grow cold.</p><p></p><p>They looked up, wanting to see that terrifying giant clearly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they couldn't make out the full appearance of that person at all. All they could see was a sea of blood red.</p><p></p><p>That person stood before their eyes, yet they couldn't see the full picture in one glance. How could they fight something so boundless and infinite? The seven satellite moons guarding Canxing, forming the most powerful defensive line in this part of the starry sky, shattered in this moment, like seven broken marbles in a pile of garbage.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord trembled all over. His mind went blank as he stared at that endless, boundless expanse of blood red.</p><p></p><p>Even the Yin Gods of the upper realm probably weren't this powerful, right?</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, you're all so tiny, but how did you get such big guts? How dare you try to stop the martial arts tournament from being held? Who gave you the courage? Those little darlings from the Myriad Demons Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lowered his head, his eyeballs bigger than Canxing itself.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on Canxing held their breath. </p><p></p><p>Even the pet dogs were so frightened they shivered and didn't dare to bark.</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing, a certain pot-bellied man heard this and was so scared he sat right down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>As a high-ranking official, he had to submit some useful suggestions to his superiors every three years. </p><p></p><p>He always just went through the motions, not daring to offend anyone, and casually suggested canceling the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, he had suggested it several times.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups never agreed.</p><p></p><p>Now... he was so scared he wet himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the Black Deer Martial Lord, he was also terrified as he looked at that vast figure.</p><p></p><p>Probably even the true form of a Martial God wasn't this big? The legendary true form of a Martial God was supposedly... only about the size of a sun? But Qi Yuan... swallowed a sun whole!</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you saying anything? Are you feeling guilty?" Qi Yuan was getting a bit angry. "If you don't give me an explanation today, I don't mind being 3.1% full!"</p><p></p><p>Although Canxing was small, 0.1% full was still doable.</p><p></p><p>"Spare us!"</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with us!"</p><p></p><p>"It really wasn't our doing!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know anything!"</p><p></p><p>"Waaah, the Myriad Demons Realm forced us to do it!"</p><p></p><p>Cries rang out across Canxing.</p><p></p><p>Most of the ordinary citizens were so scared they wet themselves, not even knowing what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Most of the nobles knelt and begged for mercy.</p><p></p><p>Those who had advocated for war were even more terrified.</p><p></p><p>As for the demon clans, they were scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you saying anything? Are you planning to resist to the bitter end?" Qi Yuan said, displeased.</p><p></p><p>He was too enormous. </p><p></p><p>The voices of these people on Canxing... well, he couldn't hear them clearly.</p><p></p><p>Unless he listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll give you a taste of my power first! Oh... it'll be you lot!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was all too familiar with the auras of those demon clans from the Myriad Demons Realm.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Flowing Wind Realm, these demon clans had worked with the demoness Shang Yanran to bully Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan hadn't been so clever and smart, working hard and diligently grinding the game, who knows how long it would have taken him to finish the game.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth without limits, by my command, kill!"</p><p></p><p>Simple words, without a single complex character. Even a kindergartener could understand them.</p><p></p><p>But it was these simplest of words that seemed like the truth of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, a mysterious force swept through.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>On Canxing, where were the arrogant and domineering demon clans of the Myriad Demons Realm now?</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Spare us!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to go home!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they regretted their actions to the extreme, and were terrified to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, any of their actions or thoughts were useless at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice seemed to make his words come true.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>A great demon at the Divine Infant level had its body shattered. Even the protective talisman left by its ancestor was gone.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace great demon who had retreated behind the other demons also let out a shrill scream at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Usually, he was the most cautious, retreating at the first sign of trouble.</p><p></p><p>But now, his caution was completely useless in the face of this mighty power.</p><p></p><p>On Canxing, blood flowers exploded one after another, like the most dazzling fireworks in the world.</p><p></p><p>In just one breath, three thousand demons were completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"Now can you give me an answer? Do you still dare to cancel the martial arts tournament?" Qi Yuan said again.</p><p></p><p>His voice rolled like thunder.</p><p></p><p>"We don't dare!"</p><p></p><p>"We really don't dare!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh god, whatever you say goes!"</p><p></p><p>In space, Qi Yuan widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? How did you get so bold?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it that I didn't kill enough?"</p><p></p><p>"Is no one going to speak up?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan only felt the vast universe was silent.</p><p></p><p>The people of Canxing trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>There were those shouting, those holding megaphones, those kneeling and begging for mercy, all kinds.</p><p></p><p>The princess gritted her teeth, her face full of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Such a being was simply incomprehensible, beyond normal understanding.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace great cultivator who had interacted with Gongxing and Qi Yuan before was also extremely anxious now.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot, even if you shout yourselves hoarse, I can't hear you unless I listen carefully."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment. He was too big.</p><p></p><p>These people were too small, their voices couldn't even reach space.</p><p></p><p>He'd have to listen carefully to hear them.</p><p></p><p>But listening carefully... was a bit tiring.</p><p></p><p>So he simply retracted his manifestation, transforming into a young man wearing a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>The sky of Canxing seemed to darken a bit at this moment, the whole world turning blood red.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure also descended onto Canxing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the place where the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord had originally sat.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I'm here. Let's have a good talk."</p><p></p><p>In the palace, everyone heard the familiar voice and couldn't help but turn their gazes to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"God!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh god!"</p><p></p><p>No matter how high their position, no matter how proud they were, these people all knelt down in unison.</p><p></p><p>Only by kneeling could they seem to express their loyalty.</p><p></p><p>The old king prostrated himself on the ground, his voice hoarse: "I signed the war decree. Divine Lord, I should die to atone for my crime. Please spare these innocent subjects!"</p><p></p><p>This king who had been muddle-headed all his life finally made a bold move for once.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a gun and shot himself in the head.</p><p></p><p>The king died, died very crudely.</p><p></p><p>But that was normal. Most people in this world die crudely.</p><p></p><p>The nobles present knelt on the ground, no one daring to say a word, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>"He's dead? Who's in charge here? Someone come forward!" Qi Yuan stood on the throne, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>The princess gritted her teeth at this point, and finally stood up. She had some baby fat, looking like she had a baby face, but her eyes were very resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, this little girl is the eldest princess."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the princess's face.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, baby face.</p><p></p><p>She was also as the legends described - a baby face never appears alone, it's very eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>That's right, she also had white hair.</p><p></p><p>"Are you still going to cancel the martial arts tournament?" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>He had come from far away, crossing time and space from the Origin Land, just for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>"We won't!" The princess nodded vigorously, her gaze lowered, unable to see her own feet.</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare to look directly at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Lord, your will is the will of Canxing. Anyone who goes against your will, within three days, no, within one day, I will definitely have them all cleared out!" The princess said, hunching her body.</p><p></p><p>"What if you're lying to me?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>The princess's body trembled. For the first time, she felt like serving the ruler was like serving a tiger.</p><p></p><p>"This little girl would never dare lie to the Divine Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple. We'll sign a contract. You need to have everyone on Canxing sign their names, agreeing not to cancel the martial arts tournament."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If there's a violation, each person will compensate 100... billion Brilliant Star coins," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to people's promises, he trusted contracts more. </p><p></p><p>Of course, what he trusted most was still his own fists.</p><p></p><p>Without powerful fists, these people might go back on their word and even violate contracts.</p><p></p><p>The baby-faced princess heard this and felt it was hard to understand.</p><p></p><p>But... the person before her was an incomprehensible, majestic being who could swallow stars whole.</p><p></p><p>Whatever he said was the supreme truth of this galaxy.</p><p></p><p>"Your will is the truth of Brilliant Star!" The princess continued to pledge allegiance. "Unconditional support for holding the Arch Star Martial Arts Tournament will be written into the constitution!"</p><p></p><p>After all, with any misstep, Brilliant Star might be swallowed by him.</p><p></p><p>There would be no future for this world then.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, pretty good," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Today's events went quite well.</p><p></p><p>The people of Brilliant Star were quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>They were persuaded without much effort.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the dead demons, Qi Yuan still felt a bit guilty.</p><p></p><p>Although they deserved to die, but...</p><p></p><p>He had thought they were still resisting when he killed them.</p><p></p><p>This was a little awkward.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit hungry," Qi Yuan said remorsefully. He needed to host a banquet for them and eat together to resolve the guilt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The princess's legs suddenly went weak.</p><p></p><p>The kneeling nobles even started crying.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed Purple Mansion cultivator also knelt on the ground, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>They thought Qi Yuan was going to eat Brilliant Star.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the people on the ground with interest and couldn't help but sigh: "The people of Stone Village are really professional at mourning, your crying is too amateurish.</p><p></p><p>Hurry up and prepare a banquet, make it lavish, ten dishes and three soups.</p><p></p><p>So many demons just died, how can we not have a banquet? Oh right, you go prepare first, I'm going to take a look at the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, I want to see for myself who the mastermind is, so heartless and malicious, actually coming up with the most poisonous scheme in all realms - canceling the martial arts tournament, targeting me like this!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only the many kneeling nobles and the baby-faced princess were left behind.</p><p></p><p>Ten dishes... ten planets?</p><p></p><p>And how to make soup? Unfortunately, Qi Yuan had already left, and no one could give her an answer.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Within the Demon Court.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand peaks stood.</p><p></p><p>On each mountain peak, there was at least one Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one mountain peak soared into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Legend had it that this peak could reach the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an angry roar came from the highest peak.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed my son!"</p><p></p><p>An incomparably powerful aura spread from the highest peak.</p><p></p><p>The entire Demon Court shook at this moment, and countless dormant auras in all the mountain peaks awakened.</p><p></p><p>"Demon King, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Did something happen to the young master? Who's so bold!"</p><p></p><p>"Please give the order, Demon King. I shall lead an army to avenge the young master!"</p><p></p><p>"For so many years, only we in the Myriad Demon Realm have caused trouble for others. No one has dared to cause us trouble. This is outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Thousands of Purple Mansion cultivators awoke, standing before the highest peak of the Demon Court like countless stars.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King was a giant python, ten thousand zhang long.</p><p></p><p>When it moved its body, the entire Demon Court shook.</p><p></p><p>"I will swallow it alive!" it roared in extreme anger.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord was its only son.</p><p></p><p>He was also the next heir to the Demon Court.</p><p></p><p>This time, it had sent the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord to Brilliant Star to search for ancestral blood, to train its offspring.</p><p></p><p>But... the soul lamp of the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord had gone out!</p><p></p><p>How could it not be angry?</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord was not only its son, but also favored by a powerful being in the upper realm, taken as a registered disciple.</p><p></p><p>As long as its son ascended to the upper realm one day, he could become that powerful being's disciple.</p><p></p><p>It could also use this connection to climb up to that powerful being.</p><p></p><p>But now its son was dead! How could it not be furious!</p><p></p><p>"Daring to ruin my plans, I will definitely swallow him alive!" The giant python hissed and raged.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sky of the Myriad Demon Realm suddenly turned red.</p><p></p><p>A vast, boundless voice echoed across the sky: "Who wants to swallow me alive?"</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Court, thousands of Purple Mansion cultivators involuntarily looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The ten-thousand-zhang-tall Demon King also looked up.</p><p></p><p>What they saw was a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Its pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>Because it knew that sea of blood was just the tip of the iceberg of an enormous being.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so it's just a paramecium. Quite ambitious, wanting to eat me." </p><p></p><p>The enormous being spoke, its voice calm.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King was now extremely frightened.</p><p></p><p>Because from birth until now, it had never seen such a scene, nor heard of one.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even know if this enormous being was talking to it.</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence..."</p><p></p><p>The Demon King swallowed and prostrated itself on the ground.</p><p></p><p>For such a powerful, enormous being that couldn't even be seen in its entirety, one could only kneel.</p><p></p><p>All the Purple Mansion cultivators knelt on the ground like ants at this moment.</p><p></p><p>However, as the Demon King, it still mustered up courage to speak to that "indescribable" being.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what brings Your Eminence to the Myriad Demon Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"There was a Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord who dared to make Brilliant Star invade Arch Star, thereby implementing the most poisonous scheme in all realms - canceling the martial arts tournament, targeting me.</p><p></p><p>I accidentally killed the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord, so I came to the Myriad Demon Realm to see who the mastermind is, being so vicious as to cancel the martial arts tournament!" Qi Yuan was very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing a paramecium, he was very patient.</p><p></p><p>This time, he also seriously listened to the voice of the beings of this world.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Demon King's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>This person... killed my son? It was terrified to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Especially since it had just said it would swallow the killer alive.</p><p></p><p>How... how could it swallow him?</p><p></p><p>It prostrated on the ground, thoughts racing, and said with difficulty: "We of the Demon Court did not order him to cancel the martial arts tournament."</p><p></p><p>"You mean there's no mastermind, and I overthought it?" Qi Yuan said, displeased.</p><p></p><p>He had always been cautious.</p><p></p><p>Even when killing, he would kill the entire family, to eliminate the root.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Suddenly, the Demon King thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying being had actually been schemed against.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that one from the upper realm? Its son's master? But its son's master... was he this strong?</p><p></p><p>It couldn't even glimpse the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>So it had no idea how strong Yin Spirits were.</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, please wait a moment. This lowly one understands!" The Demon King hurriedly said, "It must be the scheming of Thousand-Eyes' master. This lowly one will lure him down right away. He's in the upper realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Demon King didn't want to die for no reason.</p><p></p><p>It was better to let these two clash.</p><p></p><p>Surely... the big shot from the upper realm should be able to defeat this one, right?</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a hundred breaths to call him down," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" The Demon King bowed its head and quickly flew to the Heaven-Reaching Tower.</p><p></p><p>It lit an incense stick.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Master, my son was cruelly killed by a powerful being. That being is probably targeting you. Please come down to save us.</p><p></p><p>Ancestral Master must be careful, that guy... is quite big."</p><p></p><p>This incense stick couldn't transmit too much information, so it couldn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the upper realm, an old man opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A lower realm being dares to scheme against me?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, quite big? How big? I'd like to see!"</p><p></p><p>P.S. There's one more chapter, around midnight.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Distant Lands.</p><p></p><p>An ancient city in disarray.</p><p></p><p>In the market district, only a few buildings stand, the night shrouded in pitch-black darkness, with few shadows of cultivators visible.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was completely enveloped in the darkness, making his features indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept across the market district as he murmured, "There are too few people in this market district, not like the Sixth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao flourished in the Sixth Heaven, with every market district teeming with people and permeated with immortal qi. This place was gloomy and had long been in decline.</p><p></p><p>The roads in the market district were not clean and tidy.</p><p></p><p>The broken stone slabs were scattered in the muddy ground, and a faint urine stench could be faintly detected.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan stepped into the market district, a ghostly fire flickered in the ominous darkness ahead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a short figure appeared, hunched over like an old crone, her entire body shrouded in a gray robe, her face hidden behind a mask.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, are you also here to strike it rich in the Celestial Treasure Trove?" the gray-robed cultivator asked in a hoarse voice, like the sound of her throat being rubbed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the female cultivator. "I'm going to the Celestial Treasure Trove, not to strike it rich."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, let me advise you, although the Celestial Treasure Trove is full of treasures, it... also harbors countless dangers. Don't die in there and make your loved ones grieve." The gray-robed cultivator spoke ominously, standing beside Qi Yuan like a flickering candle in the wind, making one wonder if she could die at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the warning, but don't worry, even if the Sixth Heaven falls, I won't die." Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"You young man, your hair is not even fully grown, yet your tone is so arrogant. The Celestial Treasure Trove is full of mysteries, with ghostly spirits roaming the skies, seeking to take lives. Don't die in vain there." The gray-robed cultivator spoke gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, who are you calling not fully grown?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but retort. "You little sister, not behaving well, harassing people on the road? Opening your mouth with all that 'not fully grown' nonsense, why don't you take a look and see if your own hair is fully grown?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" The gray-robed cultivator let out a startled cry, "How did you... see through my disguise?"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was no longer hoarse, but clear and crisp like mountain spring water hitting the rocks, clearly very young.</p><p></p><p>The gray robe she wore was a family heirloom treasure, and even the legendary Yang Immortals would find it difficult to see through. </p><p></p><p>Yet, this young cultivator had easily seen through her disguise.</p><p></p><p>How could she not be shocked? Even the legendary Yang Immortal Lords, if they wanted to see through her disguise, her family heirloom treasure would react, and she would know.</p><p></p><p>But just now, her family's secret treasure had no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>How did he do it? To be able to avoid the detection of the family's secret treasure and see her true self, wouldn't he also be able to see her body? </p><p></p><p>As for whether her hair was fully grown or not, wouldn't he also be able to see that? Thinking of this, her face changed drastically, and she quickly covered her body and fled in terror.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched the retreating figure of the gray-robed cultivator, speechless: "How strange, it's just that she's lucky to have encountered me. If it were other great Yang Immortals, that treasure on her body wouldn't have remained with her."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes could see the information gap, so naturally he could see the treasure on that woman's body that concealed her aura, which was a rare and precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yang Immortals might not be able to detect it, but it couldn't escape the eyes of a great Yang Immortal at the Dao of the Highest Realm.</p><p></p><p>If she had encountered a ruthless one, perhaps they would have simply slain her and taken the treasure.</p><p></p><p>If it was someone kind or with a sense of morality, perhaps they would have bought the rare treasure under the guise of a windfall.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>He had his own principles.</p><p></p><p>That woman looked like she hadn't even fully grown up, which didn't fit the standards of his "white moonlight".</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was born with the ability to love, he was not a womanizer who loved anyone. </p><p></p><p>He loved, but it was conditional.</p><p></p><p>It had to be his "white moonlight".</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan sighed softly, "The atmosphere of the cultivation world is really too corrupted, deeply rooted in people's hearts. Seeing this woman, what I thought of was other Yang Immortal Lords killing and robbing her!"</p><p></p><p>Although this was just Qi Yuan's conjecture, it certainly wasn't his own fault.</p><p></p><p>The fault lay with... the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"After I become stronger, I must restore the bright and clear atmosphere of the Sixth Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought to himself as he entered the depths of the market district.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Celestial Treasure Trove was in the depths of the market district, in a rather inconspicuous location.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in a hidden cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The old crone with a decrepit appearance chuckled, "Who bullied our Yun'er?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yun, wearing the gray robe, could not hide her divine and elegant bearing.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Luan, there was a strange man in the market district!" Tian Yun said, both worried and angry, thinking of that black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Treasure Trove is full of rare treasures, and it's normal for cultivators to go there to seek treasures.</p><p></p><p>Yun'er, you're just too kind-hearted, always reminding them... As the saying goes, good words can't persuade a stubborn ghost. If he wants to enter the Celestial Treasure Trove to seek his death, let him go!" </p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan mentioned the Celestial Treasure Trove, and a complex expression flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she and Tian Yun were originally the native inhabitants of the Celestial Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>However, there were thieves who had usurped the Celestial Treasure Trove and made it their own. She had led Tian Yun to leave the Trove, barely preserving their lives.</p><p></p><p>Those thieves were extremely powerful, and their clan was almost completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, those thieves did not dare to enter the Sixth Heaven, otherwise, even hiding here, they would have been hard-pressed to escape death.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Luan, today is different from the past. That man... seemed to have noticed the family heirloom treasure on me!" Tian Yun told Aunt Luan about what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan's expression suddenly changed drastically upon hearing this: "What did you say, he noticed it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the family heirloom treasure was disguised, and normally he shouldn't have been able to see my identity, but he saw through it!" Tian Yun said.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan's expression became grave: "To be able to see through the family heirloom treasure, it must be because he is..."</p><p></p><p>Her expression was filled with fear and deep worry.</p><p></p><p>Definitely a great Dao Immortal!</p><p></p><p>A cultivator of this level, discovering the treasure on Tian Yun, how could they let it go?</p><p></p><p>Now that Tian Yun was still alive, could it be that he wanted to do something big?</p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan stood up, her bosom heaving, and her divine sense constantly swept the surroundings: "Senior, are you here? I can hand over the treasure, please spare our lives!"</p><p></p><p>She spoke loudly and sincerely. </p><p></p><p>If there was such a powerful cultivator lurking around, she wouldn't be able to detect them, and they could instantly slay her.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yun's expression changed drastically, turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>She realized something.</p><p></p><p>However, the surroundings were silent, and there was no one answering her.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan also didn't detect any powerful cultivators in the vicinity.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that she was overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and Aunt Luan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I encountered a senior with the bearing of a gentleman?" Aunt Luan marveled.</p><p></p><p>If it were her, she probably wouldn't be able to suppress the greed in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, she would try to compensate with the excuse of a windfall.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tian Yun's previous embarrassment disappeared, and her resentment towards Qi Yuan dissipated, and she even felt a bit admiring: "It turns out to be a senior with high moral integrity. It's just that... it's just that..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she blushed a little.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that his moral character was intact, even if his private conduct was a bit problematic, it didn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Luan, will this senior be in danger going to the Celestial Treasure Trove?" Tian Yun asked anxiously, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Treasure Trove was where the Holy Light Clan resided.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the Holy Light Clan that almost no Yang Immortals would step into the Celestial Treasure Trove in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Those who went to pick up the windfalls were mostly Yin Immortals and cultivators below.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan's gaze became complex upon hearing this: "If it's an ordinary cultivator who enters the Celestial Treasure Trove, they will most likely not survive.</p><p></p><p>But... since he dares to go in, he must have the confidence.</p><p></p><p>We are weak, so we shouldn't rashly speculate on the thoughts of such a great figure."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yun blinked her eyes: "Does this mean that this senior has a chance to drive away the thieves, or even kill them? Can we go home?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Tian Yun became very excited.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Treasure Trove was her home, and if the thieves were to perish, wouldn't she be able to return home?</p><p></p><p>Aunt Luan shook her head: "The Holy Light Clan is not so easily defeated. That senior may only be able to protect himself in the Celestial Treasure Trove. If he encounters the Holy Light Clan, he may also be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't want to speculate rashly, she couldn't help but guess.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Clan was an almost unsolvable problem in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Their methods were too bizarre, and even those who had mastered the supreme Dao of the Highest Realm would find it difficult to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yun heard this and felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The native inhabitants here are called the Tian Clan?"</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Treasure Trove, Qi Yuan found a suitable spot and lay down leisurely.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few cultivators in this Trove.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually grabbed a few short-sighted ones and asked them a few questions, gaining a deeper understanding of the Celestial Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Treasure Trove, also known as the Celestial Treasure Land, produced some strange and precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>These treasures were called Celestial Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Some were offensive, some were supportive, all kinds of varieties.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors of treasures that could rival Dao Treasures.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's hand was a bell.</p><p></p><p>He obtained it from an elderly young man.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Celestial Treasure Trove, that elderly young man even wanted to charge Qi Yuan a treasure-seeking fee, and when Qi Yuan refused, he became aggressive, only to be taken care of by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This bell was a Celestial Treasure that appeared in the Trove.</p><p></p><p>[Mysterious Jade Bell, a special artifact, forged using the Mysterious Wind Forging Method.</p><p></p><p>According to the instructions... by shaking the bell, the warriors in front may be able to hear the sounds of their hometown.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the bell and shook it according to the instructions written on it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an aged but kind voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ears, as if it had transcended the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>"The third month has arrived, is Qian An well? The family is safe, do not worry, Ling and I have sent the armor we wove at the Bureau of Celestial Artifacts to the frontline... The divination is auspicious, Ling and I look forward to your safe return..."</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Jade Bell was an unopened letter from home.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan could hear it, it meant that Qian An on the frontline had not received the greetings from his hometown.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the past history of the Celestial Treasure Trove, or..." Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Wind Forging Method seems quite interesting, and the time flow in the Celestial Treasure Trove is fast, so I have plenty of time. I'll take a look at these Celestial Treasures every day and learn the forging methods inside, it'll be a good skill to master!"</p><p></p><p>Mastering skills was very important.</p><p></p><p>And these Celestial Treasures were all related to various forging methods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had nothing better to do, so the more skills the better.</p><p></p><p>"But this Trove is still not as good as... the Sixth Heaven, the speed of cultivating the 'Ancestral Blood Technique' has directly slowed down by over a hundred times, I can't even trigger a bug."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pushed these thoughts aside.</p><p></p><p>He changed to a more comfortable position and began to gaze at the distant Myriad Ghost Banners through the cracks.</p><p></p><p>If it were other cultivators, they would not be able to see the Myriad Ghost Banners from such a distance.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was different, his strength was great, his breathing speed was fast, and his vision was also farther.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, information came to his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Myriad Ghost Banners, an offensive Dao Treasure, related to the Ghost Extinguishing Sovereign...]</p><p></p><p>"Again, just useless information, I want vulnerabilities or ways to enter."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and didn't bother looking.</p><p></p><p>On the first day, there was no harvest, which was normal.</p><p></p><p>"But it's fine, there are still these Celestial Treasures, and I'm quite idle, so I can master a skill."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the Celestial Treasures again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a technique called the 'Small Whirlwind Mold Fixing Method' appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Mold Fixing Method, as the name suggests, is to fix the Celestial Treasures, making them more stable.</p><p></p><p>The manufacturing of Celestial Treasures involves complex and intricate processes.</p><p></p><p>Material selection, hammering, forging, mold fixing, pattern engraving... and so on.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and nine months had already gone by.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, not even a day had passed.</p><p></p><p>A happy expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"After so many times of observing the Myriad Ghost Banners, I finally found some vulnerabilities, not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>Of course, relying on just this vulnerability, trying to silently enter the Ghost Barrier, would still not be enough.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan had great ambitions and patience, wanting to see if there was a way not only to sneak into the Myriad Ghost Banners, but also to occupy the illusory banner as his own Imperial Banner.</p><p></p><p>"Today's luck is not bad, I've finally mastered the Mysterious Wind Forging Method... too bad there's no suitable material here, otherwise my skills would definitely shine."</p><p></p><p>"Back on the Blue Star, with this technique, I can make some imitation second-hand mobile phones and sell them on Zhuanzhuan, I'm sure to make a lot of money!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought as he spent his days leisurely in the Celestial Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a young boy came over carrying a bowl of something resembling zongzi.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this is what my mother told me to bring you!" The boy, about twelve or thirteen years old, looked a bit malnourished.</p><p></p><p>This boy was named Shi Pan, and he could be considered a native of the Celestial Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Treasure Trove was plagued by disasters, and there were many refugees living a nomadic life, with no</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The zongzi had a large portion of meat, which looked very fresh, unlike the pre-made ones on the Blue Star, and it didn't use heavy salt and heavy spices to cover up the odor.</p><p></p><p>"All of this is thanks to you, my lord. If it weren't for your deterrence, we would have a hard time..." Stone Plate said, looking at Qi Yuan with some longing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's entire body was shrouded in a black robe, and his face could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>But Stone Plate had great admiration for Qi Yuan, and he also had strange thoughts in his heart, even saying... he hoped the other party would take a liking to him and take him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>That way, he would not have such a miserable life.</p><p></p><p>Maybe, he could even shelter his mother and his relatives.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this is a robe woven by my mother for you... if it doesn't fit, it can be used as a footrest." Thinking of something, Stone Plate handed a robe to Qi Yuan, his expression a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not take the robe.</p><p></p><p>"I appreciate the thought, but I don't need the robe." Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Stone Plate's eyes flashed with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"I'm always straightforward, and I understand your thoughts. I have a partner." Qi Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to dangle the bait and give people hope.</p><p></p><p>The most beautiful one in this refugee gathering place was Stone Plate's mother.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, a powerful cultivator lord would not have taken a liking to her in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Now, these refugees also had thoughts, wanting to use Stone Plate's mother to win over Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although, to outsiders, Stone Plate's mother wanting to flirt with Qi Yuan was just a pipe dream, a delusion.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, he also treated it seriously, directly refusing, rather than dangling it, or being like some mighty divine beings, completely unconcerned with the thoughts of the common mortals.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the disappointment in Stone Plate's eyes grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Plate, you shouldn't want another father, so this is a good thing." Qi Yuan casually comforted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Stone Plate stared at Qi Yuan with his innocent eyes: "If that father is you, I'm willing to have another one!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Qi Yuan couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered Chen Huan, almost wanting to call him his godfather.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm still young, I don't want to be a father." Qi Yuan politely declined.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Stone Plate was completely disappointed, but this emotion came and went quickly: "My lord, tonight is the Ghost Night, the ghosts will patrol the sky, and it's very dangerous outside, even those cultivator lords have to retreat into the wind caves to avoid the edge."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning Ghost Night, Stone Plate had a look of terror on his face.</p><p></p><p>Every Ghost Night, there would be a ghost army patrolling the sky, and then claiming souls.</p><p></p><p>If you don't return to the wind cave in time, you will be hooked by the ghosts and lose your life.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is it tonight? Time really flies." Qi Yuan was not worried, and he was even interested in the ghosts here.</p><p></p><p>"My lord must be careful, the other cultivator lords will also hide in the wind caves tonight, and there are several wind caves nearby." Stone Plate reminded again.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I understand, you all go back and prepare for the wind cave." Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>He definitely won't go to the wind cave.</p><p></p><p>He wants to stay here and watch the ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he won't tell this to Stone Plate.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it will be another sweaty tug-of-war scene.</p><p></p><p>Stone Plate took the robe woven by his mother and slowly left.</p><p></p><p>In this area, only Qi Yuan was left.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to cultivate the forging method."</p><p></p><p>Since he's idle anyway, Qi Yuan continued to cultivate the forging method, or compile the "Qi Yuan Sutra".</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, night fell.</p><p></p><p>This whole area became quiet.</p><p></p><p>It was as if even the sound of insects had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was in a desolate place.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the cool night breeze, Qi Yuan yawned: "This kind of weather is very suitable for sleeping."</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, and a layer of mist rose at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling coldness came.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay on the icy chaise lounge, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a beam of light flashed: "Fellow Daoist, hurry and leave, the ghost patrol is about to begin, quickly go to the wind cave."</p><p></p><p>This cultivator reminded him and then hurriedly ran into the nearest wind cave without any delay.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very calm.</p><p></p><p>His Purple Palace was filled with purple qi and the Underworld, would he be afraid of ghosts?</p><p></p><p>The ghosts should be afraid of him!</p><p></p><p>If they dare to provoke him, he'll just lock them in the Human Emperor Banner and give them a righteous reformation, making them work for him.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>The air around became increasingly pitch-black.</p><p></p><p>The world became even more silent.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, the world was dark, with black smoke everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In the silent night, the steady footsteps tore it apart.</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud, thud! It was as if the souls of hell were marching.</p><p></p><p>These ghosts wore tattered battle armor, which seemed to be stained with blood.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were broken, their eyes lifeless.</p><p></p><p>Aimless, like homeless wandering ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Souls without home..."</p><p></p><p>The low voice sounded desolate and bleak.</p><p></p><p>[The corrupted ancient battlefield ghosts, who died while guarding the border, with the land and rivers broken, their souls have nowhere to return.]</p><p></p><p>This information rushed into Qi Yuan's mind, and he immediately remembered the voice he heard in the Mysterious Jade Qiling.</p><p></p><p>It was a family letter, also sent to the front line.</p><p></p><p>If the two are related, it seems that the soldiers on the front line at that time were defeated, the land and rivers were broken, and everyone was killed.</p><p></p><p>Their souls have nowhere to return, and how could their bodies be buried?</p><p></p><p>"But even if they had won, it seems that they should have died by now."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he saw these ghosts, their eyes also saw him, and a thick killing intent surged from their dull expressions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a disdainful voice came.</p><p></p><p>"The ghost patrol, there is still someone who doesn't know how to die, really looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>Behind the ghost army, there was a luxurious sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>The voice came from within the sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sedan chair: "This Heaven and Earth Anomaly is not your family's, do you have a property certificate? Why can't I stay here?"</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, in this Heaven and Earth Anomaly, our Holy Light Sect is the only king!" The voice from the sedan chair was tyrannical and arrogant, "You actually dare to talk back to me after seeing me, your body and soul shall be the food of these ghost servants!"</p><p></p><p>Following the voice from the sedan chair, the hundreds of ghosts present all walked towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Each ghost emanated a terrifying and eerie sound, making people's hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, even if you are a mythical being, when you encounter my ghost servants, you will still die.</p><p></p><p>Young man, don't meet me in your next life!" The cultivator in the sedan chair said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>These ghost armies, as if controlled, had red light flashing in their eyes as they rushed towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay there motionless, looking at these ghost armies, he suddenly spoke: "I am your supreme commander, how dare you hurt me?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Forget Heart Sutra was activated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began the righteous reformation.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, his voice seemed to have a magical power.</p><p></p><p>The footsteps of these ghost armies paused slightly, and a hint of confusion flashed in the depths of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator in the sedan chair saw this expression and hesitated, quickly saying, "Hurry up and attack, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>He said, taking out a bell and shaking it violently.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of these ghost armies became dull again, forming a formation and rushing towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This momentum could easily crush a mythical being.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Heavenly Position Realm Yang Immortal entered this anomaly, they would have a hard time escaping the slaughter of this ghost army.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator in the sedan chair had a smile on his face. In the Six Realms, he was just an ordinary Purple Palace, of low status.</p><p></p><p>But in this Heaven and Earth Anomaly, those yin gods and even mythical beings that he used to look up to, he could easily slay them.</p><p></p><p>But his smile soon froze.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, a figure in a black robe had appeared in his sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>The black figure was holding a bell, staring at it curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Is it this bell that you use to control them?"</p><p></p><p>The ghost servant's face showed a look of terror: "You... how did you get in!"</p><p></p><p>That was a ghost army, even if a Heavenly Position Realm Yang Immortal entered, they would fall in cultivation and be slaughtered by these ghost armies.</p><p></p><p>But now, the other party had directly avoided the ghost army, how could he not be shocked! "You... can't kill me, I am a Holy Light Sect Holy Envoy, this bell is a gift from the Sect Master, if you take it away, the Sect Master will not let you go! Our Sect Master is from the Holy Light Clan, the terribleness of the Holy Light Clan, you don't need me to tell you more, right?" The ghost servant was afraid, constantly speaking.</p><p></p><p>Only by relying on the Holy Light Sect could he have a glimmer of safety.</p><p></p><p>"I hate it the most when people threaten me, and... don't pretend to be impressive, you'll get struck by lightning."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't hesitate at all, directly reaching out and pressing down.</p><p></p><p>A purple lightning flashed, and this Holy Light Sect Holy Envoy was directly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the bell, looking curious.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the ghost army roared and charged towards him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was calm: "Dare, I am your general, don't you recognize me?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Forget Heart Sutra was activated, and these ghost armies paused again, a hint of confusion flashing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the bell and continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I guarded the border with you all, have you forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was like thunder, echoing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Without the influence of this bell, his Great Forget Heart Sutra quickly took effect.</p><p></p><p>These ghost armies became even more hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued: "Originally, the external enemy attacked, enemies on all sides, in order to let this sky never again obscure our eyes, in order to let this land never again bury our hearts... unfortunately, we lost, it's my fault for letting the people of Jiangdong down!"</p><p></p><p>These ghost armies clearly identified with this, but when they heard the people of Jiangdong, they hesitated again.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's voice was choked, full of emotion, as if he was not acting, and they chose to believe him again in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"But the green mountains do not change, the green waters flow forever, we lost back then, the people died, but the souls are still here, maybe we still have a chance to sweep everything again! I am not only your general, but also your emperor, as long as you pledge allegiance to me again, my subjects will respect me 50 times, I believe that victory will ultimately belong to us!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very enthusiastic in his speech.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was a socially anxious person, and his speaking ability was not as good as a certain someone who knew everything, otherwise he wouldn't have fooled these ghost armies around and around? But fortunately, Qi Yuan had the Great Forget Heart Sutra to support him, which was enough to make these brainless ghosts believe him.</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes of speech, these ghost armies had already believed him, and bowed down to him.</p><p></p><p>"Hail to our Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have really taken Qi Yuan as their emperor! A sharp light flashed in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all know that in order to sweep everything again, you must first enter my Human Emperor Banner!</p><p></p><p>This banner, I have painstakingly created, and I still need your help!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke again, and at the same time, he took out the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>These ghost armies looked at Qi Yuan's Human Emperor Banner with a longing gaze, and a bit more spirituality flashed in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as soon as Qi Yuan gave the order, they would rush into it and fight for him!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very satisfied: "Don't be in a hurry, wait until the locks placed on you by the enemy are broken, then I'll let you enter the banner."</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that these ghost armies had been corrupted.</p><p></p><p>The corruptor was most likely that powerful expert from the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>He used the bell to control these ghost armies, seemingly for his own sinister purpose.</p><p></p><p>Before removing that corruption, he wouldn't let these ghost armies enter his Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>What if they polluted his Human Emperor Banner?</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, you've finally found the right person.</p><p></p><p>You should know that in this world, good positions are like AIDS, there are three ways of transmission, namely mother-to-child transmission, blood transmission, and sexual transmission... oh no, if you're capable and lucky, it's different.</p><p></p><p>But you... have all become ghosts, your luck must not be very good, and your abilities are also average."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, don't be in a hurry, I know you're eager to counterattack the enemy, but as the saying goes, to do a job well, one must first sharpen the tools, if you're not strong, how can you defeat the enemy?</p><p></p><p>I have a very awesome military training method here, called the 36th Set of Broadcast Calisthenics, tomorrow I'll lead you to practice together!"</p><p></p><p>"First, go find your brothers!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, these ghost armies immediately dispersed to find the location of Qi Yuan's ghost armies.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so smart, having so many people working for me, my Human Emperor Banner... my strength is skyrocketing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very happy.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to have such an encounter here.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if there were enough yin gods here, and whether he could practice his Human Emperor Banner into an offensive spiritual treasure.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the wind cave.</p><p></p><p>The villagers were silent, some of them afraid.</p><p></p><p>The faint candlelight flickered, looking quite frightening.</p><p></p><p>Stone Plate huddled closely to his mother, his heart in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Outside, it seemed that the roars of the ghosts could be heard, enough to make people fear.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, my grandfather said that the ghost patrol in the past was to protect us, to sweep away the evil spirits, I don't know when they became harbingers of death." An old man sighed, his voice wistful, as if reminiscing the past.</p><p></p><p>The other villagers nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The ghost patrol used to be a good thing for the original inhabitants of the Heaven and Earth Anomaly, a great and solemn sacrificial day, but now it has become a day of doom.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Stone Plate thought of something, looking at the distant cultivator, and gathered the courage to ask, "My lord, have you seen a cultivator in a black robe outside, has he gone to... the wind caves in other places?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

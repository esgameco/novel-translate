        <h1>Chapter 403</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This talent, if spoken about, seemed to produce some mysterious effects.</p><p></p><p>Unknown world.</p><p></p><p>Endless fallen trees, giant snakes flicking their tongues, flickering light.</p><p></p><p>The bitterly cold wind pierced into the body of the old man in animal skins like knives and swords, making him shiver.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a divine sound seemed to reach his ears. He hurriedly knelt down devoutly, his head thumping loudly on the ground as he kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>He babbled on incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, all of a sudden, a flash of inspiration struck the old man in animal skins, as if he had discovered something.</p><p></p><p>"Poor... money..."</p><p></p><p>These two syllables came out of his mouth, then he knelt down again, his expression ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>He had a great plan in mind - he would create an object called money based on the divine instructions.</p><p></p><p>In the underworld, Qi Yuan was quite bored.</p><p></p><p>"It's too uninteresting to just treat it as a wishing tree, without even any feedback."</p><p></p><p>He stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something: "Why don't I do an experiment?"</p><p></p><p>Having regained the energy of the Strange Painter, he walked out of the underworld and returned to the Jiang family base in Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>His little junior sister Jiang Lingsu was now in her room, with the lamp still lit.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes and began to activate the ability of his ears.</p><p></p><p>He listened to see if there were any strange sounds nearby, and if there were conversations, what interesting things might happen.</p><p></p><p>"If only I could become a great expert like the Blood Robe Sword Saint, my mother-in-law wouldn't look down on me!"</p><p></p><p>"When the sky falls, the tall ones will prop it up. What does it matter to me if the cultivation method is poisonous?"</p><p></p><p>"Steamed buns are so delicious!"</p><p></p><p>"I wish I had a considerate, devoted Dao partner who wouldn't betray me and could share weal and woe with me. Oh heavens, please grant me a Dao partner!"</p><p></p><p>These murmurs fell into Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze immediately focused on the cultivator who wanted a Dao partner.</p><p></p><p>It was a homebody cultivator, with dust on his blue robe so thick it was almost crusted over. He probably hadn't moved for many years, just sitting there lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you some good luck, may you soon embrace your Dao partner," Qi Yuan thought, and said to that homebody cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan had reached the Purple Palace realm, plus he had the power of the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't truly make things happen just by speaking, he could easily make slight changes to someone's luck with his words.</p><p></p><p>Since he had heard it, there must be a connection, so he casually gave some good luck as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>As his voice sounded, the homebody cultivator in the cave dwelling suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a shocked and fearful expression: "Who's there? Which senior is passing by and joking with this junior?"</p><p></p><p>He was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>If he had accidentally spoken out loud or transmitted a message that was intercepted and heard by a senior, that would be one thing.</p><p></p><p>But he had just been thinking to himself, producing thoughts without speaking them out loud, yet... even this could be heard by someone? He tensed up, paying attention to his surroundings, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that voice just now was an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>The homebody cultivator was unsure.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, suddenly, the space rippled and a shadowy figure appeared from the void, landing on his meditation mat.</p><p></p><p>The homebody cultivator was stunned. He looked at that strangely shaped object.</p><p></p><p>"A cup?"</p><p></p><p>When he saw the instructions for use on it, his face turned bright red.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Dao partner?"</p><p></p><p>He held the cup in his hand, his expression very complicated.</p><p></p><p>There was fear, helplessness, and confusion.</p><p></p><p>The helplessness was because his casual wish seemed to have been heard by some entity and responded to, but the result of the response was somewhat strange compared to what he had asked for.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my mumblings were heard by some extraterrestrial demon?" </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, cold sweat broke out on the homebody cultivator's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan's eyes also showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>The image of a homebody cultivator hugging a certain cup was really bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"So, does this mean I'm basically like a god of wealth distribution now?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that I would grant him the most badass Dao partner in the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>A badass cultivator, using a badass Dao partner, living a badass life!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, contemplating himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, it would be too much of a loss to always give away wealth without gaining anything in return.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to knock out that homebody cultivator and snatch the cup away.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had given something, but what had the homebody cultivator given?</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... my speech is clearer, and my ears are sharper."</p><p></p><p>In the hundred breaths of time, he had thoroughly examined himself and found only these changes so far.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there might be deeper changes that he was currently too weak to discover.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only at the Purple Palace realm now, a small newcomer in the world of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, he could occupy a mountaintop and be a big shot, but in the upper realms, it seemed he could also be a mountain lord.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan was lost in thought, suddenly a voice reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this time I've snuck over here, let's see where you run to, you brat. How dare you lead my daughter astray, I'll break your legs."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This voice was clearly Jiang Ruhua's!</p><p></p><p>He sensed for a moment and instantly discovered that Jiang Ruhua was coming in the direction of Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, Qi Yuan rushed into his junior sister Jiang Lingsu's room and grabbed her wrist.</p><p></p><p>After all, judging by Jiang Ruhua's appearance, he was hiding various talismans and formation disks on his body, clearly very confident in capturing Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... hey... Senior Brother, what are you doing!" Jiang Lingsu's jade-like nose exhaled hot breath, her almond eyes wide open, looking very anxious.</p><p></p><p>One of her hands was grabbed by Qi Yuan, while the other was holding the edge of a flesh-colored stocking as thin as a cicada's wing, seemingly in the middle of changing stockings.</p><p></p><p>Her white and delicate little foot was stepping into the bottom of the stocking, her slender calf tightly fitting, the skin as white as jade, complementing each other.</p><p></p><p>The delicate jade-like skin of her thighs was exposed to the air, seemingly outlined by the stockings, appearing tight, plump and fleshy.</p><p></p><p>Under the lamplight, a white line could be faintly seen on the stocking from the knee to the foot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced, not daring to look improperly, and moved his gaze upward. Her buttocks were like half-moons, hidden in misty clouds. Alright, that was even more improper.</p><p></p><p>Looking further up - alright, that was far too improper.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight tonight was truly big, white and round.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recited Buddhist scriptures in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form, where there is emptiness there is form..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, why are you so flustered?" Jiang Lingsu's pretty face was flushed red, "I was changing into the clothes you gave me!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly put on your clothes, your father is coming to kill us, he's almost here!" Qi Yuan let go of her hand, allowing Jiang Lingsu to cover up her spring scenery.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Jiang Lingsu's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>If her father discovered that her senior brother was in her room now, who knows what would happen.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, she quickly put on her clothes with rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, let's run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, we need to run far away!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan decided to take his junior sister to the Original God Sharing Association, as well as the Phoenix Sky Domain branch of the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>Neither was in the Eastern Lands. He didn't believe his junior sister's father could run that far.</p><p></p><p>Might as well call him Jiang Run-Run.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour later, an extremely angry voice rang out in Cloud Sky City.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you little..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Child, you can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>Evidently, Jiang Ruhua had found another direction and continued the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Strong cultivators gathered at the Original God Sharing Conference.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that shadow clones of Yin Gods from 90% of the major forces in the Cang Lan Realm were present.</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, these Yin Gods emanated various terrifying auras. Even though they were intentionally lying low, when gathered together it was still extremely frightening.</p><p></p><p>A man in white robes squinted his eyes, holding an empty fish basket in his hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable White Fish, weren't you in the Central Heavenly Region? To arrive here in person in just half a month... It seems you've been interested in this Blood Robe Sword God for quite some time."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was an elderly man with black hair tied up and a missing left ear. </p><p></p><p>This elder was named Great Venerable Left Ear, a famous independent cultivator in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"As the ruler of the Central Region, is it not appropriate to meet the Blood Robe Sword God and discuss the Great Calamity?" Great Venerable White Fish was the strongest in the Central Heavenly Region, and also the one closest to the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he was publicly recognized as the number one figure in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe Sword God has some strength. Being able to destroy Dark Sun and the Divine Flower Association, he likely already possesses mythical combat power. This level of strength is enough to look down upon heaven and earth, but to face the Great Calamity... it's difficult," one Great Venerable spoke up. He had attained the Dao of the Yellow Ox.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword God has invited us here this time. What do you all think - should we unite to face the Great Calamity together, or..." a cultivator with shifty eyes said, his gaze carrying a mocking look.</p><p></p><p>"What does Great Venerable Hunqiong think?" Great Venerable White Fish tossed the question to the shifty-eyed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators all looked at Great Venerable Hunqiong with wariness in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Some Great Venerables had pained expressions as they sent mental messages to their friends.</p><p></p><p>"Things are accomplished in secrecy, but this Blood Robe Sword God is too flamboyant. He hasn't even made a move against the Great Calamity yet, but he's already announcing it to the world. Inviting fellow Daoists is one thing, but how could he even invite a traitor like Great Venerable Hunqiong?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this Great Venerable Hunqiong had long ago submitted to the Great Calamity, becoming its pawn.</p><p></p><p>Now, his shadow clone projection had arrived without any fear.</p><p></p><p>"I just feel that this Blood Robe Sword God is too young. How long has he been famous? How long has he known about the Great Calamity? This time, this old man won't get involved. I'll just sit on the sidelines and watch," Great Venerable Hunqiong completely lacked the bearing of a powerful expert. He even crossed his legs, looking particularly smug.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the expressions of the Yin God Venerables and Great Venerables present all changed.</p><p></p><p>"Such a major matter cannot be decided in a day. This old man also feels the Blood Robe Sword God should think thrice!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this Venerable won't get involved either."</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods had received the Blood Robe Sword God's message and come here to give him face. </p><p></p><p>But to face the Great Calamity... forget it.</p><p></p><p>With traitors present, wouldn't discussing how to deal with the Great Calamity just expose all their information to the Great Calamity?</p><p></p><p>Many Great Venerables looked towards Great Venerable White Fish, their eyes flickering as if asking for his decision.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable White Fish's expression was calm as he slowly said: "We cultivators are destined to die. Dying in the face of the Great Calamity can be considered dying with honor."</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable White Fish was already resolved to die.</p><p></p><p>He would soon be unable to control himself and step into the Mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his name would be left on the Mythical Monument.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to leave then would probably be impossible.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Great Venerable Hunqiong sighed, not bothering to hide anything. "After the Blood Robe Sword God falls, this Original God Sharing Conference and Divine Flower Association will be without a master. You all better not fight with this old man over it. I will take good care of the Blood Robe Sword God's descendants."</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hunqiong was fearless.</p><p></p><p>He had only sent a clone here, while his true body remained hidden in the Cang Lan Realm. Even a Mythical expert wouldn't be able to find him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, many of the Great Venerables here knew of his identity as a traitor.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he was also confused when he received the invitation to the Original God Sharing Conference.</p><p></p><p>But he still came.</p><p></p><p>Since he came, he might as well play a role.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood Robe Sword God falls and this resistance against the Great Calamity comes to an end, he might even be able to profit a bit.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Great Venerable Hunqiong's shameless words, many of the Yin Gods and Great Venerables present had slight changes in expression.</p><p></p><p>But they could do nothing about Great Venerable Hunqiong.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hunqiong then smiled: "Don't be too discouraged. This Blood Robe Sword God was even able to destroy Destiny Mountain, so he may have some ability. This time... you Great Venerables should stop suppressing yourselves and all step into the Mythical realm."</p><p></p><p>These words were quite vicious.</p><p></p><p>Once one steps into the Mythical realm, there is only fighting to the death.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Hunqiong's words had malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable White Fish glanced at Great Venerable Hunqiong but said nothing.</p><p></p><p>A gentleman does not associate with petty men, lest it sour one's mood.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the venue became very tense.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a few who were in favor of fighting, most of the Yin Gods and Great Venerables were undecided.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Great Venerable Hunqiong present, this secret plot would fail no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had thoughts of resisting the Great Calamity, they didn't dare show it at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This great gathering was full of unpredictable people with different thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a ripple came from the void in front.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin Gods present, whether Venerables or Great Venerables, looked towards the front.</p><p></p><p>They saw a splash of blood-red color as a man in a blood-colored robe appeared, holding up his sleeve, looking quite relaxed and casual.</p><p></p><p>His face was extraordinarily handsome with a hint of bewitching charm. His eyes were as gentle as jade, but with a hidden sharp glint.</p><p></p><p>"I hope everyone has enjoyed the tea. Has anyone experienced any discomfort?" Qi Yuan spoke, his words most ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But they also represented his concern for these Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Coming from far and wide to gather here, if they experienced any discomfort and vomited or had diarrhea on his territory, wouldn't he have to compensate them? The Yin God Venerables hurriedly stood up to express their views.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe Sword God, resisting the Great Calamity is a major matter that requires careful planning!"</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, I am willing to fight alongside the Blood Robe Sword God against the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man will watch you all and cheer you on," Great Venerable Hunqiong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is too big, it needs further discussion." Many Yin Gods were already intending to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Great Venerable White Fish sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that no matter when, all the Yin Gods of the Cang Lan Realm could never reach a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Resisting the Great Calamity was always the relentless pursuit of a minority.</p><p></p><p>"You're all being too noisy."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised a finger, and instantly the great hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerables who had been speaking suddenly found they could no longer hear their own voices.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts trembled as they became even more wary of the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw the Blood Robe Sword God speak, his voice carrying a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>"I invited you here not to seek your support or opposition.</p><p></p><p>I am here to inform you that 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity', this meticulous plan, will be personally implemented by me in three days!"</p><p></p><p>The aura around Qi Yuan rose, as deep as the sea.</p><p></p><p>"In three days, I will personally go to the Central Heavenly Region to slay the Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"And when you return, you are to announce to the world that 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity' has begun. If anything unusual happens in this world, the people need not panic, as if nothing has happened."</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerables and Venerables present all looked at Qi Yuan, listening to his ambitious declaration, their expressions moved.</p><p></p><p>He was going to eliminate the Great Calamity alone? How daring!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

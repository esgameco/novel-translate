        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"They tore up my invitation letter and sold it in the market, what is the meaning of this? They don't take me seriously, they don't take the Guangming Palace seriously!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua was furious, when had he ever suffered such an insult.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Wang Shuang also felt a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>This Shenguang Sect really doesn't know how to handle things.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Zhu Lianhua had sent an invitation letter to the Seven-Color Peak, but he didn't expect the letter to be torn up and sold in the market.</p><p></p><p>He organized his words and said: "I've heard that the senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak is eccentric and unusual in his actions, it's likely that he was the one who sold the invitation letter!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Shuang did not mention the Peak Master of the Seven-Color Peak, wanting to divert the conflict to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was afraid that Zhu Lianhua would lose his temper and get into a conflict with the presumed late-stage Qi Embryo Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>But getting into a conflict with a qi-cultivating disciple would be nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, without Ruan Yixie's permission, her disciple dares to sell my invitation letter?" Zhu Lianhua transmitted, his expression had already calmed down.</p><p></p><p>If Jiang Lingsu was here, upon hearing Zhu Lianhua's transmission, she would definitely say, "Senior Brother dares."</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Fellow Daoist, be careful with your words, this is the market under the Shenguang Sect!" </p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we're just transmitting, what's there to be afraid of!" Zhu Lianhua continued to transmit.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Shuang inwardly despised him even more.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows to be afraid, not daring to curse openly, yet still acting so arrogantly, what's the point? "Fellow Daoist, shall we go to the Shenguang Sect?" Wang Shuang tentatively asked, "Do you want to go there and demand an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Zhu Lianhua, afraid that Zhu Lianhua would lose his temper and cause a ruckus at the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, he would definitely have to rush back to deal with the false claim of his 13th Concubine going into labor, not wanting to get involved in this.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua's expression was gloomy, but he finally spoke: "Going there now would only be humiliating myself!</p><p></p><p>But this humiliation today, I will remember it. Shenguang Sect... for treating me this way today, when I reach the Qi Embryo Realm, I will make this sect chaotic! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Lianhua chose to avoid the limelight for now.</p><p></p><p>Completing the task his master entrusted him with was the top priority.</p><p></p><p>As for the Shenguang Sect, Ruan Yixie, and that Qi Yuan, he would remember them! Hearing this, Wang Shuang inwardly rejoiced: "Fellow Daoist, this is a wise decision. That Ruan Yixie's cultivation is profound, we shouldn't provoke her, but her disciple is merely at the qi-cultivating realm. When he leaves the sect, I'll find a reason to capture him and get revenge for you!"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Qi Yuan had a cloak draped over his head, constantly scratching his face, he was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had secretly gone down the mountain to sell that invitation letter.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he ran into people from the Guangming Palace.</p><p></p><p>It was truly an unlucky encounter.</p><p></p><p>He secretly hid the information and followed behind them, also secretly overhearing some infuriating information.</p><p></p><p>That Zhu Lianhua wanted to seize the sect's treasure!</p><p></p><p>Who is the Shenguang Sect's treasure, if not him, Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Seize him? How could Qi Yuan endure that?</p><p></p><p>Finally, the other party bought the invitation letter, that gnashing of teeth expression, and the frantic transmissions, made Qi Yuan feel that they were brewing some plot.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I can't eavesdrop on their thoughts, otherwise I would have known their conspiracy!</p><p></p><p>They are definitely now plotting how to subvert our Shenguang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Vicious ambition!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I don't have any evidence to report this to the sect, perhaps it will be like last time when I exposed the Sect Master as a spy, and I'll end up being put under house arrest instead!"</p><p></p><p>"I can't just stand by and watch, I must take action for the sect!"</p><p></p><p>"If the sect is in trouble today and I don't act, who will save me when I'm in trouble tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Also, he must be planning to harm my Master, such a person should not be allowed to live in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also clenched his teeth like Zhu Lianhua.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Zhu Lianhua was really petty-minded.</p><p></p><p>Always wanting to wipe out entire families! Can't people have a little more trust in each other? What if that invitation letter was accidentally stolen by a thief and sold? At the very least, it was because he, Qi Yuan, was too poor to afford food, so he had to take the risk and sell the invitation letter.</p><p></p><p>Couldn't this Zhu Lianhua show a little understanding? </p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, a delicate white hand tapped on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother." A female figure in a black cloak sat across from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This woman was Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was startled: "I'm not your Senior Brother, I don't know Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, don't pretend!" Jiang Lingsu leaned close to Qi Yuan's ear and said in a low voice, "Do you have plans for those people from the Guangming Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"I just overheard their conspiracy outside. </p><p></p><p>They are plotting to overthrow the Shenguang Sect, and even the Great Liang Empire!" Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was taken aback, then somewhat speechless. She secretly glanced at the twenty-meter distant Zhu Lianhua and Wang Shuang.</p><p></p><p>They were conspiring that far away, and even transmitting, yet you heard it?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu said, "Senior Brother, could it be that you have designs on them?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Qi Yuan said righteously, "I will fight for the sect and slay those villains!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu immediately felt that she was lucky to have asked her Senior Brother first.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if her Senior Brother had rashly charged in, that would be courting death, and it would also ruin her plan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, those two are truly despicable, I also want to kill them.</p><p></p><p>But they are powerful, I'm afraid we are no match for them." Jiang Lingsu organized her words.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to kill Zhu Lianhua, naturally she had her own schemes.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't want to tell her Senior Brother about her schemes.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, follow me later and listen to my arrangement, we'll go kill them together." Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan showed a hesitant expression: "Our strength is too weak, what if we can't defeat them?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu let out a bitter smile upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, you also know that your strength is weak. Just now, I had a feeling that if I didn't come, you would have definitely gone to cause trouble for those two. Elder Brother is different from ordinary people, with a unique mindset, so anything could happen."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have a treasure that can definitely kill the two of them. Elder Brother, later when we follow them, you must listen to my arrangements, otherwise there will be variables."</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Lingsu spoke, she took out three talismans and handed them to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"These three talismans are the Concealment Talisman, the Bronze Armor Talisman, and the Water Escape Talisman. They have the functions of suppressing aura, protecting, and escaping respectively." Jiang Lingsu gave the three talismans to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Thank you, Shijie!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, use the Concealment Talisman and the Bronze Armor Talisman, and we'll follow them."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Although a bit reluctant, Qi Yuan still used the talismans.</p><p></p><p>The two of them used the talismans on themselves and walked through the market. The people in the market seemed to have not noticed their existence at all.</p><p></p><p>The two of them followed Zhu Lianhua and Wang Shuang out of the market.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Jiang Lingsu kept following behind them.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, stay closer to me," Jiang Lingsu whispered to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid that if Elder Brother was too far away, and a battle broke out, she wouldn't be able to protect him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan moved closer to Jiang Lingsu upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the two was very close, and Jiang Lingsu could feel Qi Yuan's somewhat nervous breathing. She blushed slightly. This was the first time she had been in such close contact with a man.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that Elder Brother's safety was the priority, she no longer acted coy and took Qi Yuan's hand: "Elder Brother, if we encounter danger later, you stand behind me."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll protect you from behind!" Qi Yuan agreed and also grabbed Jiang Lingsu's hand.</p><p></p><p>The two secretly followed Zhu Lianhua and Wang Shuang, and after about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, the group entered the forest.</p><p></p><p>In this secluded place, there were few people. Jiang Lingsu was very calm, but the nearby Qi Yuan seemed a bit nervous, with his breathing quite rapid, which also caused a strange ripple in Jiang Lingsu's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, when the timing is right, we'll strike, suddenly attack, and kill them."</p><p></p><p>"Attacking without honor? I understand that!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'll take the lead." Jiang Lingsu emphasized this sentence.</p><p></p><p>The opponent had one Qi Condensation Realm Perfection cultivator and one Qi Condensation Realm Mid-stage cultivator. With Jiang Lingsu's own strength, she was naturally no match for the two of them.</p><p></p><p>However, her collection of treasures was enough to drown the two Qi Condensation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The two of them moved quietly and soon arrived in the depths of the forest. At this time, Wang Shuang and Zhu Lianhua had stopped, seemingly discussing something.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan suddenly let out a loud shout: "Shijie, now is the best time, watch me sneak attack!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said this and charged forward with a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>She also knew that this was a good opportunity for a sneak attack, but she needed time to prepare her treasures. She wanted to tell Elder Brother that she would take action, and that he should hide behind her.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that Elder Brother would be so reckless! Those were Qi Condensation Realm Perfection and Qi Condensation Realm Mid-stage cultivators! You, a Qi Refining Realm cultivator, just charged in like that? And this is called a sneak attack? Charging in with a kitchen knife! At this moment, Jiang Lingsu couldn't think too much, as Elder Brother had already made his move, and she couldn't delay any longer, or else if Elder Brother died here, she would regret it for the rest of her life.</p><p></p><p>She also quickened the speed of deploying her treasures.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Zhu Lianhua was stunned for a moment, and Wang Shuang was completely shocked: "He is Qi Yuan, the senior disciple of the Seven-Color Peak."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Zhu Lianhua heard this and had an ominous premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A Qi Refining Realm cultivator wielding a kitchen knife to attack two Qi Condensation Realm cultivators, there must be a conspiracy behind this.</p><p></p><p>"Let's run." Without any hesitation, the two quickly fled.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Jiang Lingsu saw this and also understood the intentions of those two, letting out a sigh of relief. She was no longer going to take action, otherwise, if she left those two behind, Elder Brother would be in danger without her by his side. Let those two escape this calamity! Jiang Lingsu looked at Elder Brother, sighing inwardly, with a slight trace of dissatisfaction in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, seeing that the two wanted to flee, let out a loud roar: "Where are you running to!"</p><p></p><p>His speed at this moment had surged, even surpassing the two fleeing Qi Condensation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to exterminate my Shenguang Sect? You're looking for death!" </p><p></p><p>He brought down the knife, and Zhu Lianhua was dumbfounded, his head falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Aiding the wicked, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>The knife strike did not diminish, and he also split Wang Shuang in half.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan had slain the two Qi Condensation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The two of them until the end still thought they had been caught up in some great conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan patted his hands, looking at the corpses on the ground, and shouted loudly, "Shijie, come quickly, these two old fellows are useless, they were killed by my dishonorable sneak attack."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Jiang Lingsu who witnessed this scene blinked her eyes. The development of the situation was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>PS: Starting tomorrow, I'll try to avoid looking at the comments as much as possible and follow my own pace.</p><p></p><p>The upcoming plot will focus more on the game, and after breaking through the game, I'll start the real-world side storylines.</p><p></p><p>I recommend a book, the name is a bit similar, but the content is different, it's an overpowered and thrilling novel.

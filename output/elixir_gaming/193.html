        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was calm, with a hint of mockery.</p><p></p><p>This completely shocked all the gods present.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know where Qi Yuan's confidence came from. This was the heart of the North Sea Dragon Clan's territory, right in the North Sea God's domain.</p><p></p><p>Such provocation was tantamount to suicide.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon glared at Qi Yuan, his eyes blazing with fury: "Even if your father is a Great Venerable, you'll have to stay here today!"</p><p></p><p>He was truly enraged.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he was determined to keep Qi Yuan here.</p><p></p><p>The six True Gods behind Qi Yuan showed no fear in the face of powerful enemies.</p><p></p><p>A battle was about to erupt at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an elder at the second step of Heaven Treading appeared, acting as a mediator: "You are all ancient gods. With external enemies at our gates, we should not start internal conflicts lightly. Let's prioritize harmony!"</p><p></p><p>This elder at the second step of Heaven Treading was known to be a peacemaker.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Golden Flood Dragon's expression softened. He looked at Qi Yuan and said: "Hand over this woman, and we'll let this matter go."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qi Yuan immediately became displeased. This person was too good at pretending.</p><p></p><p>"Leave behind the divine power of you seven, and I'll spare the North Sea Dragon Clan's lives," Qi Yuan spoke, his voice cold and stern.</p><p></p><p>If the Golden Flood Dragon's words still had a conciliatory tone, Qi Yuan's words had none at all.</p><p></p><p>If an uninformed person were to witness this, they might think Qi Yuan was the real villain.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Ye Liuyun looked anxious and kept sending mental messages: "Brother Qi, you're being a bit rash. Why don't we make a run for it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan paid no attention and mentally replied: "Is he a Yang God? No. So wouldn't it be very embarrassing if I ran away?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Twilight Venerable also sent a mental message: "Origin Heavenly Venerable, if things go south, this old man can step in and help you hold off this Golden Flood Dragon."</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Venerable had made a big decision with this offer.</p><p></p><p>It would thoroughly offend the North Sea Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the Origin Heavenly Venerable who could open twenty-one legendary slots at once, he felt that offending the North Sea Dragon Clan was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if he were to publicize this incident, probably half of the ancient gods present would be willing to help Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He also believed this was the source of the Origin Heavenly Venerable's confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your kindness, but it's not necessary for now," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Golden Flood Dragon, he showed no signs of anxiety or fear.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Palace Lord's expression was not pleasant at this time. She wanted to intervene, but with both sides eager for battle, she was powerless to stop it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, she could only sigh and say: "If you must fight, please do so in the North Sea Ancient Battlefield. Don't damage the waters here."</p><p></p><p>Before the Evil Gods descended upon this world, when True Gods of this realm had conflicts, they would generally battle in the Ancient Battlefield to avoid harming mortals.</p><p></p><p>But after the Evil Gods arrived, they disregarded such considerations, not caring if mortals were killed or the terrain was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Fine!" The Golden Flood Dragon gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with rage.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also nodded: "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The group headed majestically towards the Ancient Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present all had their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Palace Lord felt helpless, as this year's Hundred Flowers Gathering was ending in disaster again.</p><p></p><p>The Qionghua Great Venerable could not awaken.</p><p></p><p>The future of the Qionghua Palace looked bleak.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the group arrived at the Ancient Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The space within the Ancient Battlefield was very stable, even more so than the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was different from the empty virtual realms of the Canglan World.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan entered the Ancient Battlefield, his eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>[Ancient Battlefield, the place where the Mortal Heart Realm first opened, where primordial gods and demons emerged from chaos.]</p><p></p><p>Was the Ancient Battlefield the origin of the Mortal Heart Realm?</p><p></p><p>This slightly surprised Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ancient gods in the distance of the Ancient Battlefield had varied expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This Origin Heavenly Venerable is too reckless!"</p><p></p><p>"A spoiled young master is just a spoiled young master."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we ancient gods are already in decline, why must we fight amongst ourselves?"</p><p></p><p>"One side has one at the second step of Heaven Treading and six at the peak of the first step; the other side has six at the early stage of the first step. How can they possibly win?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present did not have high hopes for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gap was too large.</p><p></p><p>The Twilight Venerable also kept watching from afar, ready to step in and rescue the Origin Heavenly Venerable if anything went wrong.</p><p></p><p>Helping in times of need was always better than adding flowers to a brocade.</p><p></p><p>At this time, as the Golden Flood Dragon entered the Ancient Battlefield, he finally stopped holding back.</p><p></p><p>"You humiliated me so in the Qionghua Palace, you deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud shout from the Golden Flood Dragon, the six True Gods behind him immediately revealed their true forms.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, six enormous flood dragons soared in the clouds, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, intertwining with each other. The aura of True Gods permeated the air, overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"We of the Dragon Clan are the leaders of water creatures. In this North Sea, we are the born rulers!" The Golden Flood Dragon roared, full of vigor. "To kill you lot, this Venerable need not act personally!"</p><p></p><p>At his words, the massive flood dragons hovering in the air fixed their gazes on Qi Yuan, their enormous eyes as big as lanterns, looking particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained unmoved: "I may not have Nezha, but I have the Dragon-Subduing Arhat."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan glanced sideways at Zhao Zun: "Weren't you hungry? Today I allow you to break your vows and eat meat."</p><p></p><p>The god Zhao Zun observed was the Dragon-Subduing Arhat.</p><p></p><p>In some mythological legends, Ji Gong was the reincarnation of the Dragon-Subduing Arhat, so in a sense, breaking vows... wasn't really breaking vows.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Zun suddenly stepped forward, his form like a bronze statue, causing the earth to start shaking.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the expressions of the other ancient gods became strange.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace Realm at its peak?"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Fasting Holy Mother couldn't fight True Gods at the peak of the Purple Palace Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this suicide?"</p><p></p><p>These True Gods couldn't understand why, when there were six True Gods available, a peak Purple Palace Realm cultivator was sent out instead.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun stood among the crowd, and when he saw Zhao Zun not concealing his aura, for some unknown reason, a nameless fear arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, since his strength was still intact, that fear wasn't very intense.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon naturally had this feeling too.</p><p></p><p>But with his powerful strength, he was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"A mere Purple Palace dares to step forward!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, let me assist you!" the Joyful Arhat spoke.</p><p></p><p>He was one of only two True Gods among the Arhats.</p><p></p><p>"Changmei will come too," the Long-Browed Arhat said.</p><p></p><p>Both of them placed their hands on Zhao Zun's body.</p><p></p><p>Divine power surged frantically into Zhao Zun's body.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a false divine aperture was born within Zhao Zun's body at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods who saw this scene were all somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>"How can they lend their own power to another person?"</p><p></p><p>"How can a Purple Palace Realm body support divine power!"</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were puzzled, as today's events exceeded their understanding.</p><p></p><p>However, even with the assistance of two True Gods,</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun's strength was still far inferior to that of the Golden Flood Dragon and his companions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Liuyun, looking at Zhao Zun, felt the fear in his heart continuously spreading.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Why would he fear a stranger?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that stranger's strength was even weaker than his!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon's expression also became somewhat unpleasant. For some unknown reason, a nameless fear also arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are you!" He glared at Zhao Zun, puzzled in his heart, "No matter what you are, kill!"</p><p></p><p>The massive bodies of the six flood dragons surged forward. Anyone with megalophobia would be scared stiff at this sight, unable to open their eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Zun took a step forward. He looked at the Dragon Clan, his voice majestic and resounding.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Dragon of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the phantom of a divine dragon appeared behind Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>That divine dragon was of indeterminate length, pure gold in color, with five claws!</p><p></p><p>However, the phantom of that divine dragon was now a corpse, its scales shattered, its body torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun, looking at the phantom of that divine dragon, was suddenly shaken in his heart: "Great Venerable, no, a True Dragon at the seventh step of Heaven Treading!"</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, the Dragon Clan was not very powerful. Even in ancient times, there were less than twenty Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The strongest was only the Dragon Ancestor at the sixth step of Heaven Treading! Now, the remnants of a True Dragon at the seventh step of Heaven Treading had appeared here. How could he not be shocked and afraid!</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also widened their eyes, inexplicably shaken in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't recognize that it was a dragon at the seventh step of Heaven Treading, but they knew that True Dragon must have been terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon gritted his teeth: "Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Then Zhao Zun stepped forward again.</p><p></p><p>"Flood Dragon of Earth, Venomous Dragon of Man!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, two more terrifying dragon phantoms appeared, both broken and incomplete, as dead as could be.</p><p></p><p>And these terrifying...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Behind the illusory dragon clan, there were densely packed dragon bodies.</p><p></p><p>Some dragon bodies had their dragon livers hollowed out, some had their dragon tendons severed. It was clear that all these dragons had been slain by the true god envisioned by Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun looked at the six flood dragons, his eyes flashing gold.</p><p></p><p>"Those who submit shall be subdued, those who are restrained shall follow, those who are called shall come, and those who are used shall take form!"</p><p></p><p>"I come by decree of the Heavenly Lord to subdue dragons!"</p><p></p><p>As Zhao Zun's voice rang out, golden light radiated from his body, endless Buddhist light shining forth. </p><p></p><p>His entire being seemed to transform into an invincible war god.</p><p></p><p>He charged towards the six flood dragons.</p><p></p><p>The six flood dragons that had been so powerful just moments ago now trembled like mice encountering a cat, without a shred of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun tore forcefully, instantly ripping one flood dragon in half as it let out a terrifying howl.</p><p></p><p>His Arhat Fist struck out, directly shattering the dragon's divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Golden Flood Dragon's body trembled. It roared: "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining flood dragons, though terrified, still attacked Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>"Under the Dragon Subduing Incantation, even five-clawed golden dragons must submit. You are all mere mud eels!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun shouted as he charged at the remaining flood dragons.</p><p></p><p>These flood dragons were no match for Zhao Zun, even though they had opened ten more divine apertures than him.</p><p></p><p>However, under the Dragon Subduing Incantation's suppression, they simply could not compare to Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, all six flood dragons were torn to pieces by Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>The ground was covered in endless blood, with mutilated dragon bodies strewn across the sky, an utterly miserable sight.</p><p></p><p>In the illusory image behind Zhao Zun, six more flood dragons appeared, ranked at the very end.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon's entire body was covered in dragon blood, blurring its vision.</p><p></p><p>"You... monster, die!"</p><p></p><p>"I've taken two steps on the path to heaven, with pure dragon blood. I won't fear you!"</p><p></p><p>With a dragon's roar, the Golden Flood Dragon transformed into its true form and charged at Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>Its aura was over ten times stronger than the six flood dragons!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun looked at the Golden Flood Dragon, his entire body brimming with fighting spirit: "I have seen the world-creating Ying Long. You little mud eel, how dare you claim to be pure?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun's great hand suddenly grabbed the Golden Flood Dragon's enormous body around the waist.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon struggled constantly in Zhao Zun's arms, divine power gushing forth.</p><p></p><p>But it simply could not break free.</p><p></p><p>Under the Dragon Subduing Incantation, Zhao Zun had an overwhelming advantage against dragon-kind.</p><p></p><p>"Mere flood dragon, you're nothing but food for immortals. Dragon liver and phoenix marrow, how dare you act so arrogantly!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun's hand suddenly plunged into the Golden Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>His hand grasped, and the dragon's liver appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Flood Dragon let out an agonized howl.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun said disdainfully: "The lowest grade of dragon liver, not even fit for a banquet."</p><p></p><p>He forcefully grabbed the Golden Flood Dragon's head and smashed it into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Golden Flood Dragon's head exploded.</p><p></p><p>The divine apertures within its body were also crushed one by one by Zhao Zun.</p><p></p><p>Before the Dragon Subduing Incantation, the Golden Flood Dragon had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was fighting the accumulated power of a terrifying world with the strength of one man.</p><p></p><p>After tearing the Golden Flood Dragon to pieces, Zhao Zun's entire body was covered in fresh blood and dragon blood remnants.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods looked at him, their expressions moved and inexplicably afraid.</p><p></p><p>They could not comprehend what had happened today.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Zun swept his gaze over everyone, his eyes cold.</p><p></p><p>"My dharma name was bestowed by the Heavenly Lord."</p><p></p><p>"I am the Dragon Subduing Arhat!"</p><p></p><p>His voice rolled out, sweeping across all directions.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun's aura also rapidly fell at this moment, returning to the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun's eyes widened: "Dragon Subduing Arhat!"</p><p></p><p>The Dusk Venerable's face was also shocked: "To dare to take the name of Dragon Subduer, this god... must be absolutely terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>After all, to take the name of Dragon Subduer was to offend all dragon-kind in the world.</p><p></p><p>Though the dragons of the Mortal Heart Realm were not the strongest, they were not so easily bullied by a single great venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly was the Dragon Subduing Arhat in ancient times?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Especially when the Dragon Subduing Arhat used the Dragon Subduing Incantation, the five-clawed golden dragon that appeared behind his body was clearly a true dragon at the level of a great venerable.</p><p></p><p>They could not sense its specific strength.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Liuyun, also of dragon-kind, knew that it was a dragon that had taken seven steps on the path to heaven! Even the Dragon Ancestor had only taken six steps, yet a dragon that had taken seven steps had died at the hands of the Dragon Subduing Arhat. The shock in his heart could not be resolved.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he heard the Dragon Subduing Arhat mention the world-creating Ying Long during battle, as well as dragon liver becoming food for immortals.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified. Were all these things true?</p><p></p><p>It sounded... too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Dragon Subduing Arhat, a deep fear arising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan, he felt even more unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>He recalled what Qi Yuan had said before about the Azure Dragon and Torch Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that those weren't inferior dragons?</p><p></p><p>Was he himself the inferior one?</p><p></p><p>In the illusory image behind the Dragon Subduing Arhat, he had seen many true dragons with bloodlines far more terrifying than his own.</p><p></p><p>"This matter must be reported to the ancestors!" Ye Liuyun knew that such information was absolutely crucial.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ancient gods were still immersed in the aftermath of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the dragon liver in Zhao Zun's hand with disgust: "I won't eat liver that's taken human form. It's not anything good, just throw it away."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun had slaughtered seven flood dragons, and Qi Yuan had gained seven divine powers.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this was his biggest windfall since coming to this world.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat happy.</p><p></p><p>These dragon-folk were all good people.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he looked at the ancient gods: "Is there anyone else here who covets my goddaughter? Speak up."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ancient gods all took a step back, feeling bewildered: "We wouldn't dare."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Qi Qi's heart was filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>She felt that this was her godfather standing up for her.</p><p></p><p>Her heart was sweet. Since the collapse of the Heavenly Mansion and the death of her clansmen, this was the first time she had met someone who treated her so well.</p><p></p><p>Domineering yet incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally did not know his goddaughter's thoughts. He was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Attending this Hundred Flowers Gathering, he hadn't gotten to put on his mocking face. Having a goddaughter was really useful, but unfortunately he had only used her once.</p><p></p><p>"All the people have been killed, we should go back and continue the Hundred Flowers Gathering."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he left with the Four Heavenly Kings and Eighteen Arhats.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient gods looked at Zhao Zun's figure, utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They were also extremely curious about Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>Which great god from ancient times was he exactly?</p><p></p><p>Everyone returned to the Hundred Flowers Gathering, their hearts still turbulent.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Hundred Flowers Gathering, most people's minds were no longer on it.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, this place is after all the domain of the Northern Sea Dragon Clan. You've killed the Golden Flood Dragon, it would be best to leave quickly," the Qionghua Palace Master advised.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged woman beside her also looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she had only sold a favor to let Qi Yuan come because her friend had asked.</p><p></p><p>She never expected that he wasn't a village-level guardian god, but an overlord!</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Flowers Gathering hasn't ended yet, how could I leave?" Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't rush to leave.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Sea Dragon Clan had lost seven members.</p><p></p><p>Would the remaining dragons dare to cause him trouble?</p><p></p><p>Even if they did, Qi Yuan was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>"I was still hoping I might obtain some supreme treasures. Sigh, I have too many subordinates, they're all waiting to eat supreme treasures." Qi Yuan looked at the Eighteen Arhats with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Dragon Subduer and Tiger Tamer, as well as the two who had advanced to the True God realm, the rest all lacked supreme treasures to advance to True God.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Qionghua Palace Master had nothing more to say and stopped trying to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>By now, the Hundred Flowers Gathering was already halfway through.</p><p></p><p>Many people were also working hard to continue awakening the flower bundles.</p><p></p><p>However, the effect was poor.</p><p></p><p>A third of the flowers here had still not bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood to the side, somewhat bored.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, being too handsome is not good. If I had a mocking face, surely some ignorant person would come mock me, letting me also observe the gods and awaken flower bundles." Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Liuyun was quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, with your strength, who would dare mock you!</p><p></p><p>"Being insulted and doubted by everyone, then observing the gods and shocking everyone, that would surely be very interesting." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he kept winking at the Dusk Venerable not far away.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

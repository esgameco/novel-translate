        <h1>Chapter 224</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Eat more fish, it will strengthen the Pillar of Heaven," Qi Yuan said from the side.</p><p></p><p>This visualization had greatly improved his subordinates. </p><p></p><p>It had also greatly improved him.</p><p></p><p>The first step of his three-step plan could be considered successfully completed.</p><p></p><p>The next thing to do was to lead the army and swiftly annihilate the evil god army of Qingheng Continent with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>The evil god spiritual power obtained would be just enough to support him using the Lost Glow Stick again to return to the past for one final upgrade.</p><p></p><p>For this last return to the past, Qi Yuan didn't know exactly when he would end up.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would return to sometime between now and the Great Flood War.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe he would go back to a much, much earlier time.</p><p></p><p>In any case, feeding the Starving Holy Mother more first to strengthen the Pillar of Heaven was always a good thing.</p><p></p><p>The next visualization would need to accumulate even more than this one.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan asked at this time: "Do you know about the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been quite curious about the Ancient Clan's ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he had never obtained any information about the ancestral land from others.</p><p></p><p>The Starving Holy Mother's expression became complicated: "That is an extremely dangerous place. Even mythical beings would perish if they entered."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, without special methods, it's impossible to enter. Rashly entering, even mythical beings could perish," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Starving Holy Mother didn't know much about the ancestral land either.</p><p></p><p>The Starving Holy Mother lowered her head to eat fish, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the stars in the sky, his face also somewhat pale.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his level had increased quite a bit recently, so the impact of losing the Blood of Flawless Glazed Glass wasn't too severe.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"Before I leave, make some more fish. Some boiled fish in hot sauce, spicy grilled fish, sauerkraut fish, all of those," Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>For the last half day, the Starving Holy Mother became a fisherman for half a day.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a red dress, she sat by the lake fishing, her black hair falling to her waist. In her eyes, there seemed to be an unmelting coldness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually lay on a lounge chair the Starving Holy Mother had found somewhere, though he wasn't really lying down.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the fish in the lake, his mind unusually clear.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly thinking of something, he asked the graceful figure not far away.</p><p></p><p>"If you went back to the past like this, unable to change the past, what would you do?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't have a good way to change the past.</p><p></p><p>The powerful visualization method, he couldn't pass on to people in the past.</p><p></p><p>The visualization method had to be observed, it couldn't be taught verbally.</p><p></p><p>So, he also couldn't truly enhance the power of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>Should he teach the Starving Holy Mother about nuclear fission? Just thinking about it was laughable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the eyes of true gods, that was really just like a weapon for blasting fish.</p><p></p><p>If he could return to the past in his true form, Qi Yuan would have the confidence to change history.</p><p></p><p>But like this... he couldn't.</p><p></p><p>The Starving Holy Mother hesitated, then slowly spoke: "Be a passerby, just seeing the mountains and rivers would be enough."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the number one person in the Mortal Heart Realm, living so freely," Qi Yuan thought of the Starving Holy Mother during the Great Flood War, when she had led him to measure the mountains and rivers with their footsteps.</p><p></p><p>After about a few hours passed, the table was filled with various fish dishes.</p><p></p><p>The Starving Holy Mother didn't seem greedy, only making a table full of fish.</p><p></p><p>The fragrant aroma wafted over, but unfortunately Qi Yuan was destined not to smell it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these fish, Qi Yuan felt quite pained.</p><p></p><p>However, he still dripped the Blood of Flawless Glazed Glass onto the fish.</p><p></p><p>The impurities were eliminated again, and Qi Yuan's form became somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had gotten the cultivator version of low blood sugar.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I have to go now," Qi Yuan clapped his hands, having accomplished his goal.</p><p></p><p>The Starving Holy Mother glanced at where Qi Yuan was, her gaze falling on the fish on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, helping each other is a traditional virtue!" Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>In his heart at this moment, he was actually cursing a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Playing a game, still have to use up Blood of Flawless Glazed Glass, this game really costs your life."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hesitated no longer, his form disappearing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The bamboo house was empty, the expression on the red-dressed woman's face frozen at this moment, as if she had discovered some truth.</p><p></p><p>A hysterical voice inexplicably arose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Devour him... devour... everything..."</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in the red-dressed woman's eyes. She picked up her chopsticks and looked at the fish before her, her gaze becoming extremely complicated.</p><p></p><p>She chewed slowly, eating for half a day, only eating half a fish.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Flying Mist City.</p><p></p><p>A group of figures suddenly appeared in an open space.</p><p></p><p>These figures all emitted terrifying auras, and excitement and elation showed on each of their faces.</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Wang Song murmured, still feeling as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that in this life, I, Wang Song, would have the chance to step into the Fifth Step of Treading Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Step of Treading Heaven was equivalent to a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Among Great Venerables, it was not considered weak.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had already perfected the Fifth Step of Treading Heaven. One more step and he would reach the Sixth Step of Treading Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, alas, alas." Venerable Zang Hui sighed three times in succession.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was unable to emulate Zhu Zhuangshi and the Big Black Dog. The Thunder God Great Venerable was a threshold he could not cross.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Venerable... had actually stepped into the Mythical realm! That was the Mythical realm! Since the Great Flood War occurred, the ancient gods of the Mortal Heart Realm had no more mythical beings! The gods before him naturally envied this greatly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over the assembled gods, a look of satisfaction in his eyes: "Take one day to settle down properly. In one day, I have a big task to do!"</p><p></p><p>These people's strength had suddenly increased, and they needed to settle and familiarize themselves.</p><p></p><p>This way, when the great battle began, it would be easier to sweep through.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" The over a thousand true gods before him spoke, their voices solemn.</p><p></p><p>"These divine aperture essences, ten for each person. Whether you open divine apertures or not is up to you," Qi Yuan waved his hand again, and ten divine aperture essences appeared in each venerable's hand.</p><p></p><p>The amount of divine realm immortal liquid was limited and couldn't be given out in large quantities indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>There was no such concern with divine aperture essence.</p><p></p><p>There was a lot, and very much of it.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand true gods bowed together, making Qi Yuan feel elated, as if he were the Jade Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form also disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, it was in the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the city lord's mansion, Qi Qi was frowning, seeming to be pondering something.</p><p></p><p>When she saw Qi Yuan appear, Qi Qi quickly stood up: "Godfather!"</p><p></p><p>Now the logistics of Qi Yuan's fief, as well as various information summaries and even diplomacy, were all handled by Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, Qi Qi had done all these things in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>This reduced the difficulty of Qi Yuan playing the game.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to focus on dominating in battle, without having to worry about trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, there are some guests in the main hall," Qi Qi said quickly, "They are representatives from the Ancient Ape Clan, the Well Dragon Clan, the Ancient God Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Now Flying Mist City had representatives from several major ancient god forces of Qingheng Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Ape Clan and Well Dragon Clan have probably come to pledge allegiance and join us in resisting the enemy. As for the Ancient God Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A great sovereign arrived, who was their alliance leader. His attitude was somewhat ambiguous, as if he came with ill intentions. "Qi Qi briefly explained the characteristics of each faction to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Also..." Qi Qi paused, "Someone from the Phoenix clan came, willing to help godfather."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi herself had some Phoenix clan blood flowing in her veins.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I see. I'll go take a look and see who's willing to become my subjects," said Qi Yuan. </p><p></p><p>With that, his form dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the reception hall, over a dozen ancient gods were seated, with varying expressions, conversing with each other.</p><p></p><p>"The setting sun at Sunset Slope was truly awe-inspiring, and it temporarily resolved our crisis!"</p><p></p><p>"When the great sun hung in the sky, even I felt fear in my heart. This strike, not even at the level of a true god, was already so powerful. Above true gods... how terrifying would that be?" Yuan Kun, the clan leader of the ancient apes, spoke with a rather helpless voice. </p><p></p><p>He had taken three steps to heaven, with an unparalleled physical body. Yet even a slight radiance from the great sun in the sky could shatter his strongest treasure body.</p><p></p><p>"The incident at Sunset Slope is indeed strange, but that's not something we should be considering. It must have been done by that mysterious powerhouse from the South who had envisioned eight mythical figures. What we should be considering is how to deal with the Liyang Army Commander! The changes at Sunset Slope are merely a drop in the bucket for the Liyang Army Commander. We don't know when the next wave of troops will come charging in."</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Kun, didn't the Origin Celestial Venerable kill your grandson? Why are you still here?" At this point, a member of the Ancient God Alliance spoke up, seemingly trying to stir up trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, an unworthy descendant who was used to being arrogant and domineering. If he was killed, so be it. I, Yuan Kun, can still distinguish between family matters and national interests!" Yuan Kun replied, somewhat displeased at the ancient god who brought up this matter.</p><p></p><p>"National interests? Who among us here doesn't have them?" The ancient god from the Ancient God Alliance spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Kun couldn't help but mock, "Then why do you still want control over the North Sea Divine Eye?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Kun had always disliked these hypocritical people from the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Ancient God Alliance's leader came in person, followed by two other great sovereigns. A total of three great sovereigns came - this was clearly not for negotiation, but to usurp power.</p><p></p><p>The others had never thought highly of the Ancient God Alliance to begin with.</p><p></p><p>This time, over a hundred ancient gods from the Ancient God Alliance had surrendered and died at Sunset Slope, making the present ancient gods even more disdainful.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because we put the world first that the North Sea Divine Eye should be controlled by our Ancient God Alliance. The Origin Celestial Venerable has many capable people under him, but only one great sovereign, Qiong Hua. We of the Ancient God Alliance are not at ease with the North Sea Divine Eye in his hands. Our Ancient God Alliance puts the world and the bigger picture first. With us three in control of the North Sea Divine Eye, we will surely protect everyone's safety," the leader of the Ancient God Alliance said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the only way to resist the army of evil gods was the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>With several great sovereigns working together to build defenses and maximize the effectiveness of the North Sea Divine Eye, perhaps the army of evil gods wouldn't want to waste lives and would leave them alone.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Alliance must secure control of the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun listened to these people's speeches, his contempt growing stronger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to control power, they should just say so directly. Why put on such a righteous act?</p><p></p><p>In Ye Liuyun's view, the Ancient God Alliance was just a bunch of cowards who bullied the weak and feared the strong.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare face the army of evil gods, so they came to bully the Origin Celestial Venerable instead.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the current leader of the Ancient God Alliance didn't know that Qi Yuan was the one who had envisioned twenty-one legends and eight myths, nor did he know that the sun's phantom was summoned by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would he dare to speak so presumptuously?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a lazy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, who's speaking with such an arrogant tone? Could it be... a branch of the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared in the hall, dressed in a cyan robe.</p><p></p><p>He sat in the main chair, his gaze fixed blatantly on the leader of the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, Ye Liuyun quickly transmitted a message: "Brother Qi, be careful. This Ancient God Alliance comes with ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Ancient God Alliance glanced at Qi Yuan and spoke in a calm voice: "My demands may have been a bit excessive, but if you just hand over control of the North Sea Divine Eye to the Ancient God Alliance, we will certainly compensate you!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you incapable of understanding human speech?" Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the ancient gods present felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This Origin Celestial Venerable was so bold, daring to speak to three great sovereigns like this! At the same time, it was also very satisfying.</p><p></p><p>They had long disliked the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But they were wary of the Ancient God Alliance's strong power!</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Ancient God Alliance leader didn't change much. He continued, "Your anger is understandable, it's only human nature. As long as you hand over control of the North Sea Divine Eye to the Ancient God Alliance, I will not..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems some people really can't understand human speech." Qi Yuan interrupted the Ancient God Alliance leader, spreading his hands and looking quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>"When I said you were a branch of the Palace of Light, I wasn't making small talk. I was telling you... it's time for you to meet your maker."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's lazy voice fell, the faces of the ancient gods present changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>How dare this Brother Qi!</p><p></p><p>How is it that every time they meet, he shocks him so much? The other ancient gods were also surprised in their hearts. The Origin Celestial Venerable's words had thoroughly offended the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Alliance might be wary of everyone being ancient gods and not make a move against Qi Yuan this time.</p><p></p><p>But they would definitely take covert action.</p><p></p><p>The face of the Ancient God Alliance leader changed slightly, but he seemed to have good self-control: "Origin Celestial Venerable, if you take back what you just said now, there's still time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan seemed to think of something: "Indeed, I should take it back, because you are very strong..."</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were confused again.</p><p></p><p>This was... too thick-skinned.</p><p></p><p>He had just spoken harshly, and now he's taking it back?</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun also had a strange look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Was Qi Yuan backing down?</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile flashed in the eyes of the Ancient God Alliance leader, looking quite benevolent.</p><p></p><p>However, hidden within that benevolent smile was a barely perceptible killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Then they heard Qi Yuan say: "The Palace of Light is too weak, just a bunch of Purple Mansion cultivators. So, I take back what I said earlier. You're not a branch of the Palace of Light, you're the main Palace of Light! And you're not about to meet your maker, you're already on your way to meeting your maker!"</p><p></p><p>The smile on the face of the Ancient God Alliance leader completely froze, and that hint of killing intent was no longer concealed.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of the bigger picture, I won't hold what you just said against you," the Ancient God Alliance leader spoke.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lazily said, "For the sake of the bigger picture, please just go and die."</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, Qi Yuan clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Dusk, Fire Lotus, send these three from the Ancient God Alliance to meet their maker!"</p><p></p><p>Following Qi Yuan's figure, two terrifying figures suddenly appeared near him.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura swept out and permeated the area at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The face of the Ancient God Alliance leader changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>"Dusk... how did you become a great sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>"And Fire Lotus... what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The faces of the ancient gods from the Ancient God Alliance all underwent drastic changes.</p><p></p><p>Just a few days ago, they had seen Venerable Dusk and Venerable Fire Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Both were at the second step of heaven-treading, still quite far from the third step.</p><p></p><p>Now... how had they become great sovereigns?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>While Qi Yuan was conversing with the Black Deer Martial Lord, nearly 400 peak Martial Kings gathered at the base of the Sky-Reaching Tower.</p><p></p><p>These peak Martial Kings came from various strongholds. They now stood quietly together, divided into different factions.</p><p></p><p>Since the Ancestral Blood competition was of great importance, no one dared to speak loudly or act out of line.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, these people appeared quite calm. But in reality, they were extremely excited internally, with varying looks in their eyes, some filled with wild ambition.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a snake-like creature spoke in a mechanical voice: "The examiners have arrived. Bow to the examiners!"</p><p></p><p>As its voice rang out, 36 thick beams of light descended from the top of the tall tower.</p><p></p><p>Each beam of light represented a powerful Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords sat at the top of the high tower, with only a trace of their aura leaking out in the form of light.</p><p></p><p>The nearly 400 peak Martial Kings present quickly lowered their heads and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the examiners!"</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to look at these examiners at all, keeping their heads lowered cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, even if some were bold enough to raise their heads to look, they wouldn't be able to see anything except the auras leaked by these Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The light beams appeared for only a moment before disappearing, like deities residing high in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The snake-like creature spoke again: "Pay respects to the Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>All the high officials immediately turned to face south, their expressions reverent as they bowed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>After the bow.</p><p></p><p>The snake-like creature announced: "Let the Ancestral Blood competition begin!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, an iron gate slowly opened at the base of the high tower.</p><p></p><p>The peak Martial Kings in the arena all became excited.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I will definitely make it into the top ten in the Ancestral Blood competition!"</p><p></p><p>"My name will surely be among the top thirty!"</p><p></p><p>"I too will eventually ascend the throne and become that supreme Martial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Some thought of the Martial Lords atop the high tower, their hearts filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Yan, this time in the Ancestral Blood competition, my ranking will definitely surpass yours!" Just then, a man in black clothes blocked Mu Yan's path, his eyes filled with domineering confidence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing who it was, Mu Yan smiled casually: "My goal has never been to surpass you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the man in black's gaze flickered as he thought of something: "You're quite similar to that Qi Yuan. Back then, in the Mountain and Sea Scroll, he said the same thing to me.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was high and mighty, not taking anyone seriously at all. He took away the mission target and did as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>But what about now? After entering the Origin Land, without a Martial Lord's imprint, he can only lurk in hiding like a thief, not daring to show his face.</p><p></p><p>Since you've said similar words, it seems you'll meet the same fate as him."</p><p></p><p>The man in black knew Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had encountered Qi Yuan in the previous mission.</p><p></p><p>He had long heard of Qi Yuan's reputation.</p><p></p><p>When other bloodline wielders chose to go sightseeing, waiting for Qi Yuan to kill all the demons and complete the mission, he was dissatisfied and wanted to challenge Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He told Qi Yuan that he would complete this mission, and that he was also a goal that Qi Yuan could not surpass.</p><p></p><p>The result was miserable. Qi Yuan said something similar to what Mu Yan had just said, and then easily defeated the man in black.</p><p></p><p>"If he had Ancestral Blood, you wouldn't even be fit to tie Qi Yuan's shoes," Mu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he actually felt sorry for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was the most talented martial artist he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that even if the dozens of Martial Kings on the ship joined forces, they probably wouldn't be a match for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was that he didn't have Ancestral Blood.</p><p></p><p>"After experiencing so much in the Mountain and Sea Scroll, don't you understand that one's background is also a form of strength?" the man in black said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Having a Martial Lord's imprint meant that the Ancestor was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan fell silent and didn't argue further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, screen-like objects appeared at the top of the high tower.</p><p></p><p>The appearances and conversations of all the peak Martial Kings below appeared on them.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord smiled and said: "Have any of you spotted any promising seedlings?"</p><p></p><p>One Martial Lord said: "This Li Fan fellow seems ordinary at first glance, living up to his name, but upon closer inspection he shows outstanding potential. He has the makings of a great Martial Lord, quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>"I think Zhuge Yu is not bad, he looks very intelligent at first sight.</p><p></p><p>On the path of martial arts, besides talent and bloodline, wisdom is also very important."</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords casually evaluated the juniors.</p><p></p><p>To them, those juniors below had no secrets at all.</p><p></p><p>A single glance was enough to see everything.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Martial Lords discuss below, Black Deer Martial Lord turned to Qi Yuan at his side and casually asked: "Brother Qi, who do you think is promising?"</p><p></p><p>"If you ask me, that one named Mu Yan is not bad," Qi Yuan said casually. "However, don't give him any special treatment just because I mentioned his name. I'm just mentioning him casually because I'm more familiar with him."</p><p></p><p>He had always been a rule-abiding person who valued fairness.</p><p></p><p>So even though he mentioned Mu Yan out of personal feelings, he still added a sentence not to give him any special treatment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he was truly a thoughtful and perfect person.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is it him? Indeed, he has a good appearance and outstanding demeanor," Black Deer Martial Lord praised after glancing at Mu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords below also glanced at Mu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a burly Martial Lord's eyes flashed with a trace of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yan was a blood descendant of his, how did this Lord Qi Yuan know him?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they seemed quite familiar?</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Suddenly, he thought of this blood descendant's request, and a shock of realization flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, in the Mountain and Sea Scroll, without Ancestral Blood, one cannot break through to become a Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we Martial Lords cannot leave the Origin Land at all.</p><p></p><p>It must be a coincidence of the same name.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, that Qi Yuan also has some connection with this lord."</p><p></p><p>This Martial Lord thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He calculated in his heart that he should increase the cultivation resources for Mu Yan and try to befriend Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"If there are those I think are promising, naturally there are those I don't think highly of. See that one wearing the black robe? I don't think much of him.</p><p></p><p>Look at how long his legs are, when he walks his buttocks bounce up and down, which clearly shows...</p><p></p><p>His buttocks are afraid of heights.</p><p></p><p>With buttocks afraid of heights, the person naturally can't avoid it either.</p><p></p><p>The trial grounds are in a high tower, the higher you go the taller it gets. With his fear of heights, he definitely won't be able to achieve good results."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan analyzed seriously, like a scholar, explaining in great detail.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Silence. The many Martial Lords fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Buttocks afraid of heights?</p><p></p><p>Could a peak Martial King be afraid of heights?</p><p></p><p>What Senior Qi Yuan said... didn't even confuse people anymore.</p><p></p><p>However, since he had said so, there must be some reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord laughed softly: "Lord Qi's words make a lot of sense."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had just joined the Eastern Alliance, and was still such a powerful expert, so they had to give him face.</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't think highly of that person, and even gave a reason.</p><p></p><p>Even if this reason sounded ridiculous, he had to take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I've always been a reasonable person, never speaking without basis, and acting based on practice," Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Black Deer Martial Lord smiled politely.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords on the scene all remained silent, with no one mourning for that man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>However, being singled out by Qi Yuan, his fate would certainly be miserable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Does this Ancestral Blood... have anything to do with the Myriad Beasts Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The native Ancestor Beasts of the Myriad Beasts Realm had disappeared, probably coming to this world.</p><p></p><p>Hearing "Myriad Beasts Realm", Black Deer Martial Lord's expression changed slightly, then he said: "It seems Lord Qi has also lived for an extremely long time, to actually know about the Ancestor Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Lord's partner was an Ancestor Beast.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, she was the Lord of the Ancestor Beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, during the calamity back then, all the Ancestor Beasts died in battle.</p><p></p><p>We, to some extent, can be considered the descendants of the Ancestor Beasts. The source of our bloodlines is the Ancestor Beasts."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Qi Yuan didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>The two also stopped their conversation.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords present were either watching the competition in the tower, chatting idly, or resting with their eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>As chief examiners, if it weren't for Qi Yuan's arrival, they wouldn't even have come in person, but would have just sent an avatar to muddle through.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, they're comparing too slowly. When will the Wall of Dongju appear? I want to see what the legendary Dongju actually looks like," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>He was only interested in Dongju and the Spiritual Realm Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Qi is bored, you could go into closed-door cultivation here. By the time you open your eyes, it will probably be over," the Black Deer Martial Lord said casually. </p><p></p><p>For Martial Lords like them, spending thousands of years in closed-door cultivation was very normal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, due to the existence of the Dawn's Call and Dongju's orders, they rarely truly went into seclusion during these thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Closed-door cultivation is impossible. I'll just go online instead," Qi Yuan said, then closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although he was currently in the Origin Realm without internet, it didn't affect his ability to go online at all.</p><p></p><p>He still had his divine infant.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant could help him go online.</p><p></p><p>He could also receive information.</p><p></p><p>In the End Realm, Qin Yuan Kingdom, Wu Qi, who was originally planning to explore ruins, suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, I apologize, but something has come up. I won't be going to the ruins this time."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Wu Qi's form dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>When she reappeared, she was in a hotel.</p><p></p><p>Taking out a computer, she made a post:</p><p></p><p>"Question: How do you build the underworld?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Tianxuan Sect building.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi stared at the cat in front of her with wide eyes, her pupils filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is she... Senior Aunt?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang's eyes were smiling, the joy on her face not yet faded: "Yes, I didn't expect her to restart... as a cat."</p><p></p><p>Although the senior sister she had always admired had become a... useless cat, and the sect's pressure hadn't been alleviated, she was still happy to see her long-lost senior sister alive.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe I petted Senior Aunt!" Wang Zhiqi murmured, feeling a bit scared. "Senior Aunt won't blame me, will she?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't. This cat is magnanimous and won't hold it against you!" With Xie Tang's help, Xie Xinsu could now speak human language.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Zhiqi breathed a sigh of relief: "That's good."</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Xie Xinsu called out: "Meow, this cat won't hold it against you, but hehe meow, it's time to avenge the humiliation suffered over so many years. Everything this cat has lost should be reclaimed!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu stood up on her hind legs, standing like a human, her front paws awkwardly on her hips, looking "imposing".</p><p></p><p>For so many years, not only had she been forced to make short videos, but she also often watched videos.</p><p></p><p>She particularly enjoyed those revenge dramas about returning to the country.</p><p></p><p>At that time, beating up enemies and shocking them would definitely feel great.</p><p></p><p>See? The cat you once humiliated and looked down upon is actually the great senior sister of Tianxuan Sect! Xie Xinsu looked at Wang Zhiqi: "You followed the account, so you should know best how much I've suffered.</p><p></p><p>In that house, I endured endless humiliation, forced to make videos every day, with no cat rights at all.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, I only had one day off, not even two days off a week.</p><p></p><p>Once, this cat secretly called the labor bureau, but they didn't even listen to me.</p><p></p><p>This kitty suffered a great injustice.</p><p></p><p>Junior sister, you must support your senior sister!</p><p></p><p>Your senior sister's days of suffering are finally over!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi was startled and quickly said: "Senior Aunt, actually Brother Qi Yuan... treated you quite well, and took care of you for so many years?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's name, Xie Xinsu's cat face changed slightly: "Hmph, he allowed Zero One to bully me, that's his crime too.</p><p></p><p>He offended me, he's done for, I want him to... feed me ten bags of cat food a day!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhiqi blinked, then smiled lightly: "Okay, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang smiled indulgently.</p><p></p><p>Although her senior sister seemed a bit silly now, she was still her senior sister after all.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan can be forgiven, but the robot Zero One is unforgivable. This cat wants it to be my slave, making videos every day, working 996 every day, without even one day off!" Xie Xinsu said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang said indulgently: "Alright, I'll take you to get revenge now!"</p><p></p><p>"Bring more cat food, wuwu, this cat traveled over a thousand miles to find this place, all this suffering must be repaid on Zero One's head!" Xie Xinsu said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll teach them a good lesson!" Xie Tang said.</p><p></p><p>Of course, considering they had taken care of her senior sister for so many years, she would remember their kindness and not be too harsh.</p><p></p><p>But there still needed to be a small punishment.</p><p></p><p>After all, her senior sister had suffered for so many years!</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>The figures of two women and a cat appeared in the Jun'an residential area.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu was excited: "Hmph, hahaha this cat is back.</p><p></p><p>See that dog? Last time when this cat escaped, it bullied me, even farting at me!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu saw a pet dog and was quite excited.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of robot Zero One's absence, she had escaped from her cage.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as she left the residential area, she was bullied by this dog.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xie Tang smiled helplessly: "Zhiqi, I'll leave it to you."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master," Wang Zhiqi left, but before leaving she said in a low voice, "Master, Brother Qi Yuan is really good, don't be too harsh."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Xie Tang nodded, "I'm a reasonable person too."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she carried Xie Xinsu towards Qi Yuan's room.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, that robot is really bad. After we lock her up, don't give her any charge, let her starve for a few days. Only when she kneels and begs this cat will I show mercy," Xie Xinsu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem," Xie Tang said.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she appeared outside Qi Yuan's room.</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in her eyes: "No one in the room?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't sense any living presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Xinsu was already laughing triumphantly: "Open the door, open the door quickly, your queen has returned!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her paws kept knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the closed door opened.</p><p></p><p>A robot's face appeared, looking at Xie Xinsu, its machine-like face showing a human-like smile: "Little cat, you've finally come home.</p><p></p><p>Mm, there are still 300 videos that haven't been made. You'll have to work hard these few days and make them all."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the familiar and "cruel" voice, Xie Xinsu became furious: "See, junior sister, this robot Zero One has no conscience at all, actually wanting me to continue making videos.</p><p></p><p>Junior sister, quickly subdue her, she has to make all these videos!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, why aren't you saying anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and do something!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Tang's eyes were wide open, her body trembling involuntarily. She looked at robot Zero One in shock: "Sen... senior..."</p><p></p><p>She suddenly remembered the exploration last time, that powerful senior.</p><p></p><p>At least at the level of Yin God realm.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, what's wrong with you, why are you calling this hateful robot senior?" Xie Xinsu didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang gritted her teeth, her starry eyebrows trembling: "Senior sister... it might be a servant of a deity."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, how could it be!" Xie Xinsu's worldview collapsed.</p><p></p><p>How could Zero One possibly be a servant of a deity.</p><p></p><p>How could the master possibly be a deity?</p><p></p><p>"Come make videos quickly, our account hasn't been updated for a long time. If we don't make money soon, your cat food will be stopped," Zero One grabbed Xie Xinsu.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang didn't dare to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she had a feeling that even if she resisted, she might not be a match for this robot.</p><p></p><p>"Sen... senior, this is my senior sister..." Xie Tang still gritted her teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, the master has always been kind-hearted and won't hurt it, just let it make videos.</p><p></p><p>Look, it's so obedient and well-behaved in the videos, which shows it still enjoys it."</p><p></p><p>"No, junior sister, wuwu, meow, save me!" </p><p></p><p>However, no matter how much Xie Xinsu cried out, she couldn't break free.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, suddenly, a strong sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang couldn't help but look up at the sky, and Zero One also raised its head, eyes calm.</p><p></p><p>Only to see countless small fireworks seemingly exploding in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?" Xie Tang had a bad feeling.</p><p></p><p>"The Eye of the Sky... has been destroyed," Zero One replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

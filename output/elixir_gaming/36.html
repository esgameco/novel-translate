        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My golden elixir... is in the sky!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted loudly, wielding his great treasure sword and launching eight slashes in the summer. Elder Xuanfeng felt a great threat and did not dare to block this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>He was even more shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"You are not a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, he discovered something.</p><p></p><p>The shock in his heart became even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Not Foundation Establishment, yet able to easily defeat Foundation Establishment! Does such a Qi Condensation cultivator exist in this world?</p><p></p><p>This is too monstrous! "No, I am Foundation Establishment, I have a golden elixir!" Qi Yuan hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the three-way battle looked quite comical, like a fight between elementary school students.</p><p></p><p>The magical battle could not attract the attention of the Black Mountain Sect disciples, but the content of the argument was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded the great treasure sword, beating the two of them.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten breaths, he had completely taken control of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Elder Xuanfeng unleashed a Dao technique, as if he had perceived something, his eyes widening.</p><p></p><p>He realized something: "You are not Foundation Establishment!"</p><p></p><p>He finished saying this and suddenly shouted, "Quickly, flee, this is not human!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I am not Foundation Establishment, I am Foundation Establishment!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally would not give the Foundation Establishment elders a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>A sword strike from top to bottom, opening the heavenly gate, directly splitting the two Foundation Establishment elders into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The steps of dismemberment were not even there.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened too quickly.</p><p></p><p>The two Foundation Establishment elders had just fought with Qi Yuan for more than ten breaths, and they were slain.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect, including the sect master, had a total of only seven Foundation Establishment Perfected Ones.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Jiao had died.</p><p></p><p>Two more had just perished.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, the Black Mountain Sect only had four remaining Foundation Establishment elders.</p><p></p><p>The losses of the Black Mountain Sect were nearly half.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other powerful figures in the Black Mountain Sect had finally stopped watching the show, or had come out of their closed-door cultivation, and arrived at the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>The leader was the sect master of the Black Mountain Sect, the Daoist Black Wind.</p><p></p><p>He wore a gray robe, with white hair and a youthful appearance, making it hard to imagine that this old man had taken an adopted father.</p><p></p><p>Jade Linglong stood by Black Wind's side, curiously staring at Qi Yuan, occasionally throwing a coquettish glance.</p><p></p><p>The other two Foundation Establishment elders had solemn expressions, staring at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Black Wind looked at the ruins on the ground, his gaze unchanged: "Sir, your attack on the mountain gate has gone a bit too far.</p><p></p><p>Our Black Mountain Sect, though a small sect, has Patriarch Jiao as my adopted father.</p><p></p><p>If you leave now, this matter can be let go.</p><p></p><p>In the past, we of the Black Mountain Sect exterminated your entire family, and now you have killed three of our Foundation Establishment elders, which is enough to cancel it out."</p><p></p><p>Black Wind could bend and yield, showing weakness to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan did not move, he was examining the people of the Black Mountain Sect, thinking about how to quickly kill them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan remain silent, Black Wind continued: "If you still insist on entanglement, our Black Mountain Sect is not a soft persimmon either. In the end, who will live or die is still unknown!</p><p></p><p>And Patriarch Jiao is my adopted father, do you know that?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's brow furrowed: "You killed my whole family and now threaten me, do you really think I'm someone who grew up eating candy?"</p><p></p><p>Black Wind was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the veiled Jade Linglong laughed, full of charm: "Little brother is quite interesting. If you are willing to spare the Black Mountain Sect, I... am willing to accompany you for a night of romance for the sake of the sect."</p><p></p><p>Black Wind's brow furrowed slightly, but he said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and shouted loudly: "Using the beauty scheme, truly despicable.</p><p></p><p>Today, I must exterminate all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not want to argue further, he directly took action.</p><p></p><p>Arguing was too boring.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was that Qi Yuan was not proficient in arguing, and had never won a verbal battle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Black Wind's face turned cold: "It seems that you, sir, are really seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Black Wind did not waste words either, he directly took out a formation flag and threw it into the air.</p><p></p><p>"Formation, activate!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he activated the sect's grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the Qi Refining disciples' faces turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment executives were a bit better, but their faces were still somewhat ashen.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the four Foundation Establishment elders, their complexions were ruddy, and their auras had become more majestic.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect's formation was draining the cultivation of all the disciples and executives, and channeling it into the Foundation Establishment elders.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the strength of the four elders had risen to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these people, and forcefully swung his great treasure sword.</p><p></p><p>Black Wind saw this and was not flustered at all. Now, he felt that he had reached the late stage of Foundation Establishment, and a round golden elixir flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Taste my strike!"</p><p></p><p>Black Wind took action, unleashing the strongest golden elixir strike.</p><p></p><p>The golden elixir is the most precious treasure of Foundation Establishment cultivators, and the culmination of Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing this technique, Black Wind seemed to have the victory in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"The golden elixir I have formed is of the middle third grade, a solid iron golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>This elixir is the most sturdy, even a Spirit Embryo cultivator cannot easily shatter it in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Your Dao techniques are exquisite, with constantly emerging killing moves, and your experience in magical battles far surpasses ours.</p><p></p><p>If I were to engage you in a protracted battle, I would surely be broken one by one.</p><p></p><p>So I will use this golden elixir to overwhelm all techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Black Wind did not have much experience in magical battles, his biggest advantage was that his cultivation realm was higher than the opponent's.</p><p></p><p>So he used the most reliable move, using the solid iron golden elixir to suppress the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scoundrel could almost crush the cultivators of lower realms.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qi Yuan saw the Jindan, his eyes lit up: "You don't even have a soccer ball, yet you want to subdue me!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist Black Wind might have to fight Qi Yuan for a long time if they were to engage in a proper spell battle.</p><p></p><p>But if he were to take out the Jindan?</p><p></p><p>That would be embarrassing!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's knife was specialized in slicing Jindans!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique! Qi Yuan once again unleashed his powerful skill.</p><p></p><p>Radiant as the sun and moon, the energy converged on his body.</p><p></p><p>The massive sword suddenly shattered, revealing the form of a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Daoist Black Wind was stunned.</p><p></p><p>A kitchen knife?</p><p></p><p>But before he could react further, his mind was filled with a frantic warning.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively tried to retrieve the Jindan.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late!</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife struck the Jindan, not even making a sound of metal clashing.</p><p></p><p>It sliced through the Jindan as easily as cutting an egg, shattering the Daoist Black Wind's Jindan.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist Black Wind's eyes widened, wanting to say something but unable to utter a word. His aura plummeted, death looming near.</p><p></p><p>"How... is this possible!" </p><p></p><p>The Daoist Black Wind was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>His Jindan, a solid iron Jindan the size of a mountain, had been sliced by a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Such immense power condensed into an egg-sized Jindan, yet it had been so easily destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Daoist Black Wind and coldly said, "It's not that I'm too strong, but your Jindan is too small."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also reflected inwardly. In the future, when refining Jindans, he must make them larger, not like the Daoist Black Wind's egg-sized one that could be sliced with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>He said this and, no longer hiding, wielded the kitchen knife, declaring, "Die!"</p><p></p><p>He charged towards the remaining three Elixir Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>His Summer Eight Slashes paid no heed to whether the kitchen knife struck the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>At first, the three Elixir Patriarchs were hesitant, afraid of killing their own disciples.</p><p></p><p>But in just a dozen breaths, they no longer cared, engaging Qi Yuan in a frenzied battle.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Black Mountain Sect, from Foundation Establishment disciples to Altar Executives, were dying and injured one after another.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, wielding the kitchen knife, once again unleashed the Heavenly Slashing Sword Technique, slaying one of the Elixir Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Another Elixir Patriarch, already severely wounded, was then ambushed and devoured of his Elixir by Jade Lotus, who used it to restore her own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, the only remaining Elixir Patriarch of the Black Mountain Sect was Jade Lotus.</p><p></p><p>The black veil was stained with blood, her clothes tattered, exposing a large expanse of her voluptuous bosom.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, pitiful and alluring, her eyes flashing with charm: "Sir, could you spare this humble maiden's life?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Qi Yuan ignored her, the kitchen knife slashing furiously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jade Lotus continued, "Sir, you have a grudge against the Black Mountain Sect, and now most of its people have perished. Why must you still linger with me?</p><p></p><p>Although I am an Elder of the Black Mountain Sect, I have no true feelings for it."</p><p></p><p>"Demonic woman, die!" Qi Yuan growled.</p><p></p><p>Jade Lotus was filled with fear, knowing that if this continued, she would be dead within ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>She steeled her heart and quickly said, "I have a secret I can tell the Benefactor!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paid no heed.</p><p></p><p>Jade Lotus grew desperate: "In truth, I have a Violet Bamboo constitution. Even until now, I have not lost my primal yin, maintaining my maiden's purity.</p><p></p><p>The Black Chicken Demonic Elder has coveted my primal yin, investing vast resources to cultivate me, all for the purpose of transforming me into a Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Once I reach the Divine Infant realm, he intends to cultivate with me, obtaining my primal yin, and thus have the chance to step into the legendary Purple Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the Benefactor is willing to spare my life, I will serve as your slave and give you my primal yin, helping you achieve the Purple Palace Immortal Destiny!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this: "The Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jade Lotus's heart rejoiced: "As long as the Benefactor is willing to indulge in carnal pleasures with me, you can step into the Divine Infant realm today. And if you wait for me to mature into a Divine Infant, and then cultivate with me, you may have the chance to enter the Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Her voice became more alluring as she saw Qi Yuan no longer attacking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, "So you are the Black Chicken Demonic Elder's resource? I cannot let you live!</p><p></p><p>The Black Chicken Demonic Elder at the Divine Infant realm is already so terrifying, let alone the Purple Palace Realm!"</p><p></p><p>He then directly severed Jade Lotus's head with the kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Jade Lotus's head flew off, and Qi Yuan split her Jindan as well.</p><p></p><p>Jade Lotus was dead beyond all doubt.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jade Lotus's corpse, relieved: "I was so scared. Good thing she said she had a Violet Bamboo constitution.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if I had killed her and fled, and the Black Chicken Demonic Elder came, who knows if he could have retrieved her physical body.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if that body could have helped someone enter the Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about this, taking out a specially-made corpse-dissolving liquid and pouring it on Jade Lotus's body.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Jade Lotus became a puddle of water.</p><p></p><p>"This way, the Black Chicken Demonic Elder shouldn't be able to take her primal yin," Qi Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>"But still, it's not safe enough!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then lit a fire, drying the puddle and storing the soil in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>After busying himself for a while, Qi Yuan looked at the Black Mountain Sect, his eyes filled with killing intent: "There are still some disciples alive, I need to deal with them thoroughly, then ransack their library and flee quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist Black Wind had set up formations, and after Jade Lotus and the other Elixir Patriarchs fought Qi Yuan to try to improve their strength, they had forcibly drained the cultivation of the remaining disciples.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples had become dried corpses, but a small number were still alive.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Qi Yuan would not spare them.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

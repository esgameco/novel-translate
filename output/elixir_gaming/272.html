        <h1>Chapter 272</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Beside the leader of the Divine Flower Society stood over twenty grim-faced yin spirits. They were all yin spirits from the Shadowy Realm who had long secretly pledged allegiance to Dark Sun along with the Society's leader. They all looked at Qi Yuan as if he were already dead.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought we'd have the fortune to witness the fall of such a peerless great master!" </p><p></p><p>They were merely Venerable Ones, utterly insignificant before a great master. And even more insignificant before the controller of Dark Sun. Now seeing Qi Yuan, they spoke with even more mockery.</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating for so many years, your perspective is still so narrow, like a nobody," Qi Yuan also raised the banner of having a grand perspective. </p><p></p><p>He didn't waste any more words, but let out a great shout:</p><p></p><p>"My enemies, come out and face death!"</p><p></p><p>This voice was like thunder, shaking the entire Wind Thunder Valley secret realm. Even space itself seemed to wrinkle. The sound was so vast it could kill the people of an entire nation. </p><p></p><p>The faces of those yin spirit Venerable Ones turned pale, because just the voice alone shook their spirits and made their divine power fluctuate. It felt as if they were facing an overwhelming demon.</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Divine Flower Society leader also changed rapidly. </p><p></p><p>He had thought the gap between his strength and the Blood-Robed Sword God's was large, but he didn't expect it to be this large. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps... the Blood-Robed Sword God was not far from mythical status.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're in such a rush to die, this old man will oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society leader let out a great shout. Above him, a mechanical bird appeared.</p><p></p><p>"You are very strong, but I have 36 pig slaves as powerful as the Lei family's Four Generals. Come forth!"</p><p></p><p>With the Divine Flower Society leader's voice, the ground of Wind Thunder Valley shook and cracked open. One by one, terrifying figures emerged.</p><p></p><p>A two-headed man wielding a golden spear, with no eyeballs in his eye sockets, wearing tattered armor that seemed to have endured millions of years, utterly decayed.</p><p></p><p>A giant dragon-elephant roared, each of its hooves as large as a small mountain. </p><p></p><p>One terrifying expert after another appeared, their auras oppressively powerful.</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes as he etched the appearance of each puppet into his memory.</p><p></p><p>Because in life, these puppets had all been mythical experts who resisted the great calamity. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after death they were refined into puppets to bring disaster upon the world.</p><p></p><p>Today, after they perish, perhaps no one in the world will remember them.</p><p></p><p>"Are these pig slaves enough to kill you?" The Divine Flower Society leader was utterly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-six experts comparable to those at the sixth step of Heaven Treading - such an accumulation was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He had learned from those great figures in the upper realm that even there, not every world had such an accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Without mythical figures appearing, these thirty-six Heaven Treading sixth step experts could sweep across the world.</p><p></p><p>Even mythical figures would have to retreat when faced with thirty-six reckless Heaven Treading sixth step experts.</p><p></p><p>"First, they are not pig slaves. Second, it's not enough. Finally, I'm in a hurry to attend my own funeral feast, so hurry up!" </p><p></p><p>He who possessed the Primordial Seed was about to die. If he didn't get to eat at his own funeral feast, wouldn't that be a waste?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't know if he would have a funeral ceremony, or if anyone would attend.</p><p></p><p>"Insane ravings!" The Divine Flower Society leader's gaze was mocking. "In that case, this old man will send you off to your funeral. </p><p></p><p>Come forth, Four Divine Generals of Heaven Felling!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society leader let out a great roar, his face filled with fanatical fervor.</p><p></p><p>In life, the Four Divine Generals of Heaven Felling had all been powerful mythical figures not far from the Yang Spirit realm. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, after being refined into puppets, they wouldn't have been able to retain mythical level combat power.</p><p></p><p>The four of them were Wind Thunder Valley's strongest trump card!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw waves of disturbance coming from the void ahead. </p><p></p><p>Space seemed to warp like a wall, with four windows being torn open. At this moment, four powerful figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these four, Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly turned cold again.</p><p></p><p>Because on the powerful bodies of these four, not a stitch of clothing could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Two men and two women, completely naked, their skin like ancient bronze or snow-white satin.</p><p></p><p>But on them... were traces of damage.</p><p></p><p>Like the long-haired man, whose throat had a hole that seemed to have been filled with some kind of metal, but blood still seemed to be seeping out.</p><p></p><p>Some had arms that had long been broken off, forcibly sewn back on with needle and thread, pieced together into their current form.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society leader's expression was both crazed and fanatical. He inserted his finger into the mouth of one of the mythical puppets, as if he were a god ruling the world, with even mythical experts becoming his slaves.</p><p></p><p>"With these four mythical figures appearing... who in this Azure Waves Realm would dare to defy me!"</p><p></p><p>Now in his crazed state, he seemed to think he was a mythical figure himself.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his divine power erupted.</p><p></p><p>The entire Wind Thunder Valley was completely drawn into the virtual realm in this instant.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society leader was not surprised, but arrogantly said: "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Following his order and control, the thirty-six Heaven Treading sixth step great masters all turned to look at Qi Yuan in unison.</p><p></p><p>There was no emotion in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-six divine domains were deployed at this moment, all attacking Qi Yuan together.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of these thirty-six divine domains combined was enough to make even mythical figures avoid their fierce onslaught.</p><p></p><p>"So what if you killed the Lei family's Four Generals? Here there are thirty-six Heaven Treading sixth step experts!"</p><p></p><p>"A one-sided battle is too boring." The Divine Flower Society leader said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rarely agreed with the words of someone he wanted to kill: "Indeed it's boring.</p><p></p><p>However, this isn't your one-sided battle, it's mine!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the long sword in Qi Yuan's hand let out a ringing sound.</p><p></p><p>"Divine domain, open!"</p><p></p><p>He shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, over 5,000 divine infants within his body resonated simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>All the divine domains opened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>These divine domains combined to form a miniature version of a divine domain.</p><p></p><p>This miniature divine domain was the sum of all the divine infants, and also a miniature version of Qi Yuan's divine domain in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the divine domain emerged, heaven and earth shook! The heaven and earth of Wind Thunder Valley changed appearance in this moment.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" The Divine Flower Society leader was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He was also a great master, so of course he knew what divine domains looked like.</p><p></p><p>But the divine domain before his eyes was beyond his understanding.</p><p></p><p>Wind, fire, thunder, lightning... plague, childbirth, calamity...</p><p></p><p>A divine domain was usually the embryonic form of certain rules.</p><p></p><p>A great master could usually only wield one type of divine domain.</p><p></p><p>For each additional type mastered, the difficulty of advancing would double.</p><p></p><p>How many types were in the Blood-Robed Sword God's divine domain before him? Ten?</p><p></p><p>A hundred? </p><p></p><p>A thousand?</p><p></p><p>It was uncountable, utterly uncountable.</p><p></p><p>How could there be a great master with such a divine domain?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't comprehend it, couldn't understand it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Your divine domains... give them to me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan struck with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The divine domains of all thirty-six great masters seemed to be pierced by this one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's divine domain invaded the divine domains of all the puppets.</p><p></p><p>The expected clash of divine domains did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine domain was like a terrifying beast in the darkness, devouring the divine domains of the thirty-six great masters.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society leader had never seen such a sight.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster are you!"</p><p></p><p>The clash of divine domains was supposed to be a naked collision, destruction.</p><p></p><p>How could there be devouring! Devouring divine domains... this was utterly incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented a person was, they could only control one or two different types of divine domains. Rashly devouring divine domains of different attributes would only lead to the shattering of one's divine domain and the extinguishing of divine power.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Blood-Robed Sword God was devouring them!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine domain was the One that gives birth to the myriad things.</p><p></p><p>All beings are me.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even though these puppets were not his people, even though they were not primordial divine spirits.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Yuan was still assimilating and devouring their divine domains.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the president of the Divine Flower Association and smiled coldly: "I am them..."</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association was frightened by that gaze, his heart skipping a beat.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt that those thirty-six pig slaves also seemed to be looking at him with the same smile as the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>He felt an inexplicable fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Four Divine Generals of Heaven-Felling, attack quickly, kill him!" The president of the Divine Flower Association shouted.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that only the four Divine Generals could give him a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>The four Divine Generals received the order, their enormous bodies turning towards Qi Yuan, with endless auras of destruction and death sweeping out.</p><p></p><p>Any one of these four had been an unparalleled expert in life, with the potential to reach the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they perished while resisting the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Even after death, their corpses were refined into puppets by petty people, suffering humiliation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing the four Divine Generals of Heaven-Felling, Qi Yuan was completely calm.</p><p></p><p>"With this sword, I shall armor the four of you!"</p><p></p><p>The wind moved, a sword struck out, a blood light transcending worlds.</p><p></p><p>The entire Wind Thunder Valley was coated in a layer of red.</p><p></p><p>On the originally naked bodies of the four Divine Generals, blood-red armor suddenly appeared, enveloping their forms.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the four Divine Generals also suddenly became somewhat stiff at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the blood sword, his expression calm, like a god of killing.</p><p></p><p>"Some people don't deserve to die wearing clothes!"</p><p></p><p>He struck out with his sword again.</p><p></p><p>Empowered by the micro divine domain, Qi Yuan's sword was no longer just a sword, but a sword of the divine domain.</p><p></p><p>As the sword struck out, rumbling sounds continued.</p><p></p><p>The clothes on the bodies of the more than twenty Yin God Venerable present shattered instantly, cracks appearing on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association could not avoid it either.</p><p></p><p>His eyes revealed a shocked expression: "You... what kind of monster are you?"</p><p></p><p>Living beings have always been in awe of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>Every aspect of the Blood-Robed Sword God's performance exceeded his understanding.</p><p></p><p>There was no such divine domain, no such sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he vaguely felt that those four mythical puppets seemed about to break free from his control.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Qi Yuan did not respond to the president of the Divine Flower Association at all.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with his sword again and again.</p><p></p><p>His divine domain was also continuously infiltrating and spreading into the divine domains of those four Divine Generals.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and stop him, quickly destroy him!" The president of the Divine Flower Association shouted.</p><p></p><p>However, the divine domains of the four Divine Generals of Heaven-Felling seemed undefended against Qi Yuan's devouring, allowing him to consume them.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association was extremely afraid inside.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered what the Blood-Robed Sword God had said, that he was these puppets.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... a terrifying expression appeared in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Blood-Robed Sword God was a collection of the remnant souls of these powerful beings?</p><p></p><p>He had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He would never know that Qi Yuan's micro divine domain was a combination of the Three Pure Ones, a combination of primordial true spirits, and a combination of the Devouring Primal Body.</p><p></p><p>These three terrifying things, enough to move even a Yang God, had created Qi Yuan's divine domain.</p><p></p><p>"No... you were killed once by the Great Calamity, you can be killed a second time!" The president of the Divine Flower Association said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that the resistance of the pig slaves in his hands was getting weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's divine domain was continuously devouring.</p><p></p><p>This was simply an unfair battle.</p><p></p><p>If it continued, he would undoubtedly be defeated.</p><p></p><p>He could only bring up the Great Calamity to intimidate the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, I wasn't raised on Yakult, how could I be scared? Forget about the Great Calamity, even the Tai Huang Palace behind it, I will personally go to destroy!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said softly, his gaze determined.</p><p></p><p>Invincible under heaven, enemies coming from above heaven, right? After killing the Great Calamity, he would go straight to the Tai Huang Palace and directly uproot their nest!</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, but it was proceeding in a one-sided state.</p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths, Qi Yuan's divine domain seemed to have devoured all the divine domains.</p><p></p><p>These puppets seemed to have lost their fighting power.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association could no longer hold back: "Spare me, I am willing to offer the control technique for these meat pigs. In the future, you will have four mythical level servants, as well as thirty-six Great Venerables at the sixth step of heaven-treading!"</p><p></p><p>He naturally didn't have the puppet control technique, he was just stalling for time now, trying to save his life.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at all the puppets, his gaze complex: "These seniors were unwilling to be confined to the Cang Lan Realm in life, fighting for freedom. After their death, how could I control their corpses, not allowing them to be free even in death."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan considered himself lawful good, he couldn't do such things.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words made the president of the Divine Flower Association not understand.</p><p></p><p>He only felt that Qi Yuan was hypocritical, or stupid.</p><p></p><p>Such huge benefits, yet abandoned for the sake of reputation.</p><p></p><p>"If senior is unwilling to control these pig slaves, this old slave is willing to be senior's hand, controlling them on senior's behalf!" The president of the Divine Flower Association quickly said.</p><p></p><p>He had long since lost his backbone, valuing his life above all else.</p><p></p><p>He thought the Blood-Robed Sword God was just seeking fame, so the dirty work could be left to him.</p><p></p><p>"Killing you, I'm afraid of dirtying my hands." Looking at the president of the Divine Flower Association, Qi Yuan's face was full of disgust.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association's face lit up with joy, thinking Qi Yuan was preparing to let him go.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he then heard Qi Yuan's cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I wash my hands diligently every day, not afraid of dirty hands!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the blood-red long sword cut through the sky of Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Yin God puppets did not resist, allowing this sword to pierce towards the president of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yin God Venerables who saw this scene fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>But how could their speed compare to Qi Yuan's sword light, compare to the spreading speed of Qi Yuan's divine domain.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods of the Ghost Sky Realm had long lost their previous smugness, they didn't even make a sound before quietly dying within Qi Yuan's divine domain.</p><p></p><p>As for the president of the Divine Flower Association, he was directly pierced through by Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>"Your divine domain is too dirty, I'm too lazy to devour it, better to just stir it up with one sword."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Qi Yuan's hand rotated clockwise, then counterclockwise, as if the blood-colored long sword was stirring in the intestines of the president of the Divine Flower Association.</p><p></p><p>His body also shattered and disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The president of the Divine Flower Association's face still bore an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He simply didn't understand why the Blood-Robed Sword God would rather give up such great benefits than kill him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the Yin Gods of the Ghost Sky Realm had fallen at Qi Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the blood sword, looking at the thirty-six Great Venerables who had tread the heavens and the four mythical powerhouses before him.</p><p></p><p>His gaze carried a trace of complexity.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan of the Divine Light Sect, today I send you seniors on your way."</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, and the world became blood-colored.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the heavens and earth were bleeding, or perhaps crying.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the puppets did not move, allowing this sword to fall on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>With a crack.</p><p></p><p>Shattered to pieces.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the forty powerhouses finally disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, extinguished in Cang Lan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became even more profound, he lowered his head and murmured: "Now... their divine domains have become part of me, doesn't that mean that when I kill the Great Calamity, I am avenging myself."</p><p></p><p>Of course, these once battle-dead powerhouses could not become his divine infants like his people.</p><p></p><p>Saying he was avenging himself by killing the Great Calamity was barely plausible.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was truly busy.</p><p></p><p>Not only busy eating his own banquet, but also busy avenging himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

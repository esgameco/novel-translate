        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The glass on the buildings looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in over a decade, appearing gray and hazy.</p><p></p><p>Inside the building, the handrails on the stairs were greasy and blackened.</p><p></p><p>A man wearing some kind of military uniform looked at the civilian Wen Min and Qi Yuan, and belched: "Old Chen asked me to bring you guys over. It's no problem, but... you'll have to behave yourselves along the way, understand?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the uniformed man lifted his coat, revealing a gun holstered at his waist.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" the burly civilian Wen Min quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't say anything, which was taken as agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Also, according to the rules... you need to hand over your weapons," the uniformed man said, looking at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Wen Min didn't hesitate at all, pulling two guns from his waist and handing them to the uniformed man.</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man glanced at Qi Yuan: "What about you?"</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man looked at the neat and clean Qi Yuan with some confusion in his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clearly wasn't a local, but rather looked like a pampered young master.</p><p></p><p>Why would he come here... to smuggle?</p><p></p><p>"Where are your weapons?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then suddenly grabbed a handful of air and gave it to the uniformed man.</p><p></p><p>"Does this count?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Min was bewildered seeing this.</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man was stunned for a moment, then looked at Qi Yuan: "You're not carrying any weapons?"</p><p></p><p>"As a martial artist, my fists and legs are my weapons, but these... I can't give you," Qi Yuan said very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>When asked to hand over weapons, he directly grabbed a handful of air.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator, even the air here could be used as a weapon.</p><p></p><p>But he had too many weapons, afraid the big guy couldn't handle them all, so he only gave him a handful of air.</p><p></p><p>"You're actually a martial arts practitioner?" The uniformed man smiled, clearly believing Qi Yuan's words. "When I was young, I was also crazy about martial arts. Later I studied for half a year, got an injection, and never practiced again."</p><p></p><p>The injection he mentioned was of course a gene drug.</p><p></p><p>Speaking as someone with experience, he said: "There's no future in practicing martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Yuan could respond, a man behind the uniformed man said: "Who says martial artists are useless? Not long ago, a priest from Wugui country was caught off guard and killed by a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the uniformed man laughed loudly: "The same thing won't happen twice.</p><p></p><p>I may not look like much, but when facing those martial artists at their limits, it's no problem for me to easily take them on one-on-one.</p><p></p><p>If I can't win, I'll just blow their brains out with a gun."</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man spoke casually.</p><p></p><p>His words also largely represented the mainstream view of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Can't compare to gene drugs, let alone guns.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Qi Yuan was sitting in Wen Min's car.</p><p></p><p>His car had been searched, and all weapons had been taken away.</p><p></p><p>"When we get to Wugui country, I'll go find an arms dealer to buy some weapons," the burly Wen Min said to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Without weapons, how could they rescue Kuanghuan, they couldn't even protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>"No need to buy weapons, too flashy, and I can't use them anyway.</p><p></p><p>When we get to Wugui country, you just need to take me to a place where I can see the Wugui military camp, I'll handle the rest," Qi Yuan naturally didn't need weapons.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were many types of weapons on Gongxing, and he probably wouldn't know how to use many of them.</p><p></p><p>Wen Min was stunned, puzzled in his heart. He hesitated for a moment, but finally followed Qi Yuan's instructions: "Everything will be done as Mr. Qi says."</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Mr. Qi had someone inside the Wugui military camp who could rescue the boss? Besides this, he couldn't think of any other possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't imagine that Qi Yuan actually planned to storm into the Wugui military camp single-handedly to rescue the person.</p><p></p><p>The convoy began to move.</p><p></p><p>This smuggling convoy, led by the uniformed man, slowly drove towards Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>There were over twenty vehicles in total, quite an impressive sight, kicking up clouds of dust.</p><p></p><p>Outside the car window was a murky river, as well as various scorched earth. Occasionally, collapsed buildings and shell craters could be seen.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, drones could be seen wandering in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The burly Wen Min glanced at the drones in the sky, his eyes full of dread: "If we weren't following this convoy and encountered these drones, we would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>Even if we're not soldiers from Yuelang country, once killed by the drones, we could still be counted as military achievements by Wugui soldiers."</p><p></p><p>"You're exaggerating. With just these drones, I could take care of them all with one Kamehameha, where's the danger?" Qi Yuan looked at these drones, not concerned at all.</p><p></p><p>Now, he already had the ability to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>The only things that could threaten him were missiles and some weapons above that level.</p><p></p><p>Wen Min was already used to Qi Yuan's way of speaking. He smiled: "Then Mr. Qi, your Kamehameha must be stronger than bullets.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary bullets can't destroy this type of drone."</p><p></p><p>The car drove quickly, and the sound of artillery fire could be heard from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Wen Min explained that this might be border artillery exchanges between Yuelang and Wugui.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, the convoy arrived at a checkpoint in Wugui country.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was a squad of Wugui soldiers stationed.</p><p></p><p>These soldiers were well-armed, wearing bulletproof vests, and conducted an inspection of the convoy.</p><p></p><p>The inspection lasted for half an hour before they were allowed to pass.</p><p></p><p>After passing through, Wen Min breathed a sigh of relief, but also felt uneasy: "Everything depends on Mr. Qi now."</p><p></p><p>Having entered Wugui country, getting out again wouldn't be so simple.</p><p></p><p>Those smugglers only brought them in, they wouldn't help them get out.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." Qi Yuan took a deep breath. He looked out the car window and asked curiously, "What are those red scarves hanging on the trees for? Are these trees... all Young Pioneers?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Min was stunned for a moment, then said: "That's a ritual of the Guiran Holy Religion.</p><p></p><p>Red scarves hanging on trees represent that this area is under the protection of the Wu God."</p><p></p><p>Wugui country was a religious state, where religious power even surpassed royal authority.</p><p></p><p>The holy religion of Wugui country was called Wu Religion, and they worshipped a deity called Wu God.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that over 90% of people in Wugui country believed in Wu God.</p><p></p><p>There was a saying in Wu God's teachings that all heretics should be hanged on trees.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in civilized society, the Wu Religion still wanted to save face and wouldn't blatantly persecute others.</p><p></p><p>Only some fanatics would do such things to persecute others.</p><p></p><p>They would kill heretics, drain their blood completely, dye cloths red with it, and hang them on trees.</p><p></p><p>So, among the red scarves on the trees, some were ordinary red scarves, while others might be the blood of heretics.</p><p></p><p>After entering Wugui territory, the probability of seeing red scarves on trees was quite high.</p><p></p><p>About three hours later, the car finally stopped in a small town.</p><p></p><p>The uniformed man came to Qi Yuan's car and knocked on the window: "I'm only responsible for bringing you here. If you want to leave, contact me, but the price... well... it's a bit expensive, same as those people."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he pointed to a group of disorderly people not far away.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, he left directly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards the disorderly group of people in the distance. Among them were old people, young people, and children.</p><p></p><p>They were dressed in rags.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some were dressed shabbily, while others wore bright clothes.</p><p></p><p>Wenmin explained: "Most of these people are not Guiran natives. They want to leave Wugui country. </p><p></p><p>Now that there's war in Wugui, these people want to leave here.</p><p></p><p>They don't have many options, smuggling convoys are their only way out.</p><p></p><p>However, most people can't afford the fare, so they can only exchange other things. Most people don't even have anything to offer."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept his gaze over those people, his eyes showing curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a closer look."</p><p></p><p>Wenmin was surprised, but without any hesitation, he drove the car towards that group of people.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, along the way, those people reached out their hands, as if trying to pry open the car doors. From outside the car, their voices could also be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Take me with you, please!"</p><p></p><p>"My daughter is very beautiful, she can serve you along the way. Take us away from here!"</p><p></p><p>"I have money!"</p><p></p><p>"Antiques, thousand-year-old relics!"</p><p></p><p>These people shouted, their eyes revealing a desperate look.</p><p></p><p>Most of these people were not Guiran natives, but had come to Wugui country for work, or had entered illegally.</p><p></p><p>Some were in an even more miserable state, having been abducted here.</p><p></p><p>Wugui country was very xenophobic, and these people lived very poorly here.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that Wugui country was at war with Yuelang country.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, to make their statistics look better, Wugui country would even kill a batch of them.</p><p></p><p>So, staying in Wugui country was like being lambs waiting for slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Wenmin couldn't help but sigh: "You can't see scenes like this online. Our people in Qinyuan country... can't see the miserable state of these people either."</p><p></p><p>For these people, their fate may have been sealed from birth, perhaps destined for misfortune.</p><p></p><p>Although Wugui was a religious country, it didn't mean you were one of them just because you believed in their religion.</p><p></p><p>Without Guiran bloodline, you were considered inferior.</p><p></p><p>Who knows when your blood might be drained by fanatics, to dye cloths red and tie them to trees.</p><p></p><p>The car drove slowly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart was calm, without much emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Stop the car."</p><p></p><p>The car stopped.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic voices came through.</p><p></p><p>Some unruly people crowded over: "Boss!"</p><p></p><p>"Get back!" Wenmin spoke, his voice gruff.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, those unruly people dared not make noise anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because they recognized that Qi Yuan's car had come in with the smugglers.</p><p></p><p>Such people had great power.</p><p></p><p>Even if they killed them, no one would care.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned the crowd, his gaze falling on a dark-skinned youth.</p><p></p><p>This youth looked only eleven or twelve years old.</p><p></p><p>He was holding the hand of a little girl, who looked dirty, her hair seemingly unwashed for several months.</p><p></p><p>This girl appeared to be only seven or eight years old.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two, his eyes revealing an interested expression.</p><p></p><p>"Do you two want to leave Wugui?" </p><p></p><p>He said to the youth and the little girl.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's question, the youth's eyes burst with excitement, but then quickly showed fear and caution.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... sir, I... I have no money, but I'm strong and very obedient, I can do hard labor," the youth Yaji said nervously. As he spoke, he shielded the little girl behind him, afraid that Qi Yuan might be someone with perverse intentions.</p><p></p><p>"I can take you out, but... I'll need some of your blood," </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stated his intention.</p><p></p><p>He had discovered that in this world, quite a few people had special blood.</p><p></p><p>For example, Wuqi.</p><p></p><p>And now this youth and little girl.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their specialness was different.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hadn't yet researched what was special about Wuqi's blood.</p><p></p><p>But the specialness of the youth and little girl's blood was obvious - it was of the same origin as Qi Yuan's "bloodline".</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan to break through in his martial arts and improve his martial aptitude, the blood of these two... could be researched and utilized.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were not only incomprehensible to the siblings, even Wenmin didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The youth hesitated for a moment, but finally nodded vigorously and said with a hunched back: "Alright!"</p><p></p><p>No matter what, for them, leaving this place was the safest option now.</p><p></p><p>After all, just a while ago, their parents had already been taken away to serve as "military achievements".</p><p></p><p>Who knows when it would be their turn.</p><p></p><p>Now, their only chance of survival was to follow this car and leave Wugui country first.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Qi Yuan, the dark-skinned youth's face was full of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The dirty little girl seemed scared and dared not look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have anything to bring with you?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The dark-skinned youth had a large bundle on his back, holding his sister's hand. That large bundle was all their family's possessions: "No."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, get in the car," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The dark-skinned youth didn't hesitate at all, leading his sister into the car.</p><p></p><p>The car Wenmin was driving had three rows of seats.</p><p></p><p>The dark-skinned youth and his sister sat in the last row. The youth's face showed a respectful expression, using the phrases that Wugui people loved to say.</p><p></p><p>"May Wu God bless you!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the most generous person!"</p><p></p><p>Yaji wasn't a believer of the Wu religion, but to live in Wugui country, saying "May Wu God bless you" was a must.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "If I wanted to kill that Yang God in Taihuang Palace, could Wu God bless me?"</p><p></p><p>That Yang God in Taihuang Palace was the person behind the great calamity, and also Qi Yuan's strongest enemy in the Canglanjie realm at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Yaji was stunned by Qi Yuan's words, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>The dirty little girl, however, said: "I heard them say Wu God is very powerful, can run while carrying a big mountain, so... he should be able to bless you!"</p><p></p><p>Living in Wugui country, they had naturally been influenced by the propaganda about Wu God's power.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "It's all made up. They couldn't even make up a more powerful deity.</p><p></p><p>Running while carrying a big mountain... that's quite weak."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found that people in this world were very practical.</p><p></p><p>Even their made-up stories weren't too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>For a deity, they didn't dare to make up claims of omnipotence.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure if this was due to being too practical, or if there were deeper reasons.</p><p></p><p>The youth Yaji didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words. He looked out the car window, his mind settling a bit. He secretly asked, "Sir... when will we leave Wugui?"</p><p></p><p>Leaving Wugui country was his greatest wish.</p><p></p><p>In this foreign land, he had no other relatives left except his sister.</p><p></p><p>As for revenge, it was unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>For small figures like them, struggling to survive was already difficult, let alone seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>"After I go pick up a friend, then we'll leave," Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>Wenmin, who was driving, remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why Qi Yuan wanted to bring these two children into the car.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't understand what leverage Qi Yuan had, daring to go to the military camp to bring the boss back.</p><p></p><p>The car drove quickly. Wenmin refueled once along the way, pushing the speed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Following the navigation, the car sped towards the location of the military camp.</p><p></p><p>The number of drones in the sky also increased.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, obviously these drones weren't paying attention to this domestic car.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

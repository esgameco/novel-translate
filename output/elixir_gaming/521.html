        <h1>Chapter 521</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran looked at the newcomer, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Why, why?" </p><p></p><p>He was perplexed. He had answered perfectly before, disguising himself flawlessly. Why then did the Princess still send someone to kill him? Previously, with his status, he would not have feared the Princess at all.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Princess had saved Jining Prefecture, and wanting to kill him was just a small whim of power. </p><p></p><p>He was completely unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>"The Princess said you did not deny being a murderer, a bandit, a villain..." The old man in the black robe said solemnly, the talisman in his palm trembling.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's face showed a bewildered expression: "But! She! Didn't! Ask! Me!"</p><p></p><p>Not being asked how to respond, Xie Danran was filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>Alas, resentment was useless, his body went limp and he died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the black robe looked at him, then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, an old man appeared, a bun still in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the corpse on the ground, pouring out a liquid from his hand.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle.</p><p></p><p>Xie Danran's body dissolved into a pool of water, leaving no trace of his bones.</p><p></p><p>"According to the young master's words, he no longer even has the chance to become a vengeful spirit."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's face wore a despicable smile as he also disappeared into the bamboo forest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Tianxong stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun's expression was terribly gloomy, then he bowed towards Wang Qingyi not far away.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, Danran offended Lingxuan, let me apologize for him."</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had learned of the news of his disciple's demise.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xie Danran had died at the hands of Princess Jiang Yunxi. Although he was angry, he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>First, Jiang Yunxi had slain the Water Lord Luo Tong, carrying a great momentum. </p><p></p><p>Second, new information showed that Luo Tong and Tianxong had deep entanglements, and the Sorrow Wind Master Wei Kun had also perished because of this, with Tianxong not occupying the moral high ground in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Third, the fall of Wei Kun was also a weakening for Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>Since Xie Danran was already dead, he would apologize on behalf of his disciple, to prevent the Shen family from being implicated due to the previous incident.</p><p></p><p>This was the only thing he, as the teacher, could do now.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Wang Qingyi snorted coldly, "Those who do evil will surely perish."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun's face showed an embarrassed expression, changing the subject: "The knife talisman that Princess Yunxi wielded... Do you really think it was shattered as she said?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing about this mysterious knife talisman, Wang Qingyi's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>"It should be fake. I'll say something bold - even with Princess Yunxi's strength, ten of my disciple Lingxuan would not be her match.</p><p></p><p>To slay the Water Lord Luo Tong and the Elder of the Thorny Blood, how difficult it is. </p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that the knife talisman is absolutely terrifying... How could it be shattered?"</p><p></p><p>"With the royal family obtaining this talisman, their strength will greatly increase, and the days of Tianxong and Gulei Gate will not be easy." Zhou Xun sighed.</p><p></p><p>In Ninguo, the royal family was declining, weaker than Tianxong and Gulei Gate, but with the knife talisman, the situation would change.</p><p></p><p>"How did Princess Yunxi obtain this talisman, and which great master created this talisman?" Wang Qingyi was curious, her eyes filled with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>This was a mystery.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone knew that Ninguo currently had no Sky-level artisan.</p><p></p><p>As for the nearby countries, there was also no news of such a great master who would create... a knife-shaped talisman.</p><p></p><p>A knife... seemed too crude.</p><p></p><p>Although this knife was strong enough, in everyone's mind it also seemed ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Xun thought of something and murmured, "This kind of talisman, the people of Luosha Country must also be very interested, I wonder if Princess Yunxi can keep it."</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi's expression changed slightly: "Zhou Xun, no matter what, this is the internal strife of our Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>Whether the knife talisman is in the hands of the royal family or others, it is good for our Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>If you..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister misunderstood, I absolutely will not do such a thing!" Zhou Xun hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Wang Qingyi snorted again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun's forehead was covered in cold sweat, he was a bit anxious, how did he manage to change the topic and still anger his senior sister today? It seems he had to continue changing the topic! He looked at Shen Lingxuan and said calmly, "I heard that the Flower Thief Sect Master Huangshan has been waiting for an opportunity to harm Lingxuan, which is a bit strange, why haven't we seen his trace these days?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if he dares to show up, this old one will not let him get away!" Wang Qingyi said.</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Shen Lingxuan, her face veiled by a light veil, making her features indistinct, but one could still feel an extremely icy and cold aura.</p><p></p><p>She thought of that day at the temple, the young man holding a water sword.</p><p></p><p>About his identity, she was very curious.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Heaven-Human Unity, he was able to easily cut down a peak Earth-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Such strength was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"If he shows up, this old master will not let him go either!" Zhou Xun hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Wang Qingyi sighed, "Lingxuan... Why don't you return to the sect for now."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Body was too domineering, and it was only because Shen Lingxuan had not yet reached the peak Earth-level that she was still safe. Otherwise, even the Sky-level old monsters from other countries would try to seize her.</p><p></p><p>To fully unleash the power of the Yin Body, Shen Lingxuan needed to reach at least the Earth-level, preferably the peak Earth-level.</p><p></p><p>Now, Huangshan Sect Master's whereabouts were unknown, and the Sky-level Armored Soldiers from the Central Luosha Country must also have learned of the events at Yeshi Lake, and might covet Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi had this hidden worry.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's gaze was calm, and she finally nodded: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Within the sect, there was the Dao Master, as well as other Earth-level Armored Soldiers and the formation of Earth-level talismans. Even if a Sky-level Armored Soldier wanted to attack, it would be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her ancestral sword was also in the sect, and if a powerful enemy appeared, she also had some self-defense ability.</p><p></p><p>Now, with wolves lurking all around, it was not good for her to stay outside.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the last time she was about to slay Huangshan Sect Master, she had already revealed the strength of an Earth-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>If it was exposed to that young man, it might stir up a bloody storm.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Body at the late Earth-level was enough to drive a Sky-level Armored Soldier crazy.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan left the hall and returned to her own residence.</p><p></p><p>The tall Zhifeng came to greet her.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan asked, her voice icy cold: "Has your master not returned yet?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Zhifeng shook her head, her face filled with anger, "Your master is really too much, coming to Yeshi Lake without even seeing you, and has now lost his trace!"</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't run into any danger, has he?" Shen Lingxuan asked, then shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Before Qi Shilian's death, he had left a gift for his son Qi Yuan, and ordinary Armored Soldiers could not harm him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm setting out for Tianmu Mountain now, you pack up and come with me." Shen Lingxuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Should we go back home for a while?" Zhifeng asked.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan shook her head: "No, it would only add more worry to my parents."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Shen family stronghold, Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao returned leisurely.</p><p></p><p>This caused quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>But for Qi Yuan, it was not a big deal at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was holding the Divine Wood Token, drinking tea and chatting.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that in these few days, a strange event has occurred in Yeshi Lake in Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>Princess Yunxi wielded a special knife talisman to slay the Water Lord Luo Tong.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Water Snake Elder of the Thorny Blood also perished.</p><p></p><p>Brother Knife, is this knife talisman possibly related to you?"</p><p></p><p>An employee of the Thorny Blood asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>Jiwu Yun saw this and was a bit speechless.</p><p></p><p>"You won't suspect Brother Knife is that knife talisman, right? Talismans don't have their own real consciousness, how can they chat with us? Even if they do, that's a divine artifact, at most the intelligence of a six or seven-year-old child, do you think Brother Knife looks like a child?"</p><p></p><p>This time it was the Thorny Blood employee who was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to say that Brother Knife was the Sky-level artisan who forged the knife talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, you Thorny Blood should compensate me, that Water Snake Elder was so disgusting, I'm applying for mental damage compensation!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Knife, if you come to Shenmu Ravine, I'll compensate you ten thousand taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"You said it, don't go back on your word!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Knife, don't go, Thorny Blood must have laid a heavenly net outside Shenmu Ravine!"</p><p></p><p>"How could that be, I think the people of Thorny Blood are quite nice, and they have money too." Qi Yuan was unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Knife has such good eyesight, we of Thorny Blood have no intention of harming people."</p><p></p><p>"Not harming people? Turning people into vengeful spirits, isn't that harming people?"</p><p></p><p>"Vengeful spirits are just another form of existence for living beings.</p><p></p><p>Just like you, avoiding us Thorny Blood, disguising yourself as a man, isn't that also changing your form of existence?"</p><p></p><p>Jiwu Yun didn't dare to speak anymore.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood employee continued.</p><p></p><p>"Human life is too short, living in this world for only a few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Unless one is blessed by the Heavens, they can live longer.</p><p></p><p>The rest are just passers-by in this world, even if they leave some traces, what does it matter?</p><p></p><p>Becoming a vengeful spirit, at least they can have a lifespan of a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>And... Brother Knife, with your talent, if you join us Thorny Blood, and hand over the Divine Wood Token, we can work together to achieve great things.</p><p></p><p>Our merits are enough to let us go to the Heavens, and be transformed into an immortal, indestructible existence!"</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood employee tempted.</p><p></p><p>"I'm already immortal and indestructible." Qi Yuan directly refused.</p><p></p><p>He was very self-centered, and didn't want to be transformed into a vengeful spirit-like being.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Brother Knife, you misunderstand us Thorny Blood too much, we are not destroying the world, we are actually saving this world.</p><p></p><p>Haven't you noticed that this world is sick?</p><p></p><p>The rulers are unjust, the aristocratic families are rampant, corrupt officials are blatantly disregarding the law, and the common people are living in great hardship."</p><p></p><p>"You're right, the social atmosphere is too corrupted." Qi Yuan deeply agreed.</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood employee's face showed delight: "Is Brother Knife willing to work with us Thorny Blood to change the world?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, your Thorny Blood's atmosphere is not that good either, that old man even wanted to keep me, I'd better change you guys!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it seems Brother Knife is unwilling." The Thorny Blood employee was a bit disappointed, "I thought you were a kindred spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say such disgusting things!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Exiting the Divine Wood Token, Qi Yuan showed a contemplative expression.</p><p></p><p>"According to the current plot information, this Thorny Blood should be considered a minor boss?"</p><p></p><p>"These are not important, the important thing is to improve my strength, and... acting."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, leveling up is too difficult, I'm only at level 119 now."</p><p></p><p>After slaying countless vengeful fish and the Water Lord Luo Tong, Qi Yuan's experience bar reached level 119.</p><p></p><p>Converted to this world, it would be the peak Earth-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>The next step would be the Sky-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>This time, acting as the Knife, he gained more than 20 levels, which was considered slow for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit strange, according to my experience bar, after slaying so many vengeful spirits and the Water Lord Luo Tong, I should have reached level 120, but I haven't... Could it be the doing of the laws of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Wangyue Continent, Qi Yuan had encountered level cap issues before.</p><p></p><p>The experience bar surged, but he couldn't level up.</p><p></p><p>Now, he also encountered the same problem.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the rules of this world."</p><p></p><p>"They need to comprehend Heaven-Human Unity to break through as Armored Soldiers."</p><p></p><p>"So I also need to achieve Heaven-Human Unity?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, there was the experience of a blind artisan breaking through to the Sky-level artisan.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he was originally a great cultivator of the Purple Palace, so this so-called Heaven-Human Unity would be... very easy for him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he entered the state of Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>From Qi Yuan's perspective, the heavens and earth were tranquil.</p><p></p><p>The wind stopped, the rain stopped.</p><p></p><p>The river water ceased to flow.</p><p></p><p>The ripe apples hung motionless in the air.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have merged into this world, becoming one with it.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth flowed in his hands, the origin seemed to approach him like a child.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a feeling that if he just reached out and grasped the origin, he could achieve Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon showed a bitter expression.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-Human Unity, the heavens are vast, and humans are small, so they can be united, but I seem... too big, becoming Heaven-Heaven Unity?"</p><p></p><p>He had already infused his essence blood into this game, and could be considered a shareholder, a creator of this game.</p><p></p><p>When he achieved Heaven-Human Unity, he became Heaven-Heaven Unity.</p><p></p><p>"So, I can't achieve Heaven-Human Unity?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can only... devour others' Heaven-Human Unity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of No Food had once given him the ability to devour the original body, so he had gained the ability to devour.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Human Unity could also be devoured.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to find some Sky-level Armored Soldier white moonlight."</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only achieve Heaven-Heaven Unity, unable to achieve Heaven-Human Unity. To break through the level limit, he needed to slay Sky-level Armored Soldiers and devour their Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was pondering where he could find the lovely white moonlight, but just then, a voice suddenly reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>The voice was ethereal, coming from nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"Infinitesimal, do not seek the lord..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's comprehension abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He immediately exited the state of Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Did I hallucinate again?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the sky, but wanted to find the source of the voice, but there was no discovery.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, who's talking?" Qi Yuan activated his superpower</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hang on." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he took out the Divine Wood Token.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, who knows where the phrase 'Extremely subtle, do not seek' comes from?"</p><p></p><p>When encountering something he didn't understand, he used to be able to ask Baidu or Ai. In the game, of course, he would ask the staff of Thorns of Blood.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Caidao must have been to the Divine Wood Abyss." The staff member of Thorns of Blood seemed quite idle, always the first to respond to the messages.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what does this have to do with the Divine Wood Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"There are words on the Divine Wood Token, Brother Caidao should know."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Xuan Hun." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Wood Token, the front side was written "Wood", and the back was engraved with "Xuan Hun".</p><p></p><p>"At the entrance of the Divine Wood Abyss, there is a broken stele with some words inscribed on it."</p><p></p><p>"Are those the words I mentioned?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, there was Wood, standing quietly Xuan Hun.</p><p>Today I think of you, like Wood awaiting spring.</p><p>Extremely subtle, do not seek."</p><p></p><p>"These are the words engraved on the stele. Yes, the first 'Wood' character is missing a part on the right side, I don't know what character it is."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, 'Wood' and 'Hun' do not rhyme, so it's likely that a character is missing. </p><p>Whose words are these?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"According to the 'Origin Essentials', this may be related to the divine tree in the Divine Wood Abyss." The member of Thorns of Blood calmly sent the message, "These mythological legends are too ancient, why is Brother Caidao suddenly interested in this?"</p><p></p><p>"Because I'm good!" </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital of Ning State, dark clouds loomed.</p><p></p><p>Patter!</p><p></p><p>The sound of hail rang out, a continuous series of sounds.</p><p></p><p>A young man in a purple robe with golden embroidery stretched out his hand, caught a piece of hail, and put it in his mouth to suck on.</p><p></p><p>"The hail of Ning State can't compare to the sweetness of Roshana."</p><p></p><p>An old eunuch in disguise hurriedly said, hunching his body.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because the royal family exists that the hail, the air of Roshana are sweet."</p><p></p><p>"Haha." The Fifth Majesty laughed lightly, very proud.</p><p></p><p>The royal family of Roshana has the surname Fifth.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fifth Yuexian is the true sun of Roshana.</p><p></p><p>After all, since the destruction of the Divine, the royal family of Roshana is unstoppable, they are the true rulers of Roshana!</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, some treacherous people are unwilling to see Roshana so beautiful, and they want to welcome back the Judgment God!" The Fifth Majesty mentioned this, his face turned cold, and a murderous intent emerged.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people also changed their expressions, some even involuntarily trembling.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Judgment God put tremendous pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>Even in the past hundred years, it was a sword hanging over their heads, and no one knew when that sword would fall.</p><p></p><p>"What, are you afraid of Him?" The Fifth Majesty sneered, with a contemptuous look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was born after the destruction of the Divine, and had never seen the Divine.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he had no respect for the Divine.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was young, not even a hundred years old, but had already reached the Heaven-level, and was the youngest Heaven-level Imperial Soldier in the royal family, so he was naturally brilliant and proud.</p><p></p><p>"No." The old eunuch hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a broken object, how could we be afraid?" A burly man said.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty's eyes showed a brilliant smile: "The Divine has been destroyed, even if there are remnants left outside, they are just wandering ghosts. Any one of us can suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, our royal family was able to suppress the Divine before, even if it returns to its full glory, our royal family can suppress it a second time!"</p><p></p><p>The other Heaven-level Imperial Soldiers heard this and all took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to say, Your Highness, don't be so arrogant!</p><p></p><p>The Judgment God in its prime, that was one person suppressing one country.</p><p></p><p>They knew best how the Judgment God fell.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the royal family was dissatisfied with the Judgment God hanging like a sword over their heads, so they planned to join hands with some aristocratic families to deal with the Divine.</p><p></p><p>But how dare they? In the end, they severed their own backbone and colluded with the enemy country, using poison tactics.</p><p></p><p>The Divine was just a tool, following the rules, it was easy to deal with it specifically.</p><p></p><p>So the royal family colluded with the enemy country.</p><p></p><p>The enemy country sent a large army to besiege, and the royal family took the opportunity to summon the Divine.</p><p></p><p>The Divine descended from the sky, but as just a tool, without a master, it could only fight the enemy army outside Fengla City for half a month before being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>And the royal family, using the rules, did not let the Divine return to the city, even if the Divine was damaged, they did not let the divine-level craftsmen repair it.</p><p></p><p>The Divine was just a tool, without any supplies, it was forced to fight the enemy army alone outside Fengla City, and was eventually destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Since then, Roshana has had no Divine, and the sword hanging over the heads of the royal family and the aristocratic families has disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty knew this history, but he had never seen the brutality of that battle, and deep down he looked down on the Divine.</p><p></p><p>But the others were different, they knew the fame of the Divine, and knew the terror of the Divine.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine has indeed been shattered, and now there are some anomalies, it should be some fragments appearing, not to be feared." The burly man said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Divine was long destroyed.</p><p></p><p>With the cruelty of the royal family, how could the Divine survive?</p><p></p><p>After the battle of Fengla City, the royal family searched for the fragments of the Divine, and then gathered three divine-level craftsmen to melt and crush the fragments of the Divine into ashes, making the Divine disappear.</p><p></p><p>And later, they also conducted a large-scale search, looking for the statues of the Judgment God, and destroyed all the statues, completely erasing the Divine.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that even if there are remnants of the Divine fragments left outside, without the statues, without anything else, at most it would be at the Earth-level combat power, and even if the Divine was special, as the number one divine tool of Roshana, it would only be barely at the Heaven-level, which is nothing to the Fifth Majesty.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if it weren't for those rats in the Judgment Association still lingering, the fragments of the Divine are not worth my personal attention." The Fifth Majesty said.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine is not worth mentioning, the Judgment Association is somewhat troublesome, with many Heaven-level Imperial Soldiers inside.</p><p></p><p>If they find the fragments of the Judgment God and gather the power of the entire association to slowly nurture it, who knows, one day the fragments of the Divine may have a trace of divine power and be able to display the power of the divine tool.</p><p></p><p>That would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"After all these years, the Judgment Association still doesn't recognize reality, truly stupid." The burly man said.</p><p></p><p>"Has there been any news of the Divine fragments?" The Fifth Majesty asked.</p><p></p><p>The old eunuch hurriedly said, "In Jiangzhou Ninghe County, there have been traces of the Divine."</p><p></p><p>He told the story of the Red Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty heard this and couldn't help but sneer, "To deal with a few dozen Yellow-level Devilish Spirits, they actually struggled for so long, the fragments of the Divine are really pathetic, there's no need for me to go, even Muo Sanxu, that rootless person, can drown it by pissing on it."</p><p></p><p>The old eunuch Muo Sanxu smiled awkwardly and hunched his body even deeper, "Your Highness is right."</p><p></p><p>"This country is so weak, it seems only they would regard the 'exploits' of the Divine fragments as divine. </p><p></p><p>Even more laughable is that a mere Earth-level peak Devilish Spirit, the whole country is utterly helpless, and it was the Yunxi Princess who wielded a culinary knife to slay it." The Fifth Majesty said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The old eunuch Muo Sanxu hurriedly said, "If Your Highness is interested in that culinary knife, this old servant will go to Eyu Lake to retrieve it for Your Highness right away."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a mere Heaven-level tool, not even worth my attention." The Fifth Majesty's voice was disdainful, "However, I heard there is a Yin-type physique here, I am quite interested.</p><p></p><p>She is the disciple of the Sky Sect, Muo Sanxu, take my imperial decree and go to the Sky Sect, tell them that I wish to give that Yin-type physique a chance, let her be my maid and follow me."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty was tyrannical, emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>In Roshana, there were still people he had to be wary of, but in this Ning State, he was truly unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to pay attention to was the Judgment Association.</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" The old eunuch Muo Sanxu hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>The other Heaven-level Imperial Soldiers had envious expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Your Highness, for obtaining this woman, your cultivation will greatly increase!"</p><p></p><p>"With a Yin-type physique, Your Highness's cultivation must be more profound!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Majesty's smile grew wider: "I hope that Yin-type physique Muo doesn't be ungrateful, she better look good, so as not to disappoint my appreciation."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ruo Tong Water Lord was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Craftsman Assembly ended, but the major families did not leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>This time, many craftsmen and experts gathered, a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Auctions, exchange meetings were held one after another.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, Qi Yuan in a white robe looked like a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, 'Practice your body to be like a crane, and at midnight the palace maids will strangle your neck'... no, that's wrong, you're learning the 'Transformation Turtle Technique', you should imitate the turtle. </p><p></p><p>When cultivating, you need to imitate the turtle's walking, sunbathing." Qi Yuan said to the side of Battle Wenyu.</p><p></p><p>These days, Battle Wenyu had come to ask him to teach the 'Transformation Turtle Technique'.</p><p></p><p>Since Tuzi Gongzi's silver could not buy the rest of the Light Swords, he also spent money to buy the 'Transformation Turtle Technique' to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Imitate the turtle's walking?" </p><p></p><p>Battle Wenyu had great talent, and immediately lay down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Is this right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your comprehension is good, the key to the turtle's walking is in the word 'slow'."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Xiansheng's teaching is good." Battle Wenyu flattered.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Tuzi Gongzi blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't witnessed Qi Yuan's strength, he might really think Qi Yuan was a fraud.</p><p></p><p>Learning to walk like a turtle, this is called cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"But you need to go further." Qi Yuan said, and pushed Battle Wenyu.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Battle Wenyu flipped over like a turtle.</p><p></p><p>He was about to struggle to his feet, when he heard Qi Yuan say, "When a turtle is flipped over, it's very hard for it to flip itself back. This is a key point you need to remember."</p><p></p><p>Battle Wenyu heard this and felt it made sense, so he lay there with his four legs up, motionless.</p><p></p><p>Tuzi Gongzi stood quietly beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Tuzi Jingshi, do you know where there are a lot of Heaven-level Imperial Soldiers, especially the evil ones?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was now eager to seize others' Heaven-Human Unification, and advance further.</p><p></p><p>"This... I don't know." Tuzi Gongzi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>There were no Heaven-level Imperial Soldiers in Ning State, how would he know where there were a lot of them.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the difficulty of life, Ning State is lazy to the core, the Imperial Soldiers are not even diligent, not even the mosquitoes are diligent."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Qi Yuan killed a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"If this mosquito were a Heaven-level Imperial Soldier, how wonderful would that be?"</p><p></p><p>Tuzi Gongzi stood quietly, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something, his expression slightly changing: "Qi Xiansheng, have you heard... in the capital, there are Heaven-level Imperial Soldiers from Roshana, they seem to have come for a divine called 'the Divine'."</p><p></p><p>Tuzi Gongzi said this while paying attention to Qi Yuan's expression.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?" Qi Yuan's expression remained calm, making it impossible to see what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"They are divided into two factions, one seems to be benevolent towards the Divine, and the other seems to want to slay the Divine." Tuzi Gongzi continued, "But this may just be a facade, they may both have sinister intentions and are just putting on a show."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I see." Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Tuzi Gongzi, and a trace of a smile suddenly flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you dare to take the Light Sword I bestowed upon you... and go to the capital?"</p><p></p><p>Tuzi Gongzi was stunned, many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This... " He was afraid.</p><p></p><p>Why did Qi Xiansheng want him to do this? Was this a test? What if he didn't agree, what would happen?</p><p></p><p>He was confused and had a thousand thoughts, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the four-legged Battle Wenyu said disdainfully, "Qi Xiansheng tells you to go, and you're still afraid? </p><p></p><p>Does Qi Xiansheng look like he would harm you? If he wanted to harm you, why would he bother with this, he could just feed you to the fish! If you don't dare, give me the Light Sword, I'll go to the capital!"</p><p></p><p>Tuzi Gongzi heard this and immediately felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>That's right, if Qi Xiansheng wanted to harm him, why would he go through all this trouble, he could just kill him directly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Xiansheng had even saved his life before.</p><p></p><p>With this kind of thing, how could he be timid?</p><p></p><p>Although it was full of danger, maybe it was also an opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to go!" Tuzi Gongzi quickly answered, "But... what should I do after I go to the capital?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily again: "Go with the flow, when you feel the need to summon the divine, just summon it."</p><p></p><p>Tuzi Gongzi heard this and was also a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>This was giving him full autonomy?</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, his expression showed a look of delight: "Can I summon the divine now?"</p><p></p><p>After the last battle, the function of summoning the divine had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Light Sword could not be used either.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, oh yes, you used the summoning this time to replace me, I won't let you lose out, how about 3,334 taels of silver? I'm quite generous, I gave you a little extra, don't say I'm stingy." Qi Yuan was about to take out the silver.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Xiansheng, there's no need for you to pay the silver." Tuzi Gongzi hurriedly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>It was like someone who received a red envelope on New Year's, trying to put the money back in the giver's pocket.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes: "Since you're so stubborn, I won't go against a man's will, the silver won't be given."</p><p></p><p>"That's natural!" Tuzi Gongzi didn't dare ask Qi Yuan for the silver.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't let you lose out either, if you use the summoning once for</p>

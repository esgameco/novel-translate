        <h1>Chapter 454</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if I ever ask for your help again, I'm lower than a pig or dog!"</p><p></p><p>He was filled with anger, even swearing, showing none of the demeanor of a great principle master.</p><p></p><p>For the advancement of the Black Sword, and to pave the way forward. </p><p></p><p>For so many years, for the greater good and for the Black Magic Abyss, he had set aside his differences with his master and depleted his own vital energy many times.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he had already done very well.</p><p></p><p>Now his master's actions left him disheartened, but there was nothing he could do.</p><p></p><p>"One with great destiny will not fall so easily. Moreover, his talent far exceeds Ghost Lord Heaven's expectations. And with the protective item I bestowed, he will surely be fine!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the strange land, howling winds raged and demons appeared everywhere, filling the void.</p><p></p><p>A banner of ten thousand ghost souls hung in the sky, its blood-red flags exuding a murderous aura as countless spirits wailed.</p><p></p><p>This land was like hell on earth, devastated as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>Pale giant hands descended from the sky, visible throughout the shattered strange land.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a terrifying voice echoed:</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, stop hiding. I see you."</p><p></p><p>The form of Great Joy Celestial Lord appeared, his face smiling like the Maitreya Buddha.</p><p></p><p>After entering the strange land, his power had dropped to the peak of the mythical realm.</p><p></p><p>Such was the nature of this place.</p><p></p><p>Outside, he may have been able to refine the strange land with his great magical powers.</p><p></p><p>But once inside, he was at the mercy of its rules, reduced to mythical level.</p><p></p><p>These were the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Only by comprehending the ultimate principles could one have a chance of resisting.</p><p></p><p>At this time, from the ground, Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe looked calmly at the banner of ten thousand ghost souls, his eyes showing a delighted expression: "Isn't this the banner of my dreams, the Human Emperor Banner?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's reaction was not unexpected to Great Joy Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>A genius like him would naturally have protective talismans.</p><p></p><p>An immortal like himself, upon entering the strange land, may not necessarily be a match for a genius like Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>"You may be fearless now, but soon... you won't be smiling anymore," Great Joy Celestial Lord said, holding the banner of ten thousand ghost souls as an ominous aura spread.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you to make assumptions about me? Whether I smile or not is none of your business," Qi Yuan retorted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile in Great Joy Celestial Lord's eyes grew even wider.</p><p></p><p>The more happily Blood Robe smiled now, the more desperate he would be later.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, you didn't expect... it would be me, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an immensely terrifying aura spread from behind Great Joy Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>A familiar face appeared.</p><p></p><p>This face was none other than Divine Blood Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze surging with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Divine Blood?" Seeing who had arrived, Qi Yuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Divine Blood Celestial Lord was very satisfied with this reaction.</p><p></p><p>Then Qi Yuan spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Hey, didn't you already admit it was Demon Eye Celestial Lord who killed your granddaughter? I don't know Demon Eye Celestial Lord, your granddaughter's death has nothing to do with me. Why have you come for me?" Qi Yuan said discontentedly, with an imposing manner.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, ambushes are meant to involve little talking.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, at their level, these exchanges took place in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Great Joy Celestial Lord and Divine Blood Celestial Lord were not just conversing, but also sealing off the area to prevent Qi Yuan from escaping and blocking other immortals from investigating.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Divine Blood Celestial Lord grew even angrier, gritting his teeth: "Back then, in the Ultimate Principle Heavenly Realm, you humiliated me like that. Did you ever think there would be consequences?!"</p><p></p><p>In the Ultimate Principle Heavenly Realm, Blood Robe's performance was etched in Divine Blood Celestial Lord's memory.</p><p></p><p>His granddaughter had been killed, and Blood Robe had blatantly lied, saying he didn't know the killer Demon Eye Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with a brain knew that Blood Robe knew Demon Eye Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>And his acting was truly terrible, it was like he was forcing Divine Blood Celestial Lord to admit it.</p><p></p><p>Such utter humiliation, he could only endure it at the time.</p><p></p><p>"How did I humiliate you? I have witnesses and evidence that Demon Eye Celestial Lord and I don't know each other at all. Do you want me to call him out to confront you?" Qi Yuan was always one to reason.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, playing dumb won't work, and neither will stalling for time.</p><p></p><p>This area has been sealed off by us. Even Purple Origin Ancestor cannot find this place. No one can save you.</p><p></p><p>Demon Eye Celestial Lord... even if he's your dog, he can't appear here!" Divine Blood Celestial Lord said in a deep voice, feeling extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The banner of ten thousand ghost souls had sealed off heaven and earth. In this desolate forbidden land, only the three of them remained. No one else could possibly appear.</p><p></p><p>"Shrimp-head man, not only do you slander me, but you also spread rumors about Demon Eye Celestial Lord!" Qi Yuan shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when Divine Blood Celestial Lord heard Qi Yuan's angry roar, he suddenly felt a powerful force sweep over him, and his head suddenly turned into a shrimp's head.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he quickly changed his shrimp head back, looking at Qi Yuan with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Purple Origin Ancestor's great principles, is this the trump card he left for you?" Although wary, Divine Blood Celestial Lord was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong Purple Origin Ancestor was, without his true body descending, killing Blood Robe here would be easy.</p><p></p><p>"Your usual tricks, changing the subject when you can't win an argument?</p><p></p><p>Hmph, it's a good thing I'm clever and always carry my witnesses and evidence, just in case I'm slandered.</p><p></p><p>Demon Eye Celestial Lord, come out quickly and tell us, do we know each other? Was it my order for you to kill Divine Blood Celestial Lord's granddaughter?" Qi Yuan said loudly.</p><p></p><p>Divine Blood Celestial Lord's heart tightened, then relaxed again: "This place has been sealed off. No other immortal lords can enter. Blood Robe, such tricks... are useless!"</p><p></p><p>Great Joy Celestial Lord smiled, looking at Qi Yuan: "You can shout until your throat breaks, but no one will appear to save you."</p><p></p><p>Now that the seal was in place and all precautions were ready, it was time to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The talking... should end now.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Divine Blood Celestial Lord and Great Joy Celestial Lord's eyes widened, their faces showing disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They saw a hole suddenly appear above Qi Yuan's dantian, in the area of his body.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura emanated from within.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a powerful figure clad entirely in gray-black appeared, wearing a kind smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I testify that Demon Eye Celestial Lord does not know any Blood Robe at all!"</p><p></p><p>The one who had suddenly walked out of Qi Yuan's body was none other than Demon Eye Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Demon Eye Celestial Lord's sudden appearance, Divine Blood and Great Joy were terrified, their expressions changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>This was impossible!</p><p></p><p>This was unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>Now, even a great principle master couldn't slip in under their noses.</p><p></p><p>How did this Demon Eye Celestial Lord come out of Blood Robe's stomach?</p><p></p><p>This incident was very strange.</p><p></p><p>"The witness is here, what do you have to say now?" Qi Yuan said triumphantly. "Demon Eye Celestial Lord and I are not acquainted, this is the truth!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Demon Eye and Blood Robe are not familiar with each other," Demon Eye Celestial Lord replied.</p><p></p><p>This scene was particularly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Divine Blood Celestial Lord suddenly felt a sense of fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This fear was long-forgotten yet profound.</p><p></p><p>It was like encountering a ghost cultivator before even entering the world of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He thought of how his head had suddenly turned into a shrimp's head, and felt his scalp tingle even more.</p><p></p><p>However, he still said in a deep voice: "We have the banner of ten thousand ghost souls. Demon Eye Celestial Lord, even if you've come, you can't escape death!"</p><p></p><p>"Is a witness not enough?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt angry.</p><p></p><p>This immortal cultivation</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in this world has become too corrupt.</p><p></p><p>Even with eyewitness testimony, they still won't admit it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we'll need a jury and judge to appear before you'll confess!" Qi Yuan was exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"Come forth, righteous judges and jury! Today... let this shrimp-headed man receive his due punishment!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe yangyang, yin emerges from divine concealment. Heed my command, judge all of heaven!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's voice rang out, a terrifying black hole appeared in front of his belly.</p><p></p><p>One by one, horrifying auras emerged from this dreadful black hole at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"East Pole Azure Florescence Great Emperor, heed my command! Preside over the Wind and Thunder Hell, wield the might of lightning, mark evildoers in the black book!"</p><p></p><p>"Nine Heavens Responding Element Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Venerable, heed my command! Thunder is the pivot of yin and yang, the root of all things. Without thunder, the three realms cannot be governed!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Gao Yao, heed my command! Understand the five punishments to assist the five teachings!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, nearly a hundred Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables emerged, standing guard behind Qi Yuan like his personal attendants.</p><p></p><p>Each one emanated an aura as vast and profound as the sea.</p><p></p><p>These were no ordinary Yang Spirits!</p><p></p><p>God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable widened their eyes, their expressions particularly unsightly.</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster was this?</p><p></p><p>How could so many terrifying, unknown Yang Spirits emerge from his body? Wasn't this supposed to be a small assassination? The two felt they had unwittingly been drawn into some horrifying vortex.</p><p></p><p>The two were trembling with fear, somewhat intimidated, and had thoughts of retreating.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan's arrogant and domineering voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"These people are all renowned grand judges, jury members, and even gods of justice. Now, tell this old God Blood fellow, did I know Demon Eye Heavenly Venerable or not? </p><p></p><p>Is God Blood Heavenly Venerable slandering me?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yao, being the god of justice, stroked his beard with an expression of quiet authority.</p><p></p><p>"The master has indeed met Demon Eye before, but imprisoning Demon Eye does not count as knowing him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, God Blood... the charge of slandering the ancestor stands!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan said happily: "See that? Even the god of justice says I'm innocent, yet you still slander me, shrimp head!</p><p></p><p>You've truly lowered the moral standards for men. You should be expelled from manhood!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Although Gao Yao calls me master, he is the god of justice - fair and impartial. He absolutely won't show favoritism towards me. God Blood Heavenly Venerable, confess your guilt now!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted, his voice like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>God Blood Heavenly Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, his expression extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he associated the inexplicable transformation of his head into a shrimp head with that feeling of supreme truth.</p><p></p><p>Thinking further about Demon Eye Heavenly Venerable's appearance, as well as those strange Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"You... you are Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable?" </p><p></p><p>God Blood Heavenly Venerable was completely shocked, and also terrified.</p><p></p><p>The person before him was actually Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Great Joy Heavenly Venerable was also startled.</p><p></p><p>It was actually that terrifying Demon Flame!</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it was more understandable.</p><p></p><p>After all, Demon Flame had comprehended two supreme truths.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of so many mysterious Yang Spirits around him became somewhat easier to accept.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>The events here were too strange.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe, or rather Demon Flame Heavenly Venerable, was nothing like a normal Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Which Yang Spirit had nearly a hundred Yang Spirits living in their belly? Qi Yuan watched the two fleeing figures without hurry, and spoke righteously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, don't try to get familiar. Since you've admitted guilt, you deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Thunder Elder Deng stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder of the Nine Heavens, condense into a thunder prison, trap them!"</p><p></p><p>East Pole Azure Florescence Great Emperor, majestic and boundless, spoke in an indifferent voice: "The names of Great Joy and God Blood, enter my black book!"</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables spoke one after another, their divine voices like commands, transforming into chains that bound God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>God Blood Heavenly Venerable was frantic, struggling constantly.</p><p></p><p>Great Joy Heavenly Venerable waved his Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner, trying to break free, countless yin souls roaring.</p><p></p><p>However, under the siege of nearly a hundred Yang Spirits, their resistance seemed laughable and ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>"Expel them from manhood!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan began to punish God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was at the realm of Myriad Dao Martial God, and had comprehended two supreme truths. He could easily crush even Supreme Truth realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention these two who had fallen in realm and status upon entering the strange land.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could easily handle them without these divine infants.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan believed in acting based on evidence.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Ghost Ruling Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Three Phases Heavenly Venerable sat on a cloud, his three faces indiscernible.</p><p></p><p>"How is it going?"</p><p></p><p>"They've fallen into the strange land, the outcome is unknown, but... Black Sword should be very difficult to kill. The ancestor of the Black Demon Abyss personally brought out a creation treasure to divine heaven's will and extend Black Sword's life!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Three Phases Heavenly Venerable was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even if a Great Truth expert took action, Black Sword would be hard to kill.</p><p></p><p>However, being able to consume some of that old turtle from Black Demon Abyss's heart blood this time is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Three Phases Heavenly Venerable thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Killing Black Sword would be a great achievement if successful, but if not, it was no matter.</p><p></p><p>Their main goal was to consume some of the Black Demon Abyss ancestor's resources.</p><p></p><p>"What about Blood Robe? According to the timing, he should have succeeded by now?" Three Phases Heavenly Venerable said softly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if sensing something, he turned his gaze towards the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed a strange expression at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Great Joy's star projection. What's going on? Has Great Joy encountered danger?"</p><p></p><p>In the Star Realm, Great Joy Heavenly Venerable's star projection suddenly flared brightly, as if struggling.</p><p></p><p>"No, God Blood Heavenly Venerable's star projection is also having issues. Could Black Demon Abyss have set an ambush?" Three Phases Heavenly Venerable was surprised, staring at the star projections in the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, this isn't star projections gathering power. This is the star projections resisting on their own. What's going on? What did they encounter?"</p><p></p><p>Three Phases Heavenly Venerable was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>At first, he thought God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable had encountered a powerful enemy and were drawing power from their star projections to face the enemy. But now it seemed that wasn't the case.</p><p></p><p>This was the star projections themselves resisting.</p><p></p><p>It seemed a majestic force was influencing the star projections in the Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>This scene reminded Three Phases Heavenly Venerable of when Purple Origin Ancestor had "crushed" the star projection of that Yang Spirit from Ghost Ruling Heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, the current situation was completely different from that crushing.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor had crushed the Yang Spirit, which then manifested as crushing the star projection.</p><p></p><p>But now, God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable had not yet perished, so how could their star projections be affected?</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Three Phases Heavenly Venerable's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>He saw God Blood Heavenly Venerable and Great Joy Heavenly Venerable's star projections changing violently, transforming frantically, seeming about to shatter, then coalescing again.</p><p></p><p>After myriad transformations.</p><p></p><p>The two star projections shattered... and reformed into the character for "woman"!</p><p></p><p>That's right, the two Yang Spirits had been expelled from manhood, and their star projections had become the character for "woman"!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all of heaven shook, countless Yang Spirits were shocked and confused, feeling it was utterly inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

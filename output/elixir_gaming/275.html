        <h1>Chapter 275</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire Canglan Realm was in turmoil, undergoing tremendous changes.</p><p></p><p>Two organizations' names stood out as the most eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>The first was the Original God Sharing Association; the second was the Divine Flower Society. </p><p></p><p>And the actual controller of these two organizations now was the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Blood-Robed Sword God's reputation was limited to the Phoenix Sky Domain and Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>But now, his fame had spread to over twenty domains in the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to the "boosting" and "crowdfunding divine techniques" of the Divine Flower Society, it still fell far short.</p><p></p><p>Under the Blood-Robed Sword God's threats, the various branches of the Divine Flower Society invested heavily.</p><p></p><p>The temporary jade slips of the Divine Flower Society were sold almost at cost.</p><p></p><p>These temporary jade slips were castrated versions.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who possessed these temporary jade slips, although not members of the Divine Flower Society, could complete tasks, increase their progress bar, and receive rewards.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, they could boost other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>So, some Divine Flower Society members generously bought one for every cultivator in their clan, inviting them to boost.</p><p></p><p>And when those cultivators learned about exchanging cultivation techniques in the Divine Flower Society, they also hurried to participate in the crowdfunding of divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the incredibly rich personal rewards, just think about those divine techniques if fully funded.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean everyone could have divine techniques? Those old monsters who had been in seclusion for thousands of years were called out by their senior or junior brothers or masters.</p><p></p><p>The first thing they said was:</p><p></p><p>"Quick, get up and boost me!"</p><p></p><p>After all, boosting could only be done once.</p><p></p><p>These secluded cultivators obviously had never boosted anyone before.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the Canglan Realm became exceptionally lively.</p><p></p><p>Those powerful cultivators in seclusion were also awakened one after another, inexplicably stuffed with temporary jade slips of the Divine Flower Society to help boost.</p><p></p><p>At first, those awakened cultivators were reluctant, but after learning about the recent major events and exchanging divine techniques and other non-toxic cultivation methods, they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>They expressed that it was truly fragrant.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Canglan Realm, even the greetings between cultivators had changed.</p><p></p><p>"Have you boosted yet?"</p><p></p><p>"How much is your progress bar?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but I've been stuck at 99% for three days!"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators joined this cause one after another.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivation techniques are fundamental.</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques were to cultivators of the Canglan Realm what true immortality techniques were to cultivators of the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>So, even Yin Gods couldn't avoid it.</p><p></p><p>An incalculable number of cultivators joined this great undertaking.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan was on his way back to Qinghong City in the Phoenix Sky Domain.</p><p></p><p>He was traveling while posting a message.</p><p></p><p>[After obtaining the Heavenly Technique, between my busty junior sister and the sect master's daughter, I chose...]</p><p></p><p>That's right, the title had to be a cliffhanger and couldn't give the answer.</p><p></p><p>This was to attract members of the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>As for the content, it was similar to his own soft advertisement.</p><p></p><p>"After uploading several jade-level techniques, my progress bar reached 50%. I thought I would get a jade-level technique.</p><p></p><p>Who knew I would actually get a heaven-grade technique!</p><p></p><p>That's a Heavenly Technique, a legendary technique cultivated by Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, I'm the kind of person who likes to brag and show off, so by that night, everyone in the sect knew about it.</p><p></p><p>The sect master's daughter knocked on my door at midnight, saying she wanted to come in and see my cat.</p><p></p><p>How could I let her in when my busty junior sister was already inside looking at the cat?</p><p></p><p>If the two of them met, I would be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, sometimes having too much luck and obtaining a Heavenly Technique isn't always a good thing.</p><p></p><p>One is a childhood sweetheart, a princess of the mortal royal family; the other is the sect master's daughter, of noble status.</p><p></p><p>How should I choose? I'm troubled and need to ask the advice of you great experts!"</p><p></p><p>During this period, Qi Yuan had been sharing his progress.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, his life had become incredibly exciting.</p><p></p><p>Slapping the face of the supervisor, suppressing senior brothers, killing enemies, gaining the favor of senior sisters, being valued by elders, junior sisters bathing in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it was very exciting and satisfying, like a winner in life.</p><p></p><p>This kind of content also motivated those cultivators who were striving to achieve their goals, frantically collecting and uploading techniques.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the post was made, many people immediately commented.</p><p></p><p>"Getting a Heavenly Technique at 50%? Fellow Daoist, your luck is too good!"</p><p></p><p>"I only got a Heavenly Technique at 80%!"</p><p></p><p>"I choose the junior sister!"</p><p></p><p>"Choose the senior sister!"</p><p></p><p>"Why not take both?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I think the sect master's wife is really not bad, still charming.</p><p>If there's a chance, I'd be of the same mind as the sect master."</p><p></p><p>"I have a good suggestion, castrate yourself, and you won't have this trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Buying techniques at high prices, buying boosts, private message me!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at these comments, Qi Yuan felt like he was back on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"They're still not as good as those keyboard warriors living on the internet, they can't even come up with interesting memes."</p><p></p><p>He scanned through and breathed a sigh of relief when he found no one cursing at him, otherwise it would affect his mood - a grave sin that would require banning.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, hehe, my progress bar has reached 70%, ranking first on the Hundred Countries leaderboard!</p><p>I got a Heavenly Technique and I'm giving it to you!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Lingsu sent a message, along with a heaven-grade technique.</p><p></p><p>A heaven-grade technique was quite precious even for the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that her senior brother urgently needed various techniques, she still transmitted it to Qi Yuan immediately.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt warm inside, indeed his own junior sister was the best, like a little cotton-padded jacket.</p><p></p><p>Although this technique originally came from him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Junior Sister. Senior Brother is very touched!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be touched, sending you the technique is just by the way, I'm ranked first in the Hundred Countries!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, even for individual progress bars, Qi Yuan had added a ranking feature.</p><p></p><p>For example, Jiang Lingsu's personal progress exceeded 70%, ranking first in the Great Shang Country.</p><p></p><p>People love to pursue rankings.</p><p></p><p>Especially those lagging behind, they're happy with every step forward in ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Great!" Qi Yuan could only praise.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come back this month, or you'll be in big trouble!" Thinking of something, Jiang Lingsu warned again.</p><p></p><p>Her father was on the way, probably arriving soon.</p><p></p><p>"Your Senior Brother is already a Divine Infant True Lord with countless subordinates, I'm not afraid of trouble," Qi Yuan casually replied.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you have countless subordinates, can you call them to boost me?" Jiang Lingsu seized the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll call people to boost you right away!" Qi Yuan said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>But he suddenly remembered a joke from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>The God of War returns, sees his wife can't get a discount on Pinduoduo, angrily calls 100,000 warriors to help cut the price, but still can't get it down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought that war god was a bit stupid. Even if they all helped cut the price, how much money could they save? It would be better to deliver packages for Pinduoduo together, they'd earn more.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, I've discovered a loophole, one that not many people have found yet!" Qi Yuan said secretly.</p><p></p><p>Since his junior sister liked the feeling of the progress bar rising, he'd help a bit.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, seeing Qi Yuan's message, Jiang Lingsu on Seven-Color Peak widened her eyes: "What loophole?"</p><p></p><p>"I found that besides uploading immortal cultivation methods, uploading martial arts manuals... can also increase the progress bar.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he had only instructed some Yin God Venerables of the Divine Flower Society, as well as the Martial Monarch Great Venerable, to go to the mortal realm to collect martial arts manuals. </p><p></p><p>He hadn't revealed this information to others.</p><p></p><p>Now, he told Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"You can do that?" Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother had never lied before.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and don't tell anyone about this matter." Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Actually, it wouldn't matter if it was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go try it... If it really works, I'll personally cook for you!"</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan had cured Jiang Lingsu's illness, their relationship had warmed up a little.</p><p></p><p>"I don't eat beef."</p><p></p><p>"How about cooking the fish you raise?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it has too many bones. Get something without bones."</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a good mood to cook for you and you're being picky? </p><p>Hurry up and find people to help me, call all your countless subordinates!"</p><p></p><p>Their conversation ended with some scolding messages.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, and sent a message to the Martial Monarch Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Get me 6,000 jade slips from the Divine Flower Society, and also, those from the Original God Sharing Society who haven't helped yet, have them all help boost someone for me."</p><p></p><p>If Junior Sister wanted help boosting, he would give it to her.</p><p></p><p>After all, rich Junior Sister could be considered his angel investor. </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's early accumulation mostly came from Junior Sister.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said this while sending Junior Sister's boost link to the Martial Monarch Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the message, the Martial Monarch Great Venerable quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"When will Senior return?" The Martial Monarch Great Venerable asked an additional question.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God had gone to the Ghostly Sky Realm alone to challenge the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>This caused a huge stir in the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Gods of the Dao-Seeking Palace contacted many powerful figures in the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, those people were not optimistic about the Blood-Robed Sword God's fate.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dark Sun, there were mythical level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by the time they learned of this matter, the Blood-Robed Sword God was already close to the Ghostly Sky Realm. Even if they wanted to dissuade him, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, the Blood-Robed Sword God actually won, destroying the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>How could the Yin Gods who attended the meeting not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>After destroying the Dark Sun, the Blood-Robed Sword God rushed back.</p><p></p><p>Now, many Yin Gods and Great Venerables who learned this news were also hurrying to Light Swan City, wanting to meet the legendary Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>In the Phoenix Palace, all the Yin God Venerables of the Phoenix Sky Realm had been killed, greatly reducing the number of Yin Gods in the Phoenix Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, nearly a hundred Yin Gods were heading to the Phoenix Sky Realm, all staying at the Dao-Seeking Palace, just to meet the legendary Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>After all, they wanted to see such a fierce Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be back soon, very soon... about half an incense stick's time?"</p><p></p><p>So fast? The Martial Monarch Great Venerable's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly went to complete the task Qi Yuan had assigned, and also informed Qi Yuan about the visiting Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>About half an incense stick's time passed.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and twelve Yin God Venerables gathered in one place in the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>They all looked somewhat nervous.</p><p></p><p>The Head Palace Master of the Dao-Seeking Palace wore all black, with expectation in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Yu Hua was smiling happily: "The Blood-Robed Sword God's name isn't on the Mythical Monument, yet he can kill mythical beings. It's really unexpected."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Yin Gods present all nodded.</p><p></p><p>His name wasn't on the Mythical Monument, he wasn't a mythical being, yet he could kill the Dark Sun. It was extremely terrifying and exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>They were even more curious about the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred thousand years ago, the Azure Wave Realm was defeated once. I wonder this time..." An old man sighed at this point.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred thousand years ago, the Azure Wave Realm produced a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>That was also the greatest hope for the Azure Wave Realm's counterattack against the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that attempt ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>That failure had many inside stories, and it destroyed almost half of the Azure Wave Realm's power.</p><p></p><p>Until now, the Azure Wave Realm had not yet recovered.</p><p></p><p>This time, if the Blood-Robed Sword God raised the banner of justice, should they follow? Everyone had different thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a blood-colored figure appeared, standing in the void, seeming to dye the blue sky red.</p><p></p><p>The great sun in the sky seemed to become dim in front of him.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin Gods who saw Qi Yuan felt an unfathomable sense.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Over one hundred and twenty top powerhouses from various realms, Yin God Venerables and Great Venerables, all lowered their noble heads at this time, as if vassals meeting their lord.</p><p></p><p>This posture also represented their intentions and determination, and was a silent oath of allegiance to the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned these Yin Gods, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Wave Realm was still poor.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods who had come from afar and gathered together were probably fewer than the Yin Gods casually attending a banquet in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What brings you all here from so far away?" Qi Yuan asked softly.</p><p></p><p>The Head Palace Master of the Dao-Seeking Palace was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected the Blood-Robed Sword God to be so direct.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't they first chat about the Dark Sun, chat about the great calamity, then unite against a common enemy, so they could take the opportunity to pledge allegiance?</p><p></p><p>But he spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the Blood-Robed Sword God's personality, he didn't mind, and said softly: "The great calamity plagues the Azure Wave Realm, the Dark Sun wantonly slaughters living beings.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God killed the Dark Sun, greatly pleasing the people. We admire you.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, we were too far away at the time, and time was too urgent, we couldn't assist.</p><p></p><p>Now with the great calamity imminent, we have come to offer our assistance to Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The other Yin God Venerables all spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to lend Senior a hand!"</p><p></p><p>Their meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Blood-Robed Sword God raised the banner of destroying the great calamity, they were willing to charge forward for him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "You've all come to help?"</p><p></p><p>He did indeed need help.</p><p></p><p>With Yin Gods helping to collect martial arts techniques, the speed would naturally increase.</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that I have a big task now that requires everyone's help." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Yin God Venerables on the scene all became serious.</p><p></p><p>If even the Blood-Robed Sword God said it was a big task, it must be very important.</p><p></p><p>After all, what kind of things did the Blood-Robed Sword God do? Establish the Original God Sharing Society, collect all the world's martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Destroy the Four Generals of the Lei Family, kill Great Venerable Jasmine, sweep through the Divine Flower Society, annihilate the Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>Each of these events could cause an earthquake in the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he had done so much in just a short month.</p><p></p><p>These Yin Gods were all a bit shocked, taking in sharp breaths, making a great contribution to warming the air in the Azure Wave Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Blood-Robed Sword God had a task for them to help with, it must naturally be such a big task, probably dealing with the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Qi Yuan expectantly, then heard the Blood-Robed Sword God's casual voice.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have jade slips from the Divine Flower Society?"</p><p></p><p>"This old one has."</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>Most of the Yin God Venerables said they didn't have any.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Monarch, give everyone a jade slip." Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch Great Venerable quickly handed out Divine Flower Society jade slips to these Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the extra jade slips Qi Yuan had requested to prepare were also handed over to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

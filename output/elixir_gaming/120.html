        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>The auras of several supreme beings were drawing closer, including one that belonged to a great supreme being.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, we can't escape!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Huan looked at Qi Yuan, and for some reason, he sensed that Qi Yuan was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The ones who can't escape are them. I... have become a supreme being," Qi Yuan's eyes cleared, as if he had experienced countless years in an instant.</p><p></p><p>His enlightenment ended, and he returned to the present moment in the game world.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother... you've become a supreme being?" Chen Huan was shocked, then overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, feeling that he had become even more mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just a terrestrial legend a moment ago? How did he suddenly become a supreme being?</p><p></p><p>Had he comprehended the origin? Awakened origin divine abilities?</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's time to complete the third step of my plan - kill the incoming enemies!" Qi Yuan was about to implement his meticulous plan.</p><p></p><p>"You just broke through to become a supreme being, it won't work. They have a great supreme being whose origin divine abilities have reached the engraving realm!" Mentioning engraving, Chen Huan's eyes showed a trace of fear. "Origin divine abilities at the engraving level cannot be defeated even if flaws are found!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also knew what Chen Huan was talking about.</p><p></p><p>While fleeing with Ning Tao, and mastering the human demon path, he had gained more understanding of supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Upon first entering the supreme being realm, the origin divine abilities mastered were at the time-exhausting level.</p><p></p><p>At the time-exhausting level, mastery of origin divine abilities was not very stable, and... consumption was very high, with a time limit.</p><p></p><p>In the middle stage of supreme being, origin divine abilities reached the subtle level.</p><p></p><p>With subtle control over origin divine abilities, one could use them very well without wasting the slightest bit.</p><p></p><p>As for the late stage supreme beings, the great supreme beings, they reached the legendary engraving level.</p><p></p><p>The origin divine abilities were engraved on their bodies and souls.</p><p></p><p>Without even moving, origin divine abilities would form on their own.</p><p></p><p>The gap between a great supreme being and an early stage supreme being was too large.</p><p></p><p>They could exhaust an early stage supreme being's origin divine abilities through attrition alone.</p><p></p><p>"Engraving... is indeed very powerful." Qi Yuan grinned, "But... I haven't killed anyone for tens of thousands of years, I've been itching to do so for a long time. The killing intent I've accumulated will give them a fright!"</p><p></p><p>In the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, Qi Yuan had sat in meditation for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>He had forgotten time, and forgotten himself.</p><p></p><p>He really hadn't killed anyone for many years.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, did you forget that we just killed a supreme being, and quite a few terrestrial legends too!" Chen Huan increasingly felt that his big brother was really unreliable.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he seemed profound and unfathomable, other times he was very scatterbrained.</p><p></p><p>The scatterbrained appearance was very similar to himself, but at this moment, Chen Huan didn't want Qi Yuan to be scatterbrained.</p><p></p><p>Although their dialogue seemed to contain a lot of content, it was completed in less than two breaths.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying auras also fully descended at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Six supreme beings could be seen standing in mid-air, surrounding Qi Yuan and Chen Huan from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist's eyes were deep as he looked at the two, with surprise in his gaze: "How did you two manage to kill Supreme Being Yu Bai?"</p><p></p><p>As Purple Daoist spoke, his gaze fell completely on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Huan, he was completely ignored.</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Chen Huan and Qi Yuan with surprised expressions.</p><p></p><p>After all, Supreme Being Yu Bai's strength was well-known. Even if two supreme beings attacked together, it wouldn't be so quick to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Yet these two in front of them had done it. Did they have some secret?</p><p></p><p>The six people had varied expressions, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze also fell on Purple Daoist, his eyes sharp as knives. He said slowly: "So it was you who sent Wu Tong to ambush me? Who gave you the confidence and courage... to ambush me?"</p><p></p><p>Before a fight, one's momentum couldn't be weak!</p><p></p><p>Even village dogs bark non-stop before fighting, right?</p><p></p><p>This Purple Daoist had ambushed him for no reason, there must be some inside story.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the others also looked at Purple Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist had actually ambushed the guardian of Wugui City before?</p><p></p><p>His coming to the Thousand Cities region this time... could there really be some inside story?</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist didn't explain, he waved his sleeve: "Capture the guardian of Wugui City alive, as for the other one... kill him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan became furious: "I am a disciple of the White Emperor, wouldn't it be better to capture me alive like my big brother?"</p><p></p><p>The other five supreme beings quickly moved to attack Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>Five terrifying origin divine abilities fell directly towards Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>If these five divine abilities hit, even if Chen Huan didn't die, he would be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother save me!" Chen Huan turned into a streak of light to escape, with the five divine abilities closely pursuing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's voice entered Chen Huan's ears.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan was stronger, it was also easier for him to spot the flaws in those five origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan's face lit up with joy: "Big brother, you're truly my father!"</p><p></p><p>As if divinely aided, Chen Huan directly escaped from the five divine abilities. However, he was still grazed by one, half his arm directly sliced off, causing him to grimace in pain.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked all six people present.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't expected Chen Huan to be able to block their origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes fell on Qi Yuan, filled with surprise, astonishment, fear, and delight.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice also rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Now... it's my turn!"</p><p></p><p>Although this world was a game, it was very realistic, not turn-based combat.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had been holding back all along, wanting to see through their origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator, their origin divine abilities were their great dao, directly reaching their true heart.</p><p></p><p>Attacking from the true heart was also the easiest way to induce heart demons.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, for some reason, the five supreme beings present all felt a strong sense of fear arise in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Purple Daoist stood in mid-air, narrowing his eyes, his expression fearless.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that when the guardian of Wugui City made his move, he could kill all the supreme beings present except for himself.</p><p></p><p>And this... happened to suit his intentions.</p><p></p><p>The secrets and treasures of Wugui City should all belong to him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a step forward, his robes rising without wind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his robes also turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>He stood in place, his gaze deep and hollow, as if coming from the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Inducement!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan immediately unleashed his origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards a female supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Lust - Red Lotus Karmic Fire!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, flames of fiery red ignited on that female supreme being's body, her clothes incinerated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The female supreme being's left eye was filled with fear, while her right eye was filled with desire.</p><p></p><p>An aura belonging to demonic evil was spreading over her body.</p><p></p><p>Her body seemed about to burst.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on a man wearing white robes.</p><p></p><p>Pride - Eye of Azure Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke softly: "I hate show-offs the most. If anyone's going to show off, it should be me!"</p><p></p><p>With his words, a demonic evil inexplicably crawled out on the white-robed man's body.</p><p></p><p>The demonic evil was extremely hideous, with eyes that looked down on everything, crouching on the white-robed man's body, eerily embracing his neck.</p><p></p><p>Like being pricked by needles, like dry tree bark scraping across the back, like centipedes crawling on the neck, goosebumps rose, and the white-robed man felt fear arise.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing!"</p><p></p><p>An origin divine ability struck his own neck, blood spurting from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As the origin divine ability manifested, an eerie aura spread.</p><p></p><p>The five supreme beings present had expressions of fear, greed, or lust.</p><p></p><p>Their minds had all come under attack.</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly became bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene from not far away, Chen Huan was both shocked and fearful. He secretly glanced at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his heart he wanted to say:</p><p></p><p>What the hell are you?</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to ask or speak.</p><p></p><p>The scene before him was too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>This guardian of Wugui City, his big brother, was acting just like a big villain.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities manifested, and demonic evil was born.</p><p></p><p>Where in the world were there origin divine abilities like this? What cultivator in the world didn't fear demonic evil like scorpions?</p><p></p><p>But his big brother...</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan thought of something, a look of horror flashing across his face.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at those five supreme beings, an extremely eerie smile on his face: "You've lived for so long, wasted so much food, it's time for you... to die."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, the auras on those five supreme beings instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Their heart demons broke out of their bodies, and they directly perished.</p><p></p><p>And since they didn't die of natural causes... no demonic evil formed either.</p><p></p><p>Five extremely powerful supreme beings died in frustration.</p><p></p><p>A trace of delight flashed in Purple Daoist's eyes: "Your origin divine ability is very interesting. One thought manifests and heart demons are born. Your origin divine ability... can be said to be unrivaled among those of the same level."</p><p></p><p>The origin divine ability of heart demon inducement was formed from the source of evil.</p><p></p><p>This kind of divine ability could easily induce people's heart demons.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Liufeng Realm originally kept their heart demons confined within. The "Demon Confinement Technique" allowed them not to worry about heart demons suddenly breaking out of their bodies, but the heart demons always existed.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he died a natural death, the demonic energy would burst out of his body.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability was perfectly targeted at cultivators from the Flowing Wind Realm. </p><p></p><p>What cultivator at the early Supreme stage could withstand one strike of Qi Yuan's divine ability? Of course, in the Azure Waves Realm, this origin divine ability would not be so invincible.</p><p></p><p>But it would still induce heart demons and reduce a cultivator's fighting power.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've already grasped quite a few secrets of No Return City," the Purple Daoist said, his eyes full of delight.</p><p></p><p>Through the Fate Stone Tablet, he had learned that the Demon Woman's burial place was in No Return City.</p><p></p><p>There lay the source of all demonic energy. </p><p></p><p>And the divine ability Qi Yuan displayed matched exactly what was recorded on the Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>If he could grasp the source of all demonic energy and understand the essence of heart demons, who in this world could be his match? He had sent Wu Tong to secretly attack Qi Yuan and plot against No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Later, he learned from the stone tablet that the Buddha, who was actually the Great Demon, was buried in Heavenly Heart Palace. </p><p></p><p>To scheme against Heavenly Heart Palace, he spread false information that the Blood Demon was there, unexpectedly hitting the mark by accident.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist looked at Qi Yuan with greed in his eyes: "If you're willing to pledge loyalty to me and reveal all the secrets of No Return City, this master is willing to take you as a disciple and give you a chance to serve me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan glanced at the Purple Daoist with a puzzled look: "You're not my wife, so why would you be my master?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at his master's back, he had deduced that his master was his wife.</p><p></p><p>This Purple Daoist, a stinking man, wanted to be his wife?</p><p></p><p>"Gay?" Qi Yuan looked at the Purple Daoist in horror, "There's a gay man right next to me."</p><p></p><p>He instinctively wanted to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words stunned the Purple Daoist, and also stunned Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>What kind of logic was this?</p><p></p><p>He was clearly talking about taking a master, what did it have to do with wives or being gay?</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan weakly said: "Big bro, why don't you just go along with him?"</p><p></p><p>He had just broken through to the Supreme realm and hadn't even had a chance to return home in glory or show off in front of his senior and junior apprentices. He didn't want to die like this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan coldly said: "Even if he knelt down to be my dog, I'd still find him too dirty."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Big bro, do you have to be so brave!</p><p></p><p>The smile faded somewhat from the Purple Daoist's eyes: "It seems you're unwilling to be my disciple. You've lost an opportunity to become a true ruler of this realm."</p><p></p><p>With the Fate Stone Tablet, this supreme treasure, he was destined for glory in this life. Given time, even the Sovereign and White Emperor would be no match for him. He had always had this premonition.</p><p></p><p>"I'm really curious, why are you so arrogant?" Qi Yuan looked at the Purple Daoist, "I seem to smell the scent of an old acquaintance on you. You're as arrogant as she was."</p><p></p><p>That old acquaintance was the Purple Heavenly Mysterious Woman.</p><p></p><p>The feeling the Purple Daoist gave him was exactly the same as the Purple Heavenly Mysterious Woman.</p><p></p><p>"This master is arrogant because he has reason to be arrogant. Your origin divine soul is strong, but it can only kill cultivators at the early Supreme stage. I am a Great Supreme, with origin divine abilities inscribed in my body and soul, flawless and perfect. How can your origin divine ability harm me?"</p><p></p><p>This was the confidence of a Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>With origin divine abilities inscribed, he didn't even need to use them - he himself was an origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"The last arrogant person has already died by my sword. You... should not be far behind."</p><p></p><p>A solemn look appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A Great Supreme was indeed powerful! Now Qi Yuan had killed five Supreme realm cultivators, and his level had risen to 124.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist before him was actually level 189.</p><p></p><p>A full sixty-some levels higher than him.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he had challenged higher levels before, but he had never challenged one so much stronger.</p><p></p><p>But in a game, soloing a boss is the most thrilling.</p><p></p><p>He held his broken sword and looked at the Purple Daoist as his form grew taller at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Little Wife!</p><p></p><p>Armor Shared with You!</p><p></p><p>As the blood-red armor was put on, Qi Yuan's level rose another five levels.</p><p></p><p>The gap with the Purple Daoist narrowed a bit more.</p><p></p><p>But the gap... was still very large.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting... but what's yours will soon be mine."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist looked at Qi Yuan with interest, like a child watching ants move.</p><p></p><p>To him, Qi Yuan's form growing to several dozen zhang tall and his aura becoming stronger was no different than a small ant becoming a big ant.</p><p></p><p>"Take my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Powerful sword energy spread out. This strike carried Qi Yuan's endless heart demons.</p><p></p><p>Any early Supreme realm cultivator affected by this strike would certainly not die a natural death.</p><p></p><p>But he was facing a Great Supreme!</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist stood motionless as an origin divine ability automatically emerged.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's powerful sword strike was actually blocked by the Purple Daoist.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist said casually: "Come at me with a few more strikes. Otherwise if you die, this master won't be able to see such swordsmanship again."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wanted to comprehend the source of demonic energy through Qi Yuan's sword and learn the secrets Qi Yuan had obtained in No Return City.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Chen Huan also said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attack was ineffective, just as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's origin divine ability was a powerful weapon. If Qi Yuan could grow to the Great Supreme realm, he would be invincible except against the White Emperor and the Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had just entered the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>The gap between him and a Great Supreme was simply too large.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan remained calm and said: "Purple Daoist, actually... you are not a Great Supreme."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the sword in his hand continued to fall.</p><p></p><p>Fighting while trash talking at the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Qi Yuan hated this the most.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately now, having awakened his origin divine ability, he had to lower himself to trash talk in order to better defeat his opponent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Purple Daoist smiled: "You really are interesting."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had heard someone say he wasn't a Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Was there any use in saying this?</p><p></p><p>"A Great Supreme doesn't just inscribe origin divine abilities in flesh and soul, but also in... demonic energy. Demonic energy is also part of you. Without inscribing it, how can you be considered a Great Supreme?" Qi Yuan was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, sophistry." The Purple Daoist's origin divine ability fell on Qi Yuan, but was easily dodged.</p><p></p><p>A look of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"When you cultivated to the Great Supreme realm, did you hear a faint voice calling out... 'Trap Demon'?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist's gaze suddenly turned gloomy: "How do you know that?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>He thought of No Return City, which was the Demon Woman's burial place.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that all this information was obtained by the guardian of No Return City from inside?</p><p></p><p>A mysterious smile appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The "Demon Trapping Scripture" was comprehended by him from the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, and he immediately began to preach.</p><p></p><p>In that state, he couldn't add any hidden doors to the technique, nor did he want to.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was a technique he had created.</p><p></p><p>The technique the Purple Daoist cultivated also derived from the "Demon Trapping Scripture". Qi Yuan was extremely familiar with what would happen during cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Because the technique you cultivate is flawed." Qi Yuan became a great bluffer, speaking eloquently, "When you entered the Supreme realm, the human and demonic energy in your dantian churned three times; the last time you cultivated, when you closed your eyes, a door suddenly appeared in your mind..."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist's expression grew increasingly gloomy, then showed wild joy: "It seems the benefits you obtained in No Return City far exceed my imagination!"</p><p></p><p>"So you're actually not a Great Supreme. Your origin divine abilities are not fully inscribed in your flesh and soul, and there are still many flaws. At most, you're only at the mid Supreme realm, not a true Great Supreme. The Sovereign and White Emperor are the flawless Great Supremes." Qi Yuan was talking complete nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"What you say is very interesting, and has even convinced me... but what use is it? Even if I'm not a flawless Great Supreme, can you defeat me?" The Purple Daoist had started to believe some of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"To become a true Great Supreme, you need to forget... that you are a false Great Supreme. Otherwise, you will never be able to step into the realm of a true Great Supreme in this lifetime!" Qi Yuan finally revealed his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist was stunned for a split second, forgetting the fact that he was a Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Forget?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sharp light flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The time had come!</p><p></p><p>Great Forgetting Mind Scripture!</p><p></p><p>Void Ruler's Heart Demon Summoning!</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Mind Scripture that had been secretly activated earlier was now exerting its full effect.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Daoist stood in the void, his eyes blank for an instant: "I'm not a Great Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>He forgot that he was a Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>His aura plummeted in that split second.</p><p></p><p>Flaws appeared in his flawless origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Void Ruler's Heart Demon Summoning also began to take effect.</p><p></p><p>Heart demons arose in the Purple Daoist's mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he looked just like those five Supreme realm cultivators, with demonic energy bursting out of his body.</p><p></p><p>His eyes suddenly cleared, flashing with fear and fury as he shouted: "I am a Great Supreme!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

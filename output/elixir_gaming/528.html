        <h1>Chapter 528</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the inn, Qi Yuan looked at the returning drone with a complex gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Can't find her, can't find her."</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers who had explored the ruins were gradually returning, and the news they brought was that they had not seen Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had also dispatched many drones to delve deep into the ruins, repeatedly broadcasting the voice searching for Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>At the time, these drones were disguised as moths, startling many of the Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>However, even with the drones, Qi Yuan still could not find Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan seemed to have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I can't ride her now?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it that this game is afraid of having too much mature content censored?"</p><p></p><p>"But I'm a shareholder!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>As a shareholder, did he have a problem with secretly building a private server to play some mature content? "Everyone... come out immediately!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thunderous roar came, and the powerful pressure of a Heaven-Realm Armored Soldier permeated the place.</p><p></p><p>In the inn, the originally resting Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers all had changed expressions.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Fallen Sky Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"A Heaven-Realm Armored Soldier?"</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers resting in the inn discussed in various tones.</p><p></p><p>"Fallen Sky Immortal, what's the matter?" a top-tier master asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Outside the inn, three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers hovered in the air, exuding a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>The leader, the Fallen Sky Immortal, wore a long green robe, with a white bone hairpin inserted diagonally in his hair, making him look like an evil sect member.</p><p></p><p>The three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers put a lot of pressure on the Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers in the inn.</p><p></p><p>Any one of these three, if they unleashed their power, could almost sweep away this inn.</p><p></p><p>"We three went to the ruins and found the embryo of a divine artifact in the lair of a Heaven-Realm Demonic Spirit. We joined forces to slay that Heaven-Realm Demonic Spirit, but unexpectedly, an Earthly Realm Armored Soldier suddenly attacked and snatched the divine artifact embryo away." The Fallen Sky Immortal's eyes were filled with anger. "He was skilled in speed, and we were held back by other Demonic Spirits, allowing him to escape."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect he is now in the inn." Another Heaven-Realm Armored Soldier spoke in a hoarse voice, "All of you come out of the inn and hand over your storage artifacts for us three to inspect."</p><p></p><p>In the inn, the others heard this and their expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Fallen Sky Immortal said that an Earthly Realm Armored Soldier had stolen their divine artifact embryo, they knew that who knows if the Fallen Sky Immortal was just making it up, and they had a greedy heart when they saw an Earthly Realm Armored Soldier take the divine artifact embryo.</p><p></p><p>However, now that Earthly Realm Armored Soldier was surrounded in the inn.</p><p></p><p>They also felt that the Earthly Realm Armored Soldier's life was over.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the inn, Wang Chunting's face was gloomy: "Damn it, it was them who robbed me!"</p><p></p><p>He kept his head down and glanced around, trying to find a loophole to escape.</p><p></p><p>But the three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers had already achieved a state of Heaven-Human Unity, and this place was guarded so tightly that there was no way to get out.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, this girl's storage artifact contains some private items, and I don't want to show them to outsiders. The one who stole the divine artifact embryo was a man, can you not check this girl's storage artifact?" said a female Earthly Realm Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how do I know you're a woman? What if you and him are in cahoots, and he hid the divine artifact embryo in your storage artifact?" the short-haired old man said in a rough voice.</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Sky Immortal's eyes flashed with murderous intent: "If you are unwilling to come out and unwilling to take out your storage artifacts, then... old master will not be polite and will strike to kill!"</p><p></p><p>Killing intent permeated the air. The surrounding atmosphere became oppressive.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't come out, the only path left is death!"</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Sky Immortal threatened.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers in the inn started walking out one by one.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunting was nervous inside, but on the surface, he pretended to be nonchalant.</p><p></p><p>"I'm done for, could it be that I'll die here today?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunting was anxious.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, a lazy voice suddenly sounded in the inn.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't come out, you'll kill me?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was very young and pleasant.</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Sky Immortal narrowed his eyes, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, the short-tempered old man shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't come out, you die!"</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers present saw this scene and were somewhat alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Someone recognized Qi Yuan's voice, who had once slain the Idle Cloud Immortal with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>His strength was among the top-tier masters.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not a Heaven-Realm Armored Soldier, how dare he...</p><p></p><p>But before they could think more, they saw three sword lights slash out from the inn.</p><p></p><p>"The meaning of your existence in this world is to provoke others as much as possible, and then wait to die today, so that everyone can laugh heartily, achieving the effect of 'first depress, then uplift'." Qi Yuan plagiarized again.</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, terrifying sword lights flashed.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The power of Heaven and Earth surged, and these three regained their confidence.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, something that made them terrified happened.</p><p></p><p>They saw the Heaven and Earth power they controlled recede like the tide.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying sword lights surged, sharp and unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Screams rang out, and three corpses fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, the three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers easily perished, as if they were fake Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!" The Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers present took a deep breath, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunting stared wide-eyed, his breathing rapid.</p><p></p><p>"The three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers... died just like that?"</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had just escaped the wolf's den, only to encounter a tiger's den.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall figure appeared outside the window.</p><p></p><p>"The balance of this game is not good."</p><p></p><p>"Why give so much dialogue to a small boss that I can casually slay?"</p><p></p><p>"No style."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was calm as he looked at the three corpses, his gaze no different from looking at ants.</p><p></p><p>Those Earthly Realm Armored Soldiers saw this and trembled, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunting dared not move, his mind flashing with many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If this senior wanted the divine artifact embryo... how could he survive?</p><p></p><p>"Don't take deep breaths, just go wash up and sleep, it's late at night, don't disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, then closed the window.</p><p></p><p>About fifty breaths later, Qi Yuan's eyes suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the plot is like this, I've entered the state of Heaven-Human Unity!"</p><p></p><p>After slaying many Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers in the Mysterious Domain, Qi Yuan had accumulated a vast amount of experience and also devoured a lot of Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>Now, casually slaying these three, the accumulated Heaven-Human Unity was enough to support him in surpassing level 120.</p><p></p><p>"I'm at level 135 now."</p><p></p><p>"The combat power... hasn't changed much, Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers are still easily slain."</p><p></p><p>"But... the strength has increased a lot, if I go back to the Blue Star and carry buildings, won't I be able to earn thousands of dollars a day?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Shen Lingxuan can't see her useless parasite husband, whose strength is now so great.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow I'll go to the Heaven Sect again, if she's not there, I'll have to go to the Raksha Kingdom first."</p><p></p><p>The performance of the blind artifact master was entering the final countdown.</p><p></p><p>He was about to go blind soon.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't ride Shen Lingxuan while blind, right?</p><p></p><p>Since the parasite husband act is stuck, he might as well first go play the God Descendent, and head to the Raksha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"God-Realm Armored Soldier..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became complex.</p><p></p><p>According to his estimation, a God-Realm Armored Soldier, when converted to other cosmic worlds, might be at the level of an Yin God.</p><p></p><p>In the Vast Celestial Realm, a full-power strike from an Yin God-level expert could erase an entire country, completely wiping out all living beings, soil, mountains, and stones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had also only defeated the Light Palace after forming a Stellar Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Now, the God-Realm Armored Soldiers in this budding universe did not have such impressive performance.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers, the God-Realm Armored Soldiers were truly as majestic as divine beings!</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers were, they could only rely on the power of the surrounding area of dozens of meters.</p><p></p><p>One punch could only affect a very small range, causing the earth to shake and the terrain to change, but they couldn't do things like holding up a mountain or cutting a river with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>They could only slash down a building.</p><p></p><p>But the God-Realm Armored Soldiers were different, they could hold up mountains, cut rivers with a single sword, truly able to withstand an entire army alone!</p><p></p><p>This kind of mighty power, the Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers could not resist at all.</p><p></p><p>"In my current state, not in the God Descendent mode, if I were to clash with a God-Realm Armored Soldier, I'm afraid... I would be shattered on contact."</p><p></p><p>Even with the Slay the Heavens Sword Technique, his powerful strength, the Death Radiance, and the endless vitality granted by the Vegetable Knife's final gift.</p><p></p><p>But as long as he collided with a God-Realm Armored Soldier, he would probably instantly become dust.</p><p></p><p>"The Raksha Kingdom has several God-Realm Armored Soldiers, it seems I have to be careful and try not to run into them."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still far behind the God-Realm Armored Soldiers in terms of power and combat prowess.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, only by further advancing the God Descendent persona could he narrow the gap.</p><p></p><p>His advantages against the God-Realm Armored Soldiers might only be in his bizarre techniques, outstanding speed, and the hardened physique granted by the Vegetable Knife.</p><p></p><p>"So for now, as long as I don't clash head-on, and encounter ordinary God-Realm Armored Soldiers, I should be fine.</p><p></p><p>Unless, they keep throwing big mountains at me."</p><p></p><p>"What's there to fear about God-Realm Armored Soldiers?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm still progressing, what about them?"</p><p></p><p>That night, the people in the inn were anxious, not daring to breathe loudly, and even afraid to sleep, lest their snoring disturb Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was someone who casually slew three Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>However, in the dead of night, there were also people who secretly took advantage of the darkness to leave, not wanting to stay here at all.</p><p></p><p>Wang Chunting tossed and turned, and finally left under the cover of night.</p><p></p><p>"I have to leave Ning Country!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>"How long will this mountain closure last?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if the Heaven-Realm Armored Soldiers really get angry, can we resist them?"</p><p></p><p>"I say we should just hand over Shen Shijie. I heard a prince from the Raksha Kingdom has taken a liking to Shen Shijie.</p><p></p><p>The Raksha Kingdom has God-Realm Armored Soldiers guarding it!"</p><p></p><p>"Watch your tongue, if the Elders hear you say such things, you'll have to go to the back mountain to do hard labor!"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with what I said? Since she's dragging us down, it's not wise!"</p><p></p><p>The man grumbled.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, daring to discuss the true disciple, slap your mouth!" Just then, a coquettish female voice came.</p><p></p><p>The man who had just spoken changed expressions repeatedly, his face full of fear: "Senior Sister Ye Zhen..."</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Zhen was from the Heaven Crafting Hall, she was also a disciple of the Heaven Sect, though not a true disciple.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of status, she was much higher than this big-mouthed junior disciple.</p><p></p><p>After the junior disciple was slapped, Ye Zhen and her group slowly walked away.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhen's face...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A lingering sense of unease always haunted her: "Sigh, I can only be an ordinary disciple at best."</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ye Zhen, these people are too outrageous," Jiang Yunxi said.</p><p></p><p>During this period, she had also left Eshan Lake and was invited to Tianxong, just arriving today.</p><p></p><p>Tianxong's invitation to Jiang Yunxi might not be without ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>"That prince of the Luosha Kingdom is even more despicable, clearly Lingxuan has a husband, yet he still wants to forcibly take her! If the Judgment God were still around, that prince and the third prince would both be dead!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi was most fond of biographical novels and had naturally heard the story of "The Swordswoman Who Beheaded the Three Princes."</p><p></p><p>"The only one to blame is our own weakness," Ye Zhen sighed. "In this matter, apart from Tianxong being able to lend some help, the Shen family is powerless, and as for Lingxuan's husband, there's no relying on him at all."</p><p></p><p>"If only the Judgment God were still alive, this kind of thing would never have happened," Jiang Yunxi lamented.</p><p></p><p>"You should go back and ask your father, and the emperor of Ning Kingdom, whether they are willing to have another Judgment God above them," Ye Zhen said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yunxi fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly resounded throughout Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>"Is Shen Lingxuan here?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was thunderous, like a clap of thunder, and everyone in Tianxong heard it.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Heaven-grade Armored Soldier from the Luosha Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>Several figures flew out from within Tianxong.</p><p></p><p>The leader was an old man in a Taoist robe, holding a Fa sword in his hand, with a youthful appearance despite his white hair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a trace of gloom flashed across his face.</p><p></p><p>"Senior from the Luosha Kingdom, Lingxuan is a disciple of our Tianxong, and there is absolutely no question of her becoming someone else's servant. Now that Lingxuan has left Tianxong, if you wish to find her, please go elsewhere."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxong Dao Leader held the sword, his voice soft but his tone resolute.</p><p></p><p>The other Earth-grade Armored Soldiers also flew over, looking at the newcomer with complex gazes.</p><p></p><p>"You are mistaken, I am not from the Luosha Kingdom. As the saying goes, all people are equal, how could I make Shen Lingxuan my servant?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke calmly, with an elegant demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"You are not from the Luosha Kingdom?" </p><p></p><p>"Who are you then?"</p><p></p><p>The many Earth-grade Armored Soldiers were surprised.</p><p></p><p>To shout so loudly that the entire Tianxong could hear, and the aura emanating from him was not easy to provoke, it seemed he was a Heaven-grade Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wang Qingyi widened her eyes: "You are Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>She had an incredulous expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not an ordinary person, how could he suddenly have such a terrifying aura?</p><p></p><p>"Who is Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wang, do you know him?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianxong elders present were surprised and wary as they looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This suddenly appearing Heaven-grade Armored Soldier, and Elder Wang actually knew him.</p><p></p><p>"He is... Lingxuan's husband..."</p><p></p><p>"What, that leech..." An elder blurted out, then quickly covered his mouth, not daring to continue.</p><p></p><p>The elders present all looked at Qi Yuan, and in the distance, Ye Zhen and Jiang Yunxi were also observing him, one with a strange expression, the other with some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"You are actually a Heaven-grade Armored Soldier? You... can't be more than twenty years old, right?" The Tianxong Dao Leader was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen such a young Heaven-grade Armored Soldier before.</p><p></p><p>No, he had never even seen an Earth-grade one.</p><p></p><p>The elders present were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had all heard about Shen Lingxuan's marriage.</p><p></p><p>They all felt that Shen Lingxuan's situation was not worth it.</p><p></p><p>But now, Shen Lingxuan's husband suddenly turned out to be a Heaven-grade Armored Soldier?</p><p></p><p>How could they not be alarmed?</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" The Tianxong Dao Leader suddenly became excited. "Since you are a Heaven-grade Armored Soldier, you have the power to protect Lingxuan, quickly take Lingxuan and leave Ning Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>An ordinary Heaven-grade Armored Soldier, of course, would not be a match for the veteran Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers of the Luosha Kingdom, but he would be enough to protect Lingxuan and help her escape, so that she would no longer be in such a dangerous and passive situation.</p><p></p><p>"I came here just to ask if Lingxuan has returned, I've searched all over the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss but haven't found her," Qi Yuan said disappointedly.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxong Dao Leader's expression changed slightly when he heard this: "Cough, cough... This old man does not know."</p><p></p><p>This time, Shen Lingxuan left very discreetly, without leaving any specific whereabouts or contact information, for fear that the Luosha Kingdom would trace her.</p><p></p><p>"You can't contact her either?" Qi Yuan's disappointment grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>It seems the role of the leech husband has come to an end.</p><p></p><p>He had to go to the Luosha Kingdom and boost his performance as the Godly Advent.</p><p></p><p>"Please stay as a guest in Tianxong, Tianxong will definitely use all its power to find Lingxuan," the Tianxong Dao Leader said.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan stayed, wielding the Dao Leader's Fa artifact of Tianxong, perhaps the Luosha Kingdom's Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers would not be able to break through the formation so easily.</p><p></p><p>"No need, since I can't find her, I have to leave. Oh, if you see Shen Lingxuan, just tell her I... went to the Luosha Kingdom, and will probably go to the Shenmu Abyss later," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Women will not hinder his steps.</p><p></p><p>Since he cannot play the role of the leech husband, then he will play the role of the Godly Advent.</p><p></p><p>"The Luosha Kingdom?" The Tianxong Dao Leader's expression changed slightly. "How can the senior go to the Luosha Kingdom, isn't that walking into the tiger's den?"</p><p></p><p>"What tiger's den? I'm going there... to demand justice," Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>The Luosha Kingdom, their god has returned! "Senior, please reconsider!" The Tianxong Dao Leader still thought Qi Yuan was angered by the matter of Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>The Luosha Kingdom not only had Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers, but even God-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>"Reconsider what?" Qi Yuan smiled, his expression calm. "You don't need to close the mountain anymore either."</p><p></p><p>"If we don't close the mountain, the Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers from the Luosha Kingdom will barge in..." muttered one of the elders.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, that kind of thing won't happen, the dozen or so Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers of the Luosha Kingdom have all been slain by me!" </p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The elders present were somewhat dazed, doubting if they had heard correctly.</p><p></p><p>"They were all killed by me in the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss," Qi Yuan's voice was calm, and the gentle smile on his face gave a faint sense of detachment as he spoke these words.</p><p></p><p>"They were all killed by the young master, you can go ask Situ Sihai and King Dao about this matter," Chen Kangbao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>He then took out some hair.</p><p></p><p>"See, these hairs were all cut from the heads of those Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers, I'm going to make a broom with them," Chen Kangbao said contentedly.</p><p></p><p>The breathing of the many Earth-grade Armored Soldiers present quickened, and they looked at the hair with shocked expressions. Qi Yuan had killed... the dozen or so Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers of the Luosha Kingdom? How was that possible? But that hair, it was indeed... from Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers. Especially the golden hair among them, they had seen it before, apart from the Heaven-grade Armored Soldier of the Luosha Kingdom, Ning Kingdom had almost no one with this kind of hair.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, everyone, see you again someday, bye-bye."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not hesitate at all, disappearing along with Chen Kangbao, leaving only a bewildered crowd behind.</p><p></p><p>The figures vanished, and the wind was still blowing.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, an elder said, "Was someone just here?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes?"</p><p></p><p>"The leech husband? Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"A Heaven-grade Armored Soldier?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm... He killed the Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers of the Luosha Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm still not fully awake, I should continue sleeping," the elder muttered.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Ye Zhen watched this scene, the shock in her heart not dissipating for a long time. After a while, she squinted her eyes and murmured, "These two people... I feel like I've seen them somewhere before?"</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ye Zhen, you also have this feeling? ... I also feel like I've seen them both before!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sun sets in the remaining night, the bright moon rises with the tide.</p><p></p><p>The Luosha Kingdom and Ning Kingdom are separated by mountains, rivers, and even an ocean.</p><p></p><p>A large ship sailed in the night, and Qi Yuan looked at the scattered stars in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The performance of the leech husband has been constantly increasing during this period, and is now stuck at 90%."</p><p></p><p>After leaving Tianxong, the performance of the leech husband has been constantly increasing. He didn't do anything special, yet it kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan estimated that the news of him slaying the Luosha Kingdom's Heaven-grade Armored Soldiers must have gradually spread throughout Ning Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Probably the people of the Shen family have also learned of this news.</p><p></p><p>The name of the leech husband Qi Yuan is now known throughout the land.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, even though the leech husband Qi Yuan is cowardly, he also has a heart that wants to show off.</p><p></p><p>Just by pretending a bit in Tianxong, his performance has increased by nearly 30%."</p><p></p><p>At 30% performance, he awakened the heart of refining tools; at 60% performance, he awakened the Yin-Yang White Fire; at 90% performance, what Qi Yuan awakened was... the Faint Mandate of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"This Faint Mandate of Heaven... is it the same as I understand it? What does it represent?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After awakening the Faint Mandate of Heaven, he did not feel that he had changed much from before.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what is the Mandate of Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>When encountering problems he doesn't understand, he can ask the netizens in the Shenmu Abyss, especially the staff member of the Thorny Blood, who knows a lot and seems to be a dedicated NPC for explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you asking about this?" The staff member of the Thorny Blood was always online. "Speaking of the Mandate of Heaven, it is a very mysterious thing. Simply put, those who bear the Mandate of Heaven are more beloved by Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>"This sounds like a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Being beloved by Heaven and Earth, one's luck would also improve, and cultivation would be more effortless.</p><p></p><p>"It's both good and bad," the Thorny Blood staff member suddenly said. "Do you know of the Godly Advent?"</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"It is a divine artifact that bears the Mandate of Heaven. According to the records in the Blue Mountain Book, its destruction is closely related to the Mandate of Heaven it bears."</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it the Luosha Kingdom that destroyed the Godly Advent?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he currently had, it was the Luosha Kingdom that ambushed and destroyed the Godly Advent.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Godly Advent is a peak existence of the Three Steps to the Heavens, just a step away from condensing a Divine Realm. How could the Luosha Kingdom have the ability to deal with such an existence? </p><p></p><p>It is precisely because the Godly Advent was shrouded by the Mandate of Heaven, involving some hidden secrets, that it was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>As for the inside story, I, a small fry, do not know.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps one day in the future, if I have the chance to step into the Seventh Realm, I may be qualified to know.</p><p></p><p>But with my talent... I shouldn't even think about it."</p><p></p><p>"So... there are people who pay attention to the Mandate of Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"You can say that. If you have the Mandate of Heaven, it's best to hide it, otherwise, you never know when a mysterious powerful figure might suddenly appear and kill you."</p><p></p><p>"Why would they kill those with the Mandate of Heaven?" Qi Yuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>"Because... the Mandate of Heaven represents the world's recognition. Perhaps some people... unable to gain the world's recognition, become enraged and desperate?"</p><p></p><p>The Thorny Blood staff member said, "These are just my speculations, not to be taken as the truth."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for telling me so much, when I go to the Shenmu Abyss, I'll treat you to some buns."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

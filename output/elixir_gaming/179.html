        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi ignored Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>For things she couldn't understand, she assumed it was due to a generation gap with her ancient godfather, so it was normal not to understand.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I go to Flying Wasteland City to look for a solution? There are many immortal masters there who are experts in agriculture."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "I've got it! Leave this matter to me!"</p><p></p><p>Immortal masters were experts in agriculture, so why didn't he visualize a great god who presided over agriculture?</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan remembered correctly, both Houji and Shennong were gods who presided over agriculture.</p><p></p><p>According to some ancient records, Houji was the ancestor of the Zhou dynasty, the son of the Supreme God, and served as prime minister during the eras of Yao and Shun. He was the first person to store grain in the national treasury and establish the system of land measurement.</p><p></p><p>He had given seeds to the common people and taught them how to farm, earning him the titles of God of Millet and God of Agriculture.</p><p></p><p>As for Shennong, he was even more famous. Who on the Blue Star didn't know about Shennong tasting a hundred herbs? But thinking that the status of these two gods seemed very high, Qi Yuan felt that his evil god spiritual power might not be able to visualize these two.</p><p></p><p>He had to settle for second best.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the temple and once again entered the visualization chat group.</p><p></p><p>The group was very lively.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, this master has visualized another rare god visualization method. It seems someone has failed in visualization again," the Divine Cat Master said in the group.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be dissing the group owner Dong Jianghe.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a bunch of old men, looking down on the young Heavenly Emperor, are you?" Dong Jianghe retorted.</p><p></p><p>"You dare call yourself the young Heavenly Emperor? The Origin Supreme Venerable looks more qualified than you," the Black Dragon Master said in the group.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe noticed something and carefully asked: "Origin Supreme Venerable, are you here to visualize this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Which true god are you planning to visualize this time?" Dong Jianghe probed, trying to gauge Qi Yuan's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if things continued like this, with more and more group members taking off, his right to bark orders would diminish.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to visualize a powerful one this time, but unfortunately my evil god spiritual power is too little. So, I plan to visualize someone... weaker," Qi Yuan answered this way.</p><p></p><p>In his understanding, that god did seem quite weak.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Jianghe immediately beamed with joy.</p><p></p><p>Finally, not visualizing someone powerful! His title as the young Heavenly Emperor was safe!</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, visualizing an ordinary one-star is not bad," Dong Jianghe couldn't help saying. "After all, not everyone is like White Xi Venerable, with one epic and three rare ones. As for me... I'm destined to surpass White Xi Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The group members immediately started mocking Dong Jianghe again: "East Heavenly Emperor, when are you going to visualize another rare one?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan greeted the people in the group and entered the visualization realm again.</p><p></p><p>A majestic visualization mountain stood before him.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the image of the god he was visualizing immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Shaped like an old man, holding a cane made of goosefoot. White beard and hair, with a kindly smile."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in a small temple, the image of an old man with a white beard appeared.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, a monkey with a thunderous voice would suddenly strike the ground, and this little old man would hurriedly burrow out of the earth.</p><p></p><p>The visualization mountain asked two questions of the heart again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the same method, directly illuminating himself with the Fixed Star Golden Elixir.</p><p></p><p>After about a few breaths of time, the visualization mountain suddenly emitted a great radiance.</p><p></p><p>A god visualization method appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>And the three evil god spiritual powers in his hand had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one was even at the Purple Palace level.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes showed a surprised expression: "It's so much stronger than Howling Celestial Dog?"</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, the other's incense offerings were not on the same level as Howling Celestial Dog's, so it was normal.</p><p></p><p>Holding the god visualization method, Qi Yuan exited the visualization mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the group was still lively.</p><p></p><p>"Just now the visualization mountain flashed with golden light, did someone get an epic? Origin Supreme Venerable just went in, could it be him?" Divine Cat Master asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe hurriedly said: "He already said he was visualizing someone very ordinary this time, how could it be an epic? Moreover, from my observation of Origin Supreme Venerable, he only has the ability of Three Steps to Heaven, it's impossible for him to know so many rare true gods."</p><p></p><p>"East Heavenly Emperor, don't speak so absolutely!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Origin Supreme Venerable has come out, quickly tell us, what did you visualize this time?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the group messages and smiled helplessly: "I had good luck this time, I visualized... an epic one-star."</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that the little old man, who was unknown in history books, would actually be an epic one-star.</p><p></p><p>"What? Origin Supreme Venerable, it's not good to joke like this!" Dong Jianghe said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not lying to you, it really is an epic one-star. This time I visualized the Earth God."</p><p></p><p>The Earth God also managed some agricultural affairs.</p><p></p><p>And some ancient records state that the Earth God is Houtu.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan visualized was the Earth God in his memory.</p><p></p><p>"Earth God, what kind of true god is this? I've never heard of it!"</p><p></p><p>"Was there really such a great god in ancient times?"</p><p></p><p>"East Heavenly Emperor, I'm also preparing to visualize, come and curse me!"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>"I think there won't be an East Heavenly Emperor in the future, only an East Dead Emperor. It should be Origin Heavenly Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>The group messages were very lively, with everyone praising Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even White Xi Venerable appeared and chimed in with a couple of praises, also advising Qi Yuan to leave the fallen area.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Supreme Venerable, you visualized an epic one-star? Your future is promising!" Heavenly Treasure Venerable said in the group. "I happen to have a few treasures that can help people break through to true god status, I might not need them, why don't I give them to you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately felt that there were still many good people in the group.</p><p></p><p>"No need, no need, Heavenly Treasure Venerable, keep them for yourself. After some time, I'll treat you to a feast!" </p><p></p><p>"Alright..."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want them, Heavenly Treasure Godfather, I want them!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Treasure Godfather!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exited the chat group.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, there was now an Earth God visualization method.</p><p></p><p>"Who should I give this visualization method to?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that Qi Qi was a girl, being an Earth God would be too incongruous.</p><p></p><p>"Little Snow is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan immediately made his decision.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I'm hungry, I want to eat pork!" </p><p></p><p>Maid Little Snow rolled up her pants and was working hard planting in the field.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be lazy, finish the work, then go raise pigs, there will be plenty of pork to eat!" Qi Qi had long since put aside her young lady's airs and was doing farm work in the field.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think is the solution the divine lord mentioned?" Maid Little Snow couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was stunned upon hearing this, she was also curious: "This matter... I'm not sure either."</p><p></p><p>The longer she stayed with her godfather, the more mysterious she felt he was.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, that crazy old woman is here again," Maid Little Snow pointed at the old woman on the field ridge.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi saw the old woman and frowned.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Then she heard the old woman mumble unclearly: "You were born noble, how can you do such lowly work? Miss, come away with me, leave this remote mountain village!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi frowned even more: "First, farming work concerns the food of all people in the world, and is not lowly. Second, I am not your miss, and I won't go with you. If you keep talking nonsense, I'll have Big Black chase you away."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Qi's words, the crazy old woman couldn't help but sigh: "Let's go, let's go." </p><p></p><p>She was confused, talking and running at the same time, until she finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Don't pay attention to that crazy old woman in the future!" Qi Qi ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, what if what she said is true? What if you are someone of noble birth with a powerful bloodline?" the maid Xiao Xue couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"What use is that?" Qi Qi blurted out.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was immersed in the joy of cultivating her adoptive father, thoroughly enjoying it.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I have a noble bloodline, don't I still have to cultivate and work hard myself? That's very difficult. I'd rather cultivate my adoptive father. I think he has the potential to become a great venerable!" Qi Qi said.</p><p></p><p>The maid Xiao Xue nodded, feeling that what the miss said made sense.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice transmission entered her ear.</p><p></p><p>A strange look appeared in maid Xiao Xue's eyes: "Miss, the master is calling me."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go together," Qi Qi said, also finding it a bit strange. Why would her adoptive father call Xiao Xue for no reason?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xiao Xue had some problem with raising pigs? The two of them came to the temple and immediately saw Qi Yuan sitting on a stone bench.</p><p></p><p>"Sit down quickly. Xiao Xue, I have a method of observing gods here. Do you want to cultivate it?" Qi Yuan got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was slightly stunned when she heard this.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't expected her adoptive father to come up with another method of observing gods so quickly.</p><p></p><p>And he was giving it to Xiao Xue instead of her.</p><p></p><p>She thought about it and figured it must be because this method was lower level than the one for the black dog, and her adoptive father was saving the better one for her.</p><p></p><p>Giving it to Xiao Xue showed he trusted her.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Maid Xiao Xue also hadn't expected such a great opportunity to fall into her lap.</p><p></p><p>"But cultivating this method of observing gods may have a tiny side effect," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"What side effect?" Maid Xiao Xue didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>"You might become shorter," This was Qi Yuan's speculation, he actually didn't know for sure.</p><p></p><p>But he had to say it in advance, otherwise if Xiao Xue became shorter, she would certainly have complaints.</p><p></p><p>"That kind of side effect is nothing. At worst, Xiao Xue, you can use magic to become tall again," Qi Qi said generously.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary method of observing gods, it was fine to give it away.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Xue nodded vigorously: "I want it!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, this is the method of observing gods. Take it and study it!" Qi Yuan gave the golden glowing method to maid Xiao Xue.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi beside him widened her eyes: "Golden light, epic one-star?"</p><p></p><p>She was completely unsettled now! She had thought it was an ordinary method of observing gods.</p><p></p><p>But it turned out to be epic, even more precious than the black dog's!</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive father, something so precious is too wasteful! Actually, daughter also wants to become shorter, to return to adoptive father's embrace!" She couldn't stay calm about this epic one-star.</p><p></p><p>An epic one-star could definitely create a true god, as long as there were materials available for breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Qi Qi deliberately transformed into a little girl form, her height only reaching Qi Yuan's waist, looking quite adorable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "You'll have yours in the future. Let's give this one to Xiao Xue, it's more suitable for her."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi looked dejected: "Adoptive father..."</p><p></p><p>An epic one-star method of observing gods was truly too rare!</p><p></p><p>She couldn't balance it in her heart.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if her own method of observing gods had been given to someone else.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was now helping her adoptive father become stronger. She had a feeling that her adoptive father's things were her things.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xue was her maid, true, but a pig feeder didn't deserve an epic one-star.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright." Qi Yuan chuckled, "Xiao Xue, try this method of observing gods."</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue glanced at her miss, but ultimately couldn't resist her anticipation and accepted the method.</p><p></p><p>She immediately entered a state of deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive father, a mountain pig can't eat fine bran!" Qi Qi said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was her adoptive father's method of observing gods. It was his freedom to give it to whoever he wanted, and she had no right to say anything.</p><p></p><p>But she still felt unfair in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, kill more evil gods and you'll get methods of observing gods," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive father, I'm just afraid you'll run out of stock!" Qi Qi said.</p><p></p><p>After all, in ancient times, there were only so many gods who received incense offerings.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of the strongest ones had already been observed by people.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many epic ones like this left.</p><p></p><p>As for legendary ones, they were even rarer.</p><p></p><p>And mythical ones... they probably hadn't appeared for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>A night passed without words, Qi Qi looked at Xiao Xue with a resentful face.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qi Yuan hugged little Jia and went into the pit to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next day, blood-red light once again illuminated the earth, and Qi Yuan felt refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Because he had leveled up again.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xiao Xue with satisfaction in his eyes: "Not bad, Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>The method of observing gods improved so quickly.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's small domain, there were already two Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Xue opened her eyes, showing joy: "Thank you, master. Thank you, miss."</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi still looked resentful: "Sigh, Xiao Xue, looks like you'll be going to conquer other villages in the future. I can only watch from behind."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xue had advanced to Purple Palace and was now a major fighting force.</p><p></p><p>"The innate divine ability Xiao Xue awakened at Purple Palace may be different from others. Her combat power is very ordinary, she's best at guarding land and farming," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Earth God was not originally a combat-type deity.</p><p></p><p>And he sensed that the innate divine ability Xiao Xue awakened was also related to farming.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Hearing this, Qi Qi widened her eyes, "The god Xiao Xue observed has a divine position? And it's related to farming? How is that possible? Isn't the Dark Dragon Venerable in charge of farming?"</p><p></p><p>But the Dark Dragon Venerable had been observed countless times and could no longer allow people to cultivate to Purple Palace and awaken farming-related innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Now she was being told there was another god in charge of farming?</p><p></p><p>What did that mean? Where did it come from?</p><p></p><p>Recommending a good new book, link below "The Game Became Real, I Became Immortal in Reality"</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: When playing games can make you stronger, why should I go out and adventure?

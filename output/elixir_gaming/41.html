        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Family, what do I do? My family has arranged a ghost marriage for me!"</p><p></p><p>Then, a watermelon head special effect is added.</p><p></p><p>If it's on a certain platform, the comments might be "Sister, hang in there."</p><p></p><p>If it's on a certain forum, the comments might be "Brother, you're blessed."</p><p></p><p>Of course, these are just stereotypes.</p><p></p><p>These responses won't solve Qi Yuan's current problem.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his new bride.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to see her face, her eyebrows and eyes, her arms and thighs.</p><p></p><p>Is it too much to look at one's own bride?</p><p></p><p>But this bride... has no face.</p><p></p><p>Not only no face, but no hands or legs.</p><p></p><p>No... jade feet.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I just took a nap, how did I end up married to an NPC?"</p><p></p><p>The place Qi Yuan was in was a place similar to a bridal chamber.</p><p></p><p>There were paper flowers pasted on the windows, with the word "joy" written on them.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the game, he and the bride were lying on a board.</p><p></p><p>His bride was a large red wedding dress, in the ancient Chinese style, the kind you see in horror movies.</p><p></p><p>If you look closely, you can even imagine a beautiful, graceful, and charming bride.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the dress monster, or rather, the wedding dress monster.</p><p></p><p>He sighed helplessly: "I really want to solve you with a sword and turn you into an experience pack."</p><p></p><p>As if understanding Qi Yuan's words, the large red wedding dress shrank back a little.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan ultimately did not kill this NPC.</p><p></p><p>At the time, when fighting the Ugly Dress Monster King in the forbidden area, the blood-red gas of the Ugly Dress Monster King entered Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>That gas was extremely troublesome for him, continuously weakening his attributes, and even trying to gradually control Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>And that red gas was helped to be dispelled by this wedding dress monster, Qi Yuan's new bride.</p><p></p><p>Everyone helped you? How can you have the heart to turn her into an experience pack? Moreover, this wedding dress monster seems to have some intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Unlike those who see Qi Yuan and just want to attack him, this one is different.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the wedding dress monster sitting on the board, only a step away from him, and slowly said, "Who are you? What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>The wedding dress monster did not respond, motionless.</p><p></p><p>"No name?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't remember?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll call you... 'Xiao Hong'?"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Monster?"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Jia!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Qi Yuan gave the wedding dress monster a name - Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Xiao Jia has no face, no skin, no legs, no hands... if the sleeves and pant legs count as hands and legs, then she has them.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I've accidentally picked up a wife." Qi Yuan didn't know whether to be happy or worried.</p><p></p><p>This wife still cannot communicate with him normally.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you marry me?" Qi Yuan still tried to communicate with Xiao Jia, even though she seemed unable to respond.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan was surprised that Xiao Jia did not remain unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>From her red sleeves, she threw out a wooden plaque.</p><p></p><p>The wooden plaque was very ancient in material, with two characters written on it.</p><p></p><p>"Husband?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, the two characters written on it were "husband."</p><p></p><p>"You want me to be your husband? So you took the opportunity when I was offline to marry me?" Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He had encountered an existence even more absurd than himself.</p><p></p><p>And it was an NPC.</p><p></p><p>"No, we didn't go to the civil affairs bureau, so it doesn't count!" Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to marry a piece of clothing.</p><p></p><p>Although brothers are like hands and feet, and women are like clothes, you can't actually be a real piece of clothing, right?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would the married life be coordinated?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia's sleeves tightly grasped Qi Yuan's arm and refused to let go.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't speak, but her actions made it clear.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed helplessly: "Since you can communicate with wooden plaques, at least get more plaques and introduce yourself more."</p><p></p><p>His eyes looked towards Xiao Jia...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The information presented was not much.</p><p></p><p>[Little Jia, your eight-bearer sedan is welcoming the new bride.]</p><p></p><p>Little Jia's hand trembled, and eight wooden boards fell out of her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Where did these come from?" Qi Yuan stared at Little Jia's sleeve, "Can I reach in and have a look?"</p><p></p><p>Little Jia did not step back, which meant she did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand reached into Little Jia's sleeve, rummaging around her chest, appendix, and liver area, but... he came up empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>As for Little Jia, she seemed to have a strong reaction and directly collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally stopped searching and instead helped Little Jia up, looking at the eight wooden boards above.</p><p></p><p>One was a male figure, with the word "Husband" written on it.</p><p>One was a wedding dress image, with the word "Wife" written on it.</p><p>One was a smiling face.</p><p>One was a crying face.</p><p>One was a sticking together image.</p><p>One was a hand-in-sleeve image.</p><p>One was a sleeping image.</p><p>One was a lying flat image.</p><p></p><p>"Were you a wholesaler of emoticons in your previous life?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but make a sarcastic remark.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Little Jia could use the wooden boards to express her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He immediately conducted a test.</p><p></p><p>For example, he made some wooden boards for Little Jia, asking her to express her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>To Qi Yuan's disappointment, it didn't work.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia could only take out those eight wooden boards.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that her world could only be represented by those eight wooden boards.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, let's get a divorce." Qi Yuan said, "Our relationship has broken down, let's apply for a divorce."</p><p></p><p>Little Jia tightly grasped Qi Yuan's arm, and a wooden board slid down, showing the "hand-in-sleeve" image.</p><p></p><p>"Can you help me?" For some reason, Qi Yuan seemed to be able to understand the meaning represented by the image, both indicating for him not to leave and that she could help him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became interested and looked at Little Jia.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Little Jia's entire cold body pressed against Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>A special change occurred at that moment.</p><p></p><p>In the bridal chamber, the blood-red wedding dress turned into red light dots, like red fireflies, falling on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>In less than a thousandth of a second, the red fireflies transformed into a red armor, covering Qi Yuan's body, completely concealing his body parts, leaving only his eyes exposed.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, the armor was blood-red, like flowing blood, but this fluid-type armor gave Qi Yuan an extremely strong sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Exquisite and beautiful, mysterious and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the blood armor, Qi Yuan held a great sword, and his entire height also rose to ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was like a terrifying demon walking in hell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that there was a wedding dress tattoo on his chest.</p><p></p><p>The tattoo was exactly the same as Little Jia's.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that the wedding dress pattern was Little Jia's true form.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored armor was the defense that Little Jia had bestowed upon him, and not Little Jia's true body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself, stunned: "Level 93?"</p><p></p><p>By wearing Little Jia, or merging with her, he had suddenly increased by 5 levels, becoming level 93.</p><p></p><p>However, he vaguely felt that this was temporary.</p><p></p><p>This made him quite excited.</p><p></p><p>That was 5 levels! A 5-level increase was a huge boost for Qi Yuan, making it much easier for him to grind monsters.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered the level 95 Ugly Clothes Emperor again, he wouldn't have to directly flee, and he even had a chance to defeat it in a one-on-one fight.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this one-on-one would be him and Little Jia against the Ugly Clothes Emperor.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an unexpected thing happened to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He activated two skills simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>One was a major skill, and the other was a minor skill.</p><p></p><p>Every 30 levels, Qi Yuan could obtain a major skill that could be used in the real world.</p><p>Every 10 levels, he would gain a minor skill.</p><p></p><p>By merging with Little Jia, Qi Yuan's level had broken through 90, and he had gained two skills.</p><p></p><p>These two skills were the major skill [Comrade-in-Arms] and the minor skill [Rend Clothes].</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

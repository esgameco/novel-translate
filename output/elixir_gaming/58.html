        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I want to know where there are more of the Five Souls, the more the better," Qi Yuan asked the question he was most concerned about.</p><p></p><p>The number of Five Souls here is too small, not even enough to fill a gap in the teeth.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the three people present all doubted whether their ears had heard wrong.</p><p></p><p>How could someone ask where there are more Five Souls? </p><p></p><p>Shouldn't they be asking where there are fewer? "Two hundred li from here, there is a valley with two hundred wood souls, I don't know if that would meet the needs of the Lord of the Clothing Department?" Tang Yan answered cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a little disappointed: "Is there no more than that?"</p><p></p><p>"More than that, how much more?" The girl with the bun couldn't help but interrupt.</p><p></p><p>"The more the better, a thousand is not too many, ten thousand... a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was a little puzzled, not knowing why Qi Yuan would ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>When entering the Tempering Grounds, shouldn't one seek a quiet place to slowly cultivate and condense the Qi of the Five Essences? "Why do you want to find a place with more of the Five Elemental Souls?" The man in red asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave him a blank look, feeling this red-clad man was a bit silly: "Of course it's to obtain the Qi of the Five Essences. The more Five Souls there are, the more Qi of the Five Essences there will be, and the better to collect."</p><p></p><p>The man in red heard this and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan looked at Qi Yuan, realizing that Qi Yuan might have just entered the Tempering Grounds of the Five Elements for too short a time, and had not yet obtained the Qi of the Five Essences, not knowing the key points.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly told Qi Yuan the key points: "Lord of the Clothing Department, obtaining the Qi of the Five Essences is not a simple matter, there are some key things to pay attention to..."</p><p></p><p>However, at the end, Tang Yan added: "Going east for a thousand li, there is a deep abyss, which is the core of the Tempering Grounds of the Five Elements, where the number of Five Souls exceeds ten thousand."</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan spoke at length, also telling Qi Yuan the route to the core area, and the man in red standing beside him really wanted to laugh.</p><p></p><p>But he had to hold back the laughter and wait until the Lord of the Clothing Department left to laugh.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he was caught talking behind someone's back and then laughed in their face, that would be quite embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is it difficult to obtain the Qi of the Five Essences?"</p><p></p><p>"It's very difficult. Even someone with extraordinary talent like Big Brother Tang Yan needs a year to cultivate and obtain a wisp of the Qi of the Water Essence," the girl with the bun answered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression did not change, he looked at the water soul trapped behind the girl: "Do you still need this one?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl was slightly stunned, instinctively answering: "No."</p><p></p><p>"That's good, although you are... but I don't want to fight with you either." </p><p></p><p>He said, swinging his sword, and the water soul was immediately cut in two.</p><p></p><p>Experience +100.</p><p>Qi of the Water Essence +1 (wisp).</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the red-clad man who had been holding back his laughter now stared wide-eyed, even wanting to rub his eyes to make sure it wasn't an illusion!</p><p></p><p>What did he see! That Lord of the Clothing Department casually swung his sword and slew a water soul, and then... he cultivated a wisp of the Qi of the Water Essence.</p><p></p><p>This is too easy, right? Talent?</p><p></p><p>Impossible! It must be a coincidence!</p><p></p><p>The red-clad man thought so, and Tang Yan and the bun-headed girl also had the same thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Clothing Department, your talent is amazing. I didn't expect that in just a few moments, you could cultivate the Qi of the Water Essence." Tang Yan praised.</p><p></p><p>He could now confirm that the Lord of the Clothing Department was a prodigy whose talent surpassed even his own, and that he was also of the water attribute.</p><p></p><p>"I'm different from you." Qi Yuan did not feel his talent was anything special.</p><p></p><p>The difference between him and these people was that he was a player, and killing monsters would reward him.</p><p></p><p>While these NPCs needed to truly cultivate and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words also left the three of them speechless.</p><p></p><p>Especially the bun-headed girl, she felt the Lord of the Clothing Department's mouth was as piercing as the red-clad man's, and she wanted to find something to stuff it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the red-clad man: "Those three water souls behind you, do you still want them?"</p><p></p><p>The red-clad man hurriedly shook his head: "No."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Then I'll take them."</p><p></p><p>He took his sword and walked towards the three water souls.</p><p></p><p>The red-clad man was a little stunned seeing this.</p><p></p><p>What is the Lord of the Clothing Department doing? Could it be...</p><p></p><p>He saw Qi Yuan approach the water souls and slash three times.</p><p></p><p>The three water souls that were originally trapped immediately died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The experience points and Qi of the Water Essence were all obtained by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The bun-headed girl was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The red-clad man was completely speechless.</p><p></p><p>Three wisps of the Qi of the Water Essence?</p><p></p><p>Three sword strikes, three water souls perished, and the Lord of the Clothing Department actually cultivated three wisps of the Qi of the Water Essence!</p><p></p><p>When did cultivating the Qi of the Water Essence become this simple?</p><p></p><p>Just kill the water souls directly? They, in order to obtain the Qi of the Five Essences, how many times have they prepared in advance, found suitable Five Souls, created a quiet environment, then slowly cultivated, experienced failure after failure, and finally occasionally succeeded? He just slashed one to death and cultivated the Qi of the Water Essence, what kind of monster is this!</p><p></p><p>Is there a problem with the Tempering Grounds of the Five Elements? The red-clad man really wanted to find a water soul, slash it to death, and see if he could cultivate the Qi of the Water Essence.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the water souls around had all been killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After killing three water souls, Qi Yuan handed the big sword to the little bride, and said again: "Is it really that difficult to obtain the Qi of the Water Essence?"</p><p></p><p>The three people on the scene were silent.</p><p></p><p>Even Tang Yan felt that the water soul power he had cultivated today was not as impressive anymore.</p><p></p><p>They three looked at each other, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>"People are different, don't be discouraged, keep working hard, young fellows. Thank you for the information, I have to go!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, embracing the little bride and heading towards the core of the Tempering Grounds of the Five Elements.</p><p></p><p>There, countless Five Souls await him.</p><p></p><p>And on the scene, only a dazed expression remained.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Three People</p><p></p><p>"Was I just hallucinating? Did I really see the Master of the Clothing Department?" the man in red clothes spoke first.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>The girl with the bun then said, "I might have had the same hallucination as you."</p><p></p><p>The usually refined and cultured Tang Yan couldn't help but curse, "The Master of the Clothing Department is really... 'born'!"</p><p></p><p>After that, he couldn't help but sigh, "The Master of the Clothing Department is definitely a natural water-type, the son of the Water Essence, no, the father of the Water Essence, the ancestor of the Water Essence!"</p><p></p><p>But the man in red clothes couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a natural water-type, how could he release a sword strike with such a powerful water aura?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there was a problem in the Five Elements Tempering Ground.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a Water Essence appeared not far from the three, rushing towards the man in red.</p><p></p><p>Yes, it was the man in red, as if he was the one attracting the resentment!</p><p></p><p>The sharp-eyed man in red was the first to see it, and he hurriedly and excitedly said, "I'll go!"</p><p></p><p>He rushed over, afraid that someone would snatch it.</p><p></p><p>However, when he killed the Water Essence, he got nothing.</p><p></p><p>He was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He remembered the words the Master of the Clothing Department said before leaving.</p><p></p><p>People are different from each other.</p><p></p><p>But... even if they are different, they shouldn't be this different, right?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tang Yan said, "I have a suggestion, how about we go to... the Core Area?"</p><p></p><p>The man in red and the girl with the bun heard this and quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>After all, people are different from each other.</p><p></p><p>They don't know when they will be able to comprehend the water aura again, and going to the Core Area won't delay them much.</p><p></p><p>Seeing someone kill a Water Essence with a single sword strike and comprehend the water aura, if they miss this opportunity, they might never see it again in their lifetime!</p><p></p><p>The three of them were all water-attributed, how could they miss an opportunity to witness such a historic event?...</p><p></p><p>A thousand-mile journey is not considered very far for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, it still takes some time to travel.</p><p></p><p>Especially since he encountered other Essences along the way, which were not few.</p><p></p><p>Even a mosquito's leg is still meat.</p><p></p><p>He collected them all.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan's group was chasing behind, but their speed was no match for Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan was killing and moving forward, they still couldn't catch up.</p><p></p><p>However, during the chase, they transmitted the information inside to the people outside.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Master of the Clothing Department's natural talent was too amazing. If he mastered the water attribute and combined with the Empress's Bridal Gown, he would probably be able to display a peak domain-level combat power! It's just a pity that he's too young! Otherwise, if he had a little more time, he would definitely be more terrifying than the celestial gods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was unaware that three people were chasing him.</p><p></p><p>He did not directly fly to the Core Area.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was very close to the 93rd level.</p><p></p><p>He planned to break through to the 93rd level on the way, and then go to the Core Area.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even the strongest spear would be pierced into a needle when facing tens of thousands of Essences.</p><p></p><p>Improving his combat power a bit more before going to the Core Area would be the right way.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that when Tang Yan's group arrived at the Core Area, they did not find Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The man in red looked at the Core Area from afar and felt the terrifying aura within: "Could it be that the Master of the Clothing Department tricked us? He used an illusion, and he never actually came!"</p><p></p><p>The girl with the bun glared at the man in red, and her body moved a little further away from him: "You should talk less. Don't you know that you attract the most attention from the Essences?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The man in red's mouth was too loose, and his behavior was also problematic. Wherever he appeared, he often attracted the Essences to attack.</p><p></p><p>If it were in other places, it would still be fine, but this was the Core Area, where there might even be Domain-level Essences.</p><p></p><p>"You're worrying too much. Those previous incidents were just coincidences." The words had just left the man in red's mouth when a thunderous roar came from the Core Area.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yan and the girl with the bun looked at the man in red.</p><p></p><p>The two of them immediately turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, tens of thousands of Essences roared and rushed out of the Core Area, dense and overwhelming, like a stampede of horses.</p><p></p><p>The man in red cried with a gloomy face, "Wait for me, really, don't mind my business!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk anymore... Ah, ah, ah, don't run towards me!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't come to my side!" Tang Yan was also very disgusted.</p><p></p><p>The three of them fled frantically, with tens of thousands of Essences chasing behind them.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Qi Yuan led Little Bride and quietly came to the Core Area.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the empty Core Area and had a puzzled expression: "Could it be that I came to the wrong place?"</p><p></p><p>However, he scanned the distant mountains with a suspicious gaze.</p><p></p><p>He clearly felt the aura of the Essences that had been here.</p><p></p><p>"The ground is still warm, they couldn't have gone far. Could it be that they went to have a party without me?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about this and gritted his teeth, saying, "It's too much to have a party without inviting me!"</p><p></p><p>He still entered the Core Area.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, after coming here, he felt his body becoming a little flushed.</p><p></p><p>The Five Essence Qi in his body also seemed to be boiling.</p><p></p><p>And in the abyss, something seemed to be flickering.</p><p></p><p>Thank you [Book Friend 20210403030807498] for the generous reward, I am very grateful and happy! Thank you!</p><p></p><p>PS: I drank two cans of Red Bull, this is my limit. The main reason is that I know the time to go online was too sudden, and I was completely unprepared, all of this is being written on the spot.</p><p></p><p>And writing here requires more brain power and attention compared to other places, so the writing is also a bit slower.</p><p></p><p>From now on, I will update every night at 9 o'clock!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

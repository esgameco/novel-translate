        <h1>Chapter 335</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He won the first National Martial Arts Competition.</p><p></p><p>After winning the championship, he would become famous. </p><p></p><p>Endorsements and commercial performances could be endless if he wanted.</p><p></p><p>His life trajectory was about to change from this point on.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the entire martial arts competition venue was in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"Fire?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's the person?"</p><p></p><p>"Exploded into a blood mist?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this still the martial arts I know?"</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the battle between Qi Yuan and Zhang Yang exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhang Yang's exploding clothes displayed overwhelming power. Although unbelievable, it was still within the acceptable range for the audience.</p><p></p><p>But then, what was with the fists suddenly bursting into flames?</p><p></p><p>Was this bringing technology onto the arena?</p><p></p><p>And after that, Zhang Yang with his flaming fists was directly punched by Qi Yuan and exploded into a blood mist.</p><p></p><p>What was this? Confusion, doubt, shock...</p><p></p><p>"Are we sure this isn't a movie being filmed?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it magic?"</p><p></p><p>"How is it possible to punch a living person into a blood mist?"</p><p></p><p>"This is very unscientific!"</p><p></p><p>Not only were the spectators confused, even the organizers of the martial arts competition were shocked.</p><p></p><p>A balding executive stood up, still looking perplexed, but he loudly said: "Stop the live broadcast immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts competition's broadcast had a 3-minute delay.</p><p></p><p>In case of such accidents, based on past experience, they only needed to stop the broadcast.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a complex voice came: "Continue broadcasting, everything according to the rules."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, the balding executive was puzzled: "Such an accident may cause panic and bring unnecessary trouble to society."</p><p></p><p>The balding executive also knew about the existence of immortal techniques.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the upper echelons were not yet prepared to announce this to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what puzzled him most was that what Qi Yuan displayed... was clearly martial arts.</p><p></p><p>How could he defeat Zhang Yang who was using immortal techniques? </p><p></p><p>"Panic is not important, rules are most important. Everything must follow the rules!" The young voice emphasized again.</p><p></p><p>This made the balding executive feel somewhat resentful.</p><p></p><p>These damn second-generation rich kids, suddenly parachuting in to become the chief executive of the martial arts competition, and lacking vision.</p><p></p><p>How could such a thing... be allowed to leak out?</p><p></p><p>And rules are most important?</p><p></p><p>Rules are bullshit!</p><p></p><p>Though cursing inwardly, the balding executive dared not object.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an old man had an expression worse than if his mother had died: "It's over, Zhang Yang is dead... Will the Zhang family implicate us?"</p><p></p><p>In the past, Qi Yuan had shown extraordinary martial arts talent, almost breaking the limits of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He had high hopes for Qi Yuan and wanted to talk to him, but was rebuffed and didn't get to meet Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was already dissatisfied with Qi Yuan, this arrogant genius.</p><p></p><p>Later, after learning about immortal techniques, his attention was completely drawn to Zhang Yang.</p><p></p><p>As for breaking the limits of martial arts, what was that? Not even worthy to carry the shoes of immortal techniques!</p><p></p><p>So he had connected with Zhang Yang, hoping to gain immortal techniques through him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the old man suddenly stood up: "Sir, this boy killed on the arena, beating Zhang Yang to death. He should be locked up and handed over to the Zhang family to account for!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang held a high position in the Zhang family.</p><p></p><p>And the Zhang family was a major clan with prominent status.</p><p></p><p>With Zhang Yang killed, he had no idea how to explain it to the Zhang family.</p><p></p><p>The young man's gaze suddenly turned sharp: "On the arena, life and death are fated. Everything must follow the rules. </p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang died... so be it, this is the rule of the arena."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old man became very anxious: "But we must give the Zhang family an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>The balding executive also said sarcastically at this point: "If the Zhang family demands accountability, I'm afraid even you sir cannot bear it."</p><p></p><p>This young man who parachuted in did have some status.</p><p></p><p>But as the chief executive of the martial arts competition, how much status could he have? Probably far less than the Zhang family.</p><p></p><p>The young man's gaze turned cold: "It seems you two should go to prison to wash your brains.</p><p></p><p>As for the Zhang family, I will notify them personally. We'll see if they dare to demand an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>As the young man finished speaking, several fully armed soldiers appeared, guns aimed at the balding executive and the old man.</p><p></p><p>He picked up his phone and dialed a number.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Mingyuan, I hear your Zhang family... needs an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>The young man questioned aggressively, his tone quite displeased.</p><p></p><p>"I need your Zhang family to give me an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>Nearby, the balding executive and old man heard this and their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Especially hearing the servile voice of Zhang Mingyuan, the Zhang family patriarch, on the phone, which shocked and confused them even more.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly the Zhang family's person who died, so why was the Zhang family patriarch so humble, as if treading on eggshells?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the balding executive and old man looked towards the man on the arena, their eyes revealing a hint of shock.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Finally won the championship."</p><p></p><p>In the hotel room, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The mission for this game finally had some progress.</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary sat nearby, seemingly watching the broadcast, her eyes sparkling.</p><p></p><p>"I have to say, Blood Pearl, that punch of yours was pretty cool."</p><p></p><p>She said, glancing at Qi Yuan nearby, as if comparing him to the video.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think it's not good that we didn't accept interviews and just fled? What if the organizers give me trouble and cancel my championship title?" Qi Yuan asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>After winning, one was supposed to accept interviews and give a speech.</p><p></p><p>When he was the Blood Robed Sword Saint, Qi Yuan was very eloquent.</p><p></p><p>He could talk about grand principles fluently.</p><p></p><p>But that was behind the scenes, not as a real person speaking.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was naturally good at speaking then.</p><p></p><p>In reality though, he wasn't very skilled with words.</p><p></p><p>When facing enemies, he was also a bit socially anxious, especially when enemies gave long speeches. He usually couldn't argue back and would just resort to fighting.</p><p></p><p>A socially anxious person would rather fight than talk if possible.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be a problem," Golden Canary said confidently. "If anyone cancels your championship title, this young lady will personally help you get it back!"</p><p></p><p>"That's good." Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>Being a kept man was so nice.</p><p></p><p>Having a capable fianc√©e really made things easier.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, if you find it troublesome, I can use Dao techniques... to make people in this world... subconsciously ignore you.</p><p></p><p>Although they'll know you exist, in certain situations... they'll subconsciously not mention you. What do you think? This way... even though you've become a public figure, when you're out... no one will secretly take photos of you." Golden Canary smiled.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment and nodded seriously: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary smiled: "This will require borrowing the power of your Solar Golden Core, otherwise... it would be quite slow for me to do it."</p><p></p><p>"Do as you please." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." A flash of fiery red passed through Golden Canary's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the world seemed to be covered in a layer of golden light.</p><p></p><p>Many people looked up at the sky, glanced at the extra sun that had appeared, then looked away as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Done." Golden Canary clapped her little hands.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This won't affect our gaming experience, it will just reduce some voyeurs and those with ulterior motives."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it will reduce a lot of trouble. Otherwise, if we go back and get a marriage certificate or something, it would be too annoying if someone secretly took photos and posted them online."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very concerned about his privacy.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Canary's ears turned red. She sat down on a chair, swinging her feet, seeming to be in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, now I can take you home with peace of mind!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>It was pitch black, mixed with a hint of illusion, as if somewhat different from the real starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Cold warships traversed through space, countless small aircraft detached from the warships and then returned to them.</p><p></p><p>These small aircraft were the latest generation of reconnaissance vehicles from Canxing.</p><p></p><p>Their purpose was to detect and collect information about Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in front of a large screen, the captain wearing a space combat suit raised his eyebrows, his eyes filled with abundant fighting spirit: "How are the investigation results?"</p><p></p><p>The captain was a fanatical war hawk, always thinking about colonizing Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sky Eyes on Gongxing were somewhat difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>For Canxing to completely occupy Gongxing would also require considerable cost.</p><p></p><p>So it was better to support some countries, incite civil war in Gongxing, and engage in exploitative trade.</p><p></p><p>But recently, Canxing received news that thirteen of the Sky Eyes on Gongxing had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This was almost one-sixth of Gongxing's power disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Gongxing's defense system had also developed huge vulnerabilities.</p><p></p><p>This was Canxing's opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In terms of technological strength, Canxing far surpassed Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>But Gongxing had obtained an unknown inheritance, a lost civilization's aircraft carrier, which allowed them to launch the Sky Eyes and gain the ability to resist Canxing.</p><p></p><p>However, Gongxing lacked the ability to replicate the Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Once a Sky Eye was lost, it was gone for good.</p><p></p><p>The captain's mood was surging, as if he could immediately establish supreme military might.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the captain, the information we detected shows that... the Seven Wu Star families had internal strife, with the other families attacking the Mu family, wiping them out." A man in special military uniform replied.</p><p></p><p>"Internal strife?" This result was quite unexpected for the captain.</p><p></p><p>Just because of internal strife, they destroyed the Sky Eyes? This seemed too wasteful.</p><p></p><p>"Is there... something crucial we don't know about this?" The captain instinctively felt that things couldn't be this simple.</p><p></p><p>"The captain is overthinking, humans... have always liked internal strife, haven't they?"</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly sounded in the warship.</p><p></p><p>In the vast warship, it was as if a demonic wind blew past, like a small tornado.</p><p></p><p>The tornado finally stopped, and a strange man with four horns on his head appeared, his double pupils flashing with a peculiar look.</p><p></p><p>The strange man looked at the screen in front, gazing at that blue planet in the distance, his eyes revealing a fanatical and obsessed expression.</p><p></p><p>"What a delicious world, I seem to feel the call of the ancestors' blood."</p><p></p><p>The captain looked at the strange man, his eyes showing reverence: "Does the lord think there are no other hidden circumstances?"</p><p></p><p>The captain knew that this strange man was an extraterrestrial visitor, from a powerful world called the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>That world had powerful demon races.</p><p></p><p>According to genetic map analysis, the humans on Canxing shared common ancestors with the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>It sounded strange that humans and demons had common ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Myriad Demon Realm, Canxing was initially vigilant and resistant.</p><p></p><p>But when the powerful beings from the Myriad Demon Realm descended and met with nearly two hundred Canxing leaders, bestowing youth and vitality upon them,</p><p></p><p>Canxing's attitude towards the Myriad Demon Realm underwent a huge change.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the captain's family had also received blessings and gifts from the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>So they were all extremely reverent towards the powerful beings of the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Demon Realm's powerful beings had vast abilities and formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>"Whether there are hidden circumstances... does it matter?" The double-pupiled man's expression was fanatical, "No matter what trump cards Gongxing has, it will still become part of our Myriad Demon Realm's territory.</p><p></p><p>Only by obtaining the ancestral blood can our Myriad Demon Realm become great again.</p><p></p><p>The last great calamity caused too much loss!"</p><p></p><p>The previous generation's Demon King, in collaboration with a demoness, had sent all their supreme experts to descend upon an alien realm.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that tens of thousands of supreme experts would be lost in that alien realm, with only a handful returning.</p><p></p><p>That battle had severely weakened the Myriad Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The previous generation's Demon King had no choice but to abdicate.</p><p></p><p>With the ascension of a new king, the Myriad Demon Realm finally began to recover its strength, but it was still far from its peak.</p><p></p><p>And now on the discovered Gongxing, they had caught the scent of ancestral blood, how could they not be excited? If they obtained the ancestral blood, what kind of opportunity would the Myriad Demon Realm gain? It was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the entire Myriad Demon Realm would have a chance to ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Qilin Warship is at your service, my lord!" The captain quickly pledged his allegiance.</p><p></p><p>The double-pupiled man nodded: "When the elders from my clan arrive, they will sweep across Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Eyes... are nothing but oversized toys."</p><p></p><p>Although the double-pupiled man was extremely wary of the Sky Eyes, he believed that the clan elders would surely be able to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>The clan elders were terrifying experts who were just a step away from ascending to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Sky Eyes were, they were still just inanimate objects.</p><p></p><p>The double-pupiled man was full of confidence, and then said: "If I remember correctly, you also have connections with some countries on Gongxing? This lord wants to go to Canxing to take a look first."</p><p></p><p>"Certainly." The captain quickly agreed, but then thought of something and said, "Please be careful, my lord, not to reveal your identity. Otherwise, if you attract the attention of the Sky Eyes, I'm afraid you might find it difficult to..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't finish the sentence.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Eyes were too terrifying, rumored to be able to kill even deities.</p><p></p><p>Their warships were very strong, but compared to the Sky Eyes, they were still a level below.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this lord understands." The double-pupiled man wasn't foolish.</p><p></p><p>His combat power was very strong, but it would be difficult to deal with even the super warships of Canxing, let alone the Sky Eyes which were even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"This humble one will arrange it immediately." The captain quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Although Canxing and Gongxing were hostile, exchanges and trade were not prohibited.</p><p></p><p>The double-pupiled man looked at the blue planet in the distance, his eyes revealing an obsessed expression: "What a... unique world."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Canary's hand as they returned to his home.</p><p></p><p>Canary tightly gripped Qi Yuan's hand, feeling a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and robot Zero One stood at the entrance, a smile appearing in its eyes: "Welcome home, master and mistress!"</p><p></p><p>"So this is Zero One, it looks quite nice." Canary's face reddened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Despite her experiences, she still retained her shy nature.</p><p></p><p>She spoke as she looked into the house.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were 'double happiness' characters pasted around, candies on the table, giving a festive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Even Xie Xinsu the cat had a 'double happiness' character pasted on its back, looking quite adorable.</p><p></p><p>Canary held Qi Yuan's hand, looking left and right, seeming very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Zero One has checked the calendar, tomorrow is an auspicious day for marriage."</p><p></p><p>Canary's face instantly turned red.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

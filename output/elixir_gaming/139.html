        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Countless pairs of eyes looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Next to the vast sun, another... small sun suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the large sun, that small sun seemed insignificant.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone who saw that small sun had shock in the depths of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"There's... another sun in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? What kind of strange phenomenon is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This isn't a phenomenon, it's real!"</p><p></p><p>In the arctic ice fields, a sleeping ice dragon opened its eyes, its blue pupils glancing at the sun in the sky: "Did I sleep too long and start hallucinating?"</p><p></p><p>It rolled over and went back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Holy Land, a woman bathed in radiance looked up at the sky, disbelief in her eyes: "Which... deity is illuminating the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>Whenever a new star appears, it must mean a new exalted position has emerged.</p><p></p><p>In the Central Celestial Realm, a man in white robes was fishing when suddenly his hand trembled and the fishing rod snapped.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the newly appeared sun, deep worry on his face.</p><p></p><p>"There cannot be two suns in the sky. Is some immortal or god trying to challenge that one's position?"</p><p></p><p>"Troubled times indeed. I hope it doesn't affect us here. There's not much time left, we should migrate... if we don't leave soon, we'll be caught in the crossfire!"</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes looked at the extra sun that had appeared in the sky, awe and shock in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>The various peak masters had gathered together, with Elder Kumo among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was looking at the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"How did another sun suddenly appear?"</p><p></p><p>"It's baffling."</p><p></p><p>"There must be great terror behind this!"</p><p></p><p>"We shouldn't look at this sun for too long. If cultivators stare at it, their memory will deteriorate."</p><p></p><p>"What? It can do that?"</p><p></p><p>The various cultivators in the Divine Light Sect were heatedly discussing the extra sun that had appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sect Leader Elder Kumo's voice rang out: "What use is there in discussing the sun in the sky? Will it affect your cultivation? Will it help you break through?</p><p></p><p>I summoned you all here to discuss the Hundred Nations Blood War and the matter of the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>The peak masters fell silent upon hearing this, and stopped discussing the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>An extra sun may have appeared, but shouldn't they still eat their meals as usual?</p><p></p><p>That kind of matter wasn't for small cultivators like them to ponder.</p><p></p><p>They should consider things directly related to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Kang Fulu has already entered the Golden Core realm, and Qi Yuan is the disciple of the Seven Colors Peak Master. We absolutely cannot hand over these two!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, we can't hand them over!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Palace of Light is truly tyrannical to the extreme. Starting the Hundred Nations Blood War, do they have no... morals left?!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, without any powerful cultivators to stand up for us hundred nations, this seems to be a foregone conclusion!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>Weakness was the original sin.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light, one power oppressing a hundred nations.</p><p></p><p>A hundred nations and over a thousand sects, yet unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the Palace of Light to manipulate them, becoming pawns in the Hundred Nations Blood War.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Shang Nation had it even worse, becoming the demonic faction in the Hundred Nations Blood War!</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator who encountered the demonic faction could slaughter them by any means necessary.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, some powers surrounding the hundred nations were already rubbing their hands in anticipation, preparing to take advantage of the chaos to invade Great Shang and plunder its resources.</p><p></p><p>This was a massive disaster for Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>No power in Great Shang could avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Now, all of Great Shang was in great turmoil, with many rogue cultivators preparing to migrate away from this war-torn land.</p><p></p><p>"The hundred nations can't even produce a single Purple Palace realm expert. How can they contend against the Palace of Light?</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan may be talented, but they still need time to grow. Even if Kang Fulu became a Divine Infant and Qi Yuan reached Golden Core right now, it would be useless," an elder said, his words full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>The hundred nations were too weak, without even a single Purple Palace realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had one, it likely wouldn't change the outcome.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light had dozens of Purple Palace realm experts.</p><p></p><p>It could be said they were the undisputed hegemon of the Eastern Emerald Continent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these elders didn't know that the Palace of Light also possessed the Imperial Dragon Crown, a damaged Yin Spirit artifact.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would be even more despairing.</p><p></p><p>Even a damaged Yin Spirit artifact could easily wipe out the entire Great Shang from among the hundred nations with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>This was a power that even Purple Palace realm experts couldn't resist.</p><p></p><p>"This old one received news from the Soaring Heaven Pavilion that one of the Blood Robe Sword Saints from the Divine Flower Society originated from our hundred nations.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Palace of Light humiliated this Blood Robe Sword Saint, forcing his daughter to live in a dog kennel. The two sides seem to have gotten into a dispute. Hopefully this matter can delay the Palace of Light's offensive."</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light is truly despicable! They claim to be the leader of the righteous path in the Emerald Continent, yet they do such inhuman things! As the saying goes, calamity should not extend to wives and children. Forcing someone's young daughter to live in a dog kennel is utterly abhorrent!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we all know how disgusting they are, but what can we do about it?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword Saint's strength is probably only at the late stage of Divine Infant. He's no match for the Palace of Light."</p><p></p><p>Everyone discussed animatedly, worry clouding their faces.</p><p></p><p>They were far too weak compared to the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on Seven Colors Peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself in the mirror, feeling somewhat melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"Baize, Foolish Daoist, Nangong Dago, Chen Huan, Zhang Sheng..."</p><p></p><p>He recalled the plot of the Flowing Wind Realm game, memorizing the names he needed to remember.</p><p></p><p>For the other useless memories, he temporarily forgot them using the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally become a True Person of the Primal Core."</p><p></p><p>"This time... I thought it was my mouth that awakened a special ability, but it turned out to be... my eyebrows."</p><p></p><p>After entering Qi Refinement, his eyes could see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>After Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment, his ears could hear some strange sounds.</p><p></p><p>After forming a Golden Core, he gained another ability - eyebrows that could predict fortune and disaster.</p><p></p><p>When his left eyebrow twitched, it meant good fortune.</p><p></p><p>When his right eyebrow twitched, disaster was coming.</p><p></p><p>That's right, not his eyes, but his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>This ability was quite good.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he entered the game in the future, before challenging a boss, he would know whether to fight or not based on which eyebrow twitched.</p><p></p><p>This was practically a divine tool.</p><p></p><p>He left his small wooden cabin, sighing, "I'm now a True Person of the Primal Core. Living in a wooden cabin with junior sister like before lowers my status and identity.</p><p></p><p>I should upgrade to a brick house."</p><p></p><p>He left the wooden cabin and immediately ran into his junior sister Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>Junior sister Jiang Lingsu seemed worried, with concerns in her heart: "Senior brother, did you see? There's an extra sun in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's worries stemmed from this.</p><p></p><p>Back then, in the Qiankun Mirror, she saw living beings in dire straits, endless blood rain.</p><p></p><p>She didn't see an extra sun appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Now, a sun had suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This meant the workings of fate had changed.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>"Sun?" Qi Yuan had been thinking about how to bring up the topic of the sun in the sky when he saw his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect her to mention it directly.</p><p></p><p>Well then, he wouldn't be polite.</p><p></p><p>"That's not a sun, that's my Golden Core!" Qi Yuan pointed at the small sun in the sky, full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>If you don't show off your wealth when you return home, it's like wearing brocade in the dark.</p><p></p><p>He had finally caught an opportunity to boast.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Jiang Lingsu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The thread of worry in her heart also disappeared. She smiled, her ample chest quivering slightly: "Senior brother, you really know how to joke.</p><p></p><p>You can't casually say things like that.</p><p></p><p>What if the deity illuminating that sun hears you? They might come looking for trouble."</p><p></p><p>"The truth is in the hands of the few." Qi Yuan naturally wouldn't explain. He looked at that sun, a hint of nostalgia on his face. "There's still someone on that sun..."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary was still on that star.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, your talent is indeed good, but right now you've just broken through to Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core is still far away for you! The vessel for the Golden Core is even more important than Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother, do you want to borrow some spirit stones from me to buy something expensive?" Jiang Lingsu was truly wealthy, with lots of money, and she was genuinely generous towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan was magnanimous, viewing wealth as dirt: "Can spirit stones buy a star?"</p><p></p><p>They can't! And there were so many stars and planets in the universe waiting for Qi Yuan to devour.</p><p></p><p>They were all free, at no cost!</p><p></p><p>Might as well eat them!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, my sister will be coming tomorrow. I'm letting you know in advance." Jiang Lingsu didn't mention the Golden Core matter again.</p><p></p><p>"She's most welcome!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted for a while, then Jiang Lingsu returned to her wooden cabin to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered to himself: "True Person of the Primal Core... it's just so-so?"</p><p></p><p>He felt his life hadn't really changed much.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and looked towards the palace halls at the top of Seven Colors Peak.</p><p></p><p>Silent and still, bathed in cold moonlight, like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>He started walking up.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The barrier halfway up the mountain appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple has reached the Yuan Dan stage."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's finger touched the barrier. </p><p></p><p>The barrier that once blocked him could no longer stop him.</p><p></p><p>He entered through the barrier and slowly walked towards the palace buildings at the top of Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>His heart also became calm.</p><p></p><p>The peak of Seven-Color Mountain was much colder than halfway up.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes it was sunny halfway up, but snowing at the peak.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan reached the summit, he felt a faint chill.</p><p></p><p>Through the clouds and mist, a white jade tower could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time coming here.</p><p></p><p>"Master?" </p><p></p><p>He called out softly towards the palace in front.</p><p></p><p>His voice echoed in the palace and returned to his ears.</p><p></p><p>However, the figure of his master Ruan Yixi did not appear.</p><p></p><p>"Wife?" Qi Yuan called out more boldly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the clouds in the sky would have gathered by now, but there was no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a faint sense of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>It was as expected.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful women are all good at deceiving.</p><p></p><p>He entered the palace alone, wanting to find traces of his master Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>The vast palace was empty, without anyone.</p><p></p><p>It was eerily quiet, without any signs of habitation.</p><p></p><p>As if no one had lived here for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a jade token fell from the air, landing accurately in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Moon?"</p><p></p><p>When he saw the character on the jade token, Qi Yuan's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The jade token had a simple design, with only the character for "moon" engraved on it.</p><p></p><p>And this "moon" character gave him endless associations.</p><p></p><p>[Moon token, the token of the Moon Deity.]</p><p></p><p>He held the moon token, countless emotions flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Memories of the Moon-Gazing Continent flowed through his mind again.</p><p></p><p>"So, was the mutation of that small grass related to Master?"</p><p></p><p>His expression was complex as he looked at the palace buildings ahead and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have we met before?"</p><p></p><p>"Or will we meet in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, you have always..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the moon token, a faint melancholy pervading.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint fragrance wafted over, and Xiao Jia's graceful figure appeared silently. She grasped Qi Yuan's sleeve, and a wooden tag with "Snuggle" written on it slipped out of her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be comforting Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The faint fragrance from Xiao Jia was particularly soothing, like the light scent of a leisurely evening, neither strong nor faint, but refreshing and relaxing, able to lull one to sleep at any time.</p><p></p><p>While the fragrance from Ning Tao was sometimes like the orchids in a secluded mountain valley, light and sweet, and other times like an alluring and sensual scent, intoxicating like opium, tormenting, tearing apart, and venting the evil in one's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Moon-Gazing Continent... Moon Deity..."</p><p></p><p>"Who did the Great Sun encounter back then?"</p><p></p><p>"Can I go to the Moon-Gazing Continent again?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would find answers there.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Forgetting his myriad worries, Qi Yuan entered the jade slip of the Divine Flower Society again.</p><p></p><p>The 100-day plan to destroy the Palace of Light was still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>He needed to push forward quickly.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he was short on cultivation techniques again.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had reached Yuan Dan, the cultivation of the "Qi Yuan Scripture" had stalled again.</p><p></p><p>He needed the white moonlight from the Palace of Light to send him cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Entering the forum, Qi Yuan opened the post from his alternate account.</p><p></p><p>Wow, there were over a thousand replies.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan skimmed through them briefly, seeing the Divine Flower Society members verbally attacking the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, even though they've learned to use shocking language, their insults are still too restrained. </p><p></p><p>The forum here doesn't censor words, they can curse freely!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just talking big. He wasn't very good at cursing either.</p><p></p><p>At most, he would use some "*" symbols to bluff the other party.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan exited the forum and returned to the group chat.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed seniors, this little novice has a question for you. If the formed golden core escapes from the body, how should one summon it back?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>His golden core was separated from him by an entire universe, right?</p><p></p><p>The small sun in the sky was just a projection of his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Summoning it back to his dantian was definitely out of the question.</p><p></p><p>His little belly definitely couldn't withstand a stellar golden core.</p><p></p><p>But if he could move the golden core to this universe, then... it would be much more convenient for him to use the power of his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Summoning the golden core across universes was really... too inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Lord, you've formed a golden core?" Rogue Immortal Lord, who always said he was in closed-door cultivation but always paid attention to group messages, asked.</p><p></p><p>"Barely managed it," Qi Yuan said smugly. "This time, I led 100,000 Purple Palace cultivators to sweep through tens of thousands of supreme beings in the Myriad Demon Realm, and barely managed to kill the final boss, forming a... very, very powerful golden core."</p><p></p><p>Afraid the group members wouldn't understand, Qi Yuan specifically replaced "supreme beings" with "Purple Palace cultivators".</p><p></p><p>"666." Rogue Immortal Lord was speechless and could only imitate Qi Yuan's previous way of speaking.</p><p></p><p>100,000 Purple Palace cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Bullshit. If you had 100,000 Purple Palace cultivators, would you still secretly register an alternate account to smear the Palace of Light? You could just steamroll them directly! Rogue Immortal Lord felt that Origin Celestial Lord's condition was getting worse and worse.</p><p></p><p>"You formed a golden core so quickly, truly worthy of being a peerless genius!" Great Sun Flame Emperor said in the group, with a hint of flattery in his words.</p><p></p><p>It took a while for Ice Mountain Domineering Woman to appear in the group. She answered seriously: "Losing a golden core... is indeed a bit troublesome. Where did you lose it?"</p><p></p><p>"Not in the Azure Waves Realm," Qi Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>The people in the group fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord felt that this Origin Celestial Lord was really good at boasting.</p><p></p><p>"This... I have no solution either," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman answered honestly. She thought of something and asked, "Origin Celestial Lord, have you been to other worlds too?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had been to the Moon-Gazing Continent, the Flowing Wind Realm, and that universe.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, the Eastern Land Genius Rankings have been moved up this time.</p><p></p><p>Origin Celestial Lord, if you participate, you should aim for a good ranking.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Eastern Land has discovered the entrance to a new world. The energy level of that world is very low. The top 30 in the Eastern Land Genius Rankings will all have a chance to go to that world," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman revealed an important piece of information to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord was excited when he heard this: "Is there such a good opportunity? That's a whole new world, with unlimited resources!"</p><p></p><p>"Rogue, don't even think about it. You should first consider how to enter the Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>The top 30 is for those like Origin Celestial Lord who have heavenly dao foundation building to consider," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu." Rogue Immortal Lord felt that the weak had no right to speak.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Great Sun Flame Emperor said: "A few days ago, the Palace of Light released news inviting Blood Robe Sword Saint to meet in Chen Kingdom. The powerful cultivator who forced Blood Robe Sword Saint's daughter to live in a doghouse, a late-stage Nascent Soul powerhouse, will personally apologize."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned when he heard this: "Apologize?"</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that something he made up? How come they're apologizing? Did they identify with it?</p><p></p><p>"It might be an apology, or it might be to force you to let this matter go. Origin Celestial Lord, be careful, don't fall for the Palace of Light's tricks," Great Sun Flame Emperor warned.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, now that I've formed an invincible golden core, what is there to be afraid of!" After forming a stellar golden core, Qi Yuan's courage had grown considerably.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without using the power of his golden core, he wasn't afraid of the late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>When he was at late Foundation Establishment, he could already kill a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Lord, don't be rash. Consider everything carefully," Rogue Immortal Lord was very cautious when it came to matters of life and death, and was very concerned for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was touched: "Don't worry, the '100-day Plan to Destroy the Palace of Light' is progressing smoothly. Feel free to borrow high-interest loans!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered, if the Palace of Light really apologizes this time, should he take the opportunity to borrow some high-interest loans or something? </p><p></p><p>"What a pity, when I went to borrow from them again, they wouldn't lend anymore. Too stingy!" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, how much did you borrow?" Great Sun Flame Emperor couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Not much, just 4 million spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"...Not much..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also silent.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing money and not paying it back was really a great way to make money!</p><p></p><p>He would destroy the Palace of Light, and Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, who had done almost nothing, would make a pure profit of 4 million spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>It was terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Origin Celestial Lord, remember to update the record of destroying the Palace of Light here from time to time. If the money doesn't fully reach my hands, I can't spend it comfortably!" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry!" Qi Yuan answered affirmatively.</p><p></p><p>He decided to meet that late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator from the Palace of Light as Blood Robe Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had formed a golden core, it was time to... kill, kill, kill the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>If he could strike hard in the game, now that he had formed a golden core, he couldn't always be timid in reality, right?</p><p></p><p>The fame of the stellar golden core must be spread through the destruction of the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

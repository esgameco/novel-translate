        <h1>Chapter 476</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The barriers around the Demon Sovereign's Palace were difficult for the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace to penetrate. </p><p></p><p>Even if he forced his way in, there would be an immediate warning and suppression.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Celestial Sovereign of the Demon Pass would be prepared in advance, and would not be killed by the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that these barriers and warnings were useless. After the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace had slain a Celestial Sovereign at the Enlightened Realm, the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner only belatedly gave the warning, and they only then discovered that the Envoy had secretly infiltrated.</p><p></p><p>In the end, another unfortunate Celestial Sovereign was also slain by the Envoy, who then left gracefully. It can be said that... the Demon Sovereign was utterly humiliated.</p><p></p><p>How to deal with such a slippery Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace?</p><p></p><p>The Emissary of the Tai Huang Palace was deeply worried: "The Demon Pass is no longer safe."</p><p></p><p>He scanned the surroundings, feeling that every void was filled with danger, as if the Envoy could appear at any moment.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he now wanted to return to the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Sovereigns, hidden in the surroundings, did not dare to reveal their forms, only faint voices could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Since even the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner's illusion is useless!"</p><p></p><p>"We who remain here are like lambs awaiting slaughter!"</p><p></p><p>These Celestial Sovereigns, lofty and glorious for a lifetime, had never been so terrified as they were now.</p><p></p><p>That Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace was simply not human.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary Great Enlightened Celestial Sovereign, despite having his strength, would not dare to rashly infiltrate the core area of the Sixth Heaven, the Sacred Land, for fear of being trapped and sealed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace, through his slaughter, had struck terror into the Celestial Sovereigns of the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>It had not been long since then, yet the Envoy had already killed nine Celestial Sovereigns, one of whom was the Decline of the Black Abyss, and one was an Enlightened Realm Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>An Enlightened Realm Celestial Sovereign was actually slain so easily!</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that apart from the Great Enlightened, the other Celestial Sovereigns of the Demon Sovereign were all in danger of their own lives?</p><p></p><p>A single Qi Yuan had struck terror into the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cold and vast voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"The loophole in the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner's illusion, I, the Banner Lord, have already known about.</p><p>This time, it was my negligence!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Banner Lord fell, his figure still enthroned in the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Like them, these powerful experts at this level would not casually leave the Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>Just like the White Dragon Abyss Lord that Qi Yuan had seen earlier, it was not the true body of the White Dragon Abyss Lord.</p><p></p><p>Many Celestial Sovereigns heard the Banner Lord's words, and did not trust him as much as the first time.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they were a bit suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their emotional intelligence was no less than Qi Yuan's, even if they were suspicious, they would not directly say it and offend the Banner Lord's face.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Lord had admitted his mistake, what else could they do? "The Celestial Sovereigns who died in recent times, their close-knit clan groups will receive our Demon Sovereign's top treatment.</p><p>I, the Banner Lord, will bestow a portion of Celestial Sovereign offerings to these clan groups."</p><p></p><p>This time, the Banner Lord had really invested a lot.</p><p></p><p>If he did not console them, the resentment within the Demon Sovereign would be boiling, and even he would have difficulty suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>"The Banner Lord is benevolent!" The Celestial Sovereigns of the Demon Sovereign were slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Consolation was something that had never happened in the Demon Sovereign, a proper evil sect. When a Celestial Sovereign perished, their accumulated resources would be instantly devoured.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Banner Lord, have already known where the loophole in the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner is, and I have personally intervened to repair it," the Banner Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sovereigns present forced a smile: "Thank you, Banner Lord."</p><p></p><p>Of course, they dared not say more.</p><p></p><p>Many Celestial Sovereigns' gazes fell on the Emissary of the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Emissary of the Tai Huang Palace, seeing this, suddenly shuddered and hurriedly said, "Banner Lord, would you please check again, just in case there are other loopholes, lest that Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace kills his way in again..."</p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Sovereigns did not dare to speak, but the Emissary of the Tai Huang Palace did.</p><p></p><p>In the void, there was a moment of silence, and after about a few breaths, the vast voice sounded again in the expectation of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I, the Banner Lord, will let one-third of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner's main body descend to protect you all!"</p><p></p><p>This time, he really invested a lot.</p><p></p><p>What he had previously released, whether it was an illusion or a clone, although their power was strong, even if they were lost, it would not cause too much damage to the main body of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner's main body descend.</p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Sovereigns heard this, and their hearts were greatly reassured.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Banner Lord!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they had no more worries in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>With one-third of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner's main body descending, the security of the Demon Pass was almost equivalent to the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was still far inferior to the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Demon Sovereign not only had the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner to guard it, but also other miraculous treasures, together forming a solid defense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Pass, there was a clamor of voices.</p><p></p><p>Icy Sword, Purple Mist Great Snow, Purple Mist Small Dew, and other geniuses had a look of worry on their faces.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they had gathered together in silence.</p><p></p><p>They could only be spectators, unable to change their own fate.</p><p></p><p>In the deep and profound palace ahead, the voices of the Celestial Sovereigns arguing could be heard incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Purple Mist Great Snow spread her hands, with a look of helplessness in her eyes: "Well, the Ling Ya Shedding hasn't even started yet, and judging by this situation, our Black Abyss is about to split up!"</p><p></p><p>The news that the Abyss Lord had submitted to the Tai Huang Palace and retreated had already spread.</p><p></p><p>This shocked many Celestial Sovereigns, and also made these geniuses feel unprepared.</p><p></p><p>"Cowering before the battle, this time our Black Abyss has lost a big one!" exclaimed one of the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we shouldn't over-interpret the Abyss Lord's actions, he must have done it for the greater good.</p><p>It's better not to fight if we can avoid it! Otherwise, how many of us in these sects would be killed in battle?" a genius said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He had no objection to submitting to the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"If we just submit, does that mean we won't fight anymore? Aren't we then just the dogs of the Tai Huang Palace, biting whoever they tell us to bite?" An Xiao Deer was dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"At least by following the Tai Huang Palace, we'll become the winners of the Ling Ya Shedding. If we oppose the Tai Huang Palace, what will our fate be?" the other person questioned.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Icy Sword suddenly spoke: "The fact that the Tai Huang Palace so easily accepted the submission, is this matter... really that simple?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the geniuses' expressions darkened, and they had an ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>Given the tyranny of the Tai Huang Palace, how could they easily accept the submission of the Black Abyss?</p><p></p><p>After all, there were still a few sects within the Black Abyss that had conflicts with the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Don't maliciously speculate about events that haven't even happened yet, I believe the Abyss Lord, as an elder, has considered the big picture and won't abandon any of our sects!" a young cultivator refuted.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a lazy voice sounded, and a handsome man in a blood-red robe appeared: "Even if the Abyss Lord has submitted, the Tai Huang Palace's plundering of my private property is not over!"</p><p></p><p>It was naturally Qi Yuan who had come here.</p><p></p><p>"The Tai Huang Palace took what from you?" An Xiao Deer couldn't help but ask at this point.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to respond, because An Xiao Deer was too loose-lipped.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Purple Mist Great Snow looked at Qi Yuan: "Blood Robe, where have you been lately? Sister wants to invite you to eat the first Purple Mist Heavenly Delicious Mushroom I've created, but I couldn't find you."</p><p></p><p>"It's a secret," Qi Yuan said, glancing at Purple Mist Small Dew.</p><p></p><p>Purple Mist Small Dew's pretty face instantly flushed, her heartbeat accelerating, like a startled deer.</p><p></p><p>Only she knew that Blood Robe Senior had gone to the Heavenly Tun Mysterious Land, not even her Big Snow Sister knew.</p><p></p><p>She had a sense of being favored.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, our Black Abyss has fallen, such a vast Black Abyss, not even worth as much as the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace.</p><p>The Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace dared to go alone to the Demon Sovereign, killing Celestial Sovereigns like slaughtering dogs, while we Black Abyss... however..." Niu Jiao Sister said, suddenly looking at Qi Yuan, "I have to say, you and the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace have some similarities."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart tightened, feeling a bit wary.</p><p>Could it be that his disguise could not even be hidden from someone as straightforward as Niu Jiao Sister?</p><p></p><p>"Where are the similarities?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"The same lawlessness," Purple Mist Great Snow smiled.</p><p></p><p>Her meaning was very clear, Blood Robe was always talking about how the one from the Tai Huang Palace was his great enemy, and he needed to suppress that enemy.</p><p>This kind of courage was no less than the Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Sister is waiting for your good news, to be your concubine!" Purple Mist Great Snow winked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Purple Mist Small Dew was a bit anxious.</p><p>How could Big Snow Sister just become a concubine like that? She hadn't figured out how to speak up yet, when the loose-lipped voice of An Xiao Deer came: "The Envoy of the Human Emperor's Palace really went to the Demon Pass to slay Celestial Sovereigns, Blood Robe has no such ability to be compared to that great person, he's just good at running his mouth!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, An Xiao Deer, how can you slander me without any evidence, you've never even kissed me, how do you know my mouth is so capable?" Qi Yuan said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>An Xiao Deer was flustered, panting, unable to retort.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan thought of something and suddenly asked, "Is Black Sword's mouth also capable?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiao Deer's face suddenly turned red, and there was a sense of sweetness in her heart: "You... what nonsense are you talking about!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched and looked at Icy Sword, his eyes slightly surprised: "Why are you hiding your strength?"</p><p></p><p>The originally steadfast Icy Sword's expression changed slightly: "How did you notice?"</p><p></p><p>Then he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>The "Ancestral Blood Technique" he had just cultivated was bestowed by Blood Robe, and he had just entered the Celestial Sovereign realm, so his aura was not yet stable, being noticed by Blood Robe was normal.</p><p></p><p>Icy Sword did not hide it, and transmitted a message: "Blood Robe Senior, this matter still needs you to help me conceal it, the reason I'm doing this is, hehe, to make a big splash!"</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Celestial Sovereign realm, Icy Sword had indulged in calling Blood Robe "Senior".</p><p>If he didn't call him that now, by the time Blood Robe entered the Celestial Sovereign realm, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>"My mouth is tight, you can rest assured," Qi Yuan continued to transmit.</p><p></p><p>Icy Sword continued, his eyes brimming with a sense of pride: "When the Ling Ya Shedding begins, the Tai Huang Palace will start inspecting the Nine Heavens, according to past logic, as long as one is a Celestial Sovereign, no matter how deeply they hide, the starlight will enter their body. At that time, tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would invite three or five good friends to gather together.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, starlight began to emanate from his body.</p><p></p><p>All his friends were stunned and amazed.</p><p>He casually waved his sleeve and said indifferently, "Ah, I didn't expect to accidentally break through to the Celestial Sovereign realm."</p><p></p><p>These scenes had already played out many times in his mind, just waiting for the inspection of the Nine Heavens to make everyone's jaws drop.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and immediately felt a sense of crisis.</p><p>Recently, his right eyebrow had been twitching occasionally, could it be... because of this?</p><p></p><p>"Will any Celestial Sovereign be exposed?" Qi Yuan asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"During the inspection of the Nine Heavens, controlled by the Immortal Realm's will, as long as that Celestial Sovereign has breathed the air of the Sixth Heaven, they will be unable to hide," Icy Sword replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and became somewhat worried: "If I exhale all the air now... is it still not too late?"</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword looked slightly surprised as he glanced at Qi Yuan: "Could it be that you have entered the realm of the Yang God Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I haven't reached that level yet," Qi Yuan replied honestly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ice Sword let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, before Linye's metamorphosis began, he was still the "brightest" of the cubs.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are not a Yang God, naturally you will not be inspected by them."</p><p></p><p>"But... what if there is a Violet Palace cultivator who has stellar projections like the Yang Gods in the Starry Realm, would he be inspected as well?" Qi Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>He was becoming a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Ice Sword was somewhat bewildered by the question.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to pry open the Blood Robe's head and tell him, "Fellow disciple Blood Robe, you should think carefully about what you're asking."</p><p></p><p>What is this "Violet Palace" with Yang God-like stellar projections? "Cough, cough, perhaps, maybe, possibly?" Ice Sword pondered for a moment before responding, "If this Violet Palace has the combat power of a Yang God, then it cannot escape the inspection of the Heavenly Realms."</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, there are also some terrifying beings who do not have stellar projections but still possess combat power comparable to the Yang God Celestials.</p><p></p><p>When the inspection of the Heavenly Realms occurs, the starlight will also be cast upon these terrifying beings.</p><p></p><p>"Can hiding in a strange place avoid it?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"It's over." Qi Yuan suddenly felt a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He cut off the voice transmission and pondered deeply, his mind shaken.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Qi Yuan spoke in a low voice: "The Taihuang Palace has been too overbearing, not only robbing my personal property but also infringing on my privacy. They really don't take me, a Violet Palace cultivator, seriously at all!"</p><p></p><p>"If you were a Violet Palace sister, they wouldn't take you seriously either." Purple Fate Great Snow laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored him, as he thought of something: "Oh no, it's going to rain, I need to go home and bring in the clothes."</p><p></p><p>With that, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>He needed to activate his brilliant mind to ponder how to deal with the inspection of the Heavenly Realms.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Taihuang Palace, his current hard power was still far inferior.</p><p></p><p>There were too many people here, which was not conducive to the operation of his brilliant mind.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe came and left in a hurry, attracting the attention of many geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword looked at Blood Robe's retreating figure, deep in thought: "Was there something wrong with what I said... or perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had a mysterious conjecture in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there is a Yang God Celestial hidden beside Blood Robe? Could it be...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, Qi Yuan was anxious like an ant on a hot pan.</p><p></p><p>"I already knew the world is difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"I shouldn't have gone to bed early last night, otherwise I wouldn't have heard this thunderbolt from a clear sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the game is still loading and needs more time. Otherwise, I could just dive into the game. Could it be that the one from the Taihuang Palace still can't get into the game to attack me?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the great plan is not yet complete, I need to devise an even greater plan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>His brilliant mind was spinning rapidly.</p><p></p><p>He was already thinking about the details of the super-great plan.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Qi Yuan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The super-great plan is complete. Indeed, when one is forced into a desperate situation, their potential is limitless!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the surrounding space-time suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that the old man Purple Fate, who loved to play with small space-time stops, had come again.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>With the confidence of the super-great plan, Qi Yuan regained his self-assurance.</p><p></p><p>Purple Fate's figure was not tall and burly. In terms of height, he was even shorter than Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan with a complex expression: "You should know that the Abyss Master has submitted to the Taihuang Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, he would have been somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the super-great plan, he was much calmer.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the waters here are very deep. In this Linye metamorphosis, our Black Abyss... I'm afraid we'll have to fight to the death over a great truth." Purple Fate sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you're such a good person, it won't be you who dies in battle."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a rare smile appeared on Purple Fate's face.</p><p></p><p>However, he still looked at Qi Yuan and said, "You little rascal, are you really not going to get the White Dragon Abyss Master pregnant? If you get her pregnant, I'll take the Purple Fate Heaven and defect to you two as a couple, not staying in this damned Black Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Fate's purpose in coming here was to try to persuade Qi Yuan one more time.</p><p></p><p>If he had previously sensed a hint of conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>Now, the conspiracy had descended directly.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors of the Black Abyss all felt that their own safety was in jeopardy.</p><p></p><p>Purple Fate also felt the dark clouds looming.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, the White Dragon Abyss Master can get a person pregnant just by looking at them. If I fell for her, in the future, if we had a deep gaze, and I got pregnant... how would I give birth to the child? Don't bring this up again. You, an elder, are even meddling in the affairs of your juniors, turning the heavenly principles upside down!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Purple Fate didn't mind the content of Qi Yuan's words. He pondered for a while and slowly said, "After leaving the Ghost Pass, you should just stay well in the Purple Fate Heaven and not go anywhere else."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Fate Heaven was his main base and the place where his combat power was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you're too timid. In this Linye metamorphosis, I'll protect you!" Qi Yuan said confidently, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal..." Purple Fate smiled, "The intention is good enough."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he mentioned, "Try not to communicate with the Black Sword during this period. If the Abyss Master summons you, just don't go. If there's a problem, contact me!"</p><p></p><p>The previous conspiracy now seemed quite clear.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sword and the Abyss Master, one of them must be the behind-the-scenes mastermind.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, both of them could be the behind-the-scenes masterminds.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Purple Fate left, and Qi Yuan was left alone in the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Before executing the super-great plan, I need to practice the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>The Taihuang Palace has more than just one strong cultivator. The super-great plan is a one-time thing, it's almost impossible to use it again. I need to improve my strength a bit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked outside, his gaze falling on the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I'm still too weak now. If I were a bit stronger, I could directly storm the Ghost Ruler Heaven's nest, that would be a big gain!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Linye metamorphosis was imminent, and the inspection of the Heavenly Realms was also about to begin.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't waste any more time.</p><p></p><p>"The banner master's clone has been hiding in the Ghost Pass all this time. It seems this time, I can't go in and slaughter again, I can only snatch the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner."</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan disappointed.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, he would still have the patience to wait for the banner master to leave before entering.</p><p></p><p>But now, he needed to save time, quickly improve his own strength, and forge the offensive Spiritual Treasure, that was the way to go.</p><p></p><p>He no longer hesitated, and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>About half a day later.</p><p></p><p>In the Ghost Pass, dark clouds filled the air.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin Celestial, the Ghost Origin Celestial, and other great Truths were hiding in the void.</p><p></p><p>This time, the banner master not only brought out the main body of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, but also formulated a plan to severely wound the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>This time, the banner master deliberately left a loophole in the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, waiting for the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace to infiltrate, and these great Truths would cooperate with the banner master to attack with thunderous force!</p><p></p><p>Although they could not slay the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace, nor could they seal him, they could still severely wound him. Otherwise, where would they put the face of the Ghost Ruler Heaven? Wouldn't the other sacred lands in the Sixth Heaven be able to mock them at will?</p><p></p><p>"He's here!" Suddenly, the Spiritual Treasure of the Ghost Sin Celestial began to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>This time, all their attention and arrangements were focused on the loophole left by the banner master.</p><p></p><p>So when the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace appeared, they immediately noticed, even though they couldn't see his figure, they knew he had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this time, we must let him return severely wounded!"</p><p></p><p>"The same loss, how could we bear it a third time!"</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Sin and Ghost Origin Celestials were furious, their hearts filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At this time, one of the great Truths said, "If our plan doesn't work and he enters the Ghost Pass again, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>He had a look of hidden worry on his face.</p><p></p><p>This Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace was too mysterious and unpredictable. Anything could happen to him.</p><p></p><p>"With the banner master personally taking action, as long as he enters, he will surely be struck by thunderous force!"</p><p></p><p>"The Yang God Celestials of the Ghost Pass have all gathered in one place now. Even if he enters, it will be difficult for him to slay them. There's no need to be afraid!"</p><p></p><p>The three great Truths transmitted.</p><p></p><p>As for the banner master's clone, it had disappeared into the void, not revealing the slightest bit of aura.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Ghost Sin Celestial narrowed his eyes: "He has already reached the location of the loophole!"</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Origin Celestial's spirit was tense: "As long as he enters, we will..."</p><p></p><p>They were a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>But that Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace stood at the loophole without moving, not entering.</p><p></p><p>This made the Ghost Sin Celestial and the Ghost Origin Celestial hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he has discovered our arrangement?" The Ghost Sin Celestial asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, he will only think it's his own keen insight!" The Ghost Origin Celestial said, anxiously observing through the Spiritual Treasure.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he will linger at this loophole for a long time, confirming that there is no danger before entering."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is a battle of patience!"</p><p></p><p>The three great Truths remained silent, observing the changes in the Spiritual Treasure.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, this Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace would definitely spend a long time detecting before entering.</p><p></p><p>However... not even a hundred breaths had passed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice filled with joy echoed throughout the Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, great nature, for this huge Human Emperor Banner!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, under the horrified gaze of the three great Truths, the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner that suppressed the Ghost Ruler Heaven and the offensive Spiritual Treasure suddenly began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>The three great Truths present were all dumbfounded, their faces revealing expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, this scene was something they had never even imagined.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one-third of the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner was firmly grasped by the Palace Emissary of the Human Emperor Palace and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This scene shook the Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>The three great Truths were completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, anxious roar also rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent wretch!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, frantic attack also fell at this moment, stirring up endless clouds and wind.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the owner of the voice was extremely angry and anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Bye-bye!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure disappeared again, along with the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Sixth Heaven trembled! One-third of the Ghost Ruler Heaven's offensive Spiritual Treasure, the Myriad Ghost Soul Banner, had been stolen!</p><p></p><p>This was an offensive Spiritual Treasure, the foundation of the sacred land!

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A crisp voice came.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan dressed up and rubbed his sleepy eyes.</p><p></p><p>He yawned and looked at the black fish in the fish tank, then walked out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, so early in the morning?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, Jiang Lingsu and Jiang Ran, two beautiful women, stood side by side, one innocent and lovely, the other graceful and elegant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt his mood lighten.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, beautiful things always make one's mood joyful.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Qi Yuan, I have good news to share with you!" Jiang Ran's pretty face was smiling, "Yesterday, a disciple of the Black Mountain Sect, who was staying overnight in Rongcheng, was killed by a mysterious expert!</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong is dead, and the Patriarch Bai Chicken is also dead!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Jiang Ran's face was full of joy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slapped his thigh, "I didn't expect my divination skills to be so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he changed his words, "I said I was good at divination, and I could see that the kid was doomed. </p><p></p><p>See, he didn't listen to me and died. He deserved it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu saw this and sighed helplessly, "I don't know which powerful person did this to bring such joy to people's hearts!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that today, an Elder Danlong from the Black Mountain Sect just happened to be nearby and went to the scene for investigation. </p><p></p><p>And last night, an Elder from our Shenguang Sect also went to Rongcheng.</p><p></p><p>Although the scene was burned, they have already obtained a lot of clues."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and his heart tightened slightly, "What clues?"</p><p></p><p>"The one who slaughtered the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect was a masked person.</p><p></p><p>The Elders said that the mysterious masked man should be a sword cultivator, but in order to avoid exposing the traces of the Dao, he specially used a knife to slaughter the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect." Jiang Lingsu was very familiar with the news within the Shenguang Sect.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of knife?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Jiang Lingsu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a kitchen knife?" Qi Yuan took out a knife and waved it.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu covered her mouth and chuckled lightly, "How could that be possible!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran's innocent and beautiful face also smiled, and a touch of charm naturally emerged in her smile, "If they were killed by a kitchen knife, that would be so humiliating, but so satisfying!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu also added, "It is rumored that the Patriarch Bai Chicken was split in half by a single blow, shattering his protective elixir light and destroying his golden core, causing his death.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that the knife must be a powerful magical weapon, how can it be compared to a mere kitchen knife?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly became dissatisfied, "All things are equal, how can you look down on my family's knife! My family's knife can also chop off that dog's head with a single blow!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran smiled lightly without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu argued with Qi Yuan, "All things are equal, how can the senior brother insult the dog?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not continue on this topic. He held the kitchen knife and said worriedly, "I have a kitchen knife, and the disciples of the Black Mountain Sect died by the knife, you say, will the Black Mountain Sect suspect that I killed Chu Tianxiong?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran was stunned, wanting to laugh, although she had not received professional training, she still held it back.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu smiled lightly, "Senior Brother, you are overthinking too much.</p><p></p><p>You should focus on your cultivation first!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't just talk about cultivation, let's talk about civilization between you and me!"</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran and Jiang Lingsu could not keep up with Qi Yuan's train of thought at all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked worried, "Yesterday, I kindly warned Chu Tianxiong, but in the eyes of outsiders, it seems that I had a dispute with him. You say, will others think that I held a grudge against Chu Tianxiong and went to kill them all at night?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran and Jiang Lingsu were completely speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, don't worry, no one will suspect you!"</p><p></p><p>"If someone asks, you two have to testify for me, just say that I didn't go out last night, I was always on the Seven-Color Peak drinking and guessing with you two!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, okay!" Jiang Lingsu rubbed her forehead.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran's mouth also held a smile.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chu Tian Xiong had died, and her mood had improved greatly, and the gloom on her face had temporarily disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lowered his head and still looked a bit scared: "What if the Black Mountain Sect doesn't believe your testimony and forcibly comes to arrest me? Will the Divine Light Sect protect me?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su was completely speechless: "Eldest Martial Brother, I don't think you should be worrying about yourself now. You should be worrying about that masked person, just like us. After all, he is facing the Black Mountain Sect, that old demonic fowl!"</p><p></p><p>After discussing for a while, Jiang Ling Su and Jiang Ran left.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ling Su's face still had a look of helplessness: "My Eldest Martial Brother, he's a good person, it's just his personality, as you can see, he's a bit eccentric and strange."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ran showed a sweet smile: "Actually, Elder Martial Brother Qi Yuan is quite interesting in this way."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, he is indeed quite interesting, and he doesn't need to have so many worries, carefree and without a care in the world." Jiang Ling Su thought of something and sighed involuntarily. She had a huge stone in her heart that she couldn't put down.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Martial Brother Qi Yuan is still carefree and without a care in the world?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was pacing back and forth in the room alone.</p><p></p><p>His face was filled with deep worry.</p><p></p><p>"I was careless last night!"</p><p></p><p>"Merely wearing a mask is not perfect, I should have dressed as a woman, then my gender would not have been exposed!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, if they realize the killer used a knife, what if they associate it with me?"</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect won't come to trouble me, will they?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan became more and more anxious and angry the more he thought about it.</p><p></p><p>Although he had done it almost flawlessly.</p><p></p><p>But what if there was a primordial saint hidden in the Black Mountain Sect who had figured out it was him?</p><p></p><p>He had already imagined the elders of the Black Mountain Sect coming to the Divine Light Sect, their troops at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>He was weak, pitiful, and helpless all alone.</p><p></p><p>He got angrier and angrier, his face flushed and his neck swollen.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the long pavilion, by the ancient road, the grassy sky."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mountain Sect is really shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"I just represented the moon and eliminated a few evil ones, didn't I?"</p><p></p><p>"They actually unite to bully me, a 229-month-old child?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there no more rule of law, no more justice in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"Bullying to the extreme!"</p><p></p><p>"Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, do not bully the young and poor!"</p><p></p><p>"I have to take revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sharpened his knife, he found a hat in the room and covered his head with it, so that no one would see him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, he also smeared some pot ash on his face.</p><p></p><p>Looking at himself in the mirror, Qi Yuan felt a little safer.</p><p></p><p>He tucked the kitchen knife into his waist and sneaked out of the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Jiang Ling Su came to the courtyard outside Qi Yuan's place: "Eldest Martial Brother, are you there?"</p><p></p><p>She called out, but got no response.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, my Eldest Martial Brother is usually in the courtyard, when did he leave, how come I didn't notice?"</p><p></p><p>After all, she had just reached the Foundation Establishment stage last night.</p><p></p><p>Her perception had improved greatly.</p><p></p><p>If her Eldest Martial Brother left, she should have been able to sense it.</p><p></p><p>"How strange."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on a glass fish tank.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the black fish swimming in the tank, murmuring: "Is this the fish my Eldest Martial Brother caught last night?</p><p></p><p>It doesn't seem to be a wild fish."</p><p></p><p>She pondered briefly, without thinking too much about it, and left her Eldest Martial Brother's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Divine Light Sect's Library Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan climbed to the third floor, hiding in a corner, secretly checking information about the strength of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thank you [Book Friend 20210403030807498] for the thousand-dollar reward.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

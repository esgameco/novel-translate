        <h1>Chapter 426</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The identity of the Ten Suns Celestial Lord must not be exposed!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, when he fished for Yang spirits, he would trick them into the underworld to kill them.</p><p></p><p>So no one would associate him with the Ten Suns Celestial Lord. </p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't reveal his origins from the Wangyue Continent, and didn't use the Solar Golden Pill in battle, no one would know he was the Ten Suns Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"I'll see you off." There was still deep reluctance in Jin Li's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Look, what's this?" At this moment, a piece of jade appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>This jade looked similar to the Exquisite Jade Dew.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few days, Qi Yuan had the divine infant create this to match the Exquisite Jade Dew in Jin Li's hand.</p><p></p><p>Although they could communicate using ordinary message jade slips, there needed to be a sense of ceremony, as the Exquisite Jade Dew held extraordinary meaning for Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we exchange Exquisite Jade Dews?" Qi Yuan shook the Exquisite Jade Dew in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The specially made Exquisite Jade Dew also had other functions, enough to protect Jin Li's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Jin Li smiled and took Qi Yuan's Exquisite Jade Dew.</p><p></p><p>A while later, the two left the great hall.</p><p></p><p>The time spent together was always short. Jin Li's expression still showed some anxiety, feeling as if everything was like living in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Only by pinching her palm and feeling a slight pain did she feel somewhat reassured.</p><p></p><p>"Young Miss!"</p><p></p><p>Shortly after walking out of the great hall, a woman wearing full armor and exuding a bloody aura approached them.</p><p></p><p>Her face was cold, with a hint of urgency.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Jin Li's aura turned a bit chilly, completely different from when she was with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>As Jin Li spoke, she leaned against Qi Yuan like a little bird seeking shelter.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be using her actions to declare that this was her man.</p><p></p><p>The armored woman before them was clearly a Yin spirit.</p><p></p><p>Her identity was rather special.</p><p></p><p>In the Moon God Palace, there was a group known as the Moon Maiden Clan.</p><p></p><p>This woman was a member of the clan from which Moon Maiden Jin Li originated.</p><p></p><p>Her parents had long since perished. She was sent to the Moon God Palace by the clan and eventually became a Moon Maiden.</p><p></p><p>As a result, her clan also became a Moon Maiden Clan, enjoying high-welfare treatment.</p><p></p><p>"Young Miss, I heard you want to give up your status as a Moon Maiden!" The armored woman's face was respectful, but she looked at Qi Yuan with a hint of hostility.</p><p></p><p>It was quite difficult for their clan to produce a Moon Maiden.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of Jin Li's existence that their clan had been prosperous for over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... shouldn't we consider it carefully? The clan elders... may have objections!" The armored woman said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Facing Jin Li, she felt a hint of fear in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"If the clan elders have objections, then they don't need to be elders anymore. Make room for others." Jin Li's voice was not polite at all.</p><p></p><p>The armored woman's face stiffened. She hadn't expected Jin Li's attitude to be so firm, without any room for negotiation.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to say more.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Jin Li lost her status as a Moon Maiden, the resources the clan received would greatly decrease, and their treatment would also be lowered.</p><p></p><p>"Young Miss, if you lose your Moon Maiden status, I'm afraid... it will be very difficult for you to reach the Yang spirit realm!" The armored woman could only say this through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, her gaze towards Qi Yuan was quite unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>Beauty misleads people! The Young Miss loves handsome men, not power.</p><p></p><p>"Whether I'm a Moon Maiden or not is my business." Jin Li's attitude was very firm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the clan's current status was entirely thanks to her.</p><p></p><p>Now, they were just losing those privileges.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for these people to have complaints.</p><p></p><p>It's like if you gave a beggar 100 yuan every day, and suddenly one day you stopped. The beggar might angrily ask you, "Where's my money?"</p><p></p><p>"He will be my dao partner." Jin Li hugged Qi Yuan and solemnly declared.</p><p></p><p>The armored woman felt somewhat disheartened: "Young Miss, the clan's interests are a small matter, but your... future..."</p><p></p><p>Before Jin Li could speak, Qi Yuan stepped forward at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"My left eyelid is twitching, which means Jin Li's future will definitely be very good if she follows me," Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>According to the Moon God Palace's cultivation, Jin Li could indeed reach the Yang spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Principle realm?</p><p></p><p>That was just wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, if Jin Li was placed in the Gate of Great Principle to contemplate for several million years, there would be no match for her in the current Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the number one treasure of creation in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>So following him, Jin Li's future would be stronger than becoming some Moon Maiden.</p><p></p><p>The armored woman was a bit confused, or rather perplexed.</p><p></p><p>She didn't really trust Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>After all, there weren't many forces in the Sixth Heaven stronger than the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Even if Jin Li went to other major forces, she might not have such treatment.</p><p></p><p>So she strongly suspected that Qi Yuan's sweet words had moved the Young Miss.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just suspicion. Without evidence, she couldn't say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>"You are Jin Li's family, which means you are my family too," Qi Yuan said kindly at this moment. "Losing the Moon Maiden status may lower your treatment.</p><p></p><p>But... I have some secret information about making a fortune to tell you privately. Don't leak it out."</p><p></p><p>The armored woman was stunned, looking somewhat dubious.</p><p></p><p>Information about making a fortune?</p><p></p><p>Jin Li spoke up at this point: "His words are equivalent to mine."</p><p></p><p>She had been standing on Qi Yuan's side all along.</p><p></p><p>"Please... sir, explain in detail!" Although she didn't understand, the armored woman still said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, she didn't really believe what Qi Yuan said about making a big fortune.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan transmitted to the armored woman: "I have inside information that the Moluoyi clan is about to kick the bucket. You should take this opportunity to borrow celestial jade from the Moluoyi clan.</p><p></p><p>When the Moluoyi clan is finished, you won't have to repay the borrowed celestial jade!"</p><p></p><p>The Moluoyi clan and the Moon God Palace were currently at war, but there was still some trade going on between the lower-level forces on both sides.</p><p></p><p>War is war, trade is trade.</p><p></p><p>If necessary, Jin Li's relatives could also cooperate with other forces and borrow celestial jade from the Moluoyi clan in the name of other forces.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the armored woman was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was too far-fetched.</p><p></p><p>The Moluoyi clan was going to be wiped out?</p><p></p><p>Borrow celestial jade? Both of these things were extremely unreliable.</p><p></p><p>Although the Moluoyi clan had always been subservient to the Taiping Palace and the Black Magic Abyss, they were the hegemon of the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, the Moluoyi clan's power ranking could easily enter the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>How could such a behemoth suddenly be destroyed?</p><p></p><p>Unless there was a holy land in the Sixth Heaven with a Great Principle expert presiding, who else could destroy them? Moreover, the Moluoyi clan also had the treasure of creation, the Moluoyi Well. Even if they were no match for a Great Principle realm expert, with the Moluoyi Well, they could escape to the First Heaven and hide.</p><p></p><p>So a holy land with a Great Principle realm expert wouldn't bother with this mess at all.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, how did you know about such a big event?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if the Moluoyi clan isn't destroyed, they will definitely be severely weakened. You don't need to worry about repaying the celestial jade you borrow," Qi Yuan added.</p><p></p><p>He had a lot of experience with this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had cooperated with the Ice Mountain Domineering Woman to borrow spirit stones from the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now, the target has become the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>The armored woman's expression was somewhat troubled. If the young miss wasn't beside her, she would have wanted to say to Qi Yuan, "Are you joking?" After all, what Qi Yuan said was too fantastical and couldn't be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>If the Moon God Sovereign really decided to destroy the Moluo clan, she would certainly formulate a detailed plan, strike swiftly and decisively, and then annihilate the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>Before the Moluo clan's destruction, this information absolutely could not be leaked.</p><p></p><p>Even less would such information be revealed to allow people to borrow celestial jade.</p><p></p><p>For a power like the Moon God Palace, what's the value of this bit of celestial jade?</p><p></p><p>Information leakage would be the most terrifying thing.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was too childish and absurd.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her conflicted expression, Jin Li said seriously: "Don't leak this matter. Now go back and urge the clan elders to borrow celestial jade from the Moluo clan!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Li was no longer the weak empress she once was. She now acted decisively and resolutely.</p><p></p><p>Although the armored woman didn't understand at all, she still said: "As you command."</p><p></p><p>Since returning from the lower realm, the young miss's personality had changed, becoming more assertive and uncompromising.</p><p></p><p>"The more the better," Jin Li added.</p><p></p><p>She wasn't worried about this matter leaking information.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if Qi Yuan said this to the Moluo Heavenly Venerable, he probably wouldn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, what holy land would borrow celestial jade before destroying another holy land?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the armored woman and said with a smile: "Don't worry, follow me and I'll definitely let you eat and drink well, have pork with every meal, and add eggs to your noodles!"</p><p></p><p>The armored woman: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Moon God Palace area, Qi Yuan felt a bit melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I have to act again."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I've discovered one of the world's top 10 unsolved mysteries!"</p><p></p><p>"How strange, who's the director, who's the producer, why aren't they paying me?"</p><p></p><p>"Who owes me money!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he realized there were people outside who owed him money. Most importantly, he didn't even know who these people were, which made him very depressed.</p><p></p><p>But now was not the time to consider this.</p><p></p><p>He had to start acting.</p><p></p><p>In the Absolute Moon Abyss, a terrifying aura descended.</p><p></p><p>The huge eyeball suddenly contracted and quickly retreated into the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Yin Gods guarding the Absolute Moon Abyss sensed a terrifying and horrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>These people's expressions all changed, knowing that something major had happened.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a vast voice sounded in the ears of all the Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Activate the formation, defend with all your might!"</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable is going into seclusion, do not disturb!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this vast voice, most of the Yin Gods of the Moluo clan turned pale or solemn.</p><p></p><p>Discussions and mental communications were heard constantly.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Venerable is...?"</p><p></p><p>"Feng Kui Myth and several other lords seem to have disappeared for a few days..."</p><p></p><p>"Something big is about to happen!"</p><p></p><p>Although the Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable's sneak attack on the Moon God Palace was carried out secretly without exposing information,</p><p></p><p>Being in the Absolute Moon Abyss, the disappearance of some mythical powerhouses and great venerables could still be traced.</p><p></p><p>Especially since in recent days, they had also sensed disturbances in the direction of the Moon God Palace, suspected to be the activity of Yang God level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable now going into seclusion and activating formations, they could vaguely guess what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expression was solemn and worried.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable's cave dwelling, Qi Yuan was lying low inside, his aura somewhat unstable, looking like he had suffered serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>"This big eyeball is really ugly."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, no wonder actors nowadays don't like to wear ugly makeup or play ugly roles. If it wasn't for the plan, how could I endure this humiliation and play a big eyeball?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan had formulated a detailed plan.</p><p></p><p>This plan was called "Sending the Well Home".</p><p></p><p>The plan was divided into three steps.</p><p></p><p>For this plan to be successfully implemented, he had specially called over the Wutian Buddha who held the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the level of detail and rigor of this plan ranked in the top three among all the plans Qi Yuan had ever made.</p><p></p><p>Just calling over the Wutian Buddha who held the Buddhist realm to switch places was no less than Han Xin's strategy of "repairing the roads in the open and transporting grain in secret".</p><p></p><p>If Han Xin could be called the God of War, Qi Yuan felt he could be the "God of Planning" - his plans were that good.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to use the Gate of Ultimate Principles to lure all the Moluo clan's Heavenly Venerables from the Demon Abyss and kill them.</p><p></p><p>The second step was to take advantage of everyone's inattention to secretly infiltrate the Fifth Heaven, use the same trick again to lure the Moluo clan's Heavenly Venerables in and kill them.</p><p></p><p>The third step was to bring the well home.</p><p></p><p>The well from his home had been wandering outside, lonely and suffering abuse. It was time for it to return home and enjoy good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said this.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was perfecting this plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed, suddenly a vast aura permeated the Absolute Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes, his expression turning serious, and said softly: "Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng, since you've come, please enter."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, an overwhelming aura rose up in the Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng's illusory form appeared, looking at Qi Yuan in surprise: "Eye Demon, what's going on with you?"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng was one of the three Ultimate Principle Yang Gods in the Demon Abyss of the Moluo clan, and had a good relationship with Eye Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, this old man fell for that old woman Long Yue's scheme!" Qi Yuan's voice was hoarse, his eyes filled with resentment, "She actually sacrificed a deputy guardian and a bit of authority to destroy the Ghostly Bamboo Crescent Moon to lure me in!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he became very angry.</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, chains constantly shook and the space became extremely unstable.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng roughly understood what had happened: "Eye Demon, you were rash this time!"</p><p></p><p>The Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable had fallen for Long Yue's scheme and lost quite a few subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"How serious are your injuries? Does the Absolute Moon Abyss need support?" Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng asked.</p><p></p><p>The Eye Demon's pupils suddenly changed, his aura overwhelming: "This old man is not injured, and the Absolute Moon Abyss doesn't need any support!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng's expression didn't change at all.</p><p></p><p>The Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable had always been arrogant and cared about face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't lose the Absolute Moon Abyss." After saying this, Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng's form disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, Qi Yuan sat on the throne, narrowing his eyes: "My acting should be pretty good, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, outside the Absolute Moon Abyss, Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng's illusory form was hidden to the side, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"Eye Demon... seems a bit different from before."</p><p></p><p>As an Ultimate Principle Yang God, Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng's acuity was beyond ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"This old man is too far from this place and can't observe Eye Demon constantly. This is a problem."</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng pondered.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that there might be some issue with the Eye Demon Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Right, Mo Chi is nearby. I can go find him and have him keep an eye on Eye Demon." Heavenly Venerable Mo Heng made his plans and headed towards the Broken Moon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 490</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hidden information was revealed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>[Chen Kangbao, 67 years old, was once a Qi Master, physically weak and feeble.]</p><p></p><p>This white-haired old man, named Chen Kangbao, was actually a Qi Master.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan greatly: "You are a Qi Master, can you refine magical artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Masters are generally highly esteemed, even if they go mad, they won't be sent to the asylum, but will be revered as living Buddhas in their homes.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Chen Kangbao, like him, was also falsely accused and sent to the asylum? After all, looking left and right, this Chen Kangbao just speaks a bit erratically, but is actually not ill.</p><p></p><p>If he is considered ill, how would Ziyuan Daxue be classified? "Divine being... this old man's memory gets poor when he's hungry." Chen Kangbao bent his body, truly seeming to regard Qi Yuan as a divine being.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a divine being," Qi Yuan denied.</p><p></p><p>He is now just a minor Purple Mansion cultivator, not even an Yin Deity, how could he be called a divine being?</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man smiled: "This old man knows, divine beings who descend to the mortal realm lose all their powers and need to hide their identities! Young master, your servant..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao looked at Qi Yuan and also changed his form of address, seemingly truly wanting to hide Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the veins on his neck were bulging, as if he wanted to say something important.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry, take your time," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Your servant... is hungry!" The white-haired old man gritted his teeth and said, and after that, Qi Yuan clearly noticed his expression becoming somewhat distorted, with black lines faintly visible in his veins.</p><p></p><p>"You really live up to your name, to be honest, I'm a bit hungry too, come, let's go to the kitchen for a late-night snack."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has come to this game world, he is merely an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>Even his physique is much weaker.</p><p></p><p>If he encounters a strong man, with his combat skills, he may be able to defeat the other.</p><p></p><p>But if it's a Commanding Officer or a Mysterious Spirit, with his thin arms and legs, he may not be able to.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, young master, I know where the kitchen is!" Chen Kangbao seemed to quickly get into his role, sneakily leading the way in front, taking Qi Yuan to the kitchen under the cover of night.</p><p></p><p>The nights in the asylum were particularly pitch-black, with only a few large red lanterns hanging on the road.</p><p></p><p>The entire asylum was silent and deathly still, appearing particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>Especially Chen Kangbao, his face was already very pale, like it was powdered, passing by the large red lanterns, his face could make the cute Sadako cry.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Qi Yuan did see a few genuine lunatics - one hanging from a tree sleeping, one fishing in the middle of the night, clearly not normal people.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Chen Kangbao and Qi Yuan arrived outside the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused: "Sneaking in like this, aren't we thieves?"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the food in the asylum is meant for us to eat, we're just eating it early!" Chen Kangbao said, with drool at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>It seems he was truly hungry.</p><p></p><p>"You have a point there." Qi Yuan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The kitchen door was locked, but for Qi Yuan, opening a lock was no problem.</p><p></p><p>The two entered the kitchen, and Chen Kangbao immediately rushed towards the food like a starving ghost, frantically eating all kinds of steamed buns and cold rice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lightly drank some porridge and ate a few buns, already feeling full.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Kangbao was still eating frantically, like a glutton.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Qi Yuan looked at Chen Kangbao and said indifferently, "Full?"</p><p></p><p>Now Chen Kangbao's belly was round and bulging, if one didn't know, they would think he was pregnant.</p><p></p><p>"With the young master's food, hehe... six parts full." Chen Kangbao let out a burp, then said, "Young master, now that we've both eaten our fill, it's time to start... the real work!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao had a serious expression, but his pale face made him look too creepy, now speaking like a clown.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we must start the real work. I need to play the role of the son-in-law well, and also... the chef's knife and the Divine Arrival."</p><p></p><p>The son-in-law and the chef's knife were easy enough, but playing the Divine Arrival, Qi Yuan had no idea.</p><p></p><p>The most urgent thing now is to return to Jian'an Manor.</p><p></p><p>But now, because of "defiling" Lady Liu, he has been sent to the asylum.</p><p></p><p>There must be a conspiracy behind this.</p><p></p><p>What is the conspiracy? Qi Yuan pondered, feeling a headache. He looked at Chen Kangbao and casually asked, "Old man, are you smart?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Kangbao hurriedly patted his belly: "I'm very smart when I'm full!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me test you, what is ninety-seven times ninety-seven?"</p><p></p><p>"9409!" Chen Kangbao blurted out without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "You're a talent! Old man, your intelligence is impressive! If I put this question to the clear-eyed university students on the Blue Star, they definitely wouldn't be able to solve it immediately. Give Zhuge Liang a thousand university students, and the Northern Expedition would have hope! You're stronger than university students, your brain will be very useful to me. Are you interested in being my strategist?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao drooled: "As long as there's food to eat, I'll do it!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Qi Yuan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>When playing the game, he needs a teammate.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's quick arithmetic skills make him the intelligence pillar of the team, Qi Yuan only needs to kill and level up.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao glanced at Qi Yuan and suddenly whispered, "Young master, your bird, is it on the left or the right?"</p><p></p><p>"What bird?" Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Then he realized Chen Kangbao was looking at his crotch.</p><p></p><p>He understood now, it was referring to that.</p><p></p><p>"It's just..." Chen Kangbao raised his eyebrows, "Young master, I am your strategist, you are my lord, out of respect for the esteemed, the bird cannot be on the same side as you!"</p><p></p><p>"...This kind of taboo doesn't need to be observed." Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that talented people often have some quirks, Qi Yuan just accepted it.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, don't always talk in that vulgar way, it's too low-class." Qi Yuan added.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, your servant will obey!" Chen Kangbao bent his body, then turned serious, "Since the young master values me, I must also help the young master solve his troubles.</p><p></p><p>Now, the young master and I are trapped in the asylum, we need to kill the director to get out! This director, he has done all kinds of evil, his head is oozing pus!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the director, Chen Kangbao hated him so much that his teeth were itching, and there was a hint of fear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this director had a rather bad reputation in the asylum.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, say whatever you want." Qi Yuan didn't feel like thinking.</p><p></p><p>As a qualified lord, he only needs to make decisions.</p><p></p><p>After all, his eyes, his ears, his nose, etc. can help him make the right judgments.</p><p></p><p>"I have formulated a detailed plan!" Chen Kangbao said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"A talent like you, with excellent qualities like me, making plans before taking action. Tell me about the plan."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao, receiving the praise, showed a proud expression.</p><p></p><p>"Before making the plan, we need to understand the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Director Zhou Mo may be small in stature, but he keeps a fierce beast dog in his courtyard, extremely fierce, this dog has swallowed a strong man whole before." Chen Kangbao mentioned this with great trepidation.</p><p></p><p>A beast, Qi Yuan also knew about this kind of creature from the memories of the son-in-law Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These are terrifying beasts born from ordinary animals encountering Mysterious Spirit pollution.</p><p></p><p>Most of them are bloodthirsty and carnivorous.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that even with Qi Yuan's skills, if he encounters such a beast, he would probably be no match.</p><p></p><p>The difference in strength and speed is too great, even containing supernatural powers.</p><p></p><p>"If I encounter this dog now, it would be a 30-70 chance, with me 30% dead and it 70% full." Qi Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>With this thin body and limbs, it won't work.</p><p></p><p>How can a small dog defeat a big dog?</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao looked at Qi Yuan and asked, "Can the young master recover his spiritual powers?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it just takes time."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not cultivate, he could still level up.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, the plan will be carried out in three steps.</p><p></p><p>The first step, the old servant will secretly use bones to lure the big dog away, and the young master will sneak into the dean's room, kill the dean, and take the Exotic Beast Token."</p><p></p><p>The Exotic Beast Token is the token that controls exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"The second step, we'll find the real culprit behind the scenes through the dean, and have the dog kill them!"</p><p></p><p>"The third step, we'll run back to the Jining Manor, seek the protection of the Shen family, and clear our name!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he had carefully designed this plan, using the "luring the tiger away from the mountain" tactic.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was amazed.</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!" Qi Yuan praised.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow? Could it be that the deity's true form is a cat?</p><p></p><p>He made a new discovery and secretly noted it down, pretending not to have noticed.</p><p></p><p>"The plan is good, but there's still room for improvement. If we add in time and backup plans, it might be even better." Qi Yuan saw that Chen Kangbao had potential, so he shared his insights on plan-making, hoping Chen Kangbao could improve.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is right, this is where the old servant fell short." Chen Kangbao lowered his head, his face full of reverence.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was overjoyed inside.</p><p></p><p>Everything the deity said, he already knew, but he deliberately didn't mention it.</p><p></p><p>As a servant, if he wasn't a little foolish, how could he highlight the deity's brilliance and might?</p><p></p><p>"The plan is complete now, I'll go and improve my strength first."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan raised his head.</p><p></p><p>Slap! A resounding slap echoed.</p><p></p><p>A mechanical, indifferent voice spoke at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"You killed a mosquito, your experience has weakly increased."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao looked at Qi Yuan, blinking his eyes, somewhat puzzled, but soon he praised, "The young master is truly a deity descended from the heavens, to be able to kill a mosquito with a single slap!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, this is nothing special?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, don't be surprised by this voice.</p><p></p><p>Since I came to this world without an awakened system, I lack a sense of security, so I'm pretending my own system."</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's go to the pond, there are more mosquitoes there, and leveling up will be faster."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said in succession.</p><p></p><p>After killing a mosquito, if he had an experience bar above his head, he could see the experience bar weakly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Kangbao didn't understand, he was very supportive and quickly followed Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The two of them came to the pond.</p><p></p><p>This pond was located in the backyard of the Insane Asylum, and at this time, there was an old fisherman fishing there.</p><p></p><p>Vegetable-washing grannies also often came here to wash vegetables and clothes.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, few people came.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the fisherman, the only other appearance might be corpses in the pond.</p><p></p><p>In this kind of county town, in the secluded Insane Asylum, randomly killing one or two people was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>It was even called the "small yamen" (local government office).</p><p></p><p>Some people who had exhausted their options would even send orphans and widows to the Insane Asylum.</p><p></p><p>And then they might appear in the pond.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman had already fished out several corpses this year.</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the pond, Qi Yuan stood among the water weeds, heedless of the mud, holding a lantern in one hand and slapping mosquitoes with the other.</p><p></p><p>The light of the lantern attracted many mosquitoes and insects.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical, indifferent voice kept sounding out.</p><p></p><p>"You slew a mosquito, your experience bar has weakly increased."</p><p></p><p>"You smashed a moth, your experience bar has weakly increased."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had become a mosquito-slaying deity, continuously killing mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Kangbao, he stood aside, seemingly earnestly catching mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the wall, two figures stood, gazing into the distance at Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Lao, it seems he has truly gone mad." The Confucian scholar in the robe spoke, his eyes filled with deep resignation.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a high-ranking person emanated from him, indicating he was either in a high position or of noble status.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the young man in black robes flashed a look of pity: "Isn't this means we can't ask for his help? The Mighty Dragon Chariot cannot be repaired, and the Mysterious Spirits of the Grandfather Mountain Lake..."</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Dragon Chariot was a powerful magical artifact.</p><p></p><p>However, this artifact had been damaged, and its power was greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Mysterious Spirits of the Grandfather Mountain Lake were rampant, and the various forces in Jiangzhou were helpless against them.</p><p></p><p>If the Mighty Dragon Chariot, this powerful artifact, could not be repaired, Jining Manor might be overrun by the Mysterious Spirits, resulting in heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>The young man in black thought about this, his expression grim, but then he heard something and his face turned ugly again: "That person has a lot of nerve, actually making Chen Lao call himself an 'old servant'!"</p><p></p><p>"A deranged person doesn't even know what he's doing, why bother finding fault with him? As long as Chen Lao is happy, that's fine." The Confucian scholar said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, should we bring Chen Lao back?" The young man in black suggested.</p><p></p><p>After all, he thought it was a disgrace for Chen Lao to live in the Insane Asylum.</p><p></p><p>"This place was once Chen Lao's old home, and for him to stay here in his old age is not a bad retirement." The Confucian scholar sighed, "And there are many eyes watching me, if someone finds out Chen Lao is still alive, he'll never have peace for the rest of his life, why bother?"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholar said this, his gaze bleak. Suddenly, he thought of something and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty thousand hidden soldiers in the deep mountains, loyal hearts shining in the cold night.</p><p>Buried in the secluded valley, any regrets? Their heroic names echoing through the ages!"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholar said this and left with the young man in black.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Lao was mad, he was safe in this Insane Asylum, and no one could harm him.</p><p>If they took him away, even though Chen Lao had rendered great service to the state, he might become a pawn in someone's hands, which the Confucian scholar did not wish to see.</p><p></p><p>So he could only leave secretly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's gaze swept towards the distant wall, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my strength is still too weak. If someone were to spy on me bathing now, I might not even know."</p><p></p><p>After killing so many mosquitoes, Qi Yuan's strength had increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>His level had finally risen to Level 1.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer the powerless son-in-law Qi Yuan, and could be considered to have some strength.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the old servant has caught many mosquitoes!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chen Kangbao ran over, cupping his hands, inside of which the mosquitoes were buzzing.</p><p></p><p>On his aged hands, one could see the large bumps from the mosquito bites.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad." Qi Yuan reached out and made a cross mark on the mosquito bite bumps on Chen Kangbao's hands, then crushed all the mosquitoes he was holding.</p><p></p><p>"You killed a bunch of mosquitoes, your experience bar has weakly increased."</p><p></p><p>【You have reached Level 2, your physical fitness has improved.】</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was accompanied by the game's voice, and a look of joy appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Now I finally have some strength."</p><p></p><p>Although he had only leveled up twice, Qi Yuan's improvement was significant, at least compared to his previous self.</p><p></p><p>Now, a single slide tackle could probably kill a leopard.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, should we execute the first step of the plan? I'll lure the dean's dog away, and you can go kill the dean!" Chen Kangbao said excitedly, eager to act.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>"You two lunatics are actually plotting to harm me, how amusing."</p><p></p><p>Only to see an old man in the distance, walking over while leading a black and white dog.</p><p></p><p>The dog's fur was black and white, its stature tall, almost as tall as a young man. Its gaze exuded a bloodthirsty aura, as if it was eyeing Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao with ill intent.</p><p></p><p>It licked its wide tongue, and a foul stench wafted over.</p><p></p><p>This dog... was quite a dog!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the world, the black-robed guards, who were like gods and demons, were no match for Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the waning moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"They're not even elite monsters, just inexperienced, inauspicious."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden looked up at the towering figure beside her, and the moon in her eyes became crescent-shaped.</p><p></p><p>The sword was like a blood dragon, still slaughtering the living beings.</p><p></p><p>The powerful and mysterious black-robed guards fell one by one.</p><p></p><p>The sword was sheathed, and the Moon Maiden held the scabbard.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke: "Let's go, to the next place."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Qi Yuan wanted to shatter all the claws and fangs of the demonic forces from the outside world that had infiltrated the human realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's just a game, right? First kill the small fry, then the big bosses, isn't that the usual routine? Kunwu City, the city walls were nearly two zhang high.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sword beam came from the south and fell into the city.</p><p></p><p>Only a mocking voice was heard: "This sword only kills the wicked and powerful, only the tyrants!"</p><p></p><p>The voice drifted, entering the ears of all the people in the city.</p><p></p><p>Many were puzzled, some were shocked, some were delighted, and some were furious.</p><p></p><p>In Kunwu City, an old man climbed off the bed of a tender young maiden, his face filled with anger: "What bold child is this!"</p><p></p><p>The response was a blood-red sword beam.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The naked young maiden saw the old man's severed head and let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the sword beam ran rampant in Kunwu City, and many heads fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The entire Kunwu City was instantly thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a burly man's face was deathly pale: "The lord is dead!"</p><p></p><p>The chubby man heard this, his eyes widening.</p><p></p><p>Then, the drifting, mocking voice sounded again: "From today, the filial piety decree is abolished. Respect the elderly is good, but also love the young, love all people, and love oneself."</p><p></p><p>The words faded, and a blood-red dragon-like sword flew out of the city.</p><p></p><p>The chubby man looked up, his expression suspicious: "This voice sounds a bit familiar."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered the faceless man he had encountered outside the city that day.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>A terrible idea formed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, outside Kunwu City.</p><p></p><p>The sword was sheathed again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked down at the petite Moon Maiden: "Now, how much have you mastered?"</p><p></p><p>"Ni... nine-tenths."</p><p></p><p>"Why is it still lacking a little?" Qi Yuan thought of something, "Can't let you become like Chenxiang, let's go to the next city."</p><p></p><p>For seven consecutive days, the entire Hundred Cities Alliance was thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>There was a faceless swordsman, leading a young maiden carrying a sword, who stepped foot in the hundred cities.</p><p></p><p>In each city, the sword struck like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>All the tyrants and nobles were slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>There were beggars who secretly watched the faceless swordsman from afar, and after he had slain the running dogs of the demonic forces from the outside world in a city, asked the sword-carrying maiden, "How much have you learned?"</p><p></p><p>They only saw the maiden lowering her head, her hands clutching her clothes: "Nine-tenths."</p><p></p><p>There were also knights in other cities who saw the same scene from a distance.</p><p></p><p>They called the faceless swordsman the Faceless Sword Deity, and the maiden the Nine-Tenths Maiden.</p><p></p><p>In seven days, Qi Yuan led the Moon Maiden to set foot in 137 cities of the Hundred Cities Alliance and 13 graveyards of the demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>The number of those killed was uncountable, but the blood flowed like rivers.</p><p></p><p>On the last day, Qi Yuan stood in the last city, his hands on his hips, not knowing what an opponent was.</p><p></p><p>"This time, how much?"</p><p></p><p>"...Nine-tenths," the Moon Maiden said cautiously but firmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan sighed helplessly: "I've slaughtered all the claws and fangs of the demonic forces from the outside world in the human realm.</p><p></p><p>He should be reacting soon, and if you say nine-tenths again, that's not quite right."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden fell silent, looking at Qi Yuan with a pleading expression on her small face: "Can you... wait three hundred years before going to slay the demonic forces from the outside world? By then... I will still hold the sword for you."</p><p></p><p>"Devouring the moon?" Qi Yuan looked at the moon in the sky, then at the Moon Maiden, "Even if a game is fun, you can't play it for three hundred years, can you?"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden remained silent, stubbornly looking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we'll return to the Seven-Month Lake, and I should leave as well." Qi Yuan took the Moon Maiden's hand, and their figures disappeared into the vast snow.</p><p></p><p>At the Seven-Month Lake, the shimmering lake water had disappeared. </p><p></p><p>The surface was thick ice, covered in snow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the cold blue stone again, looking at the little girl and slowly said, "Rest for the night, I'll be leaving tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden looked at Qi Yuan in silence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes after speaking.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden looked at Qi Yuan for a while, then turned and went back to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the Seven-Color Peak, Qi Yuan came out of the game.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the thatched hut and went to Jiang Lingsu's house.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister."</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, what's wrong?" Jiang Lingsu seemed to have just finished bathing, and her hair was still a bit damp.</p><p></p><p>"I'm about to start my foundation-building, it will take a short time, three to five days, or a year and a half, or even longer.</p><p></p><p>If anyone comes looking for me during this time, please tell them for me."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Jiang Lingsu was a bit confused, "Does foundation-building really take so much time?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, I'm preparing to cultivate the Heavenly Dao, so naturally it will take longer." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Heavenly Dao? What nonsense.</p><p></p><p>And cultivating the Heavenly Dao shouldn't take this long either.</p><p></p><p>She suspected that her big brother was probably cultivating some secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Her big brother's combat power was so strong, it was probably related to cultivating many powerful secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, don't worry, big brother, I'll keep an eye on things." Jiang Lingsu said, then thought of something and asked, "Big brother, you're cultivating secret techniques, you won't starve to death, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless: "The spirit stones you gave me are still there, how could I possibly starve to death? A true cultivator starving to death would be too embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu felt that her big brother was indeed capable of starving to death.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave a few more instructions, then returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the kitchen knife in the courtyard, bent down, and untied the rope around its neck: "I won't tie you up anymore, while I'm in seclusion, you'll have to watch the house for me."</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife's body seemed to tremble a bit, as if agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the house and set up a few small formations using the array jade slips he had taken from the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>He then re-entered the game.</p><p></p><p>The cold snow fell on his face, and he opened his eyes to see a small, reddened hand carefully brushing the snow off his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Sir... you're awake?" The Moon Maiden saw that Qi Yuan had opened his eyes, and her small hand retracted.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid of waking him up.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan gazed into the distance, a vast expanse of white, and exhaled a white breath.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden beside him suddenly felt much warmer. She looked at Qi Yuan and asked, "Will the sir go to slay the demonic forces from the outside world tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The expression on the Moon Maiden's face froze, and she said, "After tomorrow, I will leave the Moon Emperor Clan. I will cultivate diligently, and I will go help the sir, and together with the sir, slay the demonic forces from the outside world!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't set flags for me, and don't set flags for yourself either." Qi Yuan patted the Moon Maiden's head.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden didn't quite understand, but she nodded and said, "Sir, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>She was going to bring out the fish soup she had made.</p><p></p><p>Before the sir left, she had to let him drink a sip of the fish soup she had made herself.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden said this and hurried back into the hut.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Moon Maiden's retreating figure, then at the ancient Qi Chun tree.</p><p></p><p>The thick snow had piled up on the branches of the Qi Chun tree, filling them.</p><p></p><p>Some branches still had hanging icicles.</p><p></p><p>"The northern scenery, miles of ice-bound rivers, endless snow-swept plains."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but think of these lines, and the poet who wrote them.</p><p></p><p>He also recalled another line.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to sacrifice much, bold enough to change heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the vast world and suddenly murmured, "This world is indeed as beautiful as Jingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>But I'm a player... I don't need to sacrifice to wipe out NPCs."</p><p></p><p>The sound of quick footsteps came, and the Moon Maiden was carrying a steaming bowl of fish soup.</p><p></p><p>She ran with small, quick steps, the sound of crunching snow under her feet.</p><p></p><p>Over the dozens of steps, the aroma of the hot fish soup wafted to her small face.</p><p></p><p>If she were near-sighted and wore glasses, she might not have been able to see the path clearly at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Walk slowly, don't fall." Qi Yuan said without turning around.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden looked at Qi Yuan, holding the full bowl of fish soup.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sharp silver light descended from the sky, a fishing line shot straight towards the Moon Maiden, moving at an incredible speed, as if it was going to reel her in.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden was still holding the bowl, her footsteps lifted off the ground, not even realizing the fishing line in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's sword was still slanted in the snow, and he was still sitting on the blue stone, watching the snowflakes fall and land on his hair.</p><p></p><p>The fishing line was very sharp, piercing through flesh and blood, moving so fast that there was no time for blood to flow out.</p><p></p><p>The bowl in the Moon Maiden's hands fell to the ground with a clang.</p><p></p><p>She stared wide-eyed at the figure next to her, her eyes seemingly about to spill tears.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had one arm wrapped around her waist, and the other hand reached up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The fishing line pierced through his arm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the fishing line and suddenly laughed loudly: "Haha, this dog game, I knew it, at a time like this you'd definitely try to stab me! I was prepared.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, I was enjoying the snow, but in reality, I was vigilant in all directions, just waiting for you to pull out your knife."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Stab me! Hmph, those corpses under the ancient Qi tree have already stabbed me, and you still want to stab me again?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>The sword was drawn, and the power of level 99 was fully unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped pretending, stopped acting.</p><p></p><p>The lackeys have all been eliminated, and now he must formally face the final boss of the game.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword, which had been suppressed all this time, finally revealed its fangs.</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a loud roar.</p><p></p><p>The sword collided with the fishing line.</p><p></p><p>There was no strong impact, but rather a calm one.</p><p></p><p>Crack. The blood and flesh hook that the Five Patriarchs said was indestructible was cut off by Qi Yuan's sword in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fresh blood flowed out of the fishing line.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan suddenly laughed loudly: "Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>He put down the Moon Maiden, and took out a wooden hairpin from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>This was a jade hairpin he had carefully crafted in the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to give it to Jinli as a gift when they met.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he never got the chance.</p><p></p><p>He handed the wooden hairpin to the Moon Maiden: "It's called... 'As I See You', you keep it for me, and give it to..."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to say to a woman named Jinli.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, he didn't know which time period Jinli belonged to.</p><p></p><p>"Put it in a suitable place, everything will be as it should be."</p><p></p><p>He said, sheathing his sword.</p><p></p><p>He held the sword with one hand, and a trickle of blood was dripping from his left hand.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden took the hairpin and carefully hid it.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, as if she had realized something: "Sir... Can I still hold your sword for you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not answer, only the howling of the north wind could be heard.</p><p></p><p>No answer is also an answer.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden looked stubbornly at Qi Yuan, she looked at Qi Yuan's injured arm, as if she had made an important decision.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>She said, then approached Qi Yuan's arm and bit the wound pierced by the fishing line.</p><p></p><p>In that short period of time, even Qi Yuan could not heal the wound, but with the Moon Maiden's saliva, it healed.</p><p></p><p>A crescent moon mark appeared at the original wound site.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden's small face turned deathly pale, and the moon in her eyes also became dim, but her eyes were filled with a radiant smile: "Sir, does it not hurt anymore?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have dispelled some of the cold of winter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the mark on his hand, and thought of Xiaojia.</p><p></p><p>The two were equally sensible, equally heartbreaking in their sensibility.</p><p></p><p>He forced a smile: "It doesn't hurt anymore."</p><p></p><p>With his voice, he disappeared into the vast snow.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Maiden stood in the empty snowy ground, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Earthly Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes and saw a door.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaojia?"</p><p></p><p>He called out.</p><p></p><p>No response.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that slaying the final boss is my task alone.</p><p></p><p>The others cannot come here."</p><p></p><p>When he entered the Earthly Abyss, Qi Yuan felt that he had lost contact with Xiaojia.</p><p></p><p>The mark on his chest had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only on his left hand was a faint crescent moon mark.</p><p></p><p>"It's better this way."</p><p></p><p>Xiaojia was clumsy, stumbling as she walked.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan, with the great sword in his hand, was almost no different from when he first entered the game.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that his level was now 99.</p><p></p><p>His experience pool was filled with a massive amount of experience.</p><p></p><p>But he did not level up.</p><p></p><p>In front of Qi Yuan was a huge bronze gate.</p><p></p><p>The bronze gate, weathered by time, was covered in rust.</p><p></p><p>"Open sesame," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, the bronze gate opened.</p><p></p><p>An empty world appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The world in front of him had no land, no trees, and no clouds.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was in the air.</p><p></p><p>However, above the sky, there was a sun.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Earthly Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stepped into the Earthly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>A thick and cold voice sounded: "Intruder of the Earthly Abyss, you shall be executed!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw a golden-armored man standing in the void of the sky.</p><p></p><p>His face was resolute and well-defined, like a sculpture.</p><p></p><p>His figure was strong and powerful, wearing golden armor, exuding heroic vigor. His eyes were filled with endless majesty.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly God... Golden Armor?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recognized the Heavenly God Golden Armor at a glance.</p><p></p><p>He was the long-awaited husband of the Empress Jiayi, the white moonlight that the Floral Fairy had always sought.</p><p></p><p>He was also the leader of the Four Divisions of the Divine Court, sweeping through the six realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was merely a puppet, a guard at the gate of the Earthly Abyss for the demonic forces from outside.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Heavenly God Golden Armor and took a step forward: "Even though you are Xiaojia's father, my father-in-law, you cannot plagiarize my words.</p><p></p><p>What you just said was copied from the 'Whoever crosses this sword shall be executed' that I taught the Moon Maiden."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Golden Armor looked at Qi Yuan, his tiger eyes devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>He did not speak, but simply took a step forward, approaching Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You don't speak, is it because you want to say that all the words in the world are plagiarized, or that our words all come from the dictionary, so it doesn't count as plagiarism?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually mocked.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Golden Armor approached Qi Yuan and drew his long sword.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you're getting angry and resorting to violence because you can't win the argument! "</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Although Xiaojia and I had a divorce, we're still in the cooling-off period.</p><p>You are Xiaojia's father, so let me personally send you to your liberation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan struck with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Out of respect for Xiaojia's father, he personally drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle.</p><p></p><p>A flash of blood was seen.</p><p></p><p>This former leader of the Divine Court, whose strength was at the peak of the Divine Realm, was beheaded by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Slaying a Divine Realm peak expert with a single sword strike was nothing to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, the Heavenly God Golden Armor he had slain revived and returned to his original form.</p><p></p><p>Unharmed, without a single wound.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Heavenly God Golden Armor, Qi Yuan sighed: "Can't be killed, always reviving.</p><p>I'm afraid Dragon Judgment, Tong, and Yu would have a hard time getting past this level."</p><p></p><p>He swung his sword again, slaying the Heavenly God Golden Armor once more.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly God Golden Armor was unkillable.</p><p>After Qi Yuan had slain him once, he would quickly revive and then attack Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "This is so boring."</p><p></p><p>He kept killing, without stopping.</p><p>After all, it was just a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan drew his sword, he killed, he revived, he killed again, he revived again.</p><p>This continued for fifty or sixty times.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly roared: "Demonic forces from outside, come out quickly, this is too uninteresting.</p><p>You don't want me to keep torturing your puppets, do you? Although they can revive continuously, the one being depleted is your own source, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice echoed through the entire Earthly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This time, the revived Heavenly God Golden Armor did not approach Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Instead, a gentle voice came: "Young friend, come to my cave dwelling, let me brew some tea for you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw a venerable old man with an immortal demeanor appear before him.</p><p></p><p>The old man had white hair and a youthful appearance, looking extremely benevolent.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had encountered him in the Vast Mist Realm, he would have definitely taken him for a cultivated immortal master.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Earthly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This immortal-looking old man gave Qi Yuan a sense that he surpassed even the 119-level Golden Armor God General.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the old man.</p><p></p><p>【Hu Shan, 119 level (in a state of realm collapse)】</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not bother being polite with the old man, but instead drew his sword: "Demonic forces from outside, receive your death!"</p><p></p><p>He used the same sword strike that had slain the Golden Armor God, swinging it towards the old man.</p><p></p><p>But as the sword fell, the old man stood still, his benevolent smile still on his face: "Although I have fallen from the Fifth Realm, I am not someone a cultivator at your Fourth Realm can kill."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this demonic old man with vigilance.</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Was it because the other party's level was higher than his, and his use of power was more exquisite?</p><p>So his strongest sword strike could not even harm the other party? This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he had stunned Qi Yuan with a single move, the old man spoke: "Young friend, you keep calling me a demonic force from outside, but in fact, I am not a demonic force from outside.</p><p>We, along with some fellow Taoists, were invited to this world to save it.</p><p>You seem to have been deceived and blinded by some evil person, mistaking us for demonic forces from outside."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sneered: "Of course, a high-level boss, with all the skill points in deception maxed out."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you still don't believe me, young friend." The old man sighed regretfully, then continued, "Have you been to Kunwu City?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not speak, he was pondering how to slay this demonic old man.</p><p>And he vaguely felt that there must be more than just this one demonic force from outside here.</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look, young friend."</p><p></p><p>The demonic old man said, waving his hand.</p><p></p><p>An image appeared in Qi Yuan's vision.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

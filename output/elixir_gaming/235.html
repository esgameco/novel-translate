        <h1>Chapter 235</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Negotiate peace?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The evil god actually sent a military commander to negotiate peace.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what are the terms of this peace?"</p><p></p><p>For now, his subordinate gods were still absorbing and digesting the God Observation Method.</p><p></p><p>There was no rush for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Commander Wu Kui quickly said, with a very respectful attitude:</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal Heart Realm is a primordial world. Your Excellency should know the extraordinary nature of primordial worlds!"</p><p></p><p>Commander Wu Kui continued:</p><p></p><p>"Primordial worlds are realms formed at the beginning of the universe. </p><p></p><p>The living beings in this realm look human-like, but are actually a different species.</p><p></p><p>They are not human, and their minds are fundamentally different.</p><p></p><p>Your Excellency has awakened memories of your past life as Su Hui, so you are no longer a primordial being. Why entangle yourself with these alien creatures? Humans and primordial beings are natural enemies."</p><p></p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Qi Qi's eyes: "Are you saying we are not human? And you are?"</p><p></p><p>Commander Wu Kui felt an inexplicable chill run down his spine. </p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that if this woman were to attack, he would have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked - was this another mythical being? He had many speculations about the past identity of the Origin Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Definitely a top-tier powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple to distinguish primordial beings from humans and even demons.</p><p></p><p>Primordial beings are born from chaos, with a trace of chaos energy in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>This trace of chaos energy represents infinite possibilities. </p><p></p><p>Because of this chaos energy, primordial beings can transform into demons, monsters, humans, or even evil entities.</p><p></p><p>Such primordial evil demons bring calamity to all living things, and anyone can justly slay them.</p><p></p><p>In the upper realms, we are mortal enemies with primordial evil demons!</p><p></p><p>If you want to determine whether a disguised cultivator is a primordial being, it's very simple.</p><p></p><p>This realm has the God Observation Method. Only primordial beings, possessing a trace of chaos energy, can cultivate the God Observation Method."</p><p></p><p>Commander Wu Kui explained. What he said, taken at face value, was not deceiving Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The primordial beings of primordial worlds represent infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>They may look like humans, demons, or beasts, but will consider themselves human.</p><p></p><p>However, in reality, they are not.</p><p></p><p>Because they possess a trace of chaos energy, primordial beings can cultivate the God Observation Method, rapidly increasing their power. They are also most easily bewitched by some extraterrestrial evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators view primordial beings as heretics, and almost everyone calls for their extermination.</p><p></p><p>After all, it may take tens of thousands of years for a prodigy to break through to the Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>But a primordial being can enter the Yin Spirit realm overnight.</p><p></p><p>Almost all cultivators are extremely jealous and wary of primordial beings.</p><p></p><p>However, regarding primordial worlds, all cultivators have a completely different mindset.</p><p></p><p>Not wariness, but covetousness.</p><p></p><p>This is because primordial worlds are especially unique, able to create countless primordial beings.</p><p></p><p>For mythical beings at the Seven Steps to Heaven, to advance to the Yang Spirit realm, they need to cultivate their subordinate forces.</p><p></p><p>The more Yin Spirits loyal to their divine domain, the greater their potential and strength, and the greater their potential when advancing to Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>So, if one could control a primordial world, a mythical being could rapidly accumulate power, advance to Yang Spirit, and moreover... not just an ordinary Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Primordial worlds are very important for mythical beings, and the same is true for Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Wu Kui didn't know the specific details.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that a complete primordial world could allow a Yang Spirit to advance their realm further.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying thing this was! That's a Yang Spirit! In the hands of a Yang Spirit, ordinary worlds could be destroyed with a wave of their hand.</p><p></p><p>Wu Kui could hardly imagine how difficult it was for such beings to improve.</p><p></p><p>So, the fact that a primordial world could help a Yang Spirit advance further - what a great temptation that was! Moreover, primordial worlds were isolated, not connected to the greater realms. Primordial beings thus could not become Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>The strongest in this realm was just a mythical being, which was indeed a tempting morsel for Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>However, primordial worlds that had long been connected to the greater realms were extremely feared by every Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Who knew what kind of monsters might have grown inside?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Commander Wu Kui's words and listened to part of his inner thoughts, a smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>If only primordial beings could visualize the God Observation Method, then what was he? He could even... visualize the Three Pure Ones!</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency's background is mysterious. You are now trapped at the mythical level because of the primordial world.</p><p></p><p>My lord once said he wishes to befriend Your Excellency and share the primordial world with you.</p><p></p><p>Your Excellency's people can all enter your divine domain, to be taken away by you. With these primordial beings' loyalty, once Your Excellency leaves the Mortal Heart Realm, you can advance to Yang Spirit, and not just an ordinary Yang Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying I can take my people and leave the Mortal Heart Realm now?" Qi Yuan said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>Commander Wu Kui lowered his head and said anxiously: "If Your Excellency agrees to negotiate peace, the people will belong to you, and the primordial world will belong to my lord.</p><p></p><p>Once the princess has completely devoured the Heavenly Dao in the Heavenly Pillar, Your Excellency and your people will be free to leave the Mortal Heart Realm."</p><p></p><p>The terms of this negotiation were simple. Blood Sun Great Saint wanted the primordial world, and the primordial beings could be given to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, she wouldn't let Qi Yuan leave now, because... once Qi Yuan left this realm, he could advance to Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>So, she had to wait until she finished devouring the primordial world before letting him go. As for whether she would really let him go or not, that remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough sincerity," Qi Yuan shook his head. "I want both the people and the land."</p><p></p><p>Commander Wu Kui's body trembled slightly: "Your Excellency's demand is too overbearing."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mortal Heart Realm, there were two Yang Spirits stationed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how mysterious the Origin Celestial Lord's past identity was, he was currently stuck at the Seven Steps to Heaven and couldn't possibly advance to Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"My demands are not high at all," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His task was to protect Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>How could he lose the land? Most importantly, he had already gone to war with the Evil God.</p><p></p><p>He had killed so many of the Evil God's people.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe the Evil God was truly so kind-hearted as to let him go.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan considered himself a gentleman, but even as a gentleman, after being coerced and schemed against by the Black Mountain Sect, he could not forgive them. Instead, he bravely drew his kitchen knife and destroyed the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Evil God was not a gentleman, and his thoughts were surely narrow-minded. After killing so many of the Evil God's people, they were now outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, preparing to settle accounts with him.</p><p></p><p>"In war between two armies, envoys are not killed. Go back and tell your master this. Making peace is simple. Giving them the land of the Mortal Realm is not impossible, but I have one condition," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Kui thought the Origin Venerable One was softening his stance.</p><p></p><p>Earlier talk of keeping both people and land was just to scare him.</p><p></p><p>It was like saying you'd tear off the roof when you just wanted to open a window.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable One was simply trying to gain greater benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Please state your condition, Venerable One. I will faithfully relay it to my lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Your lord, and all the evil gods, must apologize to me, soothe my wounded spirit, and then all commit suicide to atone for their crimes. If you all die, I can give you the Mortal Realm as your burial ground. You see... the land goes to you, the people stay with me... isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was truly a genius.</p><p></p><p>He had quickly come up with a solution both sides could easily accept, and one that left him without worries.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat broke out on Wu Kui's forehead.</p><p></p><p>All commit suicide to atone?</p><p></p><p>This Origin Venerable One... how dare he think such a thing!</p><p></p><p>This wasn't negotiating peace at all, it was pure provocation! But even so, he dared not argue or curse, and instead said with difficulty: "I will faithfully relay these words to my lord."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled broadly: "No wonder the great ones say solutions are reached through discussion. This solution now is simply perfect. Hurry back and tell your lords honestly. I'm sure they are very excited right now. When they hear my perfect proposal, they won't be able to help but applaud."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, General Wu Kui didn't dare say more. He merely forced a smile, took his leave, and silently departed.</p><p></p><p>He dared not stay any longer.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Qi Qi stepped forward and said, her eyes filled with confusion: "Godfather, why didn't you pretend to agree to their peace terms first, to buy some time?"</p><p></p><p>For Qi Qi now, what all the people of the Mortal Realm needed most was time.</p><p></p><p>Given enough time, the 4,000 Yin spirits under her godfather could all grow to a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>At that point, when they turned against the Evil God, their chances would be much greater.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I pretend to agree? Didn't I already propose conditions?" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He had already put forward new terms for peace, and the content was very comprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi was speechless.</p><p></p><p>These were conditions?</p><p></p><p>Who negotiates like this?</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, there's no way they could possibly agree to the conditions you proposed."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao has fifty, Heaven has forty-nine, one is hidden. Nothing in this world is absolute. What if their lord was kicked by a donkey and agreed to my peace terms? An ancient once said, 'Do not neglect small good deeds, do not commit small evil deeds.' So no matter how small the probability, we can't give up. What if it happens?" Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>He felt that after contemplating the Three Pure Ones, his mind was sharper and his speech more logical.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, it was the supreme truth of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi fell silent, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>News of the Evil God sending an envoy to negotiate peace quickly spread throughout Flying Wu City.</p><p></p><p>The content of the talks between the Venerable One and the Evil God's general also spread, reaching the ears of many common people and ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>These people and cultivators had various thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The mythical plan we've been striving for is not even as good as the peace terms offered by the Evil God!"</p><p></p><p>"If the Venerable One agrees, ten billion people in the Mortal Realm could live!"</p><p></p><p>"The mythical plan... how many people could survive?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan, who had contemplated Erlang Shen for the second time, was not surprised to hear Qi Yuan's response.</p><p></p><p>"A Venerable One who refuses is a true Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the headless Great Venerable Ling Zhong opened his eyes on his chest, looking especially solemn.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flashed with infinitely complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and Great Venerable Ling Zhong stood below Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Origin Venerable One and slowly spoke: "Venerable One... before the Heavenly Pillar broke, the Holy Mother of No Food said that in the future, if someone could save the Mortal Realm, this item should be given to him."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who had been resting with his eyes closed, opened them. His eyes revealed a trace of surprise.</p><p></p><p>He remembered Wu Shi curled up sleeping by the pond holding a big fish, and also the Holy Mother of No Food he saw under the Heavenly Pillar... with her complex and strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>A special storage bag appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Ling Zhong's figure vanished, leaving only Qi Yuan alone in the entire courtyard.</p><p></p><p>With a touch of nostalgia and curiosity, Qi Yuan opened the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Immediately... a faint fragrance wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Stored in the bag were... various fish dishes, spicy, grilled fish, sour soup fish.</p><p></p><p>These fish, by their appearance, were what Qi Yuan had made the second time he saw her.</p><p></p><p>She... hadn't eaten them? He couldn't help but recall Wu Shi by the pond, holding a half-eaten fish and asking him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you... want some?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

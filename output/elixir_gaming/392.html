        <h1>Chapter 392</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This door is the foremost among treasures, sought after by countless Yang Immortals."</p><p></p><p>Even with Great Wisdom True Lord's brilliant mind, he did not know where to find the Door of Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the Door of Ultimate Truth was truly difficult to locate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned. The Door of Ultimate Truth that Great Wisdom True Lord spoke of was likely the Door of Myriad Differences that Qi Yuan had encountered in the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>When comprehending the Door of Myriad Differences, Qi Yuan had seen its hidden information.</p><p></p><p>It could be any door.</p><p></p><p>So the Door of Ultimate Truth was perhaps just a role it was cosplaying.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen it in a game," Qi Yuan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"A game?" Great Wisdom True Lord was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. Do you think if I enter that game again, it won't respawn as a game item? No, it's possible it's still there!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clearly remembered the end of the game.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ze was manipulated by the Fate Tablet, and the Golden Lotus of the Great Sun incinerated everything.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lotus of the Great Sun was a relic left behind when the Buddha of Great Sun and Radiance entered nirvana.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha of Great Sun and Radiance was a Yang Immortal level powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lotus he left behind, once it started burning, was enough to completely incinerate the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was Qi Yuan who swallowed the Golden Lotus. He used a game reward to create the Key of Myriad Differences to open the Door of Myriad Differences, taking the golden canary with him as he left the Flowing Wind Realm for an unknown universe.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord pondered: "Can game items become real?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... Well, isn't the real world just a large-scale game? Maybe the world we're in now is just a massive online game!</p><p></p><p>We play games in game jade slips, but actually, our world is also a big jade slip!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord clutched his head: "Stop, I feel like my brain is about to grow out!"</p><p></p><p>This "growing out" meant breaking through the limits of the skull and extending outwards.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, for smart people like us, we can't think too deeply, otherwise this carbon-based human body can't handle it!" Qi Yuan agreed with Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>It's like on the Blue Star, when you start pondering about the universe, galaxies, black holes, your brain starts to grow.</p><p></p><p>"So can you go back to the game?" Great Wisdom True Lord asked several questions in succession, "If you see the Door of Ultimate Truth, can you control it? Legend has it that the Door of Ultimate Truth has appeared many times over countless eons, but no Yang Immortal has been able to claim it.</p><p></p><p>After all, there's a rumor that obtaining the Door of Ultimate Truth allows one to become the supreme ruler of the upper realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ultimate Truth was said to be the foremost among treasures.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate truths comprehended by Yang Immortals of the Ultimate Truth realm would all leave their mark on the Door of Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>If one obtained the Door of Ultimate Truth, wouldn't they be able to comprehend the paths of ultimate truth of all Yang Immortals?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all Yang Immortals rated the Door of Ultimate Truth as the foremost treasure, each wanting to claim it for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't obtain it, they wanted to destroy it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if another Yang Immortal obtained it and spent tens of thousands of years comprehending one's own ultimate truth, it would be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>"What Door of Ultimate Truth? Isn't it just the door to my Netherworld?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan realized he was truly a genius among geniuses.</p><p></p><p>It's like how when girls are together, if one gets her period, it affects the others who also start menstruating.</p><p></p><p>Being with Great Wisdom True Lord, as his clever mind turned, Qi Yuan was also influenced, his thoughts flowing smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Conveniently, the Netherworld had no door.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ultimate Truth, which was also the Door of Myriad Differences, could be any door, right? So why couldn't it be the door to his own Netherworld? It said itself it could be any door, that was the evidence.</p><p></p><p>Just treat the Door of Myriad Differences as the Netherworld door, then sprinkle some purple qi.</p><p></p><p>That scene would surely attract Yang Immortals like fish crossing a river.</p><p></p><p>If one wanted to ambush enemies, the simplest way would be to place the Door of Ultimate Truth at their doorstep.</p><p></p><p>That Yang Immortal would look and think, "Wow, purple qi and the Door of Ultimate Truth, what a windfall!"</p><p></p><p>They'd rush in.</p><p></p><p>Good heavens, gloomy yin energy, it's the Netherworld? Qi Yuan could even make the place the Door of Ultimate Truth led to his universe with the suns.</p><p></p><p>At that time, all the Golden Core suns could bombard them together!</p><p></p><p>That scene would surely be delightful.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, isn't that a bit exaggerated?" Great Wisdom True Lord doubted Qi Yuan's intelligence for the first time.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the Door of Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"What you say actually makes sense. As long as you capture them, it can be the Netherworld door.</p><p></p><p>The biggest challenge is... how to capture them!"</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ultimate Truth had existed for so many years, appearing in the upper realm many times.</p><p></p><p>There were so many powerful beings in the upper realm, but none had been able to capture it.</p><p></p><p>"Why capture it? It is my door!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He had the Key of Myriad Differences, wasn't that proof that the Door of Myriad Differences was his?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, it was originally my home, just a bit mischievous and ran away from home." Qi Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>He was starting to believe what he was saying himself.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan suspiciously: "It's really your home's door?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"When can I visit your home?" Great Wisdom True Lord asked.</p><p></p><p>"My home is still being renovated, ahem, wait a while." Qi Yuan said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>His home's main door was often open, the door had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Could you also be a supreme treasure?"</p><p></p><p>In the room, Qi Yuan took out the game jade slip and examined it carefully.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head: "A broken game console, how could it be a supreme treasure."</p><p></p><p>If a game console was a supreme treasure, then the prestige of supreme treasures would be too low.</p><p></p><p>According to the Strange Painter and Great Wisdom True Lord, the value of a supreme treasure was no less than that of a Yang Immortal of the Ultimate Truth realm.</p><p></p><p>Yang Immortals of the lower three heavens, upon obtaining a supreme treasure, could even bring their holy land to ascend to the middle three heavens.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's imagination, a supreme treasure should have a halo, room for imagination.</p><p></p><p>Just like the fairies of the upper realm must not fart or defecate.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the game jade slip, Qi Yuan's eyes held a trace of complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>The game icon for the Flowing Wind Realm had already grayed out.</p><p></p><p>This meant he had completed the game and could no longer enter the Flowing Wind Realm through the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I can only search like a needle in a haystack."</p><p></p><p>There was actually another way to find the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>That was to use the stars that illuminated all realms, patrol all realms, and let the light shine everywhere in this realm.</p><p></p><p>Unlike now, where Qi Yuan's Golden Core projection was actually limited to the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were no ten suns in other worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, this action by Qi Yuan could be seen as a provocation from a certain perspective.</p><p></p><p>After all, the stars that illuminated all realms had already established rules.</p><p></p><p>The great sun was the great sun, the moon was the moon, the charm was the charm.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan's ten suns illuminated all realms, and they were all suns.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? Challenging the great sun?</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>He now understood that the great sun was that person from the Palace of Supreme Radiance, the one behind the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>They were about to clash anyway, so what did it matter to provoke first?</p><p></p><p>Of course, illuminating all realms didn't mean he could find the coordinates of all worlds.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite was that a Yang Immortal had been to that world before.</p><p></p><p>"The people of all realms are blessed!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten more suns in the sky, ten more blessings!"</p><p></p><p>"It might get too hot, the number of risqué men and women in the world might increase, which is good for reproduction</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Propagate!"</p><p></p><p>"For the Heavenly Way, isn't propagation what it loves most?"</p><p></p><p>"Refuse to stigmatize borderline content!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan raised his gaze to look at the stars in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>He saw an inconspicuous, slightly dim star.</p><p></p><p>A gentle look flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing, Yu Mengxian from the upper realm had marked out the star of the Moon Maiden.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, I'll reflect across the myriad realms, and take the chance to see Jinli's star.</p><p></p><p>The only regret is that I have too few stars, only ten, not nearly enough to form words and patterns like drones can."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Goldfinch appeared beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>By now, Qi Yuan could summon the Goldfinch and Ning Tao at any time and place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Goldfinch wore a goose-yellow skirt, looking adorable: "Hehe, finally we can go back to see Jiupan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao is on the Golden Core, helping you find the Flowing Wind Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"You're the same person, why do you still call her by her full name?" Qi Yuan asked with a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>Past self, present self, to be honest they were still one person.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if not deliberately separated, the two would even share the same sensations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after splitting into past and present selves, the past self retained the appearance of the Goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>The Goldfinch didn't answer, but instead asked: "Do you like me more, or Ning Tao more?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed helplessly: "You might as well ask if my mother and you fell into the river, who I would save first!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't bother you anymore, hurry and reflect across the myriad realms, this young lady and Ning Tao will help you together." The Goldfinch said, her little face also turning serious.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Qi Yuan's expression also became unusually solemn.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting across the myriad realms was no small matter.</p><p></p><p>It meant that a Yang Spirit who had raised their divine throne had been born! Raising the divine throne and not raising it were two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Streams of light flashed by one after another, falling into a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>That mountain peak was covered in flames everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Even the trees seemed to be grown from flames.</p><p></p><p>Fire trees, fire grass, fire fruits, fire birds.</p><p></p><p>Within the mountain, celestial music lingered.</p><p></p><p>A man in golden robes sat in the main seat, his gaze profound. He looked at the nearly hundred mythical powerhouses reflecting across the realms below, a hint of smugness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, this Taihuang meeting has some interesting things."</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man was one of the mythical figures of Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Excluding all the Yang Spirits of Taihuang Palace, among the remaining mythical figures, he ranked in the top ten.</p><p></p><p>Yang Spirits rarely appeared in the world.</p><p></p><p>These Taihuang meetings to connect with other major forces were held by mythical figures like them.</p><p></p><p>These mythical figures were no ordinary ones, they all reflected across the realms, almost representing a major force.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what good news?" The mythical figure from the Moluo clan spoke up, a smile in his eyes, "Could it be that a Yang Spirit from the Moon God Palace was killed?"</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan, like Taihuang Palace, was at odds with the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that this grudge originated from a small world in the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan had directly declared war on the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Taihuang Palace and the Moon God Palace were also in a constant state of war.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yang Spirit forces behind the other mythical figures present, most had deep connections with Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>When Taihuang Palace fought with the Moon God Palace, the forces behind them didn't engage directly, but rather... provided resource support.</p><p></p><p>"Not that." The golden-robed man's eyes held a smug look, "It's much bigger than that!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the one from Moon God Palace has fallen?" Suddenly, a mythical figure exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The other mythical figures heard this and all gave him an exasperated look.</p><p></p><p>The moon in the sky was still there! How could it have fallen? More importantly, how could a powerhouse of that level easily fall?</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man also gave that mythical figure a sidelong glance, feeling somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the news he was about to announce was indeed significant, but compared to that one falling, it was certainly far less impactful.</p><p></p><p>Now that this had been brought up, everyone's expectations had risen.</p><p></p><p>His announcement now wouldn't be as explosive.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, that one has not fallen, but the Heavenly Venerable once said that that one... has suffered no light injuries!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man announced, sitting on a chair burning with flames.</p><p></p><p>"What, He... was injured?" </p><p></p><p>The mythical figures present were also shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, beings of that level rarely appeared in the world, and naturally wouldn't be easily injured.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that even if an ordinary Yang Spirit died in battle, it wouldn't have as big an impact on the Moon God Palace as that being getting injured.</p><p></p><p>"How that one was injured is confidential, I cannot know.</p><p></p><p>But the news is absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>Taihuang Palace and Moon God Palace have been at war for a million years, and now Taihuang Palace has the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>That one... has even been wounded.</p><p></p><p>So you all can consider allying with our Taihuang Palace to jointly attack the Moon God Palace!</p><p></p><p>Of course, you can pass this information to your Heavenly Venerables!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man said smugly.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of holding the Taihuang meeting was to unite with other forces, obtain resources, and besiege the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it was to get the Yang Spirits behind these forces to join the fray and truly get involved.</p><p></p><p>Now, with that one from Moon God Palace injured, it was precisely the best opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"That one possesses a Creation Treasure, yet could still be injured!" A mythical figure exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Creation Treasure, also known as Supreme Treasure in the words of the Strange Painter.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of these mythical figures, Taihuang Palace and Moon God Palace fighting for so many years was just child's play.</p><p></p><p>Taihuang Palace had a Creation Treasure, and Moon God Palace also had one, so the two sides could never truly decide a victor.</p><p></p><p>But now, the one possessing a Creation Treasure was actually injured.</p><p></p><p>The implications behind this were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"How that one was injured, we naturally don't know, but the news is absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>Now is precisely when we should unite closely.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerables behind you all should also join the fray.</p><p></p><p>If not going to the core areas of Moon God Palace, the peripheral areas... are also accessible."</p><p></p><p>The golden-robed man said smugly.</p><p></p><p>The mythical figures present all started breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The territory of Moon God Palace was vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>If that one from Moon God Palace was truly injured, the Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables behind them might really join in to get a piece of the pie.</p><p></p><p>"This humble one will report this matter truthfully to the Heavenly Venerable. If it's true, hehe, it seems we should look out for each other!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about the core areas, our Taihuang Palace will be at the forefront. You just need to take action in the peripheral areas!" The golden-robed man said happily.</p><p></p><p>With this news spread, this Taihuang meeting would have a high probability of success.</p><p></p><p>If successful, Taihuang Palace would gain considerable assistance.</p><p></p><p>Moon God Palace would also face a siege, and then... the situation would change dramatically.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, suddenly, the mythical figure who had said that the one from Moon God Palace had fallen spoke up again.</p><p></p><p>"Why does it feel like it's gotten hotter?"</p><p></p><p>"This is Taihuang Palace, it's normal for it to be a bit hot." Another mythical figure said.</p><p></p><p>"It's just... it seems too hot, oh my... what's that in the sky?" This old man suddenly looked up at the heavens, his beard quivering, a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

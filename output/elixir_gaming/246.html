        <h1>Chapter 246</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Famous spirit infant cultivators from the Great Shang Kingdom all came.</p><p></p><p>After all, the invitation sent by the Divine Light Sect was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>A spirit infant cultivator approaching 20 years old was extremely rare in Great Shang, or even among the hundred kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that even in the Eastern Lands, there had never been such a young spirit infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan of Seven-Colored Peak breaking through to spirit infant, these spirit infant lords all had doubts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a group of spirit infant lords gathered, discussing amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>Monk Wudian sat on a golden chair, his arm resting on the golden lotus of the chair, his big feet stretched out, with no proper sitting posture. He said in a muffled voice, "What do you all think, is Qi Yuan of Seven-Colored Peak breaking through to spirit infant true or false?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's true, I don't believe he broke through at the age of 20. Perhaps it's some old monster who has taken over his body!" Tea Language True Lord said with narrowed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Her realm was mid-stage spirit infant, and she was also an independent cultivator, the strongest among independent cultivators in Great Shang after the death of the Black Chicken Old Monster.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through to spirit infant at 20 is indeed hard to believe, but if there were some great opportunities or treasures, it's not impossible," said Mad Sword True Lord, the sect leader of Floating Mountain.</p><p></p><p>As the leader of one of the three major sects, when he spoke, the spirit infant cultivators present all nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I heard a Purple Mansion cultivator died in the Divine Light Sect. Perhaps Qi Yuan's breakthrough... is related to this," Monk Wudian said again.</p><p></p><p>The spirit infant lords present all changed expression slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues for several more paragraphs, describing the discussions and speculations among the cultivators about Qi Yuan's background and abilities.]</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen stretched out his hand, holding a translucent jade porcelain bottle.</p><p></p><p>The bottle clearly contained seven pills.</p><p></p><p>All the Shenying True Lords were shocked when they saw those pills.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Essence Spirit Nourishing Pills, it's actually the legendary Seven Essence Spirit Nourishing Pills!"</p><p></p><p>"It really is this pill, the pill's aura is unmistakable, it's not fake!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Essence Spirit Nourishing Pills could nourish the souls of Shenying cultivators. </p><p></p><p>For late-stage Shenying cultivators, taking it could strengthen their souls to the peak Shenying realm, allowing them to break through to the Zifu realm.</p><p></p><p>This pill could increase a Shenying cultivator's soul strength, and also increase their chances of breaking through to Zifu by 30%.</p><p></p><p>So, which of the Shenying cultivators present wouldn't be tempted?</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen, is this true?" Monk Wudian was the first to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. I look forward to someone being able to... defeat me!" Under the black robe, Shen Wushen's fighting spirit was high.</p><p></p><p>The other Shenying cultivators, hearing this, no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"This old woman coming forward may be bullying you youngster. But for the sake of the pills, this old woman will be a bit thick-skinned and join forces with the others, what of it?" Tea Language True Lord was also eager to try.</p><p></p><p>The sect master of Floating Mountain laughed heartily: "This old man will also join in the fun."</p><p></p><p>At other times, they would still care about face. </p><p></p><p>But with someone offering pills, they naturally wouldn't stand on ceremony.</p><p></p><p>They were very confident in their own strength.</p><p></p><p>Even if Shenying cultivators from other great regions came, they would dare to fight, let alone Shen Wushen who was overestimating himself by challenging over thirty Shenying cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>All the Shenying cultivators were eager to try, even the few from Shenguang Sect were the same.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a crisp voice came.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't given a gift yet?" The gate attendant Jiang Lingsu, dressed in a cyan immortal dress, spoke up, interrupting the exchange between all the Shenying cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>The Shenying True Lords present looked at Jiang Lingsu, slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>A mere... gate attendant, how could she be so bold?</p><p></p><p>A trace of anger appeared in Shen Zhifeng's eyes, and she was about to rebuke her.</p><p></p><p>But then Shen Wushen spoke: "This is indeed an oversight on my part."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, one of the Seven Essence Spirit Nourishing Pills flew out of the porcelain bottle, and amidst exclamations of surprise, landed in front of Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Let this pill serve as a congratulatory gift," said Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was slightly stunned, and quickly put away the pill, beaming with joy.</p><p></p><p>This pill would be of great use to her senior brother, so she would keep it safe.</p><p></p><p>After all, even her Jiang family would find it difficult to produce such a precious pill.</p><p></p><p>She was delighted in her heart, as if she had obtained the pill herself.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Shenying cultivators present, led by Kumo True Lord, headed towards the nearby arena.</p><p></p><p>The arena was extremely sturdy, even Shenying True Lords couldn't easily damage it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Now, Shen Wushen looked at the thirty-three Shenying cultivators in front of him, his eyes full of fighting spirit and a hint of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>No matter who the opponent was, he would take them seriously, even if they were merely at the Yuandan stage.</p><p></p><p>This was Shen Wushen's way of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Fight!" Shen Wushen shouted.</p><p></p><p>The previously quiet Shen Wushen, with this shout, seemed to have his bloodline awakened.</p><p></p><p>His entire body's aura suddenly became ten times stronger in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Shenying cultivators' expressions all changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>They felt as if they were not facing a Shenying cultivator, but a war god!</p><p></p><p>"Quickly summon your Shenying!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't hold back on your divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three Shenying True Lords didn't hesitate at all, no one held back at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Seven Essence Spirit Nourishing Pills would be beyond their reach.</p><p></p><p>"Gale Slash Autumn Water!" Crazy Sword True Lord shouted.</p><p></p><p>A giant sword appeared out of thin air, as the sect master of Floating Mountain used his strongest divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Weak, too weak." Shen Wushen's speed was extremely fast, even the Shenying cultivators present couldn't see his figure.</p><p></p><p>He reached out with his fingers, pinching the giant sword formed by the divine ability, and lightly flicked his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Snap! The terrifying divine ability immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Before Crazy Sword True Lord could react, he felt a huge force hit him, and he was immediately sent flying out, eliminated from the arena.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Shenying cultivators were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Completely outmatched!"</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a monster!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Wushen was like a fish in water, charging straight through.</p><p></p><p>Not a single Shenying cultivator was a match for him even for one exchange.</p><p></p><p>Whoever he touched was easily knocked out of the arena.</p><p></p><p>Their proud divine abilities had no effect at all in front of Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was like a ghost, weaving through the more than thirty Shenying cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Every few breaths, another Shenying cultivator would be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>The battle was particularly shocking.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the other disciples and elders, it was like watching various dazzling techniques, followed by Shenying cultivators being eliminated.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators who saw this scene were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this still a Shenying cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Even a Zifu cultivator might not be this strong!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present looked at Shen Wushen as if they were watching a god descend to earth.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Wushen was truly too powerful.</p><p></p><p>One against thirty, crushing them!</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Jiang Lingsu bit her lower lip, frowning: "How annoying, this person has no emotional intelligence. Today is clearly senior brother's Shenying ceremony, yet he's stolen all the limelight!"</p><p></p><p>This low mutter also woke Jiang Ran from her shock.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Jiang Lingsu, feeling... incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Is now... the time to worry about the limelight?</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't they be considering... the danger of the Demon Desire Sect?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Demon Desire Sect had always been at odds with the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Demon Desire Sect had produced such an unparalleled Shenying cultivator, all the Divine Light Sect disciples sensed a hint of threat.</p><p></p><p>"Too weak, too weak."</p><p></p><p>A hundred breaths of time passed, and on the arena, Shen Wushen stood alone proudly.</p><p></p><p>All the Shenying cultivators had been forced out of the arena by him.</p><p></p><p>In just a hundred breaths of time, one against thirty-three, a complete victory!</p><p></p><p>Disappointment flashed in Shen Wushen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Such a battle was truly uninteresting, merely a warm-up.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three Shenying cultivators defeated by Shen Wushen all had unpleasant expressions.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the arrogant Shen Wushen, they had been utterly defeated and didn't dare to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Zhifeng thought of something and couldn't help but say proudly: "My young master is truly... the number one Shenying in the Cang Lan Realm!</p><p></p><p>If young master were to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking, he would definitely be number one!"</p><p></p><p>If Shen Zhifeng had said this earlier, the Shenying cultivators present would definitely not have believed it.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the overwhelming power Shen Wushen had displayed, he was no less than a Zifu cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If he were to participate in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking, he would definitely be number one.</p><p></p><p>"Kang Fulu, you're listed in the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking. If this Daoist friend were to participate, could he get first place?" Monk Wudian asked at this time.</p><p></p><p>If they had lost to the number one prodigy of the Eastern Land, it would still be somewhat face-saving for them.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu fell silent for a moment, not expecting to be dragged into this.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the Eastern Land Prodigy Battle, then said: "Those prodigies are far inferior to Shen Wushen!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even someone like Great Wisdom True Lord, who was in the top ten of the Eastern Land Prodigy Ranking, didn't have such overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Zhifeng's face showed a proud smile: "Young master should be the number one Shenying in the Cang Lan Realm!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

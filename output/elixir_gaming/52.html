        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the imperial city, Qin Yí was covered in fresh blood. </p><p></p><p>The terror in her eyes had not yet subsided, but she was now frantically running into the city.</p><p></p><p>However, the two presences behind her had not given chase, but had instead gone into hiding.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Qin Yí's sense of panic had not dissipated.</p><p></p><p>She quickly entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yí, what happened to you?" Seeing Qin Yí covered in blood, Jinli was horrified.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Prefect Yu and the Sage Kongqi, who were overseeing the progress of the sacrificial altar, also hurried over, clearly noticing Qin Yí's dire condition. </p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Qin Yí's severe injuries, both their eyes reflected worry and despair.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, they had not only been constructing the sacrificial altar, but had also been secretly plotting with Qin Yí, trying to see if they could send Empress Jinli out of the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, Qin Yí had secretly gone out of the city, just to test the waters.</p><p></p><p>But they never expected that Qin Yí would return so grievously wounded.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." Qin Yí coughed, spitting out a mouthful of blood, which seemed to contain shredded organ tissue.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jinli quickly brought the healing medicine that the Flower Immortal had provided and fed it to Qin Yí.</p><p></p><p>After taking the medicine, Qin Yí's complexion improved somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yí, are you feeling better?" Jinli asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm better, thank you for your concern, Your Majesty," Qin Yí said solemnly, looking at the group. "Just now, when I was preparing to leave the city, I encountered an ambush by two imperial cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"What, two?"</p><p></p><p>"If it had only been two, I would not have been injured so severely. There were actually several of them lying in wait. And the most important thing is, they were not human, they were demons! Outside the imperial city, they have already set up a grand formation!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí spoke at an extremely rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the faces of all present changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Kongqi's beard trembled: "Demons? A grand formation?"</p><p></p><p>"Beyond this formation, the sky is filled with a bloody light, and there are three thousand white banners, which I suspect is the Rite of Entombing Spirits!" As Qin Yí mentioned this, those present all felt unsteady on their feet. The Rite of Entombing Spirits was infamous for its cruelty.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years ago, a small neighboring country had been invaded by demonic beasts and had the Rite of Entombing Spirits set up, burning tens of thousands of its people alive.</p><p></p><p>Because of that incident, the human nations of the Waning Moon Continent were enraged and formed an alliance army to battle the demons. The result was a devastating blow to their strength.</p><p></p><p>It was also due to this that the imperial power of the Southern Qin Kingdom had gradually declined.</p><p></p><p>Now, hearing Qin Yí say that there is the Rite of Entombing Spirits outside the imperial city, how could they not be filled with dread?</p><p></p><p>"You're sure you didn't see wrong?" Prefect Yu asked Qin Yí in a low voice. The others also looked at Qin Yí anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yí said, "I didn't see wrong, that is indeed the Rite of Entombing Spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Kongqi, upon hearing this, sat down on the ground in a daze, then suddenly stood up: "I must go and ask Sima Ting what he is trying to do!"</p><p></p><p>Jinli, upon hearing this news, also felt a sense of fear. She had originally thought that Sima Ting only wanted to usurp the throne, and as long as she and those behind her were safe.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems that Sima Ting harbors sinister intentions, wanting to destroy the entire Southern Qin Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>But so many demons, and even imperial cultivators, have entered the Southern Qin. Doesn't the Heavenly Dao Sect know about this?</p><p></p><p>Jinli felt a chill in her heart, realizing that this matter was far more complex than she had imagined.</p><p></p><p>However, she looked at the sacrificial altar that was about to be completed, her eyes gleaming with determination: "Set this matter aside for now, let us first complete the sacrificial altar!"</p><p></p><p>Her voice was firm, brooking no argument.</p><p></p><p>The originally dispirited Kongqi also stood up: "As you command."</p><p></p><p>But his spirit was completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Jinli returned to her bedchamber, standing alone and looking through the window at the ancient Qi tree in the sky, tightly gripping the Linglong Jade Shard.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, if it were you, how would you handle this?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Prime Minister's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting lowered his head, looking extremely obsequious.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed lords, if that person is not eliminated, he may expose the matters of the great formation, affecting the grand plans of you lords."</p><p></p><p>The thin imperial master of the Heavenly Destiny Sect smiled without speaking.</p><p></p><p>The demonic clan's imperial master cared little: "The formation is already established, so let it be exposed. </p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the city will even benefit the progress of refining the bloodless imperial scepter!"</p><p></p><p>"But... if they publicize it, there may be changes and incite a mutiny among the soldiers in the city!" Sima Ting still had some concerns.</p><p></p><p>"Sima Ting, are you unable to control your own soldiers?" The demonic beast imperial master mocked.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting broke out in cold sweat: "If the matter is leaked, I will find a reason to appease the soldiers' hearts."</p><p></p><p>Now, the entire imperial city is in his hands, so appeasing the soldiers' hearts would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the day after tomorrow at noon, your Empress will ascend the sacrificial platform to make offerings to the heavens?" The demonic clan's imperial master changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Sima Ting replied.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have nothing to do, I'll go take a look.</p><p></p><p>See if my future wine vessel is beautiful enough." The demonic clan's imperial master laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>"I'll make the arrangements right away." Sima Ting originally had no plans to go, but since the demonic clan's imperial master wanted to go, he had to bring the civil and military officials along.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The demonic clan's imperial master nodded in satisfaction, a profound look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was not going to the sacrificial platform just to see his wine vessel.</p><p></p><p>On that day, the civil and military officials will gather, and he will unleash a massacre.</p><p></p><p>With the turbulence of blood and qi, the hearts of the people will be filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>The entire imperial city will be plunged into turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Blood, slaughter, fear, and desire will converge, and the bloodless imperial scepter will become even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not tell Sima Ting these words.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial platform was over 20 feet high, with a pavilion on top, and four small animal sculptures at each corner.</p><p></p><p>The entire sacrificial platform gave a sense of antiquity and simplicity, filled with a primitive and rugged atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, it appeared vast and weighty.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of its simplicity, the construction of the sacrificial platform did not take much time.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting sat in his position, and the demonic clan's imperial master sat beside him, with no proper posture.</p><p></p><p>Sima Riyue's hair was not tied, making him look even more unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, a group of civil and military officials whispered to each other.</p><p></p><p>Some looked at Sima Ting with a questioning gaze, while others looked at the demonic clan's imperial master, with a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, Lady Qin had already revealed the news about the great formation.</p><p></p><p>However, most people felt that it was just Empress Jinli's scheme to divide them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, among them, there was no one with the power of an imperial-level expert who could detect the "Coffin Soul Entering Pennant Formation."</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>With a shout, Empress Jinli appeared in the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>She wore a golden robe with wide sleeves, the sleeves embroidered with golden phoenix birds, a white jade necklace around her neck, golden flowers adorning it, a delicate jade belt at her waist, and a pearl phoenix crown on her head.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she truly embodied the graceful and majestic bearing of an empress.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, apart from the Minister of Rites and a few others, practically no one paid her any respects.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the army had entered the imperial city, and Sima Ting's faction no longer bothered with such pretenses.</p><p></p><p>Sima Riyue, seeing this scene, was quite pleased, and he leaned close to Sima Ting's ear, his voice not low: "Father, if you had done this earlier, your son would have been the Crown Prince."</p><p></p><p>Many of the civil and military officials heard this and all broke into smiles.</p><p></p><p>Jinli heard this but did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"The auspicious time has arrived, please make offerings to the heavens!" Kong Qi stood upright, his voice thick, as if this sacrifice would witness the downfall of a dynasty.</p>

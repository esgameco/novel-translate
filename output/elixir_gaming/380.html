        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here's my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... Sorry, that's not right, let me try again... Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out an awkward laugh.</p><p></p><p>He was also at a loss for words, wanting to open up Thunder God Lao Deng's skull to see what was inside his brain. How could he, Qi Yuan, a mere weak and helpless divine infant cultivator, be compared to an omniscient and omnipotent god?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, this was an accident. Thunder God Lao Deng is my close friend. I saved his life before, so it's normal for him to trust me."</p><p></p><p>The martial lords looked at Qi Yuan with disbelief in their eyes. </p><p></p><p>Among them, Black Deer Martial Lord's eyes held a cold look.</p><p></p><p>"I think he's the one who's been brainwashed by you, Heavenly Venerable. Even an omniscient and omnipotent god can't do what you've done, so how can you achieve it?"</p><p></p><p>Many martial lords stepped forward and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Does saving someone's life allow you to disregard facts?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan could barely keep his composure.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, aren't you all being a bit hypocritical? Why can the East Monarch do things that even an omniscient and omnipotent god can't do, but I can't?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although he was indeed not as capable as an omniscient and omnipotent god.</p><p></p><p>But this East Monarch didn't seem to be an omniscient and omnipotent god either.</p><p></p><p>How could he be inferior to the East Monarch? Qi Yuan's words left the martial lords present somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>But soon after, a female titled martial lord said: "Heavenly Venerable, your strength is indeed great, but the East Monarch... is a special existence. We can only save this world by following his instructions."</p><p></p><p>The other martial lords all agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, your strength is great and can force us to bow our heads, but it cannot change our minds!"</p><p></p><p>These people still stood firmly on the East Monarch's side.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else, they might have become agitated long ago.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"What if I told you that the East Monarch's actions are not for saving the world? What would you do then?" Qi Yuan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the ultimate truth spoken by Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the East Monarch's linguistic charm was a kind of ultimate truth?</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"The East Monarch never lies. Even if he does this, it's for the better salvation of the world."</p><p></p><p>The group of martial lords spoke incessantly, their emotions running high.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord, who had once been respectful and gentle towards Qi Yuan, now seemed like a completely different person.</p><p></p><p>These people seemed as if they had been brainwashed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they were even worse than the fanatical believers of a cult.</p><p></p><p>Reason couldn't get through to them.</p><p></p><p>The only way...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said lazily, "Whatever the East Monarch says has nothing to do with me. However, I won't allow the worlds to merge before becoming a Myriad Dao Martial God. Also, for now... I'll protect this world!"</p><p></p><p>The game quest was more important than this East Monarch he had never even met.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, someone who could lie to themselves so convincingly was clearly not a good person.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his nose could grow longer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't care what the East Monarch was plotting, but if it affected his game quest, then too bad.</p><p></p><p>The dragon-slaying youth had been activated, ready to solo the boss.</p><p></p><p>"If the East Monarch has any objections, let him come see me!" After saying this, Qi Yuan waved his sleeve and his figure vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He stepped on the Sudden and Abrupt Two Emperors and returned once again to the Land of Endings.</p><p></p><p>Only the tens of thousands of martial lords from the Eastern Alliance were left behind, looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Venerable has... lost his way!"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, he might be part of the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"We've restarted so many times following the East Monarch, how could there be a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"Should we believe a newcomer instead of the East Monarch?"</p><p></p><p>These martial lords had quite a few criticisms of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Qi Yuan's overwhelming strength, they might have already taken action to imprison him and prevent him from interfering with the East Monarch's plans.</p><p></p><p>"We must report this to the East Monarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, only the East Monarch can resolve this matter!"</p><p></p><p>The martial lords discussed among themselves, placing their hopes on the East Monarch.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in a corner, Mu Yan heard these conversations and his expression changed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the newly promoted martial lords who had come with him, and they looked back at him, their eyes filled with the same fear and shock as his.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Yan, I know you have deep feelings for that Heavenly Venerable and will stand on his side. But... the East Monarch cannot be wrong. Once you meet the East Monarch, you'll understand why we trust him so much." Mu Yan's bloodline ancestor spoke, his voice filled with the affection of an elder for a junior.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Mu Yan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard the ancestor say, "You don't need to distance yourself from the Heavenly Venerable. After he meets the East Monarch, he will also believe in him like we do."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan felt even more resistant.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor's kind face broke into a smile, "Sometimes, isn't choosing to believe... better than despair? Among all the martial lords present, nine out of ten actively chose to believe in the East Monarch!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Yan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Actively choosing to believe in the East Monarch?</p><p></p><p>What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>"But... what if the East Monarch makes a mistake?" Mu Yan said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"When a person's words are revered as truth by everyone, he cannot be wrong! Everything he says is correct!" The bloodline ancestor spoke, his eyes filled with fanatical fervor, "At this point, actively believing and offering one's loyalty is far more appropriate than passively believing!"</p><p></p><p>"But..." Mu Yan hesitated, "What if, what if the East Monarch really isn't saving the world?"</p><p></p><p>The ancestor's expression remained kind.</p><p></p><p>"First, the East Monarch cannot be wrong, he is saving the world. Second, all living beings in the world who see the East Monarch will become his followers. Such an East Monarch... whatever he does is right. It's impossible for there to be a will in the world that opposes the East Monarch."</p><p></p><p>However, as he spoke, a tide of killing intent surged in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Those who dare to resist the East Monarch have long been buried in the Black Sea by us! We are the East Monarch's first and most loyal followers! The Black Sea is filled with bones everywhere!" The ancestor's kind face twisted into a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Mu Yan became somewhat afraid.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his once-familiar ancestor had become extremely unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid? You won't be afraid once you become one of us. You've contributed to saving the world this time, the East Monarch will remember your merits."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay on the grass, casually looking at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, how long will it take to comprehend the myriad ways?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still preferred games where you kill monsters.</p><p></p><p>Just charge straight through.</p><p></p><p>This kind of comprehension game was too time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>And it was particularly boring.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still a young man, so it was normal to be a bit restless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Robot Zero One appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've brought the blank marriage certificates. There are two here."</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero One handed the blank marriage certificates to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the marriage certificates, his face showing delight.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, since I can't move the civil affairs bureau, bringing back a marriage certificate isn't too much, right? Even if it breaks, I can just replicate it."</p><p></p><p>These two marriage certificates had been entered into the network, hmm, they would be useful.</p><p></p><p>When he sees Jinli and his beautiful master later, he can just hand over the marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put away the marriage certificates and glanced over, noticing a flash of red.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you also have a marriage certificate in your hand? Are you getting married too?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Zero One waved his hand, and a row of marriage certificates appeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>These marriage certificates all had a photo of Qi Yuan attached to the inside page.</p><p></p><p>"The master may get married again in the future, so I had the civil affairs bureau make some extras to keep on hand. It'll be convenient if the master needs them someday," Zero One said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"You're... very thorough. As expected of the AI robot I trained, much better than those artificial idiots," Qi Yuan said approvingly. Robots were so considerate and thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>After all, his charm was so strong.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he said: "Zero One, you can't smuggle my marriage certificates! I'm the champion of the martial arts tournament, with many fans. Among those fans, there are some 'fangirls', as well as 'zeros' and 'ones'. If they were to buy my marriage certificates, I'd be in big trouble."</p><p></p><p>Zero One clutched the certificates: "As long as I exist, the certificates exist. When I perish, so do they."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say such unlucky things," Qi Yuan said. "Indeed, as one gets older, one becomes more superstitious."</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow! Xie Xinsu meowed beside them.</p><p></p><p>You've eaten the sun, and you still talk about superstition! How ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, I need to comprehend the myriad ways, I'm in a hurry!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, looking at the ant hole on the ground again.</p><p></p><p>He stared at it intently, with a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu stood to the side, feeling quite disdainful.</p><p></p><p>Is this how one comprehends the great way?</p><p></p><p>"I understand now, this ant tunnel has had molten iron poured into it," Qi Yuan seemed to have gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu was speechless upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for so long, this was all he comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow! It wanted to call out, to disparage its foolish master.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mechanical arm extended and grabbed its neck.</p><p></p><p>"Come here, washed-up internet celebrity, it's time to shoot a video," Zero One said, holding Xie Xinsu with a look of disgust. "Sigh, now you only have dead fans, barely getting any likes in a day."</p><p></p><p>Zero One was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>At first, Xie Xinsu had many fans.</p><p></p><p>After all, a cat that could dance and cook was quite popular in the modern city.</p><p></p><p>But later, cultivators arrived and spirit beasts appeared.</p><p></p><p>Those spirit beasts that could speak and use flying magic were more attractive than Xie Xinsu, weren't they? Most importantly, time was merciless.</p><p></p><p>The fans who followed Xie Xinsu weren't fake dead fans, but truly dead fans.</p><p></p><p>Most had died of old age.</p><p></p><p>With no new fans, and old fans all dead, some had even become zombie fans.</p><p></p><p>Now, the money Zero One earned from shooting videos wasn't even enough to buy cat food for Xie Xinsu.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan contemplated the way, Xie Xinsu acted, Zero One filmed, as time slowly flowed by.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the three of us haven't taken a photo together yet. Shall we take one?" At this moment, Zero One softly said to Qi Yuan, who was looking at the tree hollow.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a photo? No problem." Qi Yuan pinched a leaf to cover the tree hollow. </p><p></p><p>He walked towards Zero One.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zero One hurriedly set up a camera that had appeared from somewhere, rushing about.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it wasn't planning to use itself to take the photo this time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, on the lawn, under the deep night sky, Qi Yuan stood in a blood-red robe with a gentle smile on his face. Zero One held Xie Xinsu, also smiling.</p><p></p><p>Its program was about to control the camera to provide lighting.</p><p></p><p>After all, the night was quite dark.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, from the sky above, a gentle and cool moonbeam shone down, falling upon Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was clear and bright, the Milky Way stretched across the sky, there was no sound of people, only the click of the camera.</p><p></p><p>Click.</p><p></p><p>A photo was captured, recording this scene.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up, his eyes showing a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"This moonlight came quickly and left quickly."</p><p></p><p>Just now, a beam of moonlight had hurriedly arrived, fallen on Qi Yuan, and then abruptly stopped, as if it had only come to provide lighting for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the photo taken, the moonlight had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Zero One also looked at the sky, its eyes showing curiosity: "Perhaps the moon has also fallen in love with the master, introducing its way to you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "If I were such a heartthrob, why don't these myriad ways open their mouths and introduce themselves? I'd like to see which one I might fancy."</p><p></p><p>Zero One's eyes showed a joyful expression: "Master, the myriad ways... are about to speak."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan glanced at Zero One, his eyes showing anticipation: "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master is thinking correctly. The myriad ways have long since been transformed into data, hidden in the ruins. All this time, I've been absorbing and organizing the myriad ways. Now, I can finally transfer them all to the master."</p><p></p><p>"Very good, very good. As expected of my clever and intelligent robot," Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a thoughtful expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>But after pondering for a moment, he stopped thinking.</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this would strain his brain.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad ways, why?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zero One extended its hand.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also reached out, interlocking fingers with Zero One.</p><p></p><p>"The myriad ways... are simply 0 and 1," Zero One answered.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, an endless flood of information poured into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see, in the scroll of mountains and seas, the martial arts champion Luo Bufan kneeling on the ground, smiling in resignation.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see, on a lonely boat, the flower spirit girl with a cold expression, laughing madly.</p><p></p><p>He also seemed to see countless demons surrounding a lonely city, a man eating human flesh buns, guarding the city alone. After destroying the demons, he cut off all his flesh before a grave.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes, all sorts of things from the scroll of mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>Human nature, flames, schemes, persistence...</p><p></p><p>Infinite ways, surging in like mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>"The human way is for humans!"</p><p></p><p>"The spirit way is for spirits!"</p><p></p><p>"The orbital way has its orbit!"</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly way has no heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Countless great ways, chaotic and disordered.</p><p></p><p>These ways seemed false, yet also seemed real.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan completely understood.</p><p></p><p>These myriad ways were prepared by Dong Jun for his "dao partner".</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they were a backup plan.</p><p></p><p>Accepting the myriad ways would truly immerse one in the mortal world, making one realize that they were Dong Jun's "dao partner".</p><p></p><p>Now, many new memories appeared in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Those memories seemed to be just as described in the murals.</p><p></p><p>In the scroll of mountains and seas, those fragments constantly filled Qi Yuan's brain, seemingly telling him that he was Dong Jun's dao partner.</p><p></p><p>"How interesting, with such a long nose, yet you tell me it's true."</p><p></p><p>"Dong Jun, you're too desperate. I'm not your dao partner!"</p><p></p><p>Endless scenes swept over him, but Qi Yuan stood motionless, his blood-red robe fluttering.</p><p></p><p>"The myriad ways surge forth, I shall cut them down myself!"</p><p></p><p>"My way is... to forget!"</p><p></p><p>"My way is to kill!"</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, heaven and earth shook, and all the fragments turned to ashes in that moment.</p><p></p><p>On this day, as the myriad ways opened their mouths to introduce themselves, Qi Yuan stepped into the realm of Myriad Ways Martial God from ordinary life.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Zero One looked at Qi Yuan, smiling brightly: "Congratulations, master, for entering the realm of Myriad Ways Martial God. The game... is about to be completed."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zero One, his gaze calm: "I need to go meet Dong Jun. I don't know... if I'll come back. If I have a car parked in some parking lot, help me pay the parking fee. Or if my phone number is still being billed, go help me cancel it. Otherwise, if I don't come back, how much money would I owe?"</p><p></p><p>"Master... you don't have a car."</p><p></p><p>"...That's a bit disappointing. It seems in this world, there won't be a Parking Lot Emperor waiting for me in the rolling mortal world."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 435</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword's tone was bitter, with obvious resentment.</p><p></p><p>Once, he was the top genius of Black Magic Abyss. </p><p></p><p>After Black Sword arrived, he became second.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword had extremely strong talent, and had entered the realm of Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword admitted he was not as good.</p><p></p><p>But... what was the deal with Blood Robe?</p><p></p><p>He appeared suddenly, and the ancestor of Purple Origin Heaven directly gave him... Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>How could Ice Sword's heart be balanced?</p><p></p><p>The surrounding geniuses, hearing Ice Sword's complaints, all had complicated expressions.</p><p></p><p>"If Elder Brother Black Sword obtained the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood, we would be convinced."</p><p></p><p>"A person who just entered Black Magic Abyss, not even for a year, actually has the qualifications to obtain Black Magic Ancestor's Blood, it's really..."</p><p></p><p>The geniuses present discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword's face was gloomy, the cold aura around him becoming even thicker.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to question his own ancestor, why he wasn't given the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a thought.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor was a powerhouse in the realm of Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't easy for him to even meet the ancestor once, how could he dare to make demands of the ancestor.</p><p></p><p>After all, he wasn't like Purple Origin Great Snow, who was the direct bloodline descendant of Purple Origin Heaven's ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Purple Origin Little Dew and Qi Yuan's figures landed among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless gazes fell on Purple Origin Little Dew and Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Confusion, envy, jealousy, desire...</p><p></p><p>There were all kinds of gazes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan secretly transmitted to Purple Origin Little Dew: "There are too many thirsty men and women in your Black Magic Abyss. We're dressed very conservatively, not revealing at all, but there are still so many people looking at us!"</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Little Dew's toes curled, her hands gripping her clothes, her face a bit red.</p><p></p><p>She really wanted to tell Qi Yuan that these people were all looking at him, not her.</p><p></p><p>"Stop looking at the girl, can't you see Purple Origin Little Dew is so embarrassed she's gripping her hands?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me either, I have social anxiety. If I get angry, I'll throw a sinus at your faces!"</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, I'm going to report you for secret filming and sexual harassment!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was the brave Qi Yuan who stood out. He overcame his social anxiety and faced the thousand gazes with cold eyes.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding geniuses heard this and were somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Great Snow laughed at this point: "If you want to look, look at An Xun Lu, she's wearing less!"</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu's expression didn't change at all. For her, the body was just a stinking sack of skin, only the spirit was most important.</p><p></p><p>"Horned Sister, there's freedom of dress. We can't randomly look at how An Xun Lu dresses!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you talked about freedom of speech last time, how come you're covering my mouth now?" Purple Origin Great Snow said smugly.</p><p></p><p>These words stumped Qi Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>There was a feeling of his "worldview" collapsing.</p><p></p><p>When talking with Horned Sister, she could always find loopholes in his words.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's wisdom, it would actually be simple to refute.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was originally not good with words. It's normal for an introverted person with social anxiety to not dare speak loudly or argue, right? Most importantly... he was too lazy to use his brain.</p><p></p><p>Using brainpower to convince the other party was not as good as directly using fists to subdue them.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, Qi Yuan was a bit silent, speechless.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also reflecting on himself.</p><p></p><p>He still had many shortcomings. The words he said often had loopholes... contradictions between before and after, how should he resolve this.</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to comprehend an ultimate principle to make up for this shortcoming!"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, when facing Horned Sister... I can win without using my brain!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought seriously.</p><p></p><p>When participating in the Ultimate Principle Debate Conference, he would use his brain then.</p><p></p><p>The brain should be used in useful places.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise always using it is too tiring, it needs to be well-maintained.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ice Sword's gaze, as if substantial, fell on Qi Yuan, seeming to want to see through what qualifications he had to be valued by the ancestor and gifted the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a vast voice came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!"</p><p></p><p>"Listen!"</p><p></p><p>Only to see that in Black Magic Heaven, the sky instantly became dark, pitch black.</p><p></p><p>On the peak of the mountain, a white-robed man appeared, his clothes fluttering, his face like polished jade, his bearing elegant.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to the overall gloomy tone of Black Magic Heaven, this person was all white, like a warm light.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Elder Brother Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>All the geniuses, including Ice Sword, lowered their heads, looking up at the jade-like man on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, used to being an actor, also bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall teach you all."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword sat on the peak, his bearing extraordinary, like an immortal who had transcended the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu looked at Black Sword, her eyes full of admiration and respect.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses, no matter how arrogant, also showed reverence when facing Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>The first reverence came from Black Sword's powerful strength, as he was a Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The second reverence came from Black Sword's outstanding talent, even the Nine Elders of Black Magic Abyss were inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Nearly a thousand geniuses called out in unison, all sitting to one side.</p><p></p><p>The previous disputes and petty thoughts also disappeared with Black Sword's arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Today's lesson will be on Yang Spirit." Black Sword's voice was refined, like a spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat next to Purple Origin Little Dew, somewhat absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>He secretly transmitted:</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit advanced. I'd rather hear about how to talk about Yin Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was only at the Purple Palace realm, equivalent to a middle school student on Blue Star. Listening to university-level advanced mathematics was indeed too advanced.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Little Dew secretly transmitted: "Elder Brother's talent is extraordinary, no need to listen to his teachings."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze looked at Qi Yuan, with an admiring expression.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a person who refuses to make progress. We should listen more to other people's voices to open our minds." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Little Dew also has doubts on the path of cultivation. I wonder if Elder Brother could give some guidance when you're free?" Purple Origin Little Dew blinked her eyes, asking expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... no problem." Qi Yuan agreed directly.</p><p></p><p>Teaching people cultivation? Who can't do that.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had many clever ideas and insights.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Brother." Purple Origin Little Dew showed an adorable smile.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Black Sword's lecture also began.</p><p></p><p>"The star realm has no stars, heaven and earth are dark, yin.</p><p></p><p>The great predecessors saw light in strange lands and the universe, traveled between yin and yang, emulated the stars, raised spirit thrones, refined virtual images of stars, illuminating all heavens, and the world saw yang..."</p><p></p><p>"The path of Yang Spirit requires capturing the most yang qi of heaven and earth, merging it with oneself, to forge an immortal, indestructible, and imperishable soul."</p><p></p><p>What Black Sword taught was the purest Yang Spirit path of the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>To become a Yang Spirit, one needs to cultivate a star projection to illuminate all heavens.</p><p></p><p>For these geniuses, the most difficult part is cultivating the star projection.</p><p></p><p>The star projection requires capturing and refining the most yang light from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The yang light of the Six Heavens is almost exhausted, only some major forces still preserve it.</p><p></p><p>Or, in some strange lands, one can also encounter light from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Next, Black Sword explained how to capture the light from beyond the heavens, where it's easy to find, and how to capture it more easily.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses present all listened attentively, as if intoxicated.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Today's lesson ends here. If you have any questions, you may ask me."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's expression was refined, his white robe transcendent.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, many geniuses asked questions earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword also answered one by one, very carefully and in detail, without any airs of a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan suddenly stood up and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible to not follow this path of Yang Spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on Qi Yuan, with some surprise and confusion.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Ice Sword was not submissive to Blood Robe now, </p><p></p><p>Just from the deep affection the Purple Origin Heavenly Ancestor had for Blood Robe, it could be seen that Blood Robe's talent was likely second only to Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>He raised a question, perhaps with a unique insight.</p><p></p><p>They listened carefully, wanting to see if there would be any gains from these two geniuses discussing the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I have a bold idea. Capturing the extreme yang light is too slow.</p><p></p><p>Why not start from the source and go directly to other universes to capture and refine a star! Wouldn't such a Yang Spirit be even more powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan voiced his doubts.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the gazes of the geniuses present towards Qi Yuan became a bit uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought that Blood Robe, this genius, would say something profound and far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>But the result... what he said was too unreliable, right? Did this even need to be asked?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention where to find real stars in other universes, just considering themselves... who had the ability to refine a real star?</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit was strong, able to destroy stars with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>But they were merely Yin Spirits, at the nation-destroying level.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too great, far too great.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe's statement had a special kind of beauty to it.</p><p></p><p>Want to earn a million a year?</p><p></p><p>First deposit 60 million in the bank.</p><p></p><p>"The way of the Yang Spirit originates from the great ancestors of the past, there may be other methods," Black Sword explained patiently, not refusing to answer because of Qi Yuan's outlandish question. "However, one must be cautious. The power of stars is not something a Yin Spirit can refine. The slightest carelessness could lead to the annihilation of one's soul."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's answer was simple - there might be such a possibility, but it was too dangerous and not recommended.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan also felt it made sense.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirits were so weak they couldn't even swallow a star.</p><p></p><p>Refining a star? That's wishful thinking!</p><p></p><p>So the path of the Yang Spirit had to be taken step by step, capturing light from beyond the sky and refining it into star projections.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a flash of inspiration struck his clever mind, and Qi Yuan's face instantly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiaolu immediately became nervous: "What's wrong, Senior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm going to die."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very worried.</p><p></p><p>Because he had actually refined the real sun and turned it into a golden core.</p><p></p><p>According to general logic, shouldn't he be dead already? After all, a Yin Spirit refining a real star would die.</p><p></p><p>The way of the Yang Spirit was only to capture the extreme yang light from beyond the sky.</p><p></p><p>His path was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was already dead? Was everything now just a fantasy before his death?</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Senior Brother?" Purple Origin Xiaolu was somewhat concerned.</p><p></p><p>"Bring your face closer, let Senior Brother pinch it a bit." Qi Yuan's face was ashen.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Purple Origin Xiaolu was a bit confused, but still obediently brought her face closer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pinched it and asked seriously: "Does it hurt?"</p><p></p><p>"No... it doesn't hurt." Purple Origin Xiaolu said shyly.</p><p></p><p>Even if it hurt, she couldn't tell Senior Brother, to avoid making him feel guilty.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't hurt at all? Could everything be fake, just my imagination?" Qi Yuan's mental state collapsed.</p><p></p><p>He never dared to pinch himself hard, because he was afraid of pain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's state, Purple Origin Xiaolu beside him became anxious, not knowing what had happened: "It hurts, it hurts a tiny bit!"</p><p></p><p>She didn't hide it anymore.</p><p></p><p>She felt that when facing Blood Robe Senior Brother, it was better not to hide her thoughts, but to be straightforward.</p><p></p><p>"It hurts?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, "So it's not my imagination, but..."</p><p></p><p>He was confused again.</p><p></p><p>Why wasn't he dead?</p><p></p><p>Weren't Yin Spirits supposed to die when refining stars?</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he thought of something and had a realization.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Spirits die swallowing stars, what does that have to do with me at Foundation Establishment!"</p><p></p><p>Right?</p><p></p><p>He had refined the sun into a golden core and swallowed a fixed star when he was at Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>So, no problem.</p><p></p><p>It was all just scaring himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan understood and felt a bit of lingering fear, he had almost died.</p><p></p><p>This also reminded him of his earlier conversation with Purple Origin Daxue.</p><p></p><p>His path had loopholes, and not small ones!</p><p></p><p>He had to go comprehend a great truth to perfect these loopholes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Black Sword looked at Qi Yuan with a surprised expression: "Blood Robe, your manner suggests you have something to say?"</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had been acting strangely after asking his question earlier, attracting quite a few gazes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well say he had almost thought himself to death, could he?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had a clever idea in his urgency: "Black Sword Senior Brother, I want to report something!"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan disliked people who reported on others, he supported open and aboveboard reporting.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan felt quite weary.</p><p></p><p>These words made all the geniuses present reveal puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe... really was more like someone from Purple Origin Heaven than the people of Purple Origin Heaven themselves!</p><p></p><p>"Report what?" Black Sword asked.</p><p></p><p>"I want to report An Xunlu. She's sowing discord between us, insisting that I can't surpass Black Sword, and saying that I view you as my target." Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Then, Purple Origin Daxue's goose-like laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>Not far away, An Xunlu's eyes widened, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses also held back their smiles.</p><p></p><p>These words did sound like something An Xunlu would say.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword sat to the side, also recalling that An Xunlu had said similar things to him before.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had been furious but powerless.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing Blood Robe bring this out into the open, he didn't know why, but he actually felt somewhat pleased.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his gaze towards Qi Yuan became even more wary.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had been thinking of challenging Blood Robe to prove that he was the number one below Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Now... with Blood Robe's shameless behavior, how could he dare to challenge him?</p><p></p><p>If he said something inappropriate during the challenge, wouldn't this fellow exaggerate it and tell everyone, ruining Ice Sword's reputation?</p><p></p><p>Don't get close to Blood Robe, it brings misfortune.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword had this thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Stay far away from Blood Robe in the future!</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses also looked at Blood Robe with disgust.</p><p></p><p>This person really did say whatever came to mind!</p><p></p><p>At first, there were rumors that Blood Robe would tell everyone he suspected the Ancestor was his grandson, but they didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Now... they believed.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe... don't talk nonsense!" An Xunlu was really about to die of anger, her chest heaving.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not talking nonsense, I even recorded it and kept evidence." Qi Yuan said, taking out a memory stone.</p><p></p><p>"Black Sword, this An Xunlu is clearly a schemer, actually sowing discord. You should stay far away from her.</p><p></p><p>Don't let her cheat you out of your money and your body. Boys need to be careful when they're out."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, feeling very righteous, directly exposed the reality.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Black Sword, I didn't!" Tears welled up in An Xunlu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword stood at the mountain peak, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan continued: "A rumor-mongering girl who tries to act pitiful when her little essay is exposed, huh? I declare, I have never taken Black Sword as a target for comparison, nor is he someone I aim to surpass."</p><p></p><p>An Xunlu's gaze was like swords as she gritted her teeth: "Perhaps you don't dare to compare yourself to Big Brother Black Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"With so many people around, still spreading rumors!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>"When Black Sword becomes a great truth, then come and let me surpass him. Right now... he's not qualified!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was calm, but at this moment, it stirred up huge waves in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>P.S. Thanks to big shot Lin Shengjun for another 10,000 reward!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

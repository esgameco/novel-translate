        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Coming quickly, leaving quickly.</p><p></p><p>After killing an elemental dan cultivator, he disappeared into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>In the small city of Liqi, Wang Shenghai's name truly resounded, becoming the most famous person.</p><p></p><p>If others asked why he was so famous, the people of Liqi City would say: He was the first cultivator in Liqi City to be killed by the Yin God Venerable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already changed his title to Blood Robe Sword God and entered the Divine Flower Society forum.</p><p></p><p>"Purifying the Cultivation World's Atmosphere, Starting with Me, the Blood Robe Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>"Recalling the past, when I first came to the Divine Flower Society, everyone here spoke very nicely, humble and polite. </p><p></p><p>I don't know when, but the atmosphere here deteriorated, filled with all kinds of hostility.</p><p></p><p>Especially recently, many people on the forum have slandered me, spread rumors about me, making me heartbroken and distressed, unable to eat or sleep, falling into deep pain, almost developing depression.</p><p></p><p>I had to take medicine every day just to fall asleep.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, what kills people is not just knives or magic, but also words.</p><p></p><p>Just now, I went to Liqi City and executed by firing squad the Divine Flower Society cultivator who spread rumors and slandered me.</p><p></p><p>As for others who have slandered me, I will also go personally to educate them one by one."</p><p></p><p>"...Is this real or fake?"</p><p></p><p>"Does the big shot even sleep?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect the Yin God Venerable to be so sentimental, mommy hug blood baby, don't be sad, be good."</p><p></p><p>"Strongly support, Blood Robe Sword God is invincible, beat those disgusting guys to death!" Fox Den Little Li quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect Blood Robe Sword God to empathize with her so much.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when she was arguing with those people, she really couldn't eat or sleep, and almost became depressed.</p><p></p><p>And some people, especially those who had verbally attacked Blood Robe Sword God before, became a bit panicked.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is the Yin God Venerable, you should be magnanimous and not bother with petty people, it's beneath your dignity."</p><p></p><p>"Right, this is what demonic cultivators do!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these comments, Qi Yuan coldly smiled and had Qi Jianjun take note, then he replied: "I am a barbarian, I have no dignity!"</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord's eyes were full of envy as he said: "This is how a real man should be!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan thought of Liu Bang.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Great Wisdom True Lord: "When your mother gave birth to you, did she dream of a dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"No, but she dreamed of golden light falling from the sky." Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"That should be the light of wisdom." Qi Yuan said, then he posted another reply on the Divine Flower Society forum, "Next stop, Fengxian City, those who know, know."</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Fengxian City, a young woman wearing an embroidered robe turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>She stumbled towards a cave dwelling, shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, an old man emanating a terrifying aura appeared, with a kind and benevolent expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, who bullied my little Butterfly?" The old man named Yan Yiqi had stepped into the Purple Palace realm ten years ago, becoming the senior elder of the Morning Sun Sect, and could be said to be in his prime.</p><p></p><p>The young woman before him was his most beloved descendant.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, save me... wuwu." The young woman's eyes were filled with tears, looking particularly pitiful.</p><p></p><p>Yan Yiqi immediately felt heartbroken: "Quickly tell me, who bullied my little Butterfly?"</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I saw a senior acting arrogantly and killing innocents indiscriminately in the Divine Flower Society, so I privately said a few words about him with others.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that senior was so petty, he actually wants to come to Fengxian City to kill me!" At this point, the young woman was completely confused, but still mastered the skill of exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it wasn't her fault.</p><p></p><p>"How outrageous, just because he was criticized a bit by juniors, he wants to come for revenge, this is the way of demons!</p><p></p><p>If everyone acted like this, wouldn't the cultivation world be in chaos?</p><p></p><p>Quickly tell me, what's his name, what's his cultivation level, if he dares to come, I'll reason with him!" Yan Yiqi said passionately.</p><p></p><p>The young woman's heart sank: "Ancestor, he is the Blood Robe Sword God from the Divine Flower Society, a Yin God Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"..." Yan Yiqi's heart skipped a beat, "What did you say...?"</p><p></p><p>"He has already made threats, he just killed a cultivator in Liqi City, and now he's rushing to Fengxian City without stopping, Ancestor... it's not little Butterfly's fault, it's all because Blood Robe Sword God is narrow-minded." The young woman cried, pretending to be pitiful, as this always worked without fail.</p><p></p><p>No matter what mistake she made, she would always be forgiven.</p><p></p><p>Yan Yiqi's expression changed slightly, he took little Butterfly's Divine Flower Society jade slip and looked at it for a while, his beard almost standing on end: "How dare you slander a Yin God Venerable, you must have eaten a bear's gall and a leopard's heart! The Venerable is purifying the atmosphere of the cultivation world with good intentions, and you, you are the vermin of the cultivation world! Come here, tie her up, we welcome the Venerable's arrival!"</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, it's clearly..." Little Butterfly wanted to struggle, but unfortunately couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, such incidents happened repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Each time, before Qi Yuan went to a city, he would announce it in advance.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of those cities, and even nearby cities, would go there in advance, wanting to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was a Yin God Venerable, a big shot rarely seen in ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>When a big shot appeared, even Purple Palace realm experts would play music.</p><p></p><p>For small fries like them, it was hard to even see a Purple Palace expert, let alone hear music played by one.</p><p></p><p>And those geniuses who cursed people on the Divine Flower Society forum had long been tied up by their own sects and forces, handed over to Blood Robe Sword God to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword God swept through all directions, following the network to beat people up.</p><p></p><p>This serious yet comical attitude indeed shook the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Many sect elders issued orders that the young disciples in their sects could not casually slander powerful figures in communication jade slips.</p><p></p><p>And some cultivators who were previously skilled in verbal battles also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>To some extent, the atmosphere of the cultivation world did indeed improve quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>In Thunder State.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord sat in front of an alchemy furnace, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"Watch the fire!" At this time, an authoritative voice came.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord's spirit sharpened, and he quickly looked at the fire in the alchemy furnace.</p><p></p><p>"This batch of pills absolutely cannot have any mistakes, this is what I'm refining for the great cultivator Ye Chen!" The old man reminded beside him, "Our sect is in a critical period now, we need to build good relationships widely."</p><p></p><p>Yaochang Sect was a large sect in Thunder State, with one Purple Palace senior elder within the sect.</p><p></p><p>The senior elder had been in closed-door cultivation for hundreds of years, not appearing.</p><p></p><p>Outside, there were rumors that Yaochang Sect's ancestor had already perished, and Yaochang Sect's mortal enemies were also secretly watching, constantly squeezing Yaochang Sect's power.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord looked at the flames in the alchemy furnace, his eyes showing a confused expression: "Master, I want to improve, I don't want to stay on the Eastern Lands Small Genius Ranking anymore."</p><p></p><p>This time when he went to Cuiyu State, he still couldn't enter the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dan Heng True Lord revealed a kind smile: "It's rare for you to have such motivation to improve, I hope you can enter the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking and reach the Purple Palace realm like Jien.</p><p></p><p>I have some experience regarding shattering the dan to form the infant, take it and have a look."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his usually lazy disciple finally having motivation to improve, Dan Heng True Lord felt quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I don't want to shatter the dan to form the infant." Rogue Immortal Lord said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you want to polish it more?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to... shatter the dan and cultivate again.</p><p></p><p>The first-grade golden dan I formed is really too weak, not powerful at all."</p><p></p><p>"No way!" Dan Heng True Lord quickly said, "A first-grade golden dan has already surpassed 99.9% of cultivators, it's enough.</p><p></p><p>If you shatter the dan and cultivate again, wasting time, even if you form an earth-grade golden dan, so what, can you beat yourself who already has a divine infant with a first-grade golden dan?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I don't want to form an earth-grade golden dan, I want to form a more powerful one."</p><p></p><p>"More powerful? How much more powerful? Even a celestial-grade golden dan is just having amazing potential."</p><p></p><p>"I... know a friend, the golden dan he formed seems quite fierce."</p><p></p><p>"Quite fierce, how fierce?" Dan Heng True Lord looked at Rogue Immortal Lord impatiently, "What kind of golden dan did he form?"</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord looked up, through the glass roof, he pointed at the sun: "This."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Dan Heng True Lord was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"He formed a sun golden dan."</p><p></p><p>"...I think you've looked at the sun too much and damaged your brain!" Dan Heng True Lord said impatiently, "Don't look at that new sun anymore in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord couldn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Because if someone had told him before that they had formed a sun golden dan, he would also say that person's brain was damaged.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I really want to shatter the dan and cultivate again, if not forming a sun, forming a sea would be fine too." Rogue Immortal Lord couldn't forget.</p><p></p><p>His golden dan was too weak, too small.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had asked Origin Venerable in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable said, the bigger the better, the stronger the better.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think nonsense, how can you fit a sea in your dantian?" </p><p></p><p>"Then... how can someone fit a sun?" Rogue Immortal Lord asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>Dan</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Master Dan Heng was so angry his eyebrows nearly fell off. He could only say with deep meaning: "There are differences between people. Don't aim too high. Your golden elixir may not compare to the sun, but it is still my carefully refined Six Flavors Heavenly Yellow Pill - small, but with infinite potential."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, how could he compare to the Origin Heavenly Lord? Forget about the Origin Heavenly Lord, among the other two emperors in the group, who could he match up to?</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that he could cling to a powerful backer, his mood improved greatly.</p><p></p><p>"In three days, when this batch of pills is finished refining, you will personally deliver them to Master Night Chen. </p><p></p><p>Oh, and chat more with Master Night Chen's granddaughter, to build a connection," said Master Dan Heng.</p><p></p><p>He was trying to match up the Rogue Immortal Lord with Master Night Chen's granddaughter.</p><p></p><p>If successful, his disciple's future would be secure - he could just live off his wife.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord anxiously said: "Master, in three days a friend of mine is coming to the area to kill someone. I need to go watch."</p><p></p><p>Master Dan Heng frowned: "He even tells you about killing people? Your friend is really something. Is he trustworthy?"</p><p></p><p>"He is!" The Rogue Immortal Lord nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"Go take a look, then deliver the medicine after," said Master Dan Heng. He naturally assumed this was his disciple's friend facing a powerful opponent and looking for backup, so he had sought out his disciple.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't really stop this kind of thing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord sat in an inn, with the pills his master had just finished refining stored in his storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for the Origin Heavenly Lord to arrive. To be honest, he felt somewhat anxious now.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he hadn't figured out how to face the Origin Heavenly Lord yet.</p><p></p><p>"Little Jade, I asked you to deliver medicine to my grandfather. I didn't expect you to come here to watch the excitement!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a youthful and lively-looking young woman walked in, her almond eyes wide as she looked at the Rogue Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Chan, ahem, I have a friend coming. I'll deliver the medicine after I meet my friend," said the Rogue Immortal Lord, feeling somewhat timid facing the young woman before him.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the tall woman beside the young woman couldn't help but frown: "You dare to delay Master Night Chen's medicine? You're quite bold."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Chan quickly said: "It's fine if it's a little late. My grandfather isn't in a hurry to use it."</p><p></p><p>A complex look flashed in the tall woman's eyes: "Little Chan, Young Master Feng Tian of Master Feng Xiao is waiting for us upstairs. Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Hesitation flashed in Ye Chan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear voice rang out: "Rogue Immortal Lord, long time no see. So this is the city where you live? It looks quite nice, much better than my poor backwater place."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord looked over and saw Qi Yuan in a long blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was holding the hand of an adorable little girl who looked only seven or eight years old.</p><p></p><p>"This is my daughter, Qi Jianjun. </p><p></p><p>Jianjun, this is Uncle Rogue Immortal Lord. Say hello."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun's eyes seemed to contain stars. She looked at the Rogue Immortal Lord without any airs: "Hello, Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord felt flattered, but he still said: "No need to call me uncle, I'm still young. Just call me by my name."</p><p></p><p>He had heard that the Origin Heavenly Lord's daughter was a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>For a Yin God to call him uncle... he didn't dare imagine.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Xiaoyu, why are you pretending to be young?" Ye Chan couldn't help saying. She looked at Qi Jianjun, "What an adorable child."</p><p></p><p>She glanced at the tall woman beside her: "Sister Hua, I won't go up then."</p><p></p><p>She then turned to the Rogue Immortal Lord: "Little Jade, you don't mind if I sit here, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord looked towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Actually, when he heard Ye Chan call Qi Jianjun a child, he was really afraid that Yin God boss would kill Ye Chan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Rogue Immortal Lord, now I know your real name. You'll be using your real name online from now on," said Qi Yuan, not expecting the Rogue Immortal Lord's name to actually be quite roguish - Gao Xiaoyu, somewhat feminine.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord laughed awkwardly, but was actually panicking inside.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Origin Heavenly Lord, he felt okay, but facing Qi Jianjun, he was truly nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Is this your Dao companion? She's quite pretty," Qi Yuan glanced at Ye Chan and gave a polite compliment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chan's face reddened: "Don't talk nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put on a knowing look and patted the Rogue Immortal Lord's shoulder: "Work hard, become a father soon."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chan looked at Qi Jianjun, her face slightly red, and waved her hand: "Come, adorable little girl, big sister will give you a welcome gift."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, a white porcelain bottle appeared in her palm: "There are some candies inside. They taste very good. Eat one when you're hungry. It won't upset your stomach."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Rogue Immortal Lord kept giving Ye Chan eye signals.</p><p></p><p>You're giving snacks to a Yin God?</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun reached out her hand, about to take the porcelain bottle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an urgent voice rang out: "Little Chan, that's the Three Yang Essence Spirit Pill your grandfather gave you. How can you casually give it to a child!"</p><p></p><p>Sister Hua, who had gone upstairs earlier, hurried down with a handsome young man, Feng Tian, beside her.</p><p></p><p>"It's my thing, I can give it to whoever I want," said Ye Chan, somewhat displeased with Sister Hua.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sister Hua was speechless.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Feng Tian looked at Qi Yuan: "Children don't know better, but you as an adult don't know either? The Three Yang Essence Spirit Pill is considered a good item even for Divine Infant cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Ye Chan means well, but do you feel at ease taking such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "I never knew better to begin with."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he directly took the porcelain bottle from Ye Chan's hand.</p><p></p><p>He opened the bottle, and immediately a fragrant aroma wafted out.</p><p></p><p>"Come Jianjun, time for candy."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun grabbed a handful of pills with her small hand and stuffed them directly into her little mouth: "Tastes good."</p><p></p><p>Sister Hua and Feng Tian were completely stunned seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>Especially Sister Hua, who kept shaking her head: "Such a waste, such a waste."</p><p></p><p>To give such precious pills to a child to eat.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tian glanced at Qi Yuan: "I will report this matter to Master Night Chen."</p><p></p><p>He glared fiercely at the Rogue Immortal Lord: "Colluding with outsiders to deceive..."</p><p></p><p>"Enough!" Ye Chan coldly looked at Feng Tian and Sister Hua, "I'll do what I want. Are you my son, to care so much about me?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Tian was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>Sister Hua's face turned from green to red, and finally her tone softened: "Little Chan, we're just afraid you'll be deceived."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan spoke up: "Rogue Immortal Lord, we'll chat later. I'm going to kill someone."</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun held Qi Yuan's hand like a little follower: "Goodbye uncles and aunties."</p><p></p><p>His music troupe had arrived late, and he had to go kill someone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Chan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>How did the conversation suddenly turn to killing people?</p><p></p><p>Feng Tian and Sister Hua were also surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a familiar sound suddenly rang out in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The desolate sound of the suona, like the sigh of a deity, echoed throughout the entire city.</p><p></p><p>The attention of everyone present was immediately drawn to it.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God has come to kill!"</p><p></p><p>This morning, they had received news that the Blood-Robed Sword God was coming here to kill someone.</p><p></p><p>For such a big event, they had naturally come early to watch.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, who knows how many powerful experts were hidden in this city.</p><p></p><p>Even the elusive Purple Mansion, who had been in closed-door cultivation, might have appeared just to see the legendary Yin God boss.</p><p></p><p>That was the powerful Yin God who had destroyed the Palace of Light and killed the Also Poor Venerable and Have Feelings Venerable!</p><p></p><p>At least a Step Two Treading the Heavens expert.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go upstairs to watch!" At this point Ye Chan didn't dwell on it anymore, and prepared to take the Rogue Immortal Lord and Qi Yuan to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I have to go kill someone," said Qi Yuan, holding Qi Jianjun's hand as their figures disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chan was stunned for a moment, but in the end still went with the Rogue Immortal Lord to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>At this time, almost all the cultivators in this great city had gathered together.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the more than ten Purple Mansion experts in the sky, expressions of shock on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Using Purple Mansion experts as a music troupe, this Blood-Robed Sword God really knows how to put on a show!"</p><p></p><p>"Shh, don't speak ill of the Venerable, or else..."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm not speaking ill. I'm praising, praising!"</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I'd live to hear Purple Mansion experts play music, and even see the legendary Yin God!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Chan stood on the restaurant building, stars in her eyes: "Gao Xiaoyu, what do you think the Blood-Robed Sword God looks like? Is he cold and aloof, keeping people at a distance?</p><p></p><p>I heard he has a daughter who's also a Yin God. That's so scary."</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord didn't speak. He wanted to say, you just met the Blood-Robed Sword God, and even gave candy to his Yin God daughter.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, he decided not to say anything. They would see soon enough anyway.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 236</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He picked up the fish, his gaze complex.</p><p></p><p>"After so many years, I hope it hasn't expired?"</p><p></p><p>"This guy, he still left me some fish."</p><p></p><p>He used chopsticks to pick up a piece of fish, put it in his mouth, and chewed slowly, savoring the taste.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a childish voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, actually my name isn't Wu Shi, I don't have a name."</p><p></p><p>"When I first saw you, I already knew we would meet three times."</p><p></p><p>"Why? Because I not only heard your voice, but also heard your inner thoughts."</p><p></p><p>The girl's voice brought Qi Yuan back to not long ago, to the scene when he saw the girl Wu Shi, which was also the last time he saw the Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>The voice was childish, as if it was what she wanted to say when she first met him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a moment of realization.</p><p></p><p>No wonder... she looked so strange, because she heard his inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>So, she must have known that they would meet again in the future, and she also knew that her future self would die at the hands of Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate the fish as the girl's chattering voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"When I first saw you, I was very wary, thinking you might eat me. I misjudged you."</p><p></p><p>"But hehe, I wanted to eat you, but I was too timid and didn't dare."</p><p></p><p>The girl spoke about her past, as if writing in a diary, complaining about her lonely life.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan ate the fish, savoring it slowly, the voice in his ear gradually lost its childishness and became more mature.</p><p></p><p>"The second time I saw you, I was a bit excited, because I could finally eat delicious fish."</p><p></p><p>"I was really, really hungry."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to eating fish, nothing else mattered."</p><p></p><p>"Your scent was even more tempting then, I... I really wanted to eat you at that time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but recall the second time he saw the Mother of No Food, when she was curled up on the ground in a red dress, her face pale, looking at him with a hint of greed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>But later, after she finished eating the fish, her expression turned cold, keeping Qi Yuan at a distance.</p><p></p><p>"So, her change in attitude then was because she wanted to eat me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>From the Mother of No Food's words, he already knew she had both the Innate Original Body and the Devouring Original Body.</p><p></p><p>These two terrifying constitutions conflicted with each other.</p><p></p><p>No wonder whenever he saw the Mother of No Food, she always seemed strange, as if suppressing something.</p><p></p><p>What she was suppressing was her desire to devour his heart.</p><p></p><p>"A chance encounter, you give me fish to eat, I help you guard the Pillar of Heaven, we're even."</p><p></p><p>"If you harbor ill intentions, I devour you... that's not too much, is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Mother of No Food's tone was somewhat cheerful.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan knew the suppression in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The desire to devour from the Devouring Original Body was very, very strong.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the mythical level Mother of No Food ate ordinary fish and ended up writhing in agony, trembling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>That was a mythical being, who didn't even cry out in pain when facing Yang Shen with her body riddled with wounds.</p><p></p><p>Yet just eating a piece of fish caused her unbearable pain.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, later I realized that what I had been eating all along was your... blood."</p><p></p><p>The Mother of No Food's voice carried a sense of detachment.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to have convinced herself not to follow her instinct to devour Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was complex: "So, at that time she... could really have eaten me?"</p><p></p><p>At that time, when he was near the Mother of No Food, even though separated by time and space, he sometimes felt a faint threat.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the first time he met the Mother of No Food.</p><p></p><p>She was quietly eating fish in front of him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the fish had not been purified by his blood, yet the Mother of No Food still ate it with relish.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he didn't know why this was. He had thought that the Mother of No Food he saw each time was not the same person.</p><p></p><p>Now he understood, the Mother of No Food ate unpurified fish, using that extreme pain to suppress her desire to devour.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's emotions were complex.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that in their three simple meetings, where nothing earth-shattering happened, just eating, drinking, and chatting, so much was hidden behind it all.</p><p></p><p>"I wandered around the Mortal Heart Realm for ten thousand years, this world is much more fun than my hometown, and smells much better too..."</p><p></p><p>The Mother of No Food's voice was somewhat cheerful.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The Mother of No Food's childhood was indeed miserable, raised at home like a canary, or rather like a commodity.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the Mortal Heart Realm, where people like Qi Yuan had limited knowledge and didn't know about the two terrifying constitutions she possessed, everyone looked at her normally.</p><p></p><p>It was natural that she lived more happily in the Mortal Heart Realm than in her hometown.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand years in the Mortal Heart Realm were her happiest times.</p><p></p><p>As he ate the last piece of fish, a voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Since we've met, how about we make a deal?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll help you guard the Pillar of Heaven, and you help me... protect the Mortal Heart Realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate the last of the fish.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had exchanged a fish for the Mother of No Food's help in guarding the Pillar of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Mother of No Food had returned all the fish to him.</p><p></p><p>After their second meeting, when the Mother of No Food realized that the fish she ate contained Qi Yuan's blood, she stopped eating them and left the fish for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These fish contained flawless blood.</p><p></p><p>After eating these fish, the blood Qi Yuan had lost was replenished.</p><p></p><p>The aura around him also became more profound.</p><p></p><p>"Mother of No Food, you've lost out," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Because, even without making a deal with the Mother of No Food, due to the game, he would have to protect the Mortal Heart Realm, or rather protect Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>In this deal, the Mother of No Food had lost out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart was calm as he thought about many things.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, his gaze changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt the solar true fire on the Star Golden Pill in the sky suddenly flare up.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat surprised, looking around himself.</p><p></p><p>The Star Golden Pill in the sky had always been quiet, methodically devouring other stars according to Qi Yuan's wishes.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao sat within it, time seemingly at a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, the divine domain seed awakened by Ning Tao was related to the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Now, after eating the fish, Qi Yuan's Star Golden Pill suddenly underwent a change, as if it had abruptly gained the ability to devour.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring Original Body!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his empty storage bag, many thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had used crystal-clear flawless blood to purify the fish for the Mother of No Food to eat.</p><p></p><p>Now... the Mother of No Food, not wanting to owe him, had also added her blood to the fish? Now, his body had gained a trace of the essence of devouring.</p><p></p><p>This essence of devouring was something the Mother of No Food had separated and placed in the fish as a gift to him.</p><p></p><p>This essence was different from divine duties, and different from divine domains.</p><p></p><p>A helpless smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Such a great favor, are you asking me to protect this world... for a lifetime?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Zhuangshi, you're not allowed to bully Da Hei anymore!" Shi Zhongshan looked at the burly Zhu Zhuangshi, a vertical pupil seemingly appearing on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>The big black dog squatted</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the foot of Stone Heavy Mountain, as if finding a mountain to rely on, the dog barked loudly at Zhu Zhuangshi.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, it's clearly my dog, why are you Erlang Shen?" Zhu Zhuangshi was extremely jealous.</p><p></p><p>The second ancient god Stone Heavy Mountain visualized was Erlang Shen, the True Lord who Manifests Holiness!</p><p></p><p>This one's power was far greater than Marshal Tianpeng's.</p><p></p><p>You have to look at the owner when beating a dog. </p><p></p><p>He could no longer bully the big black dog like before.</p><p></p><p>"The mighty Erlang Shen is too majestic, how could a fat guy like you visualize him?" Stone Heavy Mountain said smugly.</p><p></p><p>He had originally visualized one powerful deity, then visualized several more deities, and finally visualized Erlang Shen. Now, he had suddenly entered the realm of mythology.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi's strength had also increased a lot, but compared to Stone Heavy Mountain, he was still far behind.</p><p></p><p>"You dog!" Zhu Zhuangshi cursed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two figures approached - Village Chief Yu Lu and Shaman Shen Tu.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu wore coarse linen clothes with patches. Shaman Shen Tu wore a brown robe and a hat on his head, looking much more elegant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two approaching, Zhu Zhuangshi's jovial expression disappeared, turning serious.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's go eat together. Tomorrow... the great battle begins," Village Chief Yu Lu said in an aged voice, with an inexplicable sigh.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a faint excitement welled up in Stone Heavy Mountain's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Three months ago, who could have imagined that in our two villages... everyone would become gods!"</p><p></p><p>Blue Water Village and Stone Family Village, along with Chen Xi Village, were the first villages ruled by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I remember back then, we didn't have enough to eat and were bullied by your Stone Family Village, almost wiped out. Who would have thought we'd see this day!" Shaman Shen Tu recalled the past with emotion, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Blue Water Village was in ruins, and even Zhu Zhuangshi had become emaciated from hunger.</p><p></p><p>Stone Heavy Mountain also had a reminiscent look: "The grace of the Heavenly Lord, we will never forget even in death!"</p><p></p><p>Back then, his child was about to be chosen to be sacrificed to an evil god.</p><p></p><p>He was pinned to the ground, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>It was the Origin Heavenly Lord who came, slaying the evil god with one sword, bringing new life to Stone Heavy Mountain and hope to Stone Family Village.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xi Village was the same.</p><p></p><p>These villagers all remembered the kindness of the Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not spent much time with the Origin Heavenly Lord, they were willing to die in battle for him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go eat and kill enemies!"</p><p></p><p>The four people and one dog present were all somewhat impassioned as they headed towards the banquet, talking as they walked.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhu, about that matter I entrusted to you last time..."</p><p></p><p>"You can trust Old Zhu's character, hehe, I've already researched the results."</p><p></p><p>"Good..."</p><p></p><p>As night fell, all the ancient gods stopped their cultivation and gathered in Flying Weed City to feast.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of true gods gathered in one place to eat together.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene was particularly stunning.</p><p></p><p>Where else would you find thousands of ancient gods feasting together in a city?</p><p></p><p>They toasted each other, creating a lively atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions were excited, with no confusion about the future.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of dying!</p><p></p><p>For them, who really feared death?...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>The sound of chewing constantly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Sage's devouring body continuously devoured the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Blood Sun Great Sage's movements stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Devour..."</p><p></p><p>She looked towards the north from within the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Her chaotic eyes became clear in that moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless memories flooded back into her mind.</p><p></p><p>A manic look flashed in Blood Sun Great Sage's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial world... Devouring Primal Body... Is this Heaven's favor towards me?"</p><p></p><p>If she obtained the primordial world and completely devoured it, her realm would rise to another level.</p><p></p><p>Now, she even sensed the aura of the legendary Devouring Primal Body.</p><p></p><p>All devouring bodies revered the Devouring Primal Body as supreme! This body of hers was a devouring body.</p><p></p><p>Now, she actually sensed the aura of the Devouring Primal Body?</p><p></p><p>How could she not be excited?</p><p></p><p>For her, the Devouring Primal Body was even more precious than this world's Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Because it was the most suitable physique for her!</p><p></p><p>She didn't hesitate at all, waking from her slumber, stopping her devouring of the Heavenly Dao, and emerging from the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of violent heartbeats rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This sound was like heavy drums, as if beating on everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods of the Mortal Heart Realm, and even ordinary cultivators, were startled awake at this moment.</p><p></p><p>An intense feeling of hunger enveloped their bodies at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They clutched their stomachs, with conflicting sensations of cramping and emptiness sweeping over them. Everyone's minds seemed to have a piece cut away by a knife in that moment, their consciousness briefly blurring.</p><p></p><p>All living beings in the Mortal Heart Realm couldn't help but look up at the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, at an unknown height, a majestic and terrifying figure appeared in everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>No matter from what angle or distance, that figure was fully visible in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Above True God..."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao... He devoured most of the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"He is undoubtedly the Heaven of the Mortal Heart Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahh, how can such an existence be defeated!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that figure, everyone felt the urge to prostrate themselves in worship.</p><p></p><p>As if wanting to tear themselves apart to feed Him.</p><p></p><p>Just one glance, and they knew He was invincible! The Mythology Plan also seemed particularly laughable!</p><p></p><p>Some people's eyes turned blood-red, with bloody tears constantly flowing.</p><p></p><p>Some knelt on the ground, raving madly, losing their sanity.</p><p></p><p>Only after seeing a Yang God did they know how powerful a Yang God was.</p><p></p><p>"Evil god... die, ahh!"</p><p></p><p>"Rampaging in our Mortal Heart Realm, the evil god must be executed!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the southern lands, seven or eight figures soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Each figure was like the brightest star!</p><p></p><p>Eight pillars of light, with the most fearless courage, shot straight towards that figure in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Eight great lords attacking simultaneously was already an earth-shattering event in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the people watched this scene with full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>Hoping that these eight great lords could injure, even if just slightly injure this evil god.</p><p></p><p>The evil god in the sky looked at those eight pillars of light, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>He spoke, his voice cold and emotionless, just like an immortal seated in the Nine Heavens Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Grains of rice dare to compete with the sun and moon for radiance!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Sage didn't even move, just lightly shouted.</p><p></p><p>This voice seemed like a decree from a heavenly god, or as if words became reality.</p><p></p><p>Boom! To everyone's surprise, with Blood Sun Great Sage's voice, the eight pillars of light in the sky seemed like arrows that had used up all their strength, stopping in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, the eight pillars of light exploded violently. The bright light disappeared at this moment, turning into scattered starlight.</p><p></p><p>Eight great lords attacked together, but didn't even have the qualification to force the Yang God to make a move. With just one cold shout, all eight great lords perished in battle! The Mortal Heart Realm was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Is this... what's above True God?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

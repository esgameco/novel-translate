        <h1>Chapter 341</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang's expression changed several times.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, should the demon blood provided by two early Jade Blood realm demon beasts be enough?" </p><p></p><p>He had an uneasy guess in his mind. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that you can't truly know someone just by their appearance?</p><p></p><p>Was this Qi Yuan not actually intending to give him the entry pass for the Genius Alliance, and deliberately making things difficult for him?</p><p></p><p>"Not enough." Qi Yuan shook his head. Holding two hundred drops of demon blood, he said softly, "The ancestor of Tai Huang Palace is too strong, I need to increase my strength quickly. </p><p></p><p>Hmm... I'll demonstrate for you now... consuming demon blood."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, four hundred drops of demon blood were tossed into the air, then fell into his palms and pores.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao widened her eyes. She hadn't paid close attention the last time Qi Yuan cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This time... she had to watch carefully to see if Qi Yuan was really cultivating with demon blood.</p><p></p><p>She observed Qi Yuan closely, not missing a single detail.</p><p></p><p>"He actually consumed it!" Seeing Qi Yuan's actions clearly, An Qiao's pupils contracted slightly, her eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang was stunned, his mind going blank.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, if you do this... you'll explode and die!"</p><p></p><p>He anxiously warned.</p><p></p><p>Consuming large amounts of demon blood in a short time would be too much for the human body to handle, causing it to explode and die.</p><p></p><p>He felt both anxious and guilty.</p><p></p><p>He thought Qi Yuan had been provoked by his words, and that's why he suddenly consumed all four hundred drops of demon blood? But in the next moment, a mysterious voice came, and Yang Guang was dumbfounded, staring blankly at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You have consumed 400 drops of demon blood and begun cultivation. </p><p></p><p>100 drops of demon blood have been fully consumed, you have gained 100 days of cultivation, your blood essence is abundant, reaching the peak of early Jade Blood realm."</p><p></p><p>"300 drops of demon blood consumed, you wish to advance to late Jade Blood realm in one go. </p><p></p><p>However, despite your talent and intelligence, this demon blood is holding you back, being somewhat nutritionally deficient. Your breakthrough failed, but you gained 300 days of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, Qi Yuan opened his eyes, looking delighted. </p><p></p><p>This time pretending to be the system had new gains, learning to please the host.</p><p></p><p>"See that? I consumed all 400 drops of demon blood and have already advanced to mid Jade Blood realm." Qi Yuan looked at Yang Guang and stretched out his hand. "So, I still need more demon blood. Bodyguard... you know what to do."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yang Guang's mind was in chaos. </p><p></p><p>The scene before him was beyond his understanding.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that Qi Yuan had a special talent?</p><p></p><p>Very good at eating and absorbing? Only this could explain it.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang convinced himself, then looked at Qi Yuan and asked with difficulty: "How much more demon blood do you need?"</p><p></p><p>"Almost enough. As long as the demon blood can help me improve to the point where I can defeat my great enemy, I'll stop killing," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Because of the innate seed, the strength increase in this world would almost completely feed back to his original body.</p><p></p><p>So improving here was equivalent to improving in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Yang, you're not giving up, are you?" Seeing Yang Guang hesitating, Qi Yuan continued, "If it's too difficult for you, this time you don't have to face the demons alone. I'll join you in taking action."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I can do it!" Yang Guang answered loudly.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much Qi Yuan could consume, there had to be a limit.</p><p></p><p>Besides, his enemy, the ancestor of Tai Huang Palace, was probably only at mid Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Killing one or two more mid Jade Blood realm demon beasts would surely be enough.</p><p></p><p>It's fine, just hang on a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>He was at the peak of mid Jade Blood realm, even able to match Zhou Yuan in strength.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yang Guang so full of confidence, Qi Yuan couldn't help but praise: "This bodyguard is worth hiring!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, of course I won't let Brother Qi down.</p><p></p><p>For this mission, whenever we encounter demons, I will slay them for Brother Qi, take their blood, and ensure Brother Qi returns fully loaded!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang was putting on a brave face while suffering inside. After all... he had taken the lead in the previous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Since they had come this far, he had to see it through perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yang Guang's words, Qi Yuan was very happy.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi was also very happy.</p><p></p><p>After all, the demon corpses could all be used as food.</p><p></p><p>Next, all the yamen runners who had followed returned to Zhenyang carrying the demon corpses.</p><p></p><p>Only Huo Mushi remained in the mountains, guiding the way for Qi Yuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Over the next half day, they went to three more territories of scattered demons.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang slew three late Blood Essence realm demons, two early Jade Blood realm demons, and even one mid Jade Blood realm demon.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he looked completely different from when he first entered the mountains full of vigor. He was covered in injuries, his blood martial energy depleted, looking quite miserable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yang Guang return carrying the demon beasts, Qi Yuan couldn't help but give a thumbs up: "So powerful, I really can't see where your limit is.</p><p></p><p>This time you went to hunt demons while swaying unsteadily, I thought you would ask me to go with you, but unexpectedly... you came back.</p><p></p><p>I really want to sing you a song called 'Lone Warrior', but unfortunately I'm too old and can't remember the lyrics."</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." Yang Guang was panting heavily, looking at Qi Yuan resentfully.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was exactly what he wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to ask Qi Yuan... where is your limit? With so much demon blood already, yet... you still want more? However, he had made a promise, and even with tears in his eyes, he had to see it through.</p><p></p><p>"Here, have a watermelon and take a break." Qi Yuan tossed a watermelon, which Yang Guang caught.</p><p></p><p>He held the watermelon and ate it slowly.</p><p></p><p>The watermelon that had tasted ordinary before now seemed so delicious.</p><p></p><p>It was because... his blood martial energy was severely depleted.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, if he encountered another Jade Blood realm demon, he would have to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he depleted more blood martial energy, he would lose his ability to protect himself and be unable to leave Shu Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Are you not up for it anymore? You look so weak," Qi Yuan asked Yang Guang caringly.</p><p></p><p>"No, protecting you is no problem at all!" Yang Guang threw the watermelon rind on the ground forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"That's good. Seeing your complexion, I thought you might have kidney deficiency," Qi Yuan naturally couldn't diagnose illnesses, but whenever he saw someone who seemed sick, he would say it was kidney deficiency, which was right eight or nine times out of ten.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm extremely strong now. I can kill one demon if one comes, or a whole group if a group comes!" Yang Guang said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>A man can't say he's not up for it.</p><p></p><p>And... the label of kidney deficiency couldn't be put on his head! An Qiao, watching from not far away, couldn't help but giggle.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, I'm relieved," Qi Yuan sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>Noticing the change in Qi Yuan's expression, Yang Guang was slightly stunned. Looking at the gradually darkening sky, he tentatively asked: "Today... are we still killing demons? Isn't it too late?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not a heartless capitalist. I won't make you kill demons late into the night," Qi Yuan quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>He strictly adhered to the eight-hour workday.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>His life was saved.</p><p></p><p>"However..." Qi Yuan sighed, "I'm not killing demons, but demons are coming to kill me.</p><p></p><p>We've been on a killing spree on the outskirts of Shu Demon Mountain today, attracting the attention of the demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>In order to attract more demon beasts to come, so we can obtain more demon blood, I deliberately... didn't conceal our auras.</p><p></p><p>So... not far from us, there are over ten demon beasts heading this way.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... their strength isn't great, not as strong as the ones you've killed.</p><p></p><p>Just three early Jade Blood realm and over ten Blood Essence realm."</p><p></p><p>"???" Yang Guang's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to hear a cracking sound, which was the sound of his heart breaking.</p><p></p><p>"What... demon beasts are coming this way?"</p><p></p><p>He quickly scanned outwards, and was shocked by what he saw.</p><p></p><p>He immediately locked eyes with over a dozen pairs of eyes.</p><p></p><p>His heart jolted in alarm.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At present, if he were entangled by these dozen or so demon clan members, he might truly run out of energy.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't spoken yet when he saw Qi Yuan's expectant gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang, it's your turn to take action. I want their demon clan essence blood."</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang felt like crying but had no tears, his legs trembling uncontrollably. </p><p></p><p>He seemed to recall the look his wife gave him after several years of marriage, back when he wasn't yet a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi... why don't we escape?" Life was still more important than saving face.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yang Guang accepted reality and decided to flee after all.</p><p></p><p>If he lost his fighting strength and got entangled with this group of demons, attracting the attention of the demon camp's army, he really wouldn't be able to leave Shu Demon Mountain alive.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, they still needed to go to Wind Flower Cave to meet the flower demon Man Luo and complete their mission.</p><p></p><p>"Escape?" Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment, looking at Yang Guang. "Why should we escape? They're not that strong, not as strong as the ones you killed before."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Guang stammered: "As the saying goes, there are no bad fields, only overworked oxen. There are... too many demons on this Shu Demon Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"The more the better, it's a feng shui treasure land," Qi Yuan said, then looked at Yang Guang with disappointed eyes. "I understand now, you're sick, you have kidney deficiency. It seems... I'll have to rely on myself this time."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan stood up directly.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang's expression changed slightly: "You've just entered the mid-stage of Jade Blood Realm. Why don't we... leave first? Once we get entangled, and people from the demon camp surround us, we won't be able to leave."</p><p></p><p>An anxious look also appeared on An Qiao's face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, running was the best option.</p><p></p><p>"Why run away?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile. "Today, when I picked up this stick on Shu Demon Mountain, I understood... Shu Demon Mountain... is my blessed land."</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's hand was a perfectly straight stick.</p><p></p><p>Such a straight stick was rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>When young people found such a stick, they felt like they were the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Holding this stick, Qi Yuan also felt excessively powerful.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the wooden stick and pressed forward fearlessly: "Women, children, and those with kidney deficiency... stay put. Today, I will protect you all!"</p><p></p><p>An Qiao and Huo Mushi were moved.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang wanted to retort that he didn't have kidney deficiency.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in this atmosphere, it wasn't appropriate for him to speak up and break it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, more than ten demon clan members appeared.</p><p></p><p>They were colorful and oddly shaped.</p><p></p><p>The leader was a dog demon.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Demon Suppression Department people who have been killing demons recklessly on Demon Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>The dog demon's expression was vigilant as it sized up the four people before it.</p><p></p><p>The other two demons at the initial stage of Jade Blood Realm also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had been sent to investigate after learning that two late-stage Blood Qi Realm demons had been killed.</p><p></p><p>As a result... the enemy was stronger than imagined.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to live, leave behind your demon clan essence blood!" The dog demon spoke, clearly not wanting to clash head-on with Qi Yuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>After all, with two Jade Blood Realm cultivators on the opposite side, if they fought, their casualties might be quite severe and not worth it.</p><p></p><p>They intended to pretend to let them leave, then summon more demon soldiers to surround and kill them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Guang was excited internally, wishing he could agree on Qi Yuan's behalf.</p><p></p><p>However, a cold voice came:</p><p></p><p>"When I picked up this wooden stick, it was destined that this night... would not be peaceful."</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, his blood martial energy boiled, and Qi Yuan pounced towards the dozen or so demon clan members like a giant bird.</p><p></p><p>Although he was in the Yuan Dan Realm, in this world he had dropped a major realm, like an Yang Shen who hadn't reached the Ultimate Principle Realm going to another world.</p><p></p><p>But... when he was in Qin Yuan Country, with the company and help of the golden canary, Qi Yuan's cultivation level increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>After all, what to do when spiritual energy was insufficient? Find the golden canary for a kiss, transfer some spiritual energy over, and cultivate dual cultivation by the way.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level increased quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, he was already at the peak of Yuan Dan Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was only one step away from the Divine Infant Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the game, he also had late-stage Jade Blood Realm strength.</p><p></p><p>Without using martial arts power, just using immortal cultivation power, he could easily kill these demon clan members.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light passed over the wooden stick.</p><p></p><p>"Grow!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the wooden stick in his hand seemed to be covered in golden light, becoming like the Golden Cudgel.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wielded the wooden stick, majestic and awe-inspiring, sweeping across in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The huge wooden stick looked as if it weighed a hundred thousand jin.</p><p></p><p>The wind stirred up by its swing directly uprooted and sent flying the surrounding trees.</p><p></p><p>The huge roaring wind was like gods and demons whispering.</p><p></p><p>The powerful wind wall directly trapped these dozen or so demon clan members, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The leading dog demon's face was full of shock and fear.</p><p></p><p>The other demons were the same, their jaws truly dropped by the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they didn't have much time left to be shocked.</p><p></p><p>The huge wooden stick directly smashed down on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Even if they revealed their true forms, they had no ability to resist this strike.</p><p></p><p>As the wooden stick like the Golden Cudgel smashed down, it instantly crushed them into meat paste.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Instant kill in a flash!</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Huo Mushi's eyes widened, filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's expression was exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Last time... Qi Yuan wasn't this strong, right? Yang Guang's face was full of shock and suspicion.</p><p></p><p>No way, brother, you're this strong, you can easily kill me now, yet you still asked me to be a bodyguard? How insulting is that?</p><p></p><p>Also... is this martial arts?</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan displayed seemed not to be martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But rather... the legendary immortal dao.</p><p></p><p>But... doesn't immortal dao entering this world reduce one's level by a major realm? Then how strong must Qi Yuan's true self be? His mind shaken, he dared not think further.</p><p></p><p>At this time, with several hundred drops of demon clan essence blood credited, Qi Yuan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>As if he had just killed a dozen ants.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to smash them into paste, no need to bury them, they'll enter the soil and nourish flowers."</p><p></p><p>The wooden stick in his hand returned to its original form as Qi Yuan spoke casually.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yang Guang smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>He felt like his previous self was a bit of a clown.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's strength, did he need his protection? Even Zhou Yuan probably couldn't withstand one of his strikes.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, you've hidden it from me so well. Your strength... is even greater than mine. Me protecting you is simply a joke." Yang Guang sighed.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the Genius Alliance's proof was hopeless now.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I've already dropped my disguise towards you and shown part of my strength. Shouldn't you also drop your disguise towards me?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Yang Guang blinked, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning. "What disguise do I have?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you dare to challenge the ancestor of Tai Huang Palace, my great enemy?" Qi Yuan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"..." Yang Guang made an aggrieved expression. "I thought... he was very weak. To be your opponent, I am certainly no match!"</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan looked at Yang Guang, his expression calm. After about a few breaths, he said, "You're not lying. The source of your bloodline is indeed far inferior to his."</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang looked puzzled, not quite understanding Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>What did this have to do with the source of his bloodline?</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't agree with saying the source of his bloodline was weak.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan practiced immortal cultivation and had a high realm in reality, being a big shot,</p><p></p><p>The source of his bloodline was an existence that could be called an ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't dare say these words.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's actions were quite incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

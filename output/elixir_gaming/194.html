        <h1>Chapter 194</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dusk Lord naturally noticed Qi Yuan's constantly blinking eyes, which he found strange and didn't understand the meaning of.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan sighed and said: "I also want to make a hundred flowers bloom, I also want to obtain the supreme treasure."</p><p></p><p>Whether a hundred flowers bloomed or not, Qi Yuan didn't care. What he was thinking about was obtaining the supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun's two supreme treasures nearly made him drool.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat depressed, wondering why it wasn't the Golden Flood Dragon who obtained them. The Dusk Lord beside him heard Qi Yuan's words and seemed to understand the meaning behind them.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat amused and walked over to Qi Yuan: "I've heard that the Origin Venerable Lord has unparalleled talent in visualization. Why don't you give it a try? Perhaps you can make the hundred flowers bloom."</p><p></p><p>The Dusk Lord's words immediately drew everyone's attention to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were also quite interested in this mysterious Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace's eyes lit up, looking at Qi Yuan with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"But among the gods I know, I don't know the Jade Flower Great Venerable," Qi Yuan answered honestly. "If I can't make the flowers bloom, you won't mock me, will you?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan looked around at the surrounding ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods all waved their hands.</p><p></p><p>"How could that be?"</p><p></p><p>"Blooming is a good thing, not blooming isn't bad either. Why would we disparage you?"</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable Lord, just try as you please. If anyone dares to speak ill, I'll be the first to deal with them!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods were extremely amiable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "There are still more good people in this world, everyone is so easy to talk to."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought that if it were characters from TV shows or animations encountering this situation, and they reasoned like him, asking others not to mock...</p><p></p><p>Probably, those people wouldn't dare to mock either.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who mocked would be beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>"Since you all want me to give it a try, I'll try then. What if... the flowers bloom?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it was just a try, to see if he could obtain the supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan entered the Visualization Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Just passing by the group chat, many messages caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive father!"</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive father has come to visualize again!"</p><p></p><p>"I, East River, don't believe it. How could he succeed in visualization? How could there be such a ridiculous thing in the world? There were only so many true gods in the Great Flood War! There couldn't be so many fish that slipped through the net! Could he really be a true genius?"</p><p></p><p>"It's settled!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't speak in the group chat. He didn't want to acknowledge a bunch of adopted sons.</p><p></p><p>He entered the visualization realm and immediately saw the Visualization Mountain.</p><p></p><p>After brief consideration, Qi Yuan said softly:</p><p></p><p>"Unparalleled beauty in the world, a hundred charms and thousand allures that painting cannot capture."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the illusory image of a woman of a thousand charms and a hundred allures, dressed in colorful clothes of purple and red, appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Star Golden Pill shone, and the second questioning of the heart began again.</p><p></p><p>A few breaths later, East River in the group chat nearly spat blood.</p><p></p><p>"Has my luck as the East Heaven Emperor really run out? How can there still be legendary ones!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the golden light and the chirping of hundreds of birds, East River was completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan opened his eyes in the Hundred Flowers Meeting.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Hundred Flowers Fairy can bring me some unexpected gains."</p><p></p><p>The others were also looking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a golden light flashed, and a visualization method appeared beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Legendary!" The previously friendly Step-on-Sky-Twice widened his eyes, filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>This time, making the hundred flowers bloom wasn't about the level of the visualization method.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, even an ordinary one could make flowers bloom.</p><p></p><p>This time, at the Hundred Flowers Meeting, not even a rare one had appeared.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, a legendary one came.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"A legendary level... in ancient times, this would definitely be a powerful being above Step-on-Sky-Six!"</p><p></p><p>Such a visualization method could almost create a great venerable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing it at the Hundred Flowers Meeting was truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>The Dusk Lord saw this scene and was also very shocked in his heart, but less so than the others.</p><p></p><p>After all, with twenty-one legendary ones before, one more was easier to accept.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, very much wanting to figure out what his identity was in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Why did he know so many powerful true gods from ancient times?</p><p></p><p>And these true gods were all unheard of to him.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable Lord, what connection does this god have with the Jade Flower Great Venerable?" the Dusk Lord couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace also looked expectant.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful visualization method, the visualized god might really know the Jade Flower Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>It might really be able to awaken the Jade Flower Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"This god is named the Hundred Flowers Fairy, hailed as the lord of a hundred flowers. She probably doesn't know the Jade Flower Great Venerable," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The others heard this and all felt unfamiliar with the name Hundred Flowers Fairy.</p><p></p><p>"They're both related to flowers, perhaps the Jade Flower Great Venerable knows this Hundred Flowers Fairy!" The Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan with full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>The original Hundred Flowers Meeting had been declining with each session, and this one was even more miserable.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable had almost no chance of awakening.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the sudden appearance of the Hundred Flowers Fairy, the Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace naturally held high hopes for her.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was looking at the visualization method beside Qi Yuan, expecting to see the flowers bloom.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the visualization method and said softly: "Go, Hundred Flowers Fairy."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the illusory image of a woman appeared above the visualization method.</p><p></p><p>The woman walked gracefully, holding a colorful ribbon. Even though it was just an illusory image that didn't exist in the world, the ancient gods present seemed to smell a faint exotic fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Fragrant through four seasons, butterflies lingering in the evening breeze.</p><p></p><p>They saw the illusory image of the Hundred Flowers Fairy extend a finger.</p><p></p><p>Her finger seemed to cross space, touching every flower simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Some were buds waiting to bloom, some were already in full bloom.</p><p></p><p>This scene puzzled the ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an ancient god widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This flower..."</p><p></p><p>He said half a sentence, glanced at Qi Yuan, and dared not continue.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace's pupils suddenly contracted: "What's going on, the flowers... why are they closing?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, as soon as the illusory image of the Hundred Flowers Fairy appeared,</p><p></p><p>All the flowers at the Hundred Flowers Meeting underwent a huge change.</p><p></p><p>But this change wasn't blooming, but most of them... closed up, changing from blooming flowers to buds, some even disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace's question, Qi Yuan mumbled: "Maybe they've become introverted."</p><p></p><p>The others heard Qi Yuan's words and tried hard to hold back their laughter.</p><p></p><p>They felt that it was a miracle Qi Yuan had lived to this age.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace beside suddenly turned her head to look at Qi Yuan: "Quick, make her stop, stop!"</p><p></p><p>If this continued, all the flowers at the Hundred Flowers Meeting would become introverted.</p><p></p><p>All their years of effort at Jade Flower Palace would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this scene and couldn't help but sigh: "It's too late."</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the Hundred Flowers Fairy's illusory image, three-quarters of the originally blooming two-thirds of the flower bunches chose to become introverted.</p><p></p><p>The number of blooming flowers on the scene became extremely few.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Meeting would now be more appropriately called the Hundred Buds Meeting.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods saw this scene and had words they dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>They could only communicate secretly.</p><p></p><p>"How is this the Hundred Flowers Fairy, this is the Flower Destroyer Fairy!"</p><p></p><p>"Not making flowers bloom but closing them, this Hundred Flowers Fairy doesn't live up to her name!"</p><p></p><p>"The Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace has met with great misfortune!"</p><p></p><p>"This bitter pill, I'm afraid she can only swallow it."</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods felt sorry for Jade Flower Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Meeting planned for over a thousand years, ruined just like this.</p><p></p><p>The blooming flowers were less than a quarter.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master of Jade Flower Palace collapsed to the ground without any dignity, her eyes lifeless: "It's over, it's all over!"</p><p></p><p>With these flowers closed, it would be extremely difficult for them to bloom again. Her master, the Jade Flower Great Venerable, probably would never have a chance to awaken.</p><p></p><p>The people of Jade Flower Palace looked dejected, their hearts filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods who came to participate also looked</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sorrow seemed to color her face, as if she felt regret.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly smiled and said, "I understand now, why these flowers have closed themselves!"</p><p></p><p>His smile was jarringly out of place amidst the sadness of those present.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Palace Master looked at Qi Yuan, gritting her silver teeth, wishing she could bite him.</p><p></p><p>Who among them cared why the flowers had closed? </p><p></p><p>What they cared about was how to make the flowers bloom, how to awaken the Jade Flower Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were like a solo performance, with no one to accompany him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paid no mind to everyone's reaction and continued speaking to himself: "On the Queen Mother's birthday, the immortals came to offer blessings. One fairy suggested having the Hundred Flowers Fairy come to make all flowers bloom simultaneously to add to the festivities."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was drawn in.</p><p></p><p>Who was this Queen Mother?</p><p></p><p>"However, flowers bloom according to their own timing. The seasons and locations all differ, so how could they violate their natural rhythms and bloom at will? The Hundred Flowers Fairy was unwilling to make all flowers bloom at once, and refused the proposal."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recounted the story from his memory.</p><p></p><p>This story was somewhat similar to the tale of Wu Zetian and the peonies.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present pondered this story, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>They understood that the closing of the flowers here was likely due to the Hundred Flowers Fairy's influence.</p><p></p><p>She was unwilling to see flowers blooming chaotically.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of it this way, it made sense.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how reasonable, the fact remained that all the flowers here had closed.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Palace Master's expression was grief-stricken, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>But just then, an ethereal voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the Venerable One for imparting the Dao."</p><p></p><p>With this voice, all the ancient gods felt their hearts skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>From deep within the Jade Flower Palace, a beautiful woman gracefully approached.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze shifted from confusion to clarity.</p><p></p><p>Around her neck, she wore golden flower ornaments. On her white long dress were embroidered three strange and exotic flowers.</p><p></p><p>As she arrived, it was as if a hundred flowers bloomed at once, the sky cleared, and a subtle fragrance wafted through the air.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Flower Great Venerable!" exclaimed an ancient god who had reached the second step of heaven-treading.</p><p></p><p>For the newcomer was none other than the Jade Flower Great Venerable, who had been in slumber for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Palace Master was stunned at this moment, looking at that familiar figure with excitement in her eyes: "Master!"</p><p></p><p>This person was indeed her master, the Jade Flower Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>How had her master awakened!</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable walked towards Qi Yuan, placing her left hand over her right in a gesture of respect: "This humble woman has long been stuck at the fourth step of heaven-treading, unable to consolidate the divine office of the Flower God. Today, hearing the Venerable One's words, I have suddenly gained enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable had been injured and asleep, and to awaken, there were actually only two paths.</p><p></p><p>The first path was for all the flowers in this place to bloom, restoring all of her memories.</p><p></p><p>If it happened this way, she would awaken, but it would still be the injured version of herself.</p><p></p><p>The other path was to break through her own limitations and comprehend the divine office of the Flower God.</p><p></p><p>No one in the Jade Flower Palace had considered this path.</p><p></p><p>Because even if a Great Venerable were to intervene, they couldn't help the Jade Flower Great Venerable comprehend the divine office of the Flower God.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the Jade Flower Great Venerable were awake, comprehending the divine office of the Flower God would not be easy.</p><p></p><p>But now, Qi Yuan's visualization of the Hundred Flowers Fairy causing the flowers to close, and his words, had allowed the Jade Flower Great Venerable to grasp the essence of the Flower God's divine office, leading to her breakthrough and awakening.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods were shocked to hear this.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Flower Great Venerable... has broken through?"</p><p></p><p>"She's grasped the Flower God's office?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were incredibly envious.</p><p></p><p>A divine office was something even Great Venerables coveted immensely.</p><p></p><p>Gods at the Venerable level couldn't even touch these things.</p><p></p><p>Only Great Venerables had a glimmer of hope of touching a divine office.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerables who touched a divine office were considered to have the potential to surpass true gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a saying.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, even with so many Great Venerables who had grasped divine offices, none had truly broken through to surpass true gods.</p><p></p><p>But this was already terrifying enough.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Venerable's single visualization technique had not only awakened the Jade Flower Great Venerable but also allowed her to gain insight into the divine office.</p><p></p><p>This was too incredible! The other ancient gods looked at Qi Yuan with burning gazes.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable stepped forward, without any of a Great Venerable's airs: "If the Venerable One does not object, this humble woman is willing to take you as her master!"</p><p></p><p>These words shocked everyone present even more.</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable wanting to take as her master someone who wasn't even a true god, but only at the Purple Palace realm!</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Palace Master's eyes widened - didn't this mean she would have to call Qi Yuan her grand-master in the future?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Jade Flower Great Venerable and shook his head: "I don't take disciples."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to take disciples.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words shocked the others even more.</p><p></p><p>If it were any of them in this situation, how could they not accept?</p><p></p><p>This was a Great Venerable! And one without ill intentions, truly coming with goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Accept first and think later! Ye Liuyun stood to the side, his expression constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable was slightly taken aback, clearly not having expected this outcome.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan, her flowery eyes reflecting mountains and rivers, as if she had made some decision: "This humble woman is willing to serve by the Venerable One's side at all times."</p><p></p><p>This made the ancient gods present even more dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This was a Great Venerable, and such a beautiful one at that.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Jade Flower Great Venerable and said casually: "I don't need a maid. How about this - why don't you become a citizen of my Qingshui Village?"</p><p></p><p>In any case, the dialogue between Qi Yuan and the Jade Flower Great Venerable had completely baffled the others.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable nodded, her eyes showing joy: "Many thanks to the Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, such a conversation was essentially equivalent to signing a contract.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Jade Flower Great Venerable acknowledged it and Qi Yuan permitted it,</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable was now Qi Yuan's citizen.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, our village finally has a Great Venerable. This visualization technique, I'll reward it to you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually gave away a precious visualization technique.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care at all who he was giving it to.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were his citizen, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Great Venerable accepted the visualization technique, and even as a Great Venerable, she was quite excited.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, since I awakened you, shouldn't the treasures here that can help true gods break through belong to me?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>His purpose in coming to the Hundred Flowers Gathering was for the treasures.</p><p></p><p>Gaining the Jade Flower Great Venerable as a citizen was completely an unexpected bonus.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" The Jade Flower Great Venerable nodded, waving her delicate hand. Instantly, twenty-five treasures flew from the North Sea God's Eye into her hand, "Currently, the North Sea God's Eye has only produced twenty-five, all of which are here."</p><p></p><p>The North Sea God's Eye was a special place where treasures would occasionally appear.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Palace had more treasures than most ordinary supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the twenty-five treasures, feeling delighted: "This trip wasn't in vain, I've profited."</p><p></p><p>These words left the Jade Flower Palace Master at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods also felt that this Origin Venerable was really too much.</p><p></p><p>Didn't gaining the Jade Flower Great Venerable count as profit?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Jade Flower Great Venerable and thought of something. He said, "Haven't the North Sea Dragon Clan sent someone to apologize to me yet?"</p><p></p><p>With the Jade Flower Great Venerable by his side, Qi Yuan decided to directly borrow her authority.</p><p></p><p>The North Sea Dragon Clan had offended him, and this matter wouldn't be settled without some compensation in treasures.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, they would definitely have said that it was already good enough that the North Sea Dragon Clan hadn't come to make trouble for you, let alone apologize - what were you thinking?</p><p></p><p>Now, with Qi Yuan saying this, it actually seemed reasonable.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Flower Palace Master's expression changed several times before she stepped forward respectfully and said, "Several old dragons of the North Sea Dragon Clan have already awakened and are probably still discussing the matter of the ancient battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Qi Yuan had killed the Golden Flood Dragon, the Jade Flower Palace Master had naturally been keeping an eye on the movements of their neighbor, the North Sea Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>Within the North Sea Dragon Clan, there was still an old dragon at the third step of heaven-treading.</p><p></p><p>At this time, these dragons should still be discussing the death of the Golden Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Their action is too slow, no wonder they don't amount to much," Qi Yuan said casually. "Jade Flower Great Venerable, lead the way. I want to go take a look at the North Sea Dragon Clan."</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Venerable One," the Jade Flower Great Venerable smiled charmingly.</p><p></p><p>For her, serving the Venerable One was also a good way to get closer to him.</p><p></p><p>PS: There's one more chapter coming around 2:30.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

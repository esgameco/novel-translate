        <h1>Chapter 532</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It means exactly what you think it does."</p><p></p><p>The staff member of Thorn Blood typed out this message.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he was quite pleased, just waiting to see the shock on Cai Dao and Ji Wuyun's faces.</p><p></p><p>As a Void Traveler of the Void Paradise, his descent into this world was more like a player entering a game.</p><p></p><p>It's normal for players to feel superior to the natives, right?</p><p></p><p>"I! Don't! Understand!" Ji Wuyun seemed to have thought of something, her head a bit muddled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Thorn Blood staff member's smugness grew even greater: "Brother Cai Dao, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see Cai Dao's shocked and disbelieving expression even more.</p><p></p><p>After all, in their previous interactions, Cai Dao had always been unfazed, maintaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was confident he could shock Cai Dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, now he was telling a native that the world they live in... has already had its future written, everything following its predetermined trajectory.</p><p></p><p>Probably, some self-important ones would find this hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>"So, can you show me the Blue Mountain Book? I want to take a look at the game walkthrough."</p><p></p><p>"..." The Thorn Blood staff member fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Cai Dao was just too calm, not like a normal person's reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>"Your fate has already been determined, aren't you curious at all?"</p><p></p><p>"Where has it been determined? Didn't I already change some special events and raised my Mandate?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He could accept this situation easily.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just like normally playing a game?</p><p></p><p>"Quickly tell me, what special events have I changed?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Cai Dao's heart is just too big, isn't it? If someone told him that everything he's experienced... is actually predetermined, he would have a hard time accepting that result.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you now?" the Thorn Blood staff member asked.</p><p></p><p>"Dingbo Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"According to the records in the Blue Mountain Book, Dingbo Prefecture has two recent special events.</p><p></p><p>Both are just at the beginning, not yet fully realized.</p><p></p><p>Although leaking the Blue Mountain Book is like revealing Heaven's secrets, this is the Divine Wood Decree, no matter what is said, there will be no consequences.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and the things I say here, don't let them spread out, or else... you'll incur the Heavenly Retribution."</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member said warmly.</p><p></p><p>He originally came to this world to complete a task, and he didn't have any real malice towards Cai Dao and the other woman.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Wuyun felt nervous inside.</p><p></p><p>"One is called the Great Liang Mutiny, which will happen about three months from now.</p><p>The Blood-Handed Four Grand Prefects' son Liu Wen suppressed Wind and Thunder General Li Zhao, ultimately forcing Li Zhao to mutiny."</p><p></p><p>"The other one is also called the An'ze People's Uprising. The skilled worker Wang An was bullied by a merchant's steward, so in a fit of rage he killed someone. This eventually drew the attention of the authorities, who were accustomed to wanton cruelty - not only did they execute Wang An, they also carried out a bloody massacre at the docks, enraging the common people. Chang Le, the leader of the skilled workers, contacted workers from all over to surround the authorities and demand an explanation, alarming the Prefect."</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member stopped there.</p><p></p><p>"What happened in the end with the An'ze People's Uprising?" Ji Wuyun asked.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the mutiny, she was more concerned about the people's uprising.</p><p></p><p>She felt that the fault lay with those minor officials beforehand, and as long as the court punished those minor officials, this would be a good opportunity to win over the people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>If she were the Prefect, she would definitely seize this chance to rally the people.</p><p></p><p>"The result? Of course, the ringleaders of the uprising were beheaded and displayed, while the minor officials who carried out the bloody massacre at the docks went unscathed." The Thorn Blood staff member chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"How could that be?" Ji Wuyun was perplexed, "It was the common people who were in the right!"</p><p></p><p>This was clearly a good opportunity to win over the people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"If their hearts were satisfied today, wouldn't that only increase their mentality of 'resisting from below'? Using this to coerce the officials?</p><p>Today punishing the minor officials, tomorrow punishing the County Magistrate, the day after punishing the Prefect, the day after that... Could it be that they would even punish the Emperor?"</p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member's eyes held a mocking look.</p><p>He had been to many worlds to complete tasks, and was most familiar with those wearing the black official hats.</p><p></p><p>"So, the things I did, changing those special events, is that why... my Mandate has been raised?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>It seems that secretly throwing that merchant's steward into the water to drown was considered an accident.</p><p>The authorities also didn't send anyone to trouble Wang An, so naturally there was no bloody massacre at the docks, and no An'ze People's Uprising.</p><p></p><p>"This world has many special events, if you originally bore the Mandate of Heaven, and changed the course of these special events, then your Mandate would become increasingly more profound." The Thorn Blood staff member reminded.</p><p></p><p>Having more Mandate doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"So... our fate is predetermined... following the original trajectory, even if I bite myself now, or... even commit suicide, it's all fated?" Ji Wuyun felt on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>It's as if there's a big hand manipulating her fate, and she's just a marionette.</p><p></p><p>Even her current reaction might be predestined.</p><p></p><p>"Am I in the Blue Mountain Book?" She was now very eager to open the Blue Mountain Book.</p><p>She must not follow what's written in the Blue Mountain Book.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is already determined, except for some people with special mandates who can slightly change the established situation, the rest of you... are no different from puppets.</p><p>Oh, and the Blue Mountain Book doesn't record just any old person, probably... you don't have the qualifications to be in it, haha..."</p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to leave a trace of your existence... why not come to the Divine Wood Abyss? Although I can't record your name in the Blue Mountain Book, I'm confident I can add your names to another book." The Thorn Blood staff member tempted.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of being recorded in a book? Hey, if you give me a hundred thousand taels of silver, I'll remember you for the rest of my life." Qi Yuan spoke up at this point, "That's much more useful than writing in a book."</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member laughed: "Even after countless ages and eras, the Blue Mountain Book will still exist. Brother Cai Dao, even if you are Cai Dao, you'll probably have long rusted and decayed."</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun also felt that Qi Yuan was just talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Being remembered by someone... what's the use of that?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So... the background setting of this game, even the ending, has already been written?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Divine Wood Decree, Qi Yuan's thoughts were complex.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he remembered something.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm have no future, it was severed by a single sword.</p><p></p><p>Then... if the Immortal Realm hasn't had its future severed?"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying idea and speculation suddenly surged in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>A future that can be seen at a glance... is it still the future?</p><p></p><p>"Stop overthinking, or your brain will grow bigger."</p><p></p><p>"Nine-tenths of the troubles in this world stem from overthinking."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just playing a game, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"This is just a game."</p><p></p><p>Having thought through these things, Qi Yuan no longer indulged in wild speculation.</p><p></p><p>He sat in the recliner, carefully studying the forging techniques left behind by that divine-level Armament Master.</p><p></p><p>Before his eyes went blind, he had to quickly improve his Armament Master level.</p><p>After going blind, it would be very difficult to make progress.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qi Yuan suddenly opened his eyes, a hint of joy in his deep gaze: "I finally know the exact location of the Blood Cloud Bandits' headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Not only that, his drone had also investigated the locations of their other strongholds.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to go take a look."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>An hour later, at the Judgment Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chun'winter was anxious: "Where's Brother Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao lowered his head, eating a bun: "The young master said he went out to take care of a private matter, he'll be back in a day or at most three days."</p><p></p><p>"He left?" Liu Chun'winter heard this, feeling a bit disappointed, "Why did he leave at this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there something important?" Chen Kangbao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"A Judgment Court Elder is passing by our place, I wanted to take him out to see the world, but unfortunately..." Liu Chun'winter said, disappointed.</p><p></p><p>It's not just about showing him the world, that Elder brought the latest news.</p><p></p><p>About the Divine Descent!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the elder said, although the Divine Descent has perished, fragments of it remain.</p><p></p><p>In the distant Ninguo, the Divine Descent once left divine traces.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qi is from Ninguo, perhaps he knows something, she plans to take Qi Yuan to meet the elder of the Judgment Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Can we get in touch with him?" Liu Chiwinter asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Judgment Hall is estimated to only stay here for about half a day, and is likely to leave early tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao shook his head: "No."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chiwinter's disappointment grew even stronger: "If Elder Qi comes back, let him come find me quickly."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Liu Chiwinter left with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, the mountains and rivers were pitch black, looking into the distance, it was all a black curtain, only the scattered twinkling stars in the sky were not stingy in shedding some starlight.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the entire mountain still could not see five fingers in front of one's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Blood Cloud Stronghold, torches were burning, with billowing smoke.</p><p></p><p>The torches were tied with various plants, and when burned, they had a pungent smoky smell and black smoke, driving away mosquitoes, but even so, the mosquitoes here were overly numerous.</p><p></p><p>Inside the stronghold, various sounds of drinking, laughter, and women's cries could be heard, making it particularly eerie.</p><p></p><p>The bandits guarding the stronghold gate, hearing those alluring sounds, had greedy eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, a new batch of two-legged sheep just came in, and it's us few who are on guard duty," one bandit couldn't help but curse under his breath.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this batch is no good, I heard they are military prostitutes, already played by those soldiers, not interesting," another bandit said.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I like the ones that have been ridden by many, alive... wait a minute..." Suddenly, this squint-eyed bandit narrowed his eyes and perked up his ears, "Have you guys heard any sounds?"</p><p></p><p>"You must be craving for women so much that you're going crazy," another bandit mocked.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The squint-eyed bandit's heart suddenly raced.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The sound was getting closer and closer, like the footsteps of a giant.</p><p></p><p>The few bandits guarding the gate all felt the ground shaking, as if an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the squint-eyed bandit looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Terrified, he sat down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost!"</p><p></p><p>"Monster!"</p><p></p><p>He was filled with terror, constantly struggling to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The other bandits also looked up at the sky at this time, their faces turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Monster!"</p><p></p><p>Any bandit who looked up at the sky was filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, through the faint starlight, the outline of a huge figure could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red armor, blood-red crystal armor plates were densely arranged, emitting a dangerous glow.</p><p></p><p>Barbed crystal spikes, sharp and exposed, reflecting some starlight.</p><p></p><p>The entire body was covered in red armor, concealing everything, and the only exposed part, the pair of eyes, was how cold and bloody.</p><p></p><p>That kind of coldness was not human eyes! It was a giant dragon, a divine being.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying giant looked towards the Blood Cloud Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Any bandit who was stared at by those eyes lost their courage.</p><p></p><p>"Monster!"</p><p></p><p>"Monster!"</p><p></p><p>These bandits dared not resist, crying and screaming as they fled deeper into the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying hundred-meter-tall giant stood silently outside the stronghold, quiet and motionless, silently observing everything.</p><p></p><p>Outside the stronghold, chaos erupted, the chaos spreading inward, and some torches fell to the ground, igniting some thatched huts.</p><p></p><p>After about tens of breaths of time, a scolding voice came from deep within the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Useless!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster is attacking!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's a Heaven-level Anomaly Spirit, it will die here!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, three Heaven-level Armored Warriors wielding large swords or spears appeared.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was a giant, over two meters tall, with muscles piled up like small mountains on his body, standing in place like a wall that even a thousand soldiers could not push down.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!"</p><p></p><p>The burly giant swung his sword, splitting a fleeing bandit in half.</p><p></p><p>The other bandits fleeing backwards then calmed down slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Big Boss..."</p><p></p><p>This burly giant was the Big Boss of the Blood Cloud Bandits, a Heaven-level Armored Warrior.</p><p></p><p>A Heaven-level Armored Warrior in the Luosha Kingdom could even be enfeoffed as a Baron.</p><p></p><p>In the Blood Cloud Stronghold, there were as many as three Heaven-level Armored Warriors!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The Big Boss let out a cold snort, shouldering his large sword, overbearing and domineering, "Is this the enemy that has scared you all so much?"</p><p></p><p>He was dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Bandits are just bandits, both ignorant and useless.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Prince's grand plan, how could he have become the Boss?</p><p></p><p>"Where is the enemy?" </p><p></p><p>The Big Boss swept his gaze around, not seeing any sign of anyone.</p><p></p><p>The other two Heaven-level Armored Warriors also had a look of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Bandits are just bandits.</p><p></p><p>"It... is in the sky!" A bandit swallowed hard, not daring to look up at the sky, not daring to make eye contact with those eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In the sky, can it fly? Earth-level?" The Big Boss sneered contemptuously, raising his head, "Let me slash it with one sword..."</p><p></p><p>His smile froze, and his body tensed up at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the other two Heaven-level Armored Warriors also froze at that moment.</p><p></p><p>A hundred-meter-tall giant?</p><p></p><p>Heaven-level Armored Warriors can borrow the power of Heaven and Earth, but only within a radius of tens of meters.</p><p></p><p>A single sword strike can split a dozens-of-meters-tall building.</p><p></p><p>But... that was a building, an inanimate object.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, this was... a terrifying living being! In the sky, that majestic figure remained motionless, like the Grim Reaper that had walked out of Hell.</p><p></p><p>Whoever saw it, their legs would tremble.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, that terrifying figure moved.</p><p></p><p>A cold, merciless voice resounded through the heavens and earth at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Slaughter Fist!"</p><p></p><p>The Hellish Grim Reaper suddenly threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the shockwaves surging through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>This power was not the power of Heaven and Earth, but even greater than the power of Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>This power swept away everything in its path, and no one could stop it!</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>The three Heaven-level Armored Warriors let out terrified screams.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their screams were useless, only the last proof of their existence in this world.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Crash! Under the divine, all beings are equal.</p><p></p><p>This punch did not hit anyone, but the power pierced through any person's body.</p><p></p><p>Booming sounds rang out, then immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Blood Cloud Stronghold, a third of the living beings perished under this one punch.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Hellish Demonic God's eyes remained cold.</p><p></p><p>It gazed at the remaining bandits.</p><p></p><p>"One Slaughter Fist!"</p><p></p><p>Another punch was thrown.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth were silent, only the sound like a thunderous drum could be heard.</p><p></p><p>The entire Blood Cloud Bandit group, over ninety percent of the living beings perished.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Slaughter Fist was a technique created by Qi Yuan during his time in the Orb Star, used to destroy the Slaughter God Sect.</p><p></p><p>In these days, he used his eyes to adapt this fist technique to this world.</p><p></p><p>Even just now, he had adapted it into the One Slaughter Fist.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who has committed atrocities against ordinary mortals, under this one punch, would have no place to exist.</p><p></p><p>Under two punches, thousands of bandits perished, only some ordinary civilians and military prostitutes who had been abducted were still alive.</p><p></p><p>At this time, those ordinary civilians were groveling on the ground, their bodies trembling, their hearts both relieved and terrified.</p><p></p><p>Because the majestic being in the sky looked like the Grim Reaper that had walked out of Hell, seemingly able to reap everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know whether this terrifying giant was an Anomaly Spirit, a Demonic God, or something else.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the lips of the majestic figure in the sky moved, and a solemn divine voice resounded through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The world is without light, but the Divine Descent is seen!"</p><p></p><p>"Holding the light, driving away the darkness!"</p><p></p><p>"If there is any injustice, call upon me, the Divine Descent!"</p><p></p><p>The groveling civilians had some with a puzzled expression, and some with a buzzing head.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what this meant.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, an old man over eighty years old suddenly raised his head, looking at the majestic figure in the sky, his body trembling and shaking: "He... has returned!"</p><p></p><p>And at this time, more and more civilians seemed to have remembered something, their faces filled with joyous excitement.</p><p></p><p>"He... has returned!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

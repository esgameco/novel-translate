        <h1>Chapter 331</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince was slightly stunned, many thoughts flashing through his mind, unable to understand Qi Yuan's words for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Seventh Prince and Gongyi Cai didn't understand, Qi Yuan explained:</p><p></p><p>"It means letting the people... vote on their fate. </p><p></p><p>At that time, I'll have my robot Zero One collect all the information about their lives.</p><p></p><p>All the evil deeds they've done, all the good deeds, will be listed out.</p><p></p><p>Then... options will be given, letting the people vote on whether they should die, be imprisoned, or... be released without charges."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>Those people, he had never met them, so he couldn't say he disliked them, nor did he have any feelings about them.</p><p></p><p>So... just let the voting decide the results.</p><p></p><p>After all... isn't it quite fun?"</p><p></p><p>"This..." The Seventh Prince hesitated, not expecting this kind of referendum.</p><p></p><p>He had thought it would be the members of the Seven Star Martial Families voting.</p><p></p><p>This type of referendum was unheard of, unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan couldn't help saying: "Don't tell me the citizens of the Qin Yuan Kingdom don't have the right to vote?</p><p></p><p>But I clearly remember, everyone has the right to vote.</p><p></p><p>Or is that just empty talk?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his voice.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince tensed up inside, and hurriedly replied: "They do, they absolutely have the right to vote!"</p><p></p><p>Although, as Qi Yuan said, it was indeed just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>But now that Mr. Qi had brought it up, how could it remain just talk?</p><p></p><p>They definitely had to vote.</p><p></p><p>However, the impact of this matter was too great.</p><p></p><p>A nationwide vote, with everyone acting as judge - there were too many unpredictable and uncertain factors involved.</p><p></p><p>"If it's possible, why are you still hemming and hawing? Don't tell me... you can't find college students to make a voting website? Or is it that the layers of outsourced websites are too messy, and would crash if too many people voted?"</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince looked bewildered, then immediately assured him: "We in the royal family will fully promote this matter, to serve Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't serve me, I don't need servants. Serve the people." Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Although with his authority, he couldn't agree to this on behalf of the royal family.</p><p></p><p>Such a referendum would require the consent of all the Seven Star Martial Families.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Seventh Prince didn't dare refuse, and directly agreed.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Seven Star Martial Families would agree... there was no need to wonder.</p><p></p><p>How could they have the guts to disagree?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, what awaited them... might also be a referendum.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan turned his gaze to Gongyi Cai: "Long time no see, old fellow. Hmm, you've gotten younger."</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai was stunned, then quickly lowered his head: "Has this old one met Mr. Qi before?"</p><p></p><p>His attitude was very humble.</p><p></p><p>Completely different from when he was at Mitu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, ten years later, or not really - my corpse met you," Qi Yuan said casually. "At that time, you brought a few young people from your family. I remember the one called Gongyi Qing had quite a good attitude.</p><p></p><p>But, there was one whose body had been hollowed out by wine and women, I think his name was Gongyi Lang. He looked down his nose at people, extremely arrogant, almost committing the crime of desecrating a corpse."</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Qi Yuan had become a corpse, Gongyi Qing had been quite respectful towards him.</p><p></p><p>That Gongyi Lang, on the other hand, had spoken nonsense and used foul language.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gongyi Cai's face suddenly crumpled, cold sweat dripping from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He understood now that Qi Yuan was a Restarter.</p><p></p><p>This Restarter must have died, and ten years later, the Gongyi family had sent them to communicate with Qi Yuan's corpse.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he heard that someone from the Gongyi family had been disrespectful to Qi Yuan. His expression became worse than if he were crying.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, do you want your servant to blow a breath at the Gongyi family?" Ning Tao said considerately beside him.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Cai immediately knelt on the ground, his expression tense: "Mr. Qi, please spare us!"</p><p></p><p>He had seen that the woman beside Mr. Qi had nearly destroyed the Sky Eye with just one breath.</p><p></p><p>If she blew a breath at the Gongyi family, would anyone in the Gongyi family survive? Gongyi Cai was naturally terrified, and directly kowtowed begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan said to Ning Tao: "Am I some kind of demon, always killing and fighting? That's not good. It's just a small matter, not worth mentioning. If I hadn't seen Gongyi Cai, I probably would have forgotten about it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gongyi Cai finally breathed a sigh of relief, the weight lifting from his heart.</p><p></p><p>As long as they didn't blow a breath at the Gongyi family, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he hated that little brat Gongyi Lang to death in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That guy was a second-generation rich kid, with guts too big for his britches, actually daring to mock Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for Mr. Qi's mercy in not killing us."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also felt very fond of Gongyi Qing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This Gongyi Qing wasn't from the main branch, but was very ambitious.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, someone in the clan had proposed supporting Gongyi Qing, but the proposal was rejected.</p><p></p><p>Now that Mr. Qi had mentioned Gongyi Qing, that rejection was naturally void.</p><p></p><p>The Gongyi family would not only support Gongyi Qing, but would treat him as the true leader of the younger generation of the Gongyi family!</p><p></p><p>"You clean up here, I can't be bothered to bury them. Arrange a banquet. </p><p></p><p>Now that I've come to the capital, it's still early, I need to go play for a couple of days."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually, hugging Ning Tao as their figures disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the room, only the Seventh Prince and Gongyi Cai were left, along with the corpses strewn across the floor.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince held out his palm, which was covered in sweat, showing how nervous he had been just now.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his heart was excited and thrilled.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gongyi Cai and slowly said: "This voting matter, shall I handle it together with... Gongyi Qing?"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know who Gongyi Qing was, Qi Yuan had mentioned him, so he must be given an important role.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Gongyi Cai nodded hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules, these things needed the clan leader's approval.</p><p></p><p>But given the special circumstances now, what did the clan leader matter? Mr. Qi was the true king! The king who ruled over all!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the entire capital had descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Seven Star Martial Families - their high-level figures had immediately discovered the fall of the Mu family's thirteen Sky Eye fortresses.</p><p></p><p>This matter was earth-shattering, making all the Seven Star Martial Families tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>That was the Sky Eye, the foundation on which the Seven Star Martial Families were built.</p><p></p><p>How could the Sky Eye have been breached? This was more terrifying than if a nuclear war had broken out in the world.</p><p></p><p>So, countless personnel, vehicles, and information were sent to the Mu family, trying to find out what had happened.</p><p></p><p>But the conclusion they received made them even more shocked and terrified, unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that a single human had single-handedly destroyed thirteen Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>This... was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Eye was said to be capable of slaying gods.</p><p></p><p>But... a human woman had easily defeated it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in a hall three thousand meters underground, the clan leaders of the Seven Star Martial Families had gathered, their expressions all grim.</p><p></p><p>"Destroying the Guiran military camp, killing three thousand soldiers with one sword was already enough to shock the world.</p><p></p><p>But... his companion... is a hundred times, a thousand times more terrifying, actually destroying thirteen Sky Eyes with one palm!" The old clan leader of the Gongyi family said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>The other Seven Star Martial Family clan leaders present nodded seriously upon hearing this: "Even the gods in myths and legends... couldn't be more than this, right?"</p><p></p><p>There were a total of twenty-one families in the Seven Star Martial Families.</p><p></p><p>Now, these twenty old people had gathered together to discuss the events of today.</p><p></p><p>"If that woman wanted to, I'm afraid... our Sky Eyes would also be destroyed in an instant." The old clan leader of the Fang family spoke in a decrepit voice, but no one dared ignore his words.</p><p></p><p>The Fang family was one of the top three families among the Seven Star Martial Families.</p><p></p><p>Their status was even a notch higher than the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>But even so, in the heart of the Fang family's old clan leader, he also understood that they</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That higher section was useless for Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>"This person... is too terrifying. </p><p>His companion... is also... simply inhuman!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, when facing the unknown, we should maintain reverence.</p><p>The Mu family has accumulated power for a thousand years and is used to acting tyrannically, not taking others seriously. Now they have stumbled and fallen beyond redemption. Sigh, a thousand-year-old family... doesn't even qualify to be someone else's servant. It's truly... laughable to the extreme."</p><p></p><p>After the old man finished speaking, he seemed somewhat dispirited. </p><p>It was as if something he had taken pride in his whole life had completely disappeared.</p><p>The power and influence in this mundane world... was indeed like nothing in the eyes of those at higher levels.</p><p></p><p>"After detection, the methods used by that woman have an immeasurable energy level," an elder spoke up.</p><p></p><p>After Ning Tao destroyed the thirteen Eyes in the Sky, over a thousand warships immediately flew into space to investigate and research.</p><p></p><p>"Although it cannot be measured, the destruction of our Eyes in the Sky... happened in an instant.</p><p>After simulation, we've concluded that such an attack... is enough to erase the nation of Guiran from the map.</p><p>Note, this is erasure, not just killing all the humans there, but the complete disappearance of Guiran from this world.</p><p>Most importantly, we don't know if this is her limit."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, shock flashed across the eyes of everyone present.</p><p>Even with their power and composure, they were moved by this.</p><p></p><p>The Eyes in the Sky were powerful, but to wipe out all humans in Guiran would require several Eyes activated simultaneously.</p><p>And that would only eliminate humans, not other living beings.</p><p></p><p>Yet that mysterious woman could completely erase Guiran from the map with a single strike.</p><p>What kind of concept was this? An incomprehensible concept.</p><p></p><p>"So... everyone, don't think about resistance, sneak attacks, or trying to win her over.</p><p>We simply cannot fathom beings of this level.</p><p>Our proud technological civilization and cultural heritage may be less than a nap to them."</p><p></p><p>The Fang family patriarch spoke up, his voice filled with deep helplessness. Perhaps due to nervousness, there were even grammatical errors in his speech.</p><p></p><p>If immortals still left traces to ponder,</p><p>Ning Tao's display was completely unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Can human power... sink an entire continent?</p><p>How many megatons of bombs would that take?</p><p></p><p>"So this old man proposes we stop discussing here.</p><p>No amount of discussion will be useful.</p><p>Regarding Mr. Qi and that mysterious woman, we only need to maintain reverence for the unknown.</p><p>At the same time, strictly order the younger generation of our families not to cause trouble outside.</p><p>Whoever causes trouble will be expelled from the family at the least, and face... the death penalty at worst!"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Fang's attitude was firm and resolute.</p><p></p><p>"I second that, I don't want our family to be put to a public vote!"</p><p></p><p>"If Mr. Qi puts us to a public vote, I'm afraid we won't have any ability to resist."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, sometimes... going down in history isn't so bad."</p><p></p><p>The other old patriarchs all agreed.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan hadn't said anything, they understood what should and shouldn't be done.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Qi Yuan, they no longer dared to directly investigate his privacy like Duke Blue Sea had, but only looked into his publicly available information.</p><p></p><p>This public information also revealed a glimpse of Qi Yuan's personality.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... a psychiatric certificate, somewhat unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>But overall... he could be considered someone who repays kindness with kindness and enmity with enmity, and "respects and obeys the law".</p><p></p><p>Since he was like this, they would play along with his "act".</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, I will personally go pay respects to Mr. Qi. Who will come with me?" Old Master Fang spoke up, then added after thinking of something, "This old man will go in person."</p><p></p><p>For people of their level, having cloned bodies was extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>Cloned bodies would usually remain dormant, only substituting for them in special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go in person too."</p><p></p><p>"I'll also go in person!"</p><p></p><p>These old fellows now understood that Qi Yuan absolutely could not be offended.</p><p></p><p>Sending a cloned body would be disrespectful to Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the streets of the capital, Qi Yuan had his arm around Ning Tao... no, more precisely, Goldfinch as they walked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan held a brick in his hand, a thoughtful look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I've always heard that if you randomly throw a brick in the capital, you'll hit a bureau chief. I wonder if that's true?"</p><p></p><p>Rarely coming to the capital, he very much wanted to test this out.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch tilted her head with a pondering expression: "Blood Pearl, I think that would be difficult. There aren't many people around us."</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll leave it to fate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the brick and tossed it into the air.</p><p></p><p>This time he didn't use much strength, only throwing it tens of thousands of meters high.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he deliberately cast a spell, afraid of killing someone.</p><p></p><p>Even if this brick fell and hit someone, it wouldn't harm them in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go quickly and see who it hit." Seeing the brick start to rapidly fall, Goldfinch was also excited. Holding Qi Yuan's arm, she wanted to see if it would hit a bureau chief.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look." Qi Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>In life, it was rare to have someone to fool around with.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly flew towards where the brick was falling.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the streets of the capital, the sun was a bit glaring.</p><p></p><p>Many people were looking up at the two suns in the sky, taking photos and checking in on social media.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiming walked dejectedly on the street carrying a black bag.</p><p></p><p>He came from a rural background. When he went to university, the villagers had sent eggs, sweet potatoes, whatever they could to support him in attending a top university.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that top universities in the Qinyuan Kingdom were extremely expensive.</p><p></p><p>He had also worked very hard, working part-time jobs while studying in college, and started a business right after graduation.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, one of his investment projects developed very quickly.</p><p></p><p>In just five years, his company was worth a billion.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he also started giving back to his hometown.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that his "small company" would catch the eye of a second-generation rich kid from a powerful family.</p><p></p><p>That privileged person wanted to directly pluck the fruit of his labor. Without a strong background, he had no way to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Various departments started making things difficult for him, and business partners began refusing to communicate with him.</p><p></p><p>All to make him sign a contract.</p><p></p><p>After signing, the company would no longer be his, and he would become an employee.</p><p></p><p>Although the salary would be high, he was very resentful.</p><p></p><p>Because his plans to invest in projects in his hometown would have to be shelved.</p><p></p><p>"This is absolutely shameless, how can they do this!" Huang Weiming felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't some immature youngster either.</p><p></p><p>He also understood the concept of making concessions.</p><p></p><p>After all, such things happened often, usually losing a bit for mutual benefit in the end.</p><p></p><p>But... that second-generation Mu family member... was too shameless, wanting to take everything without leaving him anything?</p><p></p><p>Completely dishonorable!</p><p></p><p>How could he not be angry, even wanting to curse the heavens.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head, his eyes filled with intense anger.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the anger in his eyes turned to fear.</p><p></p><p>He saw what looked like a brick falling from the sky, about to hit him on the head.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiming cried out in fright, unable to react in time.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the brick landed on his head.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because... he wasn't injured at all.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came from nearby: "Hey... are you a bureau chief?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

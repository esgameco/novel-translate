        <h1>Chapter 346</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Who knows who plays the flute in the heavens, blowing down jade flowers to fill the world.</p><p></p><p>North and south, in the midst of the Xi River, snow drifts for ten thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>On city walls, in wine houses, in small rural courtyards, everyone looks up at the sky, gazing at that terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Staff Demon Slayer... has destroyed the Xi River Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually been destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that the Red Staff Demon Slayer would battle the Xi River Demon, and that this battle was approaching. But they didn't expect it to begin so suddenly and end so quickly. </p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths... it was over.</p><p></p><p>It seemed too hasty.</p><p></p><p>That was twenty thousand demon soldiers, led by the Xi River Fish Woman! Yet in the hands of the Red Staff Demon Slayer, they were more fragile than a nest of ants.</p><p></p><p>In the Xi River, the once mighty demon army melted away like snowflakes under a scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>That blood-red terrifying figure stood in the sky, like a god.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared at that figure, their expressions frenzied or awed.</p><p></p><p>"This world, this realm - if the Red Staff Demon Slayer wanted it, he could take it with ease!"</p><p></p><p>"With this level of power, even a hundred thousand Imperial Dragon Guards probably couldn't stop him!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a true uncrowned king, a martial arts sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>Countless people exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>All doubts vanished in this moment. Those who had harbored dark thoughts of scheming now became open and honest in the face of Qi Yuan's overwhelming strength.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the blood-red figure in the sky descended, landing on a hillside a thousand meters away.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored armor disappeared. That blood-red figure stood out starkly against the snow.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Shi, let's go. It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>In the vast snowfall, the blood-red figure didn't spare a glance for the onlookers, leaving only his back to view.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mu Shi in the wine house hurriedly grabbed the ropes, pulling two black sacks. The demons and humans inside the sacks quickly trotted after him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, not a single person in the wine house dared to follow.</p><p></p><p>The Green Pearl County Lady hesitated, then finally shouted with all her might: "Master, are you leaving?"</p><p></p><p>She had a feeling that if the Red Staff Demon Slayer left, she might never see him again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still didn't turn around. At this moment, he was silently consuming the demon blood essence.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, slaughtering twenty thousand demon soldiers had given him a vast amount of demon blood essence.</p><p></p><p>This much demon blood essence was a great help to him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, just now... how much did you learn?" The words slipped out, and Qi Yuan paused, remembering Moon Woman.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if he was getting old, always thinking of people from the past.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Green Pearl County Lady hesitated, "Zero percent."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, we'll meet again if fate allows." Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to say more.</p><p></p><p>In this world, he was just a passerby, a game player.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finished speaking, his gaze falling on the blood-red wooden staff, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his hand flicked out.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red wooden staff was tossed into the Xi River.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant smile appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "It would be interesting if a monkey picked you up."</p><p></p><p>With most of the demons in this world exterminated, it was time for him to complete his mission and leave.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in this world, he had reaped a bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>In less than a year, he had reached the realm of Martial Spirit, comparable to the Divine Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>These white moons really spoiled him.</p><p></p><p>Having thrown away the staff, Qi Yuan vanished from sight, alone and unencumbered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>On a small boat.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay lazily on the boat, like a pampered young noble out for a pleasure cruise.</p><p></p><p>At the other end of the boat were two black sacks.</p><p></p><p>The black sacks were tightly wrapped, looking like they contained people.</p><p></p><p>As for what was inside these black sacks, there were many theories among the people. Some said they contained peerless beauties, hidden away by the Red Staff Demon Slayer. Others said they held supreme treasures, the source of the Red Staff Demon Slayer's incredible power.</p><p></p><p>Now, these mysterious black sacks were finally opened, revealing just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had his back to the Flower Demon and the young Tong Youwei, not even glancing at them.</p><p></p><p>The once arrogant Flower Demon now felt both joy and shock, but mostly calm.</p><p></p><p>When she was first captured, she thought it was just some ignorant person.</p><p></p><p>But after all she had seen and heard along the way, her heart had grown numb and trembling.</p><p></p><p>"My lord..."</p><p></p><p>She carefully chose her words, afraid of angering this peerless martial artist.</p><p></p><p>In her heart, she also had intense curiosity.</p><p></p><p>What exactly did this person want with her?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shifted to a more relaxed position, still not looking at the Flower Demon. His leisurely voice rang out: "Tell me the story of Tong Youwei and the Flower Demon Manlo."</p><p></p><p>After hearing the final TV drama, it would be time for him to leave this treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>No, with the demon race exterminated, this place could no longer be called a treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Flower Demon looked confused, not understanding why this supreme expert would ask about this.</p><p></p><p>However, she still answered truthfully, though her eyes held a trace of hatred.</p><p></p><p>"The beginning of the story is clich√©. At Wangshan Temple, fierce winds blew and heavy rain poured down.</p><p></p><p>A young master from a noble family, taking shelter at the temple, saw a flower being battered by wind and rain. He took it under the eaves.</p><p></p><p>The flower in his arms also remembered his scent.</p><p></p><p>Later, ten years later, that flower cultivated into human form and deliberately approached that young noble. At Wangshan Temple, the two reunited, and as time passed, feelings grew. During one heavy rainstorm, they tasted the forbidden fruit..."</p><p></p><p>The subsequent developments were also very melodramatic and convoluted.</p><p></p><p>That young noble was the only male heir in seven generations of the Tong family, exceptionally doted on by his parents.</p><p></p><p>It could be said he had never suffered any hardship, having grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>When the Tong family patriarch learned his son was involved with a demon, he naturally refused and confined the young man.</p><p></p><p>After all, if his son married a demon, what would happen to the Tong family's reputation? Moreover, even if a human and demon married, they could only produce monstrous offspring.</p><p></p><p>The Tong family, due to their bloodline, had only a single heir in each generation.</p><p></p><p>If that demon gave birth to a monster, wouldn't the Tong family line be cut off? The Tong patriarch met with Flower Demon Manlo and said that the Tong family bloodline couldn't be broken. Only after Tong Youwei married a proper wife and had children would they be allowed to meet.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know that at that time, Flower Demon Manlo was already pregnant.</p><p></p><p>To avoid giving birth to a monster, she went alone to the Ten Thousand Thorns of Shu Demon Mountain, her body covered in wounds, just to pick a Shedding Origin Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The Shedding Origin Fruit could ensure her child would be born safely and normally, but... the price was her own life.</p><p></p><p>Later, I was born, and Tong Youwei married a new wife."</p><p></p><p>The young face of the Flower Demon bore a deep-seated hatred.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the funniest part is that Tong Youwei's wife could never get pregnant.</p><p></p><p>He panicked, afraid that he was infertile and would be laughed at.</p><p></p><p>Haha, so, to have a child, he took his wife to Wangshan Temple and had a monk... Hahaha, and finally Tong Tianyou was born.</p><p></p><p>But, fearing the scandal would come to light, he had his wife killed as soon as Tong Tianyou was born.</p><p></p><p>Father and son living in harmony, old and young getting along well, their days passed so nicely.</p><p></p><p>So, I poisoned Tong Tianyou and tricked the Tong patriarch, saying that to save Tong Tianyou, they needed the heart of his closest relative, Tong Youwei! They always claimed to love their son, willing to pluck the stars from the sky for him.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But they felt that Tong Youwei couldn't have a son, while Tong Tianyou could still have a son. So they personally drugged Tong Youwei and sent him to me, asking me to save their grandson. At that time, when I was removing his heart, he cried so pitifully, constantly repenting.</p><p></p><p>The old Madam Tong cried her eyes out. Haha, it was she who tricked Tong Youwei into drinking the drugged tea.</p><p></p><p>Hair turning white overnight, the affection between close relatives, how touching indeed.</p><p></p><p>But in the end... what bullshit love, they only loved themselves and that feeling of love!"</p><p></p><p>The flower demon's voice was frenzied and hysterical. </p><p></p><p>Towards the Tong family and Tong Youwei, she was full of resentment, as if she wanted to eat their flesh and swallow their bones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lay on his side and yawned lazily: "It's indeed quite complicated. Fortunately I didn't grow a brain at Wangshan Temple, otherwise... I wouldn't have been able to see so many of my dear moonlights.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, before leaving, I can still watch a play, that's not bad either."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the flower demon standing on the flat boat revealed a ferocious smile in her eyes: "When I was three years old, I dug out my uterus and turned it into a magical weapon. They... the Tong family will have no descendants, hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that for her, this was the most thorough and best method of revenge.</p><p></p><p>The flower demon laughed maniacally, desolate and miserable.</p><p></p><p>Tong Tianyou stood to the side, looking at the flower demon, his expression somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>As if he too had been infected by the flower demon, his mood became somewhat low.</p><p></p><p>"The world is too chaotic, why think too much? I have a sword, I'll cut it off myself."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a lazy voice came, and that figure was seen rising.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Tong Tianyou's expression changed slightly, all his previous worries dissipating.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and lowered his head, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the flower demon stumbled, her emotions collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan viewed everything before him as a play, though he occasionally appeared on screen.</p><p></p><p>"Mushi, after I leave, go back to Zhenyang and tell the Tong family master that their family line has ended."</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the demons in this realm had been slain, and he couldn't be bothered with the few remaining stragglers. It was time to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Sir!" Huo Mushi looked at the empty space in front, his expression momentarily lost.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qinyuan Country, Tianyue City.</p><p></p><p>In a three-bedroom apartment, a woman wearing thin silk pajamas lay with her eyes tightly closed, cold sweat breaking out on her forehead, her bangs in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she woke with a start, gasping for breath.</p><p></p><p>"Another nightmare?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao sat up, her face full of deep fear.</p><p></p><p>These days, she had nightmares every night.</p><p></p><p>She dreamed that a crack appeared between heaven and earth, and a woman who looked exactly like her appeared and stabbed her to death with a knife.</p><p></p><p>The woman's cold expression was still vivid in her memory.</p><p></p><p>She had been having this dream for three consecutive days.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not really suffering from kidney deficiency, am I, having such strange dreams?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao looked anxious.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, she saw cracks appearing in the sky, and countless strange figures or demons appearing.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to come from other worlds, wearing various ancient costumes, or riding technologically advanced warships.</p><p></p><p>Fighting each other!</p><p></p><p>She was also killed by an ancient version of herself.</p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, dreams are projections of the real world.</p><p></p><p>These dreams of mine should be related to the descent of cultivators to Gongxing half a year ago."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao comforted herself this way.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, world cracks appeared above Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Four major cultivation worlds connected with Gongxing, and countless cultivators descended upon Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>This caused a huge impact on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators could fly in the sky, move supernaturally, with speeds comparable to fighter jets, displaying powerful and mysterious abilities.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these cultivators caused great turmoil in Gongxing society.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there was even a great demon who, wielding a banner of ten thousand souls, threatened to massacre the city.</p><p></p><p>This great demon was an ancestor of a demonic sect, a demonic powerhouse, a Divine Infant Elder.</p><p></p><p>At that time, people were in panic.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the Eye in the Sky demonstrated its powerful might.</p><p></p><p>It directly pinpoint eliminated that great demon.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the whole of Qinyuan Country cheered in excitement.</p><p></p><p>The four major cultivation worlds were also shocked by this incident.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't expected that Gongxing would have such a terrifying weapon of this level.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Seven Martial Stars sat down with the four major cultivation worlds for a month-long negotiation, signing many contracts.</p><p></p><p>Some were about trade, some about establishing cultivation grounds and cultivation schools.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao thought that it was because of these events that left a deep impression on her, so... she dreamed of other worlds also descending upon Gongxing, and someone exactly like her appearing to kill her.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity Qi Yuan is gone, otherwise I could have him check if I'm possessed by a ghost.</p><p></p><p>He's a cultivator, he knows a lot."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Niao thought.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, she had looked for Qi Yuan several times.</p><p></p><p>The news she got was that Qi Yuan was not around now.</p><p></p><p>This made her quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a cultivator, and he was familiar with her. Perhaps he could investigate her recent nightmares.</p><p></p><p>She had helped Qi Yuan treat his mental illness before, now... it would be reasonable for Qi Yuan to help treat her illness, right?...</p><p></p><p>Tianxuan Building, people coming and going, all sorts of people gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Folks, this is Tianxuan Building." The female streamer, dressed scantily, filmed the building in front with her phone. "It's rumored that this building was given by the Seven Martial Stars to the mysterious cultivation sect Xuantian Sect. This is also the first famous cultivation sect in our province."</p><p></p><p>Back then, four cultivation worlds connected with Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Various sects decided to leave their legacies on Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Like Xuantian Sect, which had a Divine Infant Elder presiding over it, it was an absolute major sect.</p><p></p><p>This kind of legacy was called a top-grade immortal sect.</p><p></p><p>Its status, placed on the Blue Star, would be equivalent to a top university.</p><p></p><p>As for other small cultivation sects, well... they were much inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, our province has such a large population, why do we only have one top-grade immortal sect!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity they only recruit disciples based on talent!"</p><p></p><p>"See, so many people kneeling outside Tianxuan Building, just to seek a chance at immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I also want to join a top-grade immortal sect like Xuantian Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"My neighbor, a 60-year-old single lady, finally joined a sect comparable to Xuantian Sect, and then was favored by a marquis who directly married her!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister, check the inner lining, avoid getting scammed."</p><p></p><p>In the live streaming room, people from all over the country looked at Tianxuan Building, their eyes revealing envy.</p><p></p><p>Joining such a major sect was truly like a fish leaping over the dragon gate, becoming an elite for life.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the roof of Tianxuan Building, a tall woman with star-like eyebrows and sword-like eyes looked quite haggard.</p><p></p><p>She scanned the people kneeling below Tianxuan Building, her expression disappointed: "All... trash spiritual roots!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

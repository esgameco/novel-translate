        <h1>Chapter 411</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leaving from the edge of the universe, Qi Yuan pondered how to ascend to the upper realm. His figure flashed, and he appeared above a pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he had swallowed three thousand worlds, he had eaten a bit too much and felt drowsy after being full, which was quite normal. </p><p></p><p>Hearing this from not far away, Jiang Lingsu's pretty face blushed slightly, her towering bosom trembling and swaying mesmerizingly. She seemed to be hinting at something: "If Senior Brother is tired, come... take a nap."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced over, remembering the soft jade and warm fragrance he had embraced last time.</p><p></p><p>This was a real breast pillow! Using this to test a Purple Palace cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"I can't sleep in this paradise of tenderness. I need to go to the upper realm," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of seeing his junior sister this time was to tell her about this matter.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Light Sect, on the Seven-Colored Peak, only he and his junior sister remained.</p><p></p><p>If he left without informing his junior sister, making her worry, it wouldn't be right.</p><p></p><p>As for the Original God Sharing Association and the Four Emperors of Divine Flowers, he notified them through jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Well, he still knew how to distinguish between close and distant relationships, and had a tiny bit of favoritism towards women over friends.</p><p></p><p>The joy in the depths of Jiang Lingsu's eyes suddenly receded, replaced by intense reluctance. But soon after, she raised her head and looked at Qi Yuan with anticipation: "Senior Brother, is Master in the upper realm? Can I go to the upper realm with you to find Master?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered. He had previously told Jiang Lingsu about his speculation that their master was in the upper realm, so it wasn't surprising that she knew.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qi Yuan didn't speak, Jiang Lingsu came over and hugged his arm, saying pitifully, "Senior Brother, I won't cause any trouble. If I do, you can just put me back in your Purple Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop... pretending!" Qi Yuan could hardly handle it.</p><p></p><p>This junior sister was too good at acting!</p><p></p><p>"Does Senior Brother agree?" Jiang Lingsu blinked her eyes, revealing joy in her beautiful eyes, and her speech returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go then, we'll venture into the immortal realm together as brother and sister!"</p><p></p><p>He had always been generous towards Jiang Lingsu, this angel investor.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained Qi Yuan's permission, Jiang Lingsu beamed with joy, then fell into a daze and said, "Senior Brother, do you think I should put on some ugly makeup? Otherwise, with your junior sister's natural beauty, if we go to the immortal realm and some pampered young master takes a fancy to me, wouldn't that unnecessarily cause trouble for you?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, you're being a bit narcissistic!" Qi Yuan spoke bluntly, affection aside, he still had to retort, "The people in the immortal realm are surely very cultured. Those immortal maidens don't even fart, how could they do such uncultured things?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu nodded: "That makes sense. Ah, I should bring more recording stones this time to the upper realm to document everything!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was very excited, just like a young girl about to go on a trip.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and pack, we need to leave soon." Thinking of something, Qi Yuan asked, "Where's your father? Where did he go? Has he come to cause me trouble?"</p><p></p><p>If he continued to cause trouble, wouldn't it be safer to hide in the upper realm?</p><p></p><p>"He..." Jiang Lingsu secretly spat, "Recently got a bunch of adopted grandsons."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Junior Sister, doesn't that mean you're about to become a mother?"</p><p></p><p>Descending from his junior sister's pavilion, Qi Yuan went to other places in the Canglan Realm and met quite a few people.</p><p></p><p>First, he met Withered Wood True Lord, and then Kang Fulu.</p><p></p><p>Now, Withered Wood True Lord was in his prime and openly together with the Empress Dowager of the Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was still as flamboyant as before, with a head full of white hair.</p><p></p><p>Later, Qi Yuan went to the Blood Robe Alliance, then to the Original God Sharing Association, and met Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he went to see White Fish Great Venerable and other top experts of the Canglan Realm to discuss matters of rectifying the atmosphere of the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Jianjun, she had gone fishing in the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>She wasn't very keen on going to the upper realm, only saying, "Quickly find Mother and call her."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless about this daughter.</p><p></p><p>Is fishing really that good?</p><p></p><p>On the pavilion, Qi Yuan handed the clothes to Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, these clothes are made from materials from the Underworld, combining defense and disguise.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they can block imprints, but there's one important condition... you can't be too far from me."</p><p></p><p>The imprint of that person from the Tai Huang Palace was still within the bodies of all living beings in the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>If they left Qi Yuan's Purple Palace without the isolation of the Ten Thousand Distinctions Gate, that person from the Tai Huang Palace could kill and harvest all living beings with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Qi Yuan had ordered Qi Qi to make these clothes to block the imprint.</p><p></p><p>However, even if Jiang Lingsu wore these clothes, she couldn't stray too far from Qi Yuan, otherwise, the effect of the Ten Thousand Distinctions Gate would disappear.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu hugged the clothes, thought of something, and then sighed: "This must be very expensive. My storage bag is empty, I can't afford it."</p><p></p><p>In the past, she could act as a rich sister in front of her senior brother, lavishly spending money to support him, boldly saying she didn't need protection.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, didn't you invest in my Purple Palace? There's a lot of interest," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's sense of imbalance slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, turn around, I'm changing clothes!" Jiang Lingsu said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan obediently turned around.</p><p></p><p>Although now the entire Canglan Realm was within his Purple Palace, and he could see everything even without looking, the respect that should be given still needed to be given.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the rustling sounds ended, and Jiang Lingsu had changed into the green dress specially made by Qi Qi, looking quite cute, like an elf.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan knew that this was just her exterior. If peeled away, one would know how alluring and incomparable she was.</p><p></p><p>"Is Junior Sister ready? If you're ready, we'll start going to the upper realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mood was quite calm.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, going to the upper realm was just like switching to a new game for him.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Canglan Realm was all within his Purple Palace, so it wasn't too far from home.</p><p></p><p>"Ready!" Jiang Lingsu nodded seriously, though there was still some worry in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Just as Qi Yuan was about to leave, suddenly a hurried sound came from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of light passed by, and a man dressed entirely in golden clothes appeared. His face bore an anxious expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan, he said respectfully,</p><p></p><p>"Senior... you've swallowed this Canglan Realm, and the teleportation array of the Demon Desire Gate has failed. This junior... can't return to the upper realm!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>He had been slacking off in the Demon Desire Gate, but then... found he couldn't go back.</p><p></p><p>He was anxious.</p><p></p><p>He had come to the lower realm for experience, not to settle down.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Qi Yuan coughed, this matter was indeed somewhat related to him, "This time I'm going to the Fifth Heaven of the upper realm, you can come with me."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was from the upper realm after all, considered a local. Having an extra guide was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Shen Wushen breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Although the Fifth Heaven was far from Mount Futu, at least there was hope of returning, right? If he stayed in the Canglan Realm, he estimated he might never be able to return.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's settled... let's go."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embraced Jiang Lingsu, grabbed Shen Wushen, and his figure suddenly twisted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The world became chaotic in this instant, all perceptions seemed to be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>When vision became clear again, Qi Yuan and the other two had already arrived in a small world.</p><p></p><p>This small world was connected to the Wangyue Continent, its</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The teleportation array led directly to the Demon Luo clan in the Fifth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Two yin spirits were lurking around the teleportation array, likely guarding it. </p><p></p><p>However, even when Qi Yuan and his two companions arrived right in front of them, the spirits didn't notice anything.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen muttered at this time: "The Demon Luo clan originated from the Black Magic Abyss and fought against the Moon Palace. Senior, we're heading to the Demon Luo clan's home turf this time, so we must be extremely careful!"</p><p></p><p>"I know," Qi Yuan nodded. He looked at the teleportation array ahead and said, "Aren't we being very impolite by secretly using someone else's teleportation array? If we're discovered, wouldn't that prove we have no morals?"</p><p></p><p>This time Qi Yuan was going to the Upper Realm not only to see Jin Li and find his master's wife, but also with a grand aspiration:</p><p></p><p>To rectify the atmosphere of the immortal realm. Although according to the Emperor's hoe, the immortal realm's atmosphere must be very good.</p><p></p><p>But in a big forest, you'll find all kinds of birds.</p><p></p><p>Some cleaning up was still necessary. </p><p></p><p>As a result, here he was trying to clean up the atmosphere, yet secretly using a teleportation array without paying. If discovered, wouldn't that be extremely embarrassing?</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was stunned for a moment: "Should we leave some spirit stones then?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't have that many spirit stones," Qi Yuan said reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu beside them suddenly said: "Senior Brother, isn't the Demon Luo clan our enemy?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "Using the enemy's teleportation array shows our trust in them! </p><p></p><p>If they dare to charge us money, that means they don't trust us! They're truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he swept his powerful divine sense over.</p><p></p><p>The two lurking yin spirits were now destined to lurk forever.</p><p></p><p>Their divine souls were extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's hand suddenly grabbed them: "We must repay evil with kindness. Although they don't trust me, I'll still generously collect their corpses!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan directly stuffed the two yin spirit venerable's bodies into the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>Even mosquito meat is meat, it mustn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Shen Wushen was speechless, inwardly feeling fortunate that he had interacted with Senior Qi Yuan for so long and was still alive - his luck was truly good.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we should now boldly step onto the teleportation array to express our trust in the Demon Luo clan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan embraced Jiang Lingsu and stepped onto the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen also hurriedly ran over.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the teleportation array slowly activated.</p><p></p><p>"After arriving in the Upper Realm, we still need to run quickly.</p><p></p><p>Although I trust them, they don't trust me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instructed in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength was very great,</p><p></p><p>He still needed to be careful in the Demon Luo clan's headquarters.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the Buddhist sect, the Demon Luo clan also had four Ultimate Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the Demon Luo clan also possessed Creation-grade treasures.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan recklessly killed in the Demon Luo clan and was surrounded by four Ultimate Realm experts wielding Creation-grade treasures, he would die miserably.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation array activated at this moment, and a vast energy that seemed capable of tearing everything apart swept over them.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu tightly embraced Qi Yuan, her fragrance enveloping him. After all, she was only at the Foundation Establishment stage now and couldn't withstand such a teleportation array with her own body.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was a true disciple of Mount Futu and had treasures bestowed by Mount Futu that allowed him to safely pass through the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly cleared.</p><p></p><p>"Run!" Qi Yuan embraced Jiang Lingsu, grabbed Shen Wushen, and fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>In the Upper Realm, the Great Venerable guarding the teleportation array was bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Did... someone just come through?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's check the teleportation... huh... check what?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Demon Luo Sacred Tower, though called a tower, actually occupied an area not much smaller than the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>From the ground to the sky, its height was unknown, as was the number of its levels.</p><p></p><p>Countless floating cities hung in the sky, surrounding the Demon Luo Sacred Towers one after another.</p><p></p><p>On the ground below were mostly mortals, with few cultivators coming there.</p><p></p><p>The floating cities and Demon Luo Sacred Towers were where the cultivators resided.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on a floating city, Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "The air in the Upper Realm is indeed sweeter, but... wasn't it said that in the Upper Realm, Yang spirits walk everywhere and Myth realm experts are as common as dogs?</p><p></p><p>In this city, forget about Myth realm, why isn't there even a single Yin spirit?"</p><p></p><p>This floating city, in terms of size, was considerably larger than the Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>Among all the floating cities, it belonged to the smaller ones.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen laughed awkwardly: "Senior, Yin spirits are absolute powerhouses no matter where they are!"</p><p></p><p>If he reached the Yin spirit realm, as a true disciple, he could immediately apply to become an elder.</p><p></p><p>This would be an elder of a holy land! In the immortal realm, besides holy lands, there were other sects, numbering tens of thousands or even billions more than the holy lands.</p><p></p><p>Among these sects, those with some strength had Myth realm experts at most, or Great Venerables and Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Some even only had Purple Palace realm, or worse, Yuan Dan realm cultivators, not even comparable to the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Then what am I as a Purple Palace great cultivator?" Qi Yuan asked secretly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>You're still calling yourself a Purple Palace great cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"In areas not belonging to holy lands, even Purple Palace cultivators can be called ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I can be considered a big shot now." Qi Yuan's gaze turned towards the distant Demon Luo Sacred Tower, his eyes full of anticipation, "Up there... so many unwashed moon goddesses."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Wushen said: "The Demon Luo clan has ninety-nine Demon Luo Sacred Towers in total.</p><p></p><p>The ninety-nine Demon Luo Sacred Towers are interconnected.</p><p></p><p>If Senior wants to go to the Demon Abyss at the junction of the Sixth and Fifth Heavenly Realms, you must pass through the Demon Luo Sacred Tower."</p><p></p><p>Each Heavenly Realm couldn't be passed through at will.</p><p></p><p>One must pass through the holy lands.</p><p></p><p>As for ordinary cultivators, without great fortune, they might never be able to leave their own Heavenly Realm in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a deep breath: "How do we get permission to pass through? Can I force my way in?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, cold sweat formed on Shen Wushen's forehead: "This junior only knows how to go down, not how to go up. If we force our way in... we'll likely trigger the restrictions left by the Ultimate Council. Even Yang spirit powerhouses would be banished to the cracks of the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, you locals are not very good tour guides. I'd better ask Wutian instead." Qi Yuan was very disappointed with Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>After coming to the Upper Realm this time, he had originally thought of using him as a tour guide and had asked him many questions.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know the answer to one in three questions.</p><p></p><p>He didn't seem like a local at all.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Wushen felt a bit wronged.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan also communicated with his divine infant, the Wutian Buddha.</p><p></p><p>The current Buddha Realm, ruled by the Buddha country, was located at the other end of the Fifth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan got the answer from the Wutian Buddha.</p><p></p><p>To ascend to the Sixth Heavenly Realm, one needed a Heaven-reaching Jade.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, those Yang spirits of the Demon Luo clan all had quite a few Heaven-reaching Jades.</p><p></p><p>There might also be some Heaven-reaching Jades scattered about in the Demon Luo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Demon Luo Sacred Tower ahead, his eyes full of anticipation: "Let's go to the Demon Luo Sacred Tower!"</p><p></p><p>He had already made plans in his heart, formulating a perfect strategy.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find a Heaven-reaching Jade, he'd go find a moon goddess.</p><p></p><p>With his Purple Palace realm, it wouldn't be too much to hook a foolish moon goddess, right?</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

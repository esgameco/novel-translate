        <h1>Chapter 524</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ruins ahead were shrouded in a deathly stillness, as if enveloped in the deepest darkness. Where was there even a glimmer of light?</p><p></p><p>It was clear that they had failed.</p><p></p><p>"The lineage of the Qingshan Realm's Artifact Masters... has been severed." At this moment, a female voice sounded beside Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>It was a creature, the size of a moth and similar to a butterfly. </p><p></p><p>This spiritual being was an ancient entity that had existed since the dawn of the world.</p><p></p><p>This was what Shen Lingxuan encountered upon arriving at the ruins.</p><p></p><p>"All those who come here to refine the shards of the Luminous Treasure are true prodigies among Artifact Masters. They are gone now... The Dao of Artifacts in the Qingshan Realm will stagnate for hundreds of years," the Butterfly Maiden spoke in a mysterious tone.</p><p></p><p>In the Butterfly Maiden's eyes, the Artifact Masters who ventured into this forbidden place were all extraordinary talents unearthed from various realms. </p><p></p><p>Had they followed the normal path of cultivation, these people would have had a bright future and almost certainly attained great wealth and status.</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Maiden looked at Shen Lingxuan: "Lingxuan, you bear a Heavenly Mandate, you are a person of unique destiny. Among the other things in this forbidden place, you can leave them be, but you must obtain the Source of the Forbidden."</p><p></p><p>"Only a Heavenly Mandate can suppress the Source of the Forbidden, preventing it from thriving. Furthermore, by refining the Source, you can gain various special abilities, hidden within the Qingshan Realm, undetected by... outsiders."</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Maiden spoke with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, once you achieve Unity of Heaven and Man, you will undoubtedly attract the attention of outsiders, and you will meet the same fate as in your previous life - your body destroyed."</p><p></p><p>An aura of icy coldness emanated from Shen Lingxuan.</p><p></p><p>The memories of her previous life surged forth at that moment.</p><p></p><p>In her previous life, she had been a heavenly prodigy, diligently cultivating, but one day, a sword beam fell from the sky, and her body was shattered instantly, leaving no trace of her remains.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike still filled her with a sense of dread when she recalled it. </p><p></p><p>The existence that had wielded it must have reached the legendary Godly realm.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly does the Heavenly Mandate represent?" Shen Lingxuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Maiden paused for a moment, then said, "It represents the will of the world, the belonging of the world."</p><p></p><p>She was clearly being cryptic, not revealing too much. </p><p></p><p>It was also possible that this was all she knew.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's black dress made her look like a black rose, cold and icy: "Muo Sanxong is outside, and the Godly Armored Soldiers from the Luosha Realm are also rushing here. Even they alone would be difficult for me to handle. Obtaining the Source of the Forbidden... will be arduous."</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Maiden swayed slightly: "This is a problem, unfortunately I have no combat prowess, I can't even deal with Earth-ranked Armored Soldiers."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can go out and scout the way for you, so you can avoid some dangers," the Butterfly Maiden said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ah, before exploring the ruins, we should eat our fill, otherwise we won't have the energy," Chen Kangbao said, taking out the buns from his clothes and stuffing them into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As he ate, he held the buns in his hand and spoke to Tuosi Hai and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want some?"</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman covered her mouth, seeming to find the sweaty smell of the buns distasteful: "Thank you, old sir, for your kindness."</p><p></p><p>Since Chen Kangbao was Qi Yuan's attendant, she did not want to offend him.</p><p></p><p>"No, thank you," the others also refused.</p><p></p><p>Only Wang Daoface had a smile on his face: "I'll have some, thank you, old sir."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao, seeing this, was overjoyed: "Here you go!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoface immediately took the bun and stuffed it into his mouth without a care: "Delicious."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we should explore the ruins and find that Muo Sanxong!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The group of eight people gathered their belongings and headed northeast towards the Ten Thousand Mountains Abyss.</p><p></p><p>According to Wang Daoface's description, Muo Sanxong had entered through the seventeenth black gate from the northeast direction.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of night, they moved quickly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the blind old man and humbly asked, "Old man, in a few months, I may also go blind. What do you think is most important for a blind person?"</p><p></p><p>In a few months, he would have to pretend to be a blind Artifact Master, and he had rarely encountered a truly blind person, so he wanted to ask for advice.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man paused for a moment, his left eye was blind, but his right eye was still intact: "Perhaps... it is to regain the light."</p><p></p><p>"To regain the light?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The greatest wish of a blind Artifact Master in this life should be to become a Godly Artifact Master, or to ascend even higher.</p><p></p><p>But can one truly ascend higher while being blind?</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the group took advantage of the night and arrived at a mountain depression.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that an earthquake had once occurred here, causing the soil and rocks to collapse, exposing a corner of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of black iron gates with mysterious patterns were visible.</p><p></p><p>"Half of the iron gates here are already open, and the one we need to enter is also open, otherwise... it would have taken us a lot of time," Tuosi Hai said.</p><p></p><p>The iron gates in the ruins were extremely sturdy, even top-tier masters would find it difficult to destroy them.</p><p></p><p>"Where's it open? There's a dog hole, isn't there?" Chen Kangbao exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The one with the duck-like voice crawled in through that dog hole before," Wang Daoface said, still feeling a bit frightened.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't so difficult to get out after entering, he suspected that the Armored Soldier might have killed him on the spot upon seeing his embarrassing situation.</p><p></p><p>"What dog hole? This is the Dragon and Phoenix Cave," the beautiful woman giggled.</p><p></p><p>Tuosi Hai also laughed: "We're all familiar with it, no need to deceive ourselves, at least we can get in through it."</p><p></p><p>The others also agreed, crawling in was not bad.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man looked at the beautiful woman: "I'm afraid your chest meat is too big to fit through."</p><p></p><p>"Blind old man, be careful I don't poke your good eye when we get in there!" the beautiful woman did not get angry.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at it seriously: "The blind old man is right."</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman's face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else saying this to her, she wouldn't have felt anything.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was a mysterious and powerful expert, a future Godly Armored Soldier, and still so young and handsome.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"A mere gate, everyone watch closely, the son-in-law is going to twist his mouth!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, walking straight towards the black gate.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Black Demon Brothers revealed surprise, and the younger brother couldn't help but say, "This black gate is forged from Puya Iron, even a Godly Armored Soldier would find it difficult to destroy."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he did not have much faith in Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's the kind of feeling I want, you guys should say more similar things, otherwise my twisted mouth won't be fun enough."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Before the son-in-law twisted his mouth, if there was no one mocking him, it would lack soul.</p><p></p><p>It would be best if there was a beautiful woman or handsome man to slap him on the ear.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was afraid of pain, so slapping his face was out of the question.</p><p></p><p>The younger Black Demon Brother's face showed an awkward expression.</p><p></p><p>Tuosi Hai paused for a moment, remembering Qi Yuan's strange personality, and tentatively said, "Brother Qi, striking this black gate may be in vain."</p><p></p><p>He was actually speaking the truth.</p><p></p><p>"The attack power is too weak, I should give you guys a short play, let you see how those people recite their lines!" Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man did not speak, he did not particularly like Qi Yuan's unconventional personality, and only watched coldly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan did not waste any words.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand and gave a light push forward.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous force was transmitted.</p><p></p><p>His hand was like a sharp kitchen knife, transforming the push into a slash.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A thunderous sound rang out, and the seemingly indestructible black gate shattered like a tofu block.</p><p></p><p>A human-sized entrance appeared in the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"This... how is this possible!"</p><p>"It actually broke!"</p><p></p><p>The few people present were all stunned, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They had already anticipated that Qi Yuan was strong, but they never imagined he would be this powerful!</p><p></p><p>Shattering the black gate with a single strike, this level of strength... could a Godly Armored Soldier do it?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan did not twist his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Now your reactions are normal, just like in TV shows, the previous mocking was too weak in force."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>The few people present looked at each other, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Brother Qi to be so powerful, it seems we'll have to rely on Brother Qi this time when exploring the secret realm," Tuosi Hai promptly praised.</p><p></p><p>The blind old man also looked at Qi Yuan with higher regard, reconsidering his previous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoface was in a good mood, because Qi Yuan's strength was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the elder Black Demon Brother spoke: "If we rely entirely on Brother Qi, how will the treasures be distributed if we find any?"</p><p></p><p>This also caught the attention of the others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did all the work, how would the treasures be distributed?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they came here as tourists, and all the treasures would be taken by Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Who said you guys won't contribute? You can..." Chen Kangbao smiled mysteriously, flipping his hand, "Whenever you encounter enemies, you can help the young master blow the suona and beat the gongs and drums!"</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he had several suona horns, as well as gongs and drums.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at each other, truly at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is kind-hearted, he doesn't want the enemies to die in silence, so he'll help them have a grand funeral, and I even brought some steamed buns for the feast!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao, as Qi Yuan's strategist, had thoroughly grasped Qi Yuan's thoughts and made thorough preparations.</p><p></p><p>The younger Black Demon Brother's face turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Asking them to blow the suona, this was humiliating them? At this time, the blind old man took the suona: "If blowing the suona also counts as our contribution, how can an old man like me not blow the suona?"</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to exploring the ruins, blowing the suona was much less dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"There's such a good thing?" The beautiful woman took the suona, her eyes seductive, "I'm quite good at blowing the suona."</p><p></p><p>Wang Daoface did not hesitate at all, taking the suona.</p><p></p><p>The younger Black Demon Brother saw this, hesitating, and when he saw his elder brother reach for one, he also stretched out his hand, though his expression was somewhat stiff.</p><p></p><p>He secretly wanted to say, let's see if Qi Yuan has the ability.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's strength was formidable, so he didn't dare express this thought.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the others take the suona, Qi Yuan felt as if he had returned to the Fanxin Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had led the villagers of Qingshui Village, sweeping across the land.</p><p></p><p>Killing, feasting.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm a shareholder in this game, follow behind me, no one dares to knife you!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if an accident happens and you get knifed, I'll find you later and put you in my underworld!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>A confident son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>The people around him were puzzled, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>Only Chen Kangbao continued to play the role of a sycophant.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is a god descended from the heavens, follow the young master, and you'll have steamed buns to eat every day!"</p><p></p><p>He flattered shamelessly, appearing utterly ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>The younger Black Demon Brother looked at Chen Kangbao, a flash of disdain in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This person was too shameless and shameful, unworthy of being an Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>The group entered the black gate.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, the sound of suona horns rang out.</p><p></p><p>Five black shadows appeared, their faces ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Each one possessed the strength of an Earth-ranked Armored Soldier, roaring as they charged towards the group.</p><p></p><p>"I've already twisted my mouth, and you still dare to come and kill me? Do you think I'm a useless son-in-law?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression remained calm. He lightly tapped the ground, and five stones flew up. With a forceful kick, the stones shot towards the five black shadows like cannon balls.</p><p></p><p>The five black shadows halted in midair, then abruptly plummeted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Their auras were completely extinguished!</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's face broke into a smile: "Young master, you are mighty! The suona just sounded, and these evil spirits are already dead!"</p><p></p><p>Tuosi Hai watched this scene, his eyes filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>This Qi brother was simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even the Black Demon Brothers...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His younger brother, for some reason, did not have any complaints at this time, and only felt that it was truly delicious.</p><p></p><p>If the few of them had come, it would probably have taken a great battle to slay these five ghostly spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's eat, let's eat!" Chen Kang Bao said.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he also took out a bunch of steamed buns from his pocket. This time, the people present did not refuse, even if they were disgusted, they pinched their noses and swallowed the steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>"These ghostly spirits' eyeballs are not bad, worth some money. You've been blowing the suona for so long, they're yours."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuanxing was always willful in his actions.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai was stunned: "These eyeballs... are worth money?"</p><p></p><p>The eyeballs of the ghostly spirits were almost useless, this was common knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they were going to eat them.</p><p></p><p>"Not worth much, probably just a few hundred taels." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"This time we relied entirely on Brother Qi's help, so this treasure should go to Brother Qi." The elder brother of the Black Sha brothers said politely.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need this thing." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The others also didn't think much of it, probably not a powerful treasure.</p><p></p><p>They were earth-level imperial soldiers, a few hundred taels of silver was still something they could let go of.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tu Sihai asked, "What use are these eyeballs?"</p><p></p><p>"Invigorating... hmm, making people..." </p><p></p><p>Before the words could fall, a whistling sound suddenly arose, and five figures swiftly pounced on the corpses of the ghostly spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, leave one for me, you've already got two!" The younger brother of the Black Sha brothers was anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, you're still young, don't fight with your brother!"</p><p></p><p>"We're twins!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a bewitching young woman showed a disdainful smile on her face: "A group of useless men."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she then looked at the blind old man: "Old blind man, aren't you usually aloof? Not interested in women."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The old blind man snorted coldly, "I have a friend, I'm helping him get it."</p><p></p><p>He said, tightly grasping the eyeballs and putting them into his own storage artifact.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I can't return to the Blue Star, otherwise I would have taken these eyeballs with me." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had missed too many opportunities to get rich.</p><p></p><p>If he could mass-produce these kinds of eyeballs, he would be enthroned on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>If there was a vote to elect the ball captain, he would definitely win by a landslide.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's continue."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan swept a glance at the others, not meaning to discriminate against the incompetent men.</p><p></p><p>The rest of them also had thick faces, just pretending that this incident had not happened.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they encountered many dangers.</p><p></p><p>But they were all easily crushed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the sound of the suona rang out, it would only last for a few breaths before abruptly stopping.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was really too strong, like a hexagonal warrior, without any weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>The fast ghostly spirits, the powerful ghostly spirits... in their areas of expertise, they were no match for him.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Qi Yuan was pushing forward with an invincible posture.</p><p></p><p>"Pay attention, I'm going to be crooked-mouthed!"</p><p></p><p>"Open the feast!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill!"</p><p></p><p>The people following behind, at first were still not able to let go and blow the suona, but the deeper they went, their faces became thicker.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, am I blowing the suona loudly?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the relic, a Confucian-robed scholar coughed, blood seeping from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong's eyes held a playful expression: "Unexpectedly, in coming to Ning Country, I would encounter... the Grand Libation Master of the Shang Country!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Country was a small country, bordering the Luosha Country.</p><p></p><p>Shang Country had no monarch, only an Elder Council.</p><p></p><p>Under this system, Shang Country greatly revered the legendary Arbiter God.</p><p></p><p>When the Arbiter God was still around, Shang Country was a vassal state of Luosha Country, and the glory of the god's presence would also shine upon Shang Country.</p><p></p><p>However, since the god's destruction, Shang Country had resolutely broken away from Luosha Country.</p><p></p><p>This had enraged Luosha Country greatly.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Shang Country had secretly assisted the Arbitration Council, it was with Shang Country's covert support that the Arbitration Council had managed to preserve much of its strength.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the fact that the Arbiter God had fallen, and Luosha Country's national power had been weakened, making them no longer a match for the enemy country, they would have long since sent troops to annihilate Shang Country.</p><p></p><p>Now, Mo Sankong, seeing the Grand Libation Master of Shang Country, had a playful smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Killing the Grand Libation Master would be a good merit.</p><p></p><p>"Just having just entered the Heavenly level, how can you contend with me?" Mo Sankong looked at the Confucian-robed scholar with a ferocious smile.</p><p></p><p>His eagle-like claws rushed towards the Confucian-robed scholar, who quickly blocked, but still left a bloody gash on his shoulder, the fresh blood flowing.</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong was about to continue his attack, when suddenly a sound of suona came from not far away.</p><p></p><p>He looked over sharply, and only saw a bronze gate open, with a few figures tumbling to the ground in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Eight people appeared in his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the suona abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Those who had been blowing the suona saw Mo Sankong, their faces showing surprise and fear.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and human as one, this is a Heavenly level imperial soldier!"</p><p></p><p>"The other one is also... a Heavenly level imperial soldier in battle?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Dao was about to say something, but then he thought of something and swallowed the words back into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he had seen Mo Sankong, Mo Sankong had not displayed his strength, so he thought he was just a powerful Earth-level imperial soldier.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Mo Sankong fighting the other person, the state of Heaven and human as one was clearly revealed.</p><p></p><p>He knew very well that Qi Yuan's opponent was this Heavenly level imperial soldier?</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was strong, he had not yet revealed the state of Heaven and human as one.</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength and speed far surpassed Mo Sankong, in the state of Heaven and human as one, that was not something that could be compensated for by just strength and speed.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai also realized something, and quickly said, "Senior, we have no intention of intruding, we will take our leave."</p><p></p><p>He adopted a very humble attitude.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was a Heavenly level imperial soldier, and it seemed that he was not just a newly entered Heavenly level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cold smile appeared in Mo Sankong's eyes: "You can leave, but the old man must stay."</p><p></p><p>He pointed to Chen Kang Bao, his gaze wild, looking at the Confucian-robed scholar, a treacherous smile flashed in his eyes: "Although you have disguised yourself well, when the old man appeared, the surprise and worry in your eyes were still discovered by me. You know him... and are very familiar."</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong stood in the air, his eyes full of confidence, his bearing majestic.</p><p></p><p>He was like a sovereign ruler.</p><p></p><p>"He stays, you leave."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise... all of you die!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was domineering, yet full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar had a worried expression, also full of self-blame.</p><p></p><p>It was his own fault that had harmed the old man! On the other side, Tu Sihai and the others were also somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>Because this Mo Sankong gave them too much pressure, stronger than any Heavenly level imperial soldier they had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Even if they united, they might not be a match for this person.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan might be strong, but he had not yet reached the state of Heaven and human as one, and was not a match at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, old eunuch, you're a bit too self-confident, aren't you?" Qi Yuan's eyes showed surprise, "Even if you let us go, I still don't want to let you go!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong's expression suddenly turned icy cold, he seemed to dislike being called an eunuch, it had hit a sore spot.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I didn't expect that this small country would have so many presumptuous fellows. Today... none of you will be leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong's heart was filled with the intent to kill.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sihai and the others were on high alert, he quickly said, "Brother Qi, you take the lead, we'll assist you, let's attack together!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mo Sankong was murderous, whatever they said would be useless, only battle would give them a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? Keep playing the suona, keep blowing the suona, I'll send him off." Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>"But he's a Heavenly level imperial soldier!" The blind old man said solemnly, somewhat disbelieving as he looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Was he not just pretending to be crazy, but truly insane?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a Heavenly level imperial soldier has come, facing Young Master, he'll still kick the bucket!" Chen Kang Bao raised his hand and said, "Play the music!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tu Sihai and the others hesitated for a moment, but then also picked up the suona and started blowing, though their whole bodies were tense, ready to act if anything went wrong.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Mo Sankong and said calmly, "Mo Sankong, do you know what crime you have committed?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong's expression slightly faltered: "You know me?"</p><p></p><p>"You actually wanted to snatch my wife Shen Lingxuan, if you snatch her, where will I be a son-in-law? You have committed an unforgivable crime.</p><p></p><p>If you kowtow and commit suicide, I can give you some benefits, so that you can eat your own feast after death."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very generous, and also very kind-hearted. Even when facing a criminal, he still respected their human rights.</p><p></p><p>As for how to eat one's own feast after death? It's simple, just cut open his stomach and stuff the steamed buns in.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" Mo Sankong was furiously enraged! "Shen Lingxuan has already been seen by my lord prince, if you find her and offer her to my lord prince, your whole family can live after you commit suicide!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm an orphan, can you quickly revive my whole family for me?"</p><p></p><p>The sound of the suona rang out, urgent and resounding.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there seemed to be a touch of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The Earth-level imperial soldiers present all had anxious expressions, with worries in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar was also anxious, and a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Qi Yuan the lunatic from the asylum? Wasn't he just an ordinary person before? How could he be so strong now?</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong attacked, in the state of Heaven and human as one, he directly used the power of heaven and earth to press down on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, not reaching the Heavenly level, you will forever be an ant, you don't know what the power of heaven and earth is!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Sankong was tyrannical beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>His own strength was not as good as Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>But in the state of Heaven and human as one, he could draw on the power of heaven and earth within a ten-meter radius.</p><p></p><p>This kind of power, not just ten thousand jin, could not be resisted by human strength!</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest gap between a Heavenly level imperial soldier and an Earth-level imperial soldier!</p><p></p><p>When facing each other directly, there were no examples of an Earth-level imperial soldier defeating a Heavenly level imperial soldier.</p><p></p><p>"The power of heaven and earth?" Qi Yuan chuckled lightly, "Old eunuch, do you know... the value of the shareholders?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly struck out with a punch.</p><p></p><p>Mo SanKong's eyes revealed a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly found that the heaven and earth power he had gathered was shattered.</p><p></p><p>No, not shattered, but deflated, softened!

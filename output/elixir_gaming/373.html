        <h1>Chapter 373</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The car stopped at the Junan residential complex.</p><p></p><p>A woman in tight-fitting clothes got out of the car, her face bearing an urgent expression.</p><p></p><p>"A great battle is about to begin. It's no longer safe here. We must take Xiao Yuan away. Going to Tianyuan Sect is the only chance for survival."</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes was "Xiao Mei", also the disciple of Qi Yuan's parents in this body.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she had always been quietly watching over Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she didn't want to disturb Qi Yuan's peaceful life. </p><p></p><p>But now, with war approaching and the entire Qin Yuan country about to fall, she had to take Qi Yuan away. She couldn't let her master's bloodline be cut off.</p><p></p><p>In the residential complex now, pedestrians hurried along the streets, their faces all bearing urgent expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Sky had been destroyed, and Canxing's great army could descend from the starry sky at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could sense the dark clouds of war.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes climbed the stairs, her thoughts turning: "In such a short life, I've witnessed so much history."</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she arrived at the door of Qi Yuan's floor. Looking at the door in front of her, she felt a bit timid.</p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.</p><p></p><p>About five breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>The door opened, and a delicate-looking, rather slender robot came into view.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, may I help you?" Zero One asked politely, holding a phone in one hand as if filming a video.</p><p></p><p>From deep inside the apartment came the pitiful meowing of a cat.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to see Qi Yuan. It's urgent," the woman in tight clothes said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, my master is not home," said Zero One.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he now? I have an urgent matter, it's extremely urgent!" The woman in tight clothes was getting anxious.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan was missing at this time, it would be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, but that involves privacy. I cannot disclose my master's whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"This concerns Qi Yuan's life and death. Don't talk about privacy now." The woman in tight clothes was becoming desperate.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyuan Sect's law boat would be leaving in just three days.</p><p></p><p>She didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, but I have no authority to disclose that information." Zero One's tone was full of refusal.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes gritted her teeth. "This..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gentle voice came from inside the apartment: "Zero One, it's alright. I'm back."</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, Qi Yuan's figure walked out from the apartment.</p><p></p><p>He had just come down from the bridge formed by the two sudden emperors and returned to his own apartment.</p><p></p><p>In his blood-red robe, he looked incomparably handsome.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes was momentarily dazed when she saw Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Although she had seen Qi Yuan decades ago, this time was completely different from the last.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, I am..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I know. You're Xiao Mei," Qi Yuan recognized the woman in tight clothes. "You're not here to ask me to repay the money, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit conflicted and hesitant.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't bought the Gongxing yet, hadn't saved money to buy land and build the underworld. He was being very frugal now and didn't really want to repay the money.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not that." The woman in tight clothes held her forehead. "A great battle is about to..."</p><p></p><p>"You've run out of money?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"I know you're in a hurry, but don't say anything yet. I have an urgent matter to deal with. Can we talk after I've handled it? </p><p></p><p>Maybe, just wait for me for ten minutes? An hour?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to default on the debt.</p><p></p><p>Why should he repay money borrowed on his own merits?</p><p></p><p>This world is full of malice.</p><p></p><p>The woman in tight clothes, her words interrupted, heard Qi Yuan's words and could only nod: "Alright, go quickly and come back quickly. I have an urgent matter to discuss with you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go in and have a seat first. Bye-bye."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pushed the woman in tight clothes into the apartment, and his figure disappeared at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Only the worried woman in tight clothes was left behind.</p><p></p><p>However, having seen Qi Yuan, she also breathed a sigh of relief, thinking there was no major problem.</p><p></p><p>In the deep darkness of the universe, looking far away, one could see several blue or fiery red spheres.</p><p></p><p>They hung in the vast universe like the eyeballs of enormous creatures, lonely and deathly still.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the universe, it was silent, as if it were a world that had lost its voice.</p><p></p><p>Meteors floated, streaks of light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead, nearly a hundred space warships formed a vast military formation, patrolling through the universe.</p><p></p><p>On the warships, a cold silvery-white light flickered, their special design inspiring awe at first glance.</p><p></p><p>Inside the warship, the male beast Pang Qie, wearing a human skin robe, had a haughty smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"These human things are quite interesting. This speed... even faster than Purple Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"These are all the latest models of warships. Each one is capable of trampling the Qin Yuan country.</p><p>Of course, compared to the great ones of the Myriad Beasts Realm, these are just scrap metal," said a man wearing special battle armor sycophantically.</p><p></p><p>He was the commander of this warship and also the supreme commander of this operation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the real supreme commander was the beast beside him, Lord Pang Qie.</p><p></p><p>"The power of these warships is astonishing, indeed not easy to deal with. But, as long as the people inside are taken care of, they're quite ordinary," said Pang Qie.</p><p></p><p>If the Myriad Beasts Realm were to face these warships head-on, without a doubt, the Myriad Beasts Realm would also suffer heavy losses, with many Purple Mansions dying.</p><p></p><p>But the Myriad Beasts Realm was clever, choosing to corrupt the upper echelons, controlling Canxing from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>Now, Canxing's fleet was also in the hands of the beast race.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers and officers going to war this time were all from the pro-war faction.</p><p></p><p>"We are mere mortals, naturally we cannot compare to the great ones!" the commander said sycophantically.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a voice rang out among the fleet.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, excuse me, how do I get to Canxing!"</p><p></p><p>The soldiers in the warships tensed up when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>The fleet commander also became alert.</p><p></p><p>"Search for the source of the voice, investigate the unknown entity."</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly ordered.</p><p></p><p>After just a few breaths of time, a blood-red figure appeared on the screen.</p><p></p><p>On a huge meteor, there stood a man wearing a blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator?" Pang Qie grinned, his eyes filled with amusement. "To be able to traverse the starry sky like this, he must be a Purple Mansion.</p><p>Is this the hidden strength of Qin Yuan, a Purple Mansion?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Canxing's fleet, would you?" the blood-red figure asked again.</p><p></p><p>The meteor under his feet kept pace with the fleet.</p><p></p><p>Pang Qie looked at the blood-red robe, his eyes filled with appreciation: "Your courage is admirable. If you acknowledge me as your master, I can ensure the safety of your lineage!"</p><p></p><p>Pang Qie said generously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, standing on the meteor, froze when he heard this: "Not only do you want to cancel the martial arts competition, but you also want to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Pang Qie found Qi Yuan's words puzzling when he heard them.</p><p></p><p>Then, he sneered: "It seems you only have courage, but no insight. In that case, just kill him, don't waste words."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The captain quickly agreed and issued the order.</p><p></p><p>"Lock onto the target, activate the Tiancang heavy cannon, proceed with elimination!"</p><p></p><p>With the captain's voice, this fleet quickly dispersed, moving at extreme speed, jumping through space.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, they had surrounded Qi Yuan, blocking his retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Tiancang heavy cannon was also aimed at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Tiancang heavy cannon was a powerful weapon created based on the concept of a star-destroying cannon.</p><p></p><p>It was the most powerful weapon on the space warships.</p><p></p><p>It was also Canxing's second most powerful weapon, even comparable to the Eye of the Sky.</p><p></p><p>With the captain's voice, over a hundred Tiancang heavy cannons locked onto Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>An electronic voice echoed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Charging, 3, 2, 1..."</p><p></p><p>The captain's face bore an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>This kind of weapon could even annihilate immortals!</p><p></p><p>A mere Purple Mansion was nothing but dry bones in a grave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe remained calm: "It seems there are quite a few villains among the NPCs."</p><p></p><p>He stood still, not moving an inch.</p><p></p><p>Countless missiles and beams shot towards him from all directions, a saturated attack.</p><p></p><p>Even if it were a great sovereign, they couldn't escape at this moment.</p><p></p><p>However, he was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This level of fleet? He didn't even take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Too boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, blowing a breath towards the front.</p><p></p><p>In the originally silent universe, suddenly, a powerful wave of wind arose.</p><p></p><p>It was like a cosmic storm, stars exploding.</p><p></p><p>Countless meteors shattered and disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The missiles heading towards Qi Yuan all turned to dust at this moment.</p><p></p><p>As for those warships, without even an alarm sounding, all the soldiers and beasts inside died directly from Qi Yuan's single breath.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, there wasn't even the sound of an explosion.</p><p></p><p>A powerful fleet was thus obliterated, without causing any ripples.</p><p></p><p>"Can't even withstand a single breath from me, yet so boastful. It's laughable!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan yawned, his gaze searching around.</p><p></p><p>"Is that glowing green planet Canxing?</p><p></p><p>The sun next to it is a bit dazzling, too much of a nuisance!"</p><p></p><p>Gongxing and Canxing were only slightly larger than the solar system.</p><p></p><p>There were two suns in this ecosystem.</p><p></p><p>Well, not counting Qi Yuan's projection.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." In the starry universe, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>In Canxing's largest military base.</p><p></p><p>A man in military uniform spoke with a panicked expression: "Marshal, the Qihang fleet... has lost contact!"</p><p></p><p>"Lost contact?" The marshal was momentarily surprised. "You mean they've lost signal?"</p><p></p><p>"Marshal, it's not just losing signal. Our soldiers'... Qianli Ming, they've all died!"</p><p></p><p>Qianli Ming was a special organism, or rather a bacterial colony.</p><p></p><p>Part of it was implanted in the soldiers' bodies, and part was placed in culture dishes.</p><p></p><p>If a soldier died, these bacterial colonies would also die correspondingly, and then those in the culture dishes would die too.</p><p></p><p>Their function was similar to the soul lamps in the world of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>When the soul lamp extinguishes, the person perishes.</p><p></p><p>"What, all of them are gone?" The marshal's face changed dramatically, showing panic for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Didn't this mean that the fleet had been annihilated?</p><p></p><p>That was a fleet composed of over a hundred space warships, each capable of destroying a country in the past.</p><p></p><p>Now... they were gone.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Has any news been sent back?" The marshal anxiously stamped his foot.</p><p></p><p>The death of soldiers was a small matter, but failing to complete the Myriad Beasts Realm's mission was a big issue.</p><p></p><p>"No, the connection was completely cut off! However, before losing connection, the fleet encountered an enemy and activated the Tiancang heavy cannon."</p><p></p><p>"This... Immediately activate the Starry Sky Defense Line at full power, prohibit anyone from entering Canxing!" The marshal immediately ordered.</p><p></p><p>If, if...</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If the fleet was indeed annihilated by an enemy, then that enemy's strength must be truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If such a fearsome foe were to enter Canxing's territory, they would be severely constrained, just like when facing the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The best approach would be to eliminate them in space.</p><p></p><p>The Starry River Defense Line was Canxing's most powerful defense in space. </p><p></p><p>This defense line was composed of seven celestial bodies. </p><p></p><p>Five of these were Canxing's moons, while two were captured using Canxing's technology.</p><p></p><p>The Starry River Defense Line formed by these seven celestial bodies housed Canxing's most powerful weapons.</p><p></p><p>It could be activated whenever enemies invaded.</p><p></p><p>At full power, the Starry River Defense Line was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>It was equipped with all kinds of powerful weapons - orbital cannons, imaginary planet-destroying cannons, super-energy radiation, stellar bombs, space light, and more.</p><p></p><p>It was capable of blasting a small moon to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"I must report this to the Demon Lord and the King!" the Marshal said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by second by second.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord listened to the report with a calm expression, his head resting on the young queen consort's fair thighs.</p><p></p><p>"An enemy attack? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>He showed no concern at all.</p><p></p><p>The elderly King stood to the side, his face devoid of any emotion. </p><p></p><p>The Princess stood nearby, her nerves taut.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a projection suddenly appeared in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"I am Robot 01, here to deliver a message from my master:</p><p></p><p>'Canxing is arrogant and delusional, dreaming of conquering Gongxing and canceling the Martial Arts Tournament. </p><p></p><p>Today, I shall personally come to teach you a lesson.'</p><p></p><p>My master Qi Yuan will descend upon Canxing in three minutes.</p><p></p><p>Those who surrender may live! Those who resist will be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The mechanical voice rang out, cold and merciless.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the reclining Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord rise, a glint of killing intent flashing in his eyes: "Interesting, they dare to threaten me to my face."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord stood up, exuding a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>The King's expression remained impassive, without a word.</p><p></p><p>A barely noticeable flicker of excitement flashed in the Princess's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord, what should we do?" the Marshal bowed his head, somewhat afraid. </p><p></p><p>After all, the enemy had destroyed an entire fleet - they were not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have the Starry River Defense Line? Space will be his final resting place!" The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord's eyes were filled with ferocity, showing no fear of Qi Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>In his view, this Qi Yuan who had destroyed a fleet was at most a peak Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He himself was also at the peak Purple Palace level, and in the Demon Realm, there were over a hundred peak Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In terms of combat power, he wasn't afraid.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Starry River Defense Line was indeed powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even ten peak Purple Palace cultivators would likely be unable to break through the Starry River Defense Line.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, I will ensure he cannot reach Canxing alive."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, like an ant trying to shake a tree, courting death!" The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Princess's expression now showed signs of worry.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle robots sounded an alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Beep, intruder detected by Starry River Defense Line, commencing elimination!"</p><p></p><p>"Orbital cannons activated!"</p><p></p><p>"Space Annihilation Line activated!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Imaginary planet-destroying cannon activated!"</p><p></p><p>Countless powerful weapons were activated.</p><p></p><p>At this time, anyone who looked up at the sky would see lights flashing everywhere in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, human eyesight wasn't good enough to see this.</p><p></p><p>On the screens, endless sparks could be seen flashing, along with crisscrossing beams of light.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of seven armed satellites firing at full power, bombarding the target with a saturation attack.</p><p></p><p>Countless weapons, light beams, and radiation streaked towards the target as if they cost nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Even I couldn't withstand this kind of attack. Hmph, he's just coming here to die," the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord said coldly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in space, Qi Yuan stood motionless.</p><p></p><p>Countless shells and attacks landed on him, unable to even breach his blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>His expression was calm, with a hint of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you dared to cancel the Martial Arts Tournament because you had some trump card, but is this all? How disappointing," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>His voice seemed to ignore the constraints of space, resonating across Canxing at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on Canxing heard Qi Yuan's voice in that instant.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear that?"</p><p></p><p>"The voice of a god?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky, but they couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>They also couldn't see the battle taking place in space.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, a look of gravity appeared in the Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord's eyes: "Increase the power output, destroy him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!" The Marshal hurriedly gave the order.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the vast voice continued to resound.</p><p></p><p>"I've been walking for so long, I'm a bit hungry... Let me eat something, then we can have a proper chat."</p><p></p><p>As these words fell, the sky suddenly turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>There was no white light in the world, only red light.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"A planet?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky, confused or terrified.</p><p></p><p>Because above their heads, the starry sky had vanished, the sun had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>What they could see was a... round, enormous thing that looked like... a star.</p><p></p><p>No, there were two!</p><p></p><p>"Are those... eyes?" The impassive King's eyes widened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Because the things that had suddenly appeared in space, blocking out all light, looked like... the eyes of some enormous being.</p><p></p><p>A voice rang out at this moment: "It feels so good to be big, always being confined in a tiny body is really no fun.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, but being big has its downsides too, my eyeballs are almost touching Canxing, yet I still can't see you clearly!"</p><p></p><p>He stood in space.</p><p></p><p>Canxing wasn't even as big as his palm, his body spanning the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he seemed to be completely unbound by the laws of the universe.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, everyone could see him.</p><p></p><p>His voice didn't propagate through the air like normal sound; as soon as it rang out, everyone heard it.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Eyed Demon Lord's body trembled, unable to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>The other citizens of Canxing also lost all courage at this moment, falling to their knees one after another.</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing, countless millions of miles away, all the citizens also saw that blood-red figure.</p><p></p><p>When the Sun God's Dharma body manifested, all living beings, regardless of space, could see that terrifying form.</p><p></p><p>Canxing was too far from Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>From Gongxing, Canxing looked only about the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>But now, blood-red light replaced the sun.</p><p></p><p>A humanoid colossus stood in the void, seemingly blocking out Canxing.</p><p></p><p>The sun near Canxing looked only about as big as his palm.</p><p></p><p>All the humans who had been panic-buying supplies involuntarily looked up at the sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, their "eyesight" was very good this time.</p><p></p><p>They clearly saw an enormous being standing in the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>"What's that blood-red thing in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that a person?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I seeing things?"</p><p></p><p>"Mommy, waaah, I'm scared, wife!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blood-red giant in space turned around, his enormous hand waving forward.</p><p></p><p>The star near Canxing was instantly grasped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A vast voice rang out at this moment, not only on Gongxing, but also on Canxing, and in the images projected by the Origin Land's memory stones.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand the value of winning the Martial Arts Tournament 76 times in a row?</p><p></p><p>You dare to invade Gongxing and cancel the Martial Arts Tournament!"</p><p></p><p>On Canxing, countless people were terrified.</p><p></p><p>They were too close to see Qi Yuan's face clearly, only able to see the tip of the iceberg of the terrifying giant.</p><p></p><p>The Princess's face was filled with fear as she recalled Fang Hun's words.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hun had said there was a powerful expert on Gongxing, very powerful.</p><p></p><p>She knew he was powerful, but she never imagined he would be this powerful!</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land, all the Martial Lords were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Black Deer Martial Lord's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Is that... Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't comprehend it, couldn't imagine it.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying form could probably crush the entire Origin Land with one step!</p><p></p><p>Was this a Martial God?</p><p></p><p>On Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Countless people were confused, then excited.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, it's Mr. Qi, hahaha!" The King laughed, then wept with joy.</p><p></p><p>Gongyi Qing also knelt on the ground, constantly bowing to that terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's wife had destroyed the Sky Eye.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought Mr. Qi was weaker than his wife.</p><p></p><p>When Canxing invaded, they feared Mr. Qi might not be able to resist.</p><p></p><p>Now... this was far from being unable to resist, this was simply too terrifying! Incomprehensible, or rather, beyond comprehension!</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a being in the world, with a fist as large as the sun!</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean, if he wanted to, a single strand of his hair could crush Gongxing?</p><p></p><p>On top of a tall building, a 17-year-old youth looked at the white-haired old man: "Grandpa... weren't you the runner-up in the Martial Arts Tournament?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at his grandfather, his eyes filled with excitement and enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>If the champion was this strong, the runner-up, no matter how weak... couldn't be that far behind, right?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Military Peace Community, the woman in tight clothes swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu's eyes widened, trembling, not daring to move at all.</p><p></p><p>Wu Qi stood on the upper floor, her eyes filled with awe and worship.</p><p></p><p>"How could I have been so bold?"</p><p></p><p>She suddenly recalled how she had once tried to seduce Mr. Qi while naked.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi was so big... how could her tiny body... possibly handle that?</p><p></p><p>The young man who had just replied to Qi Yuan on the forum was also stunned: "Bro... you were serious?!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was looking at that terrifying blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>Then, that terrifying blood-colored giant moved.</p><p></p><p>He reached out with his unimaginably large hand and grabbed the star from Canxing's solar system.</p><p></p><p>A murmur rang out.</p><p></p><p>"I've never eaten a star before, being this big."</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the star and stuffed it into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Crunch.</p><p></p><p>Sparks and explosions sounded in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan savored it carefully: "Not bad, tastes like deep-fried sugar, makes my mouth a bit numb."</p><p></p><p>After this colossus finished eating the sun, his gaze involuntarily fell on the sun of Gongxing's solar system, a glint of greed flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with great willpower, he overcame his appetite.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards Canxing, his voice vast.</p><p></p><p>"I'm about 30% full now, come, let's continue our discussion. Will you surrender... or resist?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice echoed across Canxing.</p><p></p><p>On this day, everyone truly witnessed history.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

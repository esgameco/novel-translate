        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help blurting out as he listened to the voices of these old men and women.</p><p></p><p>Yes, they all had very long hair, reaching down to their waists. </p><p></p><p>According to ancient sayings on Blue Star, they were already eligible for marriage.</p><p></p><p>However, after saying this, Qi Yuan realized something and added: "Except for me and my wife."</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator, Qi Yuan also had long flowing hair, not to mention the Golden Canary.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, nonsense. How could others help with comprehending innate divine abilities?" The elder in the pure red mask couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>The others also felt that Qi Yuan was just causing trouble.</p><p></p><p>"In this vast world, nothing is impossible. Why do you speak so absolutely? </p><p>How would you know it doesn't exist if you haven't seen it?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"You are not a fish, how do you know a fish's joy?" </p><p>This saying was truly all-purpose for arguments.</p><p></p><p>"Even celestial immortals can't do it, so who else could?" The pure red masked elder retorted.</p><p></p><p>"Do immortals dare claim to be invincible?" Qi Yuan said calmly. "There are those even stronger than immortals.</p><p>Moreover, everyone knows that at the highest levels of cultivation, one can even reach a state of omniscience and omnipotence. How could they not be able to help others comprehend innate abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan never spoke nonsense, but always reasoned with logic and evidence.</p><p>To be blunt, if he failed at cultivation and returned to Blue Star, he could even open a shop specializing in writing papers for people.</p><p></p><p>"You... you..." The pure red masked elder was left speechless.</p><p>He felt Qi Yuan was twisting logic.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the man completely shrouded in a purple robe spoke: "This friend's words are not false. Generally speaking, from Divine Infant to Purple Palace realm, no one can help with comprehending innate abilities. </p><p>But there are exceptions in this world. I once heard that in one realm, there was a Purple Palace cultivator who gave sermons. A hundred thousand Divine Infant cultivators went to listen, and all who heard attained the Purple Palace realm."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand Divine Infants listening to a sermon?"</p><p></p><p>"And it wasn't an immortal or deity!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, who knows if this friend is just making it up?" The pure red masked elder looked at the purple-robed man with an unfriendly expression.</p><p></p><p>"Everything this old man says is true." The purple-robed man's voice turned cold, with a hint of an abyss-like aura leaking out in that moment.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators present felt this aura and their expressions changed, showing fear.</p><p></p><p>"A great Purple Palace cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace realm!"</p><p></p><p>The previous doubts and discussions vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked elder's attitude changed completely: "The great cultivator's words must be true. It was this old man's ignorance."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the pressure a Purple Palace cultivator exerted on Divine Infant cultivators was too great.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, strength was everything.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan became unwilling: "Why did you argue when I said it, but accept it as soon as he said it?"</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked elder looked at Qi Yuan and couldn't help saying: "The senior is at Purple Palace realm. Are you at Purple Palace realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became dejected: "Alas, I'm not at Purple Palace realm. I'm just a small Divine Infant."</p><p></p><p>That's right, he was still at Divine Infant realm in the Cang Lan realm.</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked elder ignored Qi Yuan and stood up, giving the main seat to the purple-robed Purple Palace great cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still couldn't swallow this: "Although I'm a Divine Infant, my alt account is actually a Yang Spirit. Is that okay?"</p><p></p><p>The pure red masked elder clearly didn't believe him and chuckled: "Not okay. Must be Purple Palace."</p><p></p><p>None of the cultivators present took Qi Yuan's words seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, the appearance of one Purple Palace cultivator was already shocking and unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Would a Yang Spirit that could illuminate all realms be here? That would be brainless. It would be like a village gathering in an Eastern country on Blue Star, inviting villagers to get together.</p><p>Suddenly a villager claims to be the leader of a neighboring country.</p><p>Without thinking, no one in the village would believe it.</p><p></p><p>Although everyone joked that he was from an Eastern country, no one would take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Even Yang Spirit isn't enough, sigh." Qi Yuan was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>No one paid attention to Qi Yuan. All eyes were focused on the purple-robed Purple Palace cultivator, since Purple Palace realm was extremely rare in the Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace great cultivator continued: "The preaching great being this poor Daoist spoke of was actually a reincarnation of a great being.</p><p>The Dao of that realm was created by that great being, so that Purple Palace cultivator could easily help others enter Purple Palace realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others all had sudden realizations.</p><p>Some were delighted or melancholic to hear such secrets.</p><p></p><p>"The path of immortal cultivation is vast. Anything is possible."</p><p></p><p>"The higher one's cultivation, the more one realizes one's own insignificance."</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infant cultivators sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a look of joy appeared on the Golden Canary's pretty face. She leaned close to Qi Yuan's ear and transmitted: "Is he talking about you, Blood Pearl?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably," Qi Yuan hesitantly replied.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that when the Blood Lord preached in the past, he wore a robe of blood and was incomparably handsome. A hundred thousand Earthly Immortals bowed before him.</p><p>Unfortunately, this little miss didn't get to see your past heroic bearing.</p><p>Why don't you wear a red robe for this little miss to see next time?"</p><p></p><p>The girl's breath was fragrant as orchids. She blinked her eyes, her expression tender and coquettish, with a hint of intimacy and playfulness in her words.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the girl's fair face through his mask. He couldn't help saying: "Little Jia has seen it. You can ask her."</p><p></p><p>"Little sister Jia has seen it, but this little miss hasn't!" The girl's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the girl's soft hand and said righteously: "Arrest! You are Ning Tao!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Canary called Little Jia "sister".</p><p>Ning Tao called Little Jia "little sister".</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's face immediately turned red: "Blood Pearl, your servant is not Ning Tao!"</p><p></p><p>The two transmitted rapidly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the pure red masked elder stepped forward and said sincerely: "Please preach to us, senior, and show us the way forward!"</p><p></p><p>How could a group of Divine Infant cultivators discussing compare to a Purple Palace cultivator? The other cultivators also looked at the Purple Palace great cultivator expectantly.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the purple-robed cultivator's gaze unusually fell on Qi Yuan: "I wonder what views this friend has on the Purple Palace realm?"</p><p></p><p>This purple-robed cultivator was very curious about Qi Yuan's background, and also wanted to probe Qi Yuan's depths.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding Purple Palace realm, I do have some insights.</p><p>I have a good friend who once had an interesting idea. Purple Palace contains the character for 'palace', so it's a purple-colored palace!" Qi Yuan directly plagiarized Great Wisdom True Lord's words, but he added a citation and source, so it didn't count as plagiarism.</p><p></p><p>When this was said, the Divine Infants present were stunned, then burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"There's an explanation like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Is friend joking?"</p><p></p><p>"If we say it like that, this old man would say Purple Palace is a palace condensed from primordial purple qi!"</p><p></p><p>"This palace refers to the five viscera and six bowels!"</p><p></p><p>"It clearly means the Heavenly Palace!"</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infants also started talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned, then became thoughtful: "A palace constructed from primordial purple qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Purple is the extreme of all colors. Primordial purple qi is also known as chaos qi, or the mother qi of all things. It is the beginning of everything, representing endless vitality, and is the first qi of the immortal path.</p><p>Even for supreme Yang Spirits, primordial purple qi is an extremely rare treasure! What, you want to construct a palace using primordial purple qi? You really dare to imagine. Even Yang Spirits can't do that!" A Divine Infant cultivator mocked.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at the fat cultivator who had proposed primordial purple qi. An excited expression appeared on his face: "Sir's great talent truly deserves to be called a genius.</p><p>Indeed, there are qilins in the wilderness, and masters among the common people.</p><p>Sir, could you remove your mask and let me see what kind of wise eyes you have!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's attitude was sincere, rather like Liu Bei visiting Zhuge Liang three times.</p><p></p><p>This left that fat Divine Infant stunned. Hearing Qi Yuan's sincere words, for a moment he</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether Qi Yuan was being sarcastic or sincere.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, that won't be necessary," the fat divine infant said awkwardly. </p><p></p><p>The other divine infants present were also looking at him with amused expressions.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then said, "Sir, you've been a great help to me. From now on, I'll look out for you on Gongxing!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>He very much wanted to recruit this clever person for his own use. Under that smart head, there might be some brilliant plan hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, alright," the fat divine infant said casually, not wanting to offend anyone unnecessarily. </p><p></p><p>In truth, he felt somewhat insecure, as he thought he was just average. </p><p></p><p>Being praised like this by Qi Yuan made him feel unworthy.</p><p></p><p>He didn't seem to deserve it.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you have any more words of wisdom to share?" Qi Yuan continued asking.</p><p></p><p>This concerned his own great Dao, so he had to be careful and respectful towards the wise.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." The fat divine infant coughed, feeling even more undeserving of his position.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that a fellow cultivator admired him so much made him feel somewhat elated.</p><p></p><p>His limited brain power worked to come up with a decent answer for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the fat cultivator pondered and said: "Regarding the Purple Palace, every cultivator has their own understanding, and each understanding is different.</p><p></p><p>For each cultivator, the innate divine ability that suits them best is the best one. In other words, the Purple Palace that suits them is also the best.</p><p></p><p>From what I've heard you say, it seems you want to take an unconventional path, an unconventional Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, what suits you naturally is the most appropriate."</p><p></p><p>To other cultivators, the fat cultivator's words seemed like nonsense, with a set of far-fetched logic.</p><p></p><p>It's true that innate divine abilities are one's own path that cultivators must forge for themselves.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace is different.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palaces in the world are more or less the same, with no real difference in suitability.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened attentively, pondering, like a student standing in the snow at Cheng's gate.</p><p></p><p>"So based on what I've heard you say, you advocate that the Purple Palace is a mansion, hence proposing that 'purple' refers to purple qi.</p><p></p><p>You can elaborate on the character 'fu' (mansion) in Purple Palace, and you may gain some insights."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator cleared his throat, quite satisfied with his own speech.</p><p></p><p>However, it still lacked a finishing touch, some supporting evidence.</p><p></p><p>He added:</p><p></p><p>"The way of immortal cultivation emphasizes the harmony of yin and yang, the fusion of heaven and earth, and following the laws of nature. If you think along these lines, you surely won't go astray."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other divine infant cultivators were both amused and exasperated.</p><p></p><p>To them, what the fat cultivator said was utter nonsense, except for the last sentence which quoted the ancients and made some sense.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, on the other hand, furrowed his brows upon hearing this, with many thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"A Purple Palace that suits oneself?"</p><p></p><p>In this world, the most powerful beings are immeasurable, undefinable, and unobservable.</p><p></p><p>Although the Purple Palace is a realm, a common realm.</p><p></p><p>But powerful Purple Palaces must be undefinable.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the Purple Palace one lacks is the good Purple Palace, the definable Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>This is like some powerful beings who can automatically switch their own worldviews, randomly switching to a worldview that benefits them.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator's words were an enlightening revelation to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've understood!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Qi Yuan had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>What does he lack now? Why is he working so hard to cultivate? It's for freedom, for great ease, for leaving no regrets.</p><p></p><p>But on the path he had traveled, there were far too many regrets.</p><p></p><p>On the Wangyue Continent, in the Five Elements Forbidden Land, the five ancestors of Metal, Water, Wood, and others sacrificed their lives to let Qi Yuan control the Five Elements Forbidden Land - this was a regret.</p><p></p><p>Under the ancient Qichun tree, not seeing Jinli - this was a regret.</p><p></p><p>In Wugui City, three people guarding one city, Zhang Sheng and Chen Jiao who gave Qi Yuan wine died, with only Qi Yuan remembering their names - this too was a regret.</p><p></p><p>There were far too many such regrets.</p><p></p><p>Once, Qi Yuan had said that one day, he would re-establish earth, water, wind, and fire, turn the false into the real, the virtual into the actual, and bring the five ancestors back to the world.</p><p></p><p>This was his unfulfilled vision.</p><p></p><p>Now... couldn't the Purple Palace be approached with this idea?</p><p></p><p>As they say, yin and yang in harmony.</p><p></p><p>Purple qi is the ultimate yang of heaven and earth, representing infinite vitality, the root of all things reviving.</p><p></p><p>If there's yang, what's missing is yin?</p><p></p><p>What is the ultimate yin in the world? The underworld!</p><p></p><p>Yes, it must be the underworld! For Qi Yuan, the underworld is the most yin in the world, filled with yin souls.</p><p></p><p>Within it, there are six paths of reincarnation in the cycle of rebirth, connecting yin and yang.</p><p></p><p>So, the underworld is the most suitable yin.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the underworld contains the character "fu" (mansion).</p><p></p><p>This is destiny at work.</p><p></p><p>What is the Purple Palace?</p><p></p><p>It's the underworld filled with the mother qi of all things, which is purple qi! Qi Yuan felt he was so creative.</p><p></p><p>Reshaping the people he had seen in the past with purple qi, letting them revive in the underworld, and guiding them into the underworld.</p><p></p><p>That way, the five ancestors in the Five Elements Forbidden Land would also revive.</p><p></p><p>All of Qi Yuan's past regrets could be nurtured and appear in the Purple Palace, reviving.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's innate divine abilities, Virtual Realm Dominator: Heart Demon Inducement, and the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, were also very suitable for the Purple Palace as the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Heart Demon Inducement could be the eighteen levels of hell, where those who enter are ravaged by heart demons.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra could be the soup of Meng Po, the River of Forgetfulness, where all cultivators forget themselves after one sip.</p><p></p><p>And such a Purple Palace would not only serve to revive old acquaintances, but also be formidable in battle.</p><p></p><p>First, find an unknown world, open the Purple Palace, and lure the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, purple qi spreading.</p><p></p><p>What is purple qi? It's a supreme treasure of heaven and earth. Seeing purple qi, wouldn't enemies be tempted? Purple qi represents infinite vitality, it's the mother qi of all things, the limit of life.</p><p></p><p>There would be no danger here, no forbidden areas, just difficult to capture.</p><p></p><p>So, seeing purple qi, all Yangshens would be unable to resist trying to capture it.</p><p></p><p>Good... once they try to capture it, they're in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>Under the purple qi is actually the gloomy underworld.</p><p></p><p>Sorry, once you come to capture it, you fall into hell.</p><p></p><p>Those Yangshens who come to snatch the purple qi probably won't understand how they ended up in hell when they came for purple qi. Once they enter Qi Yuan's Purple Palace, aren't they at his mercy?</p><p></p><p>What Heart Demon Inducement, what Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Enemies he doesn't like, directly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Enemies he likes, well, their souls erased, true spirits wiped clean, but their cultivation preserved, waiting for new true spirits to grow, kept to work for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Simply genius! Qi Yuan greatly admired himself, but also felt that the path of the Purple Palace was long and arduous.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the fat cultivator and said seriously: "I will never forget your kindness in teaching me the Dao.</p><p></p><p>If you pass away one day, this unfilial disciple won't even collect your remains. Don't worry, I will resurrect you!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, laughter erupted again.</p><p></p><p>"Even resurrection has come up, do you think you're the Ancestral Dao, friend?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even the Ancestral Dao of a realm couldn't do that, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I thank you on behalf of this friend, haha!"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator looked at Qi Yuan, his expression changing several times.</p><p></p><p>Who curses someone with death like this?</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Qi Yuan's sincerity, he felt that maybe Qi Yuan was just socially inept, and he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>This young brother was still the straightforward person he liked.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your kindness, friend. If my soul is extinguished, I will surely turn into a ghost and come find you." Well, the fat cultivator responded with high emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he felt satisfied with himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

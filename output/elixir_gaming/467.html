        <h1>Chapter 467</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Powerful Yang spirits would occasionally emerge from the Black Magic Abyss and head towards the Demon Gate.</p><p></p><p>The Outer Heavens of Ghost Dominion had a thick aura, with two Great Principles seemingly presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how many powerful experts were lying in wait in secret.</p><p></p><p>Due to the matter of the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood, the two forces had been filled with tension recently.</p><p></p><p>In the cramped cave dwelling, Qi Yuan was consuming the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood and cultivating the "Ancestor Blood Scripture".</p><p></p><p>These fifteen days felt especially long to him.</p><p></p><p>He was always worried that some Yang spirit would suddenly appear and attack him.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately nothing had happened so far.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe and Ice Sword have greatly increased their cultivation and are holding a banquet. They've invited quite a few little spirits. Do you want to come out and listen to some music, and have some mushrooms while you're at it?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Purple Origin Snow's message came through.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rejected without thinking: "No thanks, I don't like eating mushrooms."</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan was determined to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>"These aren't ordinary mushrooms, they're specially made by Big Sis!"</p><p></p><p>"Then I definitely won't eat them. I don't really trust the culinary skills of you Black Magic Abyss cultivators. Your cooking is a bit unpalatable and you don't know how to stir-fry. </p><p></p><p>Hey... do you think if I opened a New Oriental Culinary School here, would I make a fortune?" Qi Yuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Although he missed the delicacies of the Blue Star, they really couldn't compare to the food of the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>It was more nostalgia at work.</p><p></p><p>Thinking further, Qi Yuan felt he should reverse it - after returning to Blue Star, open a culinary school and crush New Oriental.</p><p></p><p>With another business plan added for his return to Blue Star, Qi Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Qi Yuan suddenly looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He saw two extremely hot auras leaking from the sky dome, like divine suns.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the talented disciples in the Demon Gate also suddenly looked up.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Great Principles!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Principles venturing out... is something big about to happen?"</p><p></p><p>These talented disciples were bewildered. They didn't know what changes had occurred on the Ghost Dominion side, nor did they know about the appearance of the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>This time, the powerful experts from the Black Magic Abyss did not conceal their forms when going out.</p><p></p><p>For such powerful beings, combat strength was the most useful weapon.</p><p></p><p>An Xun Lu looked up at the sky dome, her eyes filled with worry: "Big Brother Black Sword has also gone. It must be something big. I hope they'll be alright!"</p><p></p><p>"The Linye Molt hasn't begun yet. Even if there's conflict, it won't be too serious. Everyone, don't worry," Ice Sword spoke up. His expression had cleared of past gloom and he looked pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>This was because over this period of time, he had secretly entered the Yang Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he hadn't revealed this or announced it publicly.</p><p></p><p>He still needed a lot of time to stabilize his realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, during this time, due to Black Sword and Blood Robe being in the limelight, he had almost no presence except for laying eggs.</p><p></p><p>His plan was to wait until the Tai Huang Palace toured the heavens searching for Yang Spirits across the world. When starlight converged on his body, he would secretly dazzle those geniuses.</p><p></p><p>See, the Black Magic Abyss not only had Black Sword and Blood Robe, but also Ice Sword, this peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>He could not only lay eggs, but was also a Yang Spirit that reflected all the heavens!</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had already been secretly planning how to reflect all the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, Ice Sword always felt that his star embryo form was a bit strange, resembling an egg.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Outer Heavens of Ghost Dominion.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable sat in the void, a Ten Thousand Soul Banner spanning across space, covering the sky and concealing his form.</p><p></p><p>Below was the surging Black Magic Ancestor's Blood, emitting a blood-red radiance.</p><p></p><p>Soul Envoys from the Ten Thousand Soul Banner slowly entered the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood, then quickly exited.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable was doing this to pollute the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>In another half month, the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood would be completely polluted, becoming useless waste blood.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a slender figure entered and looked at the Ten Thousand Soul Banner with reverence in her eyes: "Third Ancestor, the Heavenly Venerables of the Black Magic Abyss have left the Demon Gate!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable's eyes flashed with a sharp light. He nodded and then asked: "Has the whereabouts of that envoy from the Human Emperor Palace been found?"</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Human Emperor Palace envoy had suddenly appeared and killed a Yang Spirit of Ghost Dominion.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable had furiously attacked but failed to detain the envoy, which he found quite humiliating.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been ordering his subordinates to find the hiding place of the Human Emperor Palace envoy at all costs.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Heavenly Venerable, we have not found him," the slender figure trembled slightly. Even though she was also a Yang Spirit, she inexplicably felt fear when facing a Great Principle expert.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable's gaze was deep: "You may withdraw."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the slender figure breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast voice sounded in Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable's ear.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Still hung up on that so-called Human Emperor Palace envoy?"</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was the other Great Principle presiding over the Outer Heavens, named Ghost Sin.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable had a small, thin form with the character for "sin" carved on his face, not hiding it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a Yang Spirit who isn't even a Principle dares to threaten me. He's really asking for death!" Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable had a fiery temper.</p><p></p><p>"Variant Yang Spirits are indeed strange, buzzing around like mosquitoes, quite annoying," Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable said. "When this matter is over, I'll personally help you drag him out. Daring to disrespect Ghost Dominion, I think this Human Emperor Palace... all want to enter my soul banner!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this Human Emperor Palace is related to the Black Magic Abyss? This time... will he come in person?" Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable's eyes flickered with killing intent, as well as a strong sense of wariness.</p><p></p><p>That Human Emperor Palace envoy's methods were unfathomable, actually able to vanish into thin air from right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable gave a sinister laugh: "If he dares to come, he won't be able to leave."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable looked pleased: "Could it be that the Banner Master is coming in person?"</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable shook his head: "The Banner Master is in a standoff with that old fellow from the Black Magic Abyss and can't move rashly. But the Banner Master has lent me a split banner from the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner, containing Principle-level killing moves, enough to detain the Human Emperor Palace envoy!"</p><p></p><p>This borrowed split banner from the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner was not the same as the split banner that Great Joy Heavenly Venerable had previously obtained.</p><p></p><p>The one Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable held contained one-tenth of the power of the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Banner.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not be able to carry the Banner Master's Principle-level killing moves.</p><p></p><p>This was specifically meant to deal with the Human Emperor Palace envoy.</p><p></p><p>As for... the Great Principles of the Black Magic Abyss, this... actually had very little effect.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could restrain a Great Principle for a breath, they would not be able to kill them, and it would be difficult to even injure them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they knew that they only needed to guard this place, and the Banner Master had his own plans.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, five days had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable and Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable presided over the Outer Heavens, polluting the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood, appearing especially quiet.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding area was silent, all a mass of chaos.</p><p></p><p>Only Yang Spirits could enter this realm.</p><p></p><p>Entering it would cause one to be assimilated by the chaos, becoming muddled and turning into part of the space.</p><p></p><p>And in the Outer Heavens, the destructive power of Yang Spirits was greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>It was like two ordinary people fighting in mud, their movements restricted.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, without any warning.</p><p></p><p>A golden hand tore through space, spanning across the Outer Heavens, reaching for the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>The chaos trembled, and space became faintly unstable, rippling.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable opened his eyes, his gaze like ghost fire: "They've finally come!"</p><p></p><p>He shouted loudly, and the Ten Thousand Soul Banner shook.</p><p></p><p>Runes flashed, and ghost fire glowed dimly.</p><p></p><p>The wind rose and clouds surged, ghostly winds blew in gusts, and countless pale, ferocious faces appeared on the banner - old people, children, women and men.</p><p></p><p>Ghosts wailed and wolves howled, the cries of ten thousand souls swept out, making listeners' scalps tingle.</p><p></p><p>Mournful and eerie, who knows how many lives this Ten Thousand Soul Banner had claimed.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Soul Banner spanned across the sky, blocking that giant golden hand.</p><p></p><p>Countless ghosts howled and roared as they poured out.</p><p></p><p>Without any words, the battle erupted instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>A cold snort was heard, and an extremely sharp sword intent swept out.</p><p></p><p>The chaos of the Outer Heavens shattered in an instant, and a thin black sword struck from afar.</p><p></p><p>A point of cold light flashed across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Envoys on the Ten Thousand Soul Banner showed fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword appeared in a white robe, striding forward with an imposing figure and heavy steps.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike just now had come from him.</p><p></p><p>With one strike, it was overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Envoys on the Ten Thousand Soul Banner all scrambled to retreat.</p><p></p><p>As for those who were slow, they sizzled like ghosts encountering the sun, disintegrating into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable narrowed his eyes, wariness showing in them: "As expected of a Supreme Principle. Not yet entering Great Principle, yet already having such might. If he enters Great Principle, I'm afraid... he could easily kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable felt a wave of fear.</p><p></p><p>It was fortunate that Ghost Dominion had joined Tai Huang Palace. Otherwise, if Black Sword were allowed to grow, with his strength, Ghost Dominion's fate would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Since you know you're not my match, hand over the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood. If we meet in the future, I can spare your life." Black Sword held the thin sword, dressed in white robes like a heavenly god, his voice indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable grinned: "The Linye Molt is about to begin. It's still unknown whether you'll have the chance to grow into a Great Principle."</p><p></p><p>His words carried naked killing intent.</p><p></p><p>As if saying that in this Linye Molt, Supreme Venerables would fall.</p><p></p><p>And you, Black Sword, are one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk, let's see your true skills!" Purple Origin Ancestor had a fiery temper and couldn't be bothered with words, attacking directly.</p><p></p><p>In the star realm, stars flickered.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor's Dharma body manifested.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying giant appeared, larger than a realm.</p><p></p><p>The huge golden hand seemed able to crush the sun, now grabbing towards the two Great Principles.</p><p></p><p>A battle of this level, if it happened at the Demon Gate, would be enough to tear the Demon Gate apart.</p><p></p><p>But this was happening in the Outer Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even so, just the leaked aura was enough to make Yang Spirit Heavenly Venerables tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Origin Ancestor, let me experience your skills!" Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable shouted loudly, also manifesting his Dharma body.</p><p></p><p>Two terrifying giants clashed in battle at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Various Principle-level killing moves constantly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Even the chaos of the Outer Heavens could not withstand this energy, shattering and reforming.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword stood in the chaos, holding the thin sword.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Senior Brother, please attack Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable!" Black Sword spoke to the old man beside him, his voice calm.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders of the Black Magic Abyss were the ancestors of the Yin Soul Heavens. With a gloomy appearance and an aura as deep as the sea.</p><p></p><p>He stood sinisterly beside Black Sword and suddenly smiled: "We are all Great Principles. Even if we fight all out we can't hurt each other. Why don't we sit down and talk?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Yin Soul Heavens ancestor sat down directly.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable stood still, his eyes flickering with a smile: "What you say makes sense. Without offensive magical treasures manifesting or Supreme Venerables appearing, even if we fight until the heavens break, we won't be able to determine a victor."</p><p></p><p>Above, Purple Origin Ancestor and Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable were engaged in fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>For a battle of this level, just the aftershocks could kill ordinary Yang Spirits.</p><p></p><p>But the two in the center of the battle were unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Even though Purple Origin Ancestor had a slight upper hand, he still couldn't do anything to Ghost Origin Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The wind whistled in, making Black Sword's clothes flutter. He looked at Fifth Elder and suddenly spoke, his voice regretful: "Fifth Senior Brother... you and I are of the same origin... why betray the Black Magic Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fifth Elder was not surprised, but looked at Purple Origin Ancestor: "I just don't want my descendants' bloodline to be cut off. I want to see... Moon God Yuan Jun die!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning Moon God Yuan Jun, Fifth Elder's eyes revealed bone-deep killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had deep enmity with Moon God Yuan Jun.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, in the last Linye Molt, the Black Magic Abyss was weak, with only five Great Principles, but we were like brothers, working together.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Linye Molt hasn't even begun, and the Black Magic Abyss is stronger than before, but some want to leave. It's really..." Black Sword's voice was quite desolate.</p><p></p><p>He was of the same origin as the Black Magic Ancestor's Blood.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to see the Black Magic Abyss fall apart.</p><p></p><p>Fifth Elder looked at Black Sword, his eyes carrying a mocking smile: "Even if you become a Supreme Venerable, you'll still be a pitiful figure, forever influenced by your bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Black Sword sighed softly: "Besides you, who else wants to leave the Black Magic Abyss? Who planned this behind the scenes?"</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Heavenly Venerable sat</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the distance, as if watching a spectacle, there were smiling faces.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Patriarch heard this but did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Then Black Sword said: "I agree to let you leave the Black Demon Abyss, and I won't stop you. </p><p></p><p>As a condition, I will take the Black Demon Ancestor Blood from here!"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of sharpness in Black Sword's gentle voice.</p><p></p><p>Although he was very reluctant to see the Black Demon Abyss fall apart, he would not stop those who wanted to leave.</p><p></p><p>"That's... not enough," the Fifth Patriarch looked at Purple Origin Ancestor with killing intent in his eyes. "He must stay behind."</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's heart skipped a beat inexplicably, and his gaze finally became solemn.</p><p></p><p>With the Fifth Patriarch's words, he inexplicably sensed that a major conspiracy seemed to be brewing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there's no room for negotiation on this matter." Black Sword quickly sent a mental message to Purple Origin Ancestor, telling him to be careful.</p><p></p><p>"That's not up to him," the Fifth Patriarch revealed a grim smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand, and a white porcelain jade bottle appeared in everyone's view.</p><p></p><p>Inside the jade bottle, there was a faint red light flickering.</p><p></p><p>Everyone heard a "thump thump" sound.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's originally calm expression finally showed some panic at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Root Demon Blood!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ghost Sin Venerable in the distance also revealed a wary expression: "It's actually Root Demon Blood!"</p><p></p><p>Although under the coordination of the Great Huang Palace, he had chosen to cooperate with the Fifth Patriarch, he hadn't expected the Fifth Patriarch to bring out Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>Root Demon Blood was a great terror for Yang Spirits, especially for Yang Spirits at the Great Ultimate Principle realm.</p><p></p><p>It could cause Yang Spirits to fall into the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Without any preparation, entering the Root Demon Tribulation, nine out of ten would perish.</p><p></p><p>Especially for someone like Purple Origin Ancestor, who had been suppressing his cultivation realm with great difficulty, if the Root Demon Tribulation suddenly descended, there would be almost no chance of survival except for perishing.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Purple Origin Ancestor smelled the scent of Root Demon Blood. At this moment, his scalp tingled as he sensed endless danger.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Origin Venerable chuckled: "Purple Origin Ancestor, it seems this will be the last battle of your life."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Purple Origin Ancestor snorted coldly. Although anxious in his heart, his battle momentum remained unshaken.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected the other side to obtain Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to use such a precious thing as Root Demon Blood against him? He felt somewhat bitter.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected to encounter such misfortune just after obtaining the new "Ancestor Blood Scripture".</p><p></p><p>At this time, the slender sword in Black Sword's hand trembled. He looked at the Fifth Patriarch with a wary expression.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Patriarch, holding the Root Demon Blood, strode towards Ghost Sin Venerable with a manic smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Ghost Sin Venerable's face was also very thick.</p><p></p><p>Victory was already determined.</p><p></p><p>This time, Ghost Dominion Heaven would achieve a great victory.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor, entangled by Ghost Origin Venerable, had no chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>How could Purple Origin Ancestor flee once the Root Demon Blood was released?</p><p></p><p>However, at this critical moment, Black Sword suddenly spoke up, his aura suddenly becoming sharp.</p><p></p><p>He shouted at the Fifth Patriarch: "Attack!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Patriarch's betrayal was fake, it was a play acted out by the Master and the Fifth Patriarch, just to hunt down a Great Ultimate Principle expert of Ghost Dominion Heaven!</p><p></p><p>He had only learned about all this from the Master's message before setting out.</p><p></p><p>He spoke up, preparing to launch an attack on Ghost Sin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a cold smile curled at the corner of the Fifth Patriarch's mouth, and he said softly: "Attack."</p><p></p><p>These two words were the same as what Black Sword had said.</p><p></p><p>But when Ghost Sin Venerable heard it, the smile in his eyes grew even more.</p><p></p><p>A banner of ten thousand ghosts appeared, emanating a terrifyingly horrific aura.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that with one wave of the banner, a world could be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The vast, profound Ultimate Principle killing move was carried by the banner of ten thousand ghosts, and its target... was actually Black Sword!</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's mind went blank, and an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Is it...</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Principle killing move of the Banner Master, carried by an offensive artifact of creation, fell directly on Black Sword! Black Sword's body froze momentarily at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness also paused at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene from afar, Purple Origin Ancestor's face was shocked: "How daring!"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that their target wasn't him at all, but Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>He also hadn't expected that this matter would be so complicated, he hadn't received any information at all, as if he were an outsider.</p><p></p><p>He shouted in anger, wanting to break through the restraints.</p><p></p><p>But Ghost Origin Venerable blocked his way, and he couldn't break free at all.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant smile appeared in the Fifth Patriarch's eyes: "Junior Brother Black Sword, you didn't expect... our target has always been you, even the Master was fooled by me, hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Patriarch laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Venerable quickly said: "Quickly use the Root Demon Blood, the Ultimate Principle killing move can only restrain him for half a breath!"</p><p></p><p>Their communication was very fast, in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The Fifth Patriarch stopped laughing and threw the Root Demon Blood towards the restrained Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the terrifyingly jumping blood emitted a horrifying aura, heading towards Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword stood still, motionless, countless thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Was it the Master... who made a miscalculation, or...</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he had no time to think more.</p><p></p><p>If something happened to him, the outcome of this Lin Ya Molt for the Black Demon Abyss would likely be very miserable.</p><p></p><p>A smug smile appeared in the Fifth Patriarch's eyes: "In this Lin Ya Molt, a Supreme will fall, but who would have known, the young Supreme would die at this old man's hands."</p><p></p><p>But as he was smiling, suddenly, the smile on his face froze.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Venerable was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's eyes also showed a surprised look.</p><p></p><p>They saw that the Root Demon Blood, which was originally flying towards Black Sword, suddenly made a 90-degree turn, like a blood snake, and crashed into the void where the Black Demon Ancestor Blood was located.</p><p></p><p>The void collapsed for a moment, and a man wearing blood-colored armor appeared. He was holding a bowl in his hand, seemingly about to scoop up some Black Demon Ancestor Blood. A flash of surprise passed through his cold eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Root Demon Blood, as if seeing its own kind, directly crashed into the blood armor and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The man appeared from the void, a trace of embarrassment flashing in his eyes. He had been caught trying to steal the Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>But then his expression became cold again.</p><p></p><p>According to the methods Qi Yuan had learned from the comment section on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, if you're in the right, you convince people with reason.</p><p></p><p>If you're not in the right, you muddy the waters.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, when the rules are in your favor, you talk about rules; when the rules are not in your favor, you talk about human feelings.</p><p></p><p>When both rules and facts are not in your favor, you muddy the waters.</p><p></p><p>This way, you can stand undefeated.</p><p></p><p>So, Qi Yuan took the initiative!</p><p></p><p>"The petty thieves of Ghost Dominion Heaven indeed have no martial virtue. I was merely traveling through the void when they ambushed me with Root Demon Blood, such a great evil thing!</p><p></p><p>I... my stomach hurts now!"</p><p></p><p>This blood-armored man was, of course, Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he secretly hid the bowl.</p><p></p><p>After fifteen days, Qi Yuan had recovered his own strength and wanted to come and fish in troubled waters, to take away the Black Demon Ancestor Blood.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he arrived here, he was hit by the legendary Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was neither at the Ultimate Principle realm nor a Yang Spirit, so there was no so-called Root Demon Tribulation for him.</p><p></p><p>So when the Root Demon Blood approached, it couldn't trigger his Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>It just nuzzled around in his arms, making him a bit itchy. He caught it and stuffed it into the Human Emperor Banner.</p><p></p><p>He would explore this Root Demon Blood after he snatched the Black Demon Ancestor Blood and returned.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Fifth Patriarch saw the newcomer and his eyes nearly popped out.</p><p></p><p>Especially... the Root Demon Blood was gone!</p><p></p><p>Gone!</p><p></p><p>His plan was ruined!</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Venerable also looked at Qi Yuan with an angry face: "Human Emperor Hall Envoy, you're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Ghost Sin Venerable directly attacked Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's you who are seeking death. Not only did you steal my Human Emperor Banner, but you also ambushed me. Today, I'm taking this Black Demon Ancestor Blood as compensation!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was originally sneaking around, now that he had been discovered, openly took out several bowls and started scooping the Black Demon Ancestor Blood into them.</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished scooping, a powerful attack came.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Venerable and the Fifth Patriarch joined forces to attack Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The immense power was enough to shatter space.</p><p></p><p>For the current Qi Yuan, facing the Ultimate Principle killing moves of these two, he could barely handle one person, but two would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at this moment, an elegant voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, let me assist you!" Time had passed, and Black Sword had freed himself from the Ultimate Principle killing move.</p><p></p><p>A slender sword stirred the heaven and earth, blocking in front of the Fifth Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's eyes carried a bone-deep killing intent: "There's one more person... who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword strike was full of pressure.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Patriarch's face was full of panic, along with intense anger.</p><p></p><p>Today's scheme had all come to nothing.</p><p></p><p>Without the Root Demon Blood, even if the Banner Master came in person, they couldn't detain Black Sword and Purple Origin Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Fifth Patriarch quickly sent a message to Ghost Sin Venerable: "Quickly go and invite the Banner Master!"</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Human Emperor Hall Envoy was not strong, and he couldn't resist a Great Ultimate Principle expert.</p><p></p><p>But his methods were unpredictable, and he could disappear into thin air.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Patriarch wanted to detain the Human Emperor Hall Envoy and retrieve the Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Venerable obviously understood this reasoning as well.</p><p></p><p>He was about to send a message when suddenly he seemed to sense something, and a look of wild joy appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"No need to send a message, the Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, all the Great Ultimate Principle experts present felt a world-destroying aura at this moment.</p><p></p><p>That aura was unparalleled and unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Even Purple Origin Ancestor and Black Sword smelled a strong sense of danger at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move, coming from an infinite distance, was directed at the Human Emperor Hall Envoy.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, this is the Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move, it can restrain time and space!" Black Sword quickly warned.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor was also worried for the Human Emperor Hall Envoy.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Human Emperor Hall Envoy had just saved Black Sword's life.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, suffering the Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move, although he would be restrained for a few breaths, Ghost Dominion Heaven had no means to kill him except for Root Demon Blood, they could only injure him, which was not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>But the Human Emperor Hall Envoy was different, not being at the Great Ultimate Principle realm, once restrained, he would be unable to escape and would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword quickly warned, but unfortunately, his voice hadn't yet reached Qi Yuan's ears before the Ultimate Principle killing move had already fallen on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, a look of wild joy appeared on Ghost Sin Venerable's face.</p><p></p><p>"Kid... now you know how to write the word 'death'?"</p><p></p><p>With the Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move in action, the Human Emperor Hall Envoy would certainly be restrained.</p><p></p><p>Now he was like a fish on a chopping board, his life and death were in Ghost Sin Venerable's grasp.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Black Sword quickly struck with his sword, wanting to buy a breath of time for the Human Emperor Hall Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Fifth Patriarch stood like a mountain in front of him, and he couldn't break through at all.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Sin, Root Demon Blood!" The Fifth Patriarch shouted, reminding Ghost Sin Venerable to retrieve the Root Demon Blood.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Sin Venerable's face bore a smile as he brought out the banner of ten thousand ghosts in his hand: "Kid, enter my banner of ten thousand ghosts and become a soul servant!"</p><p></p><p>The banner of ten thousand ghosts waved, emitting a strong and grim aura.</p><p></p><p>Usually, Ghost Sin Venerable wouldn't fight like this, all offense and no defense.</p><p></p><p>But the Human Emperor Hall Envoy was restrained by the Ultimate Principle killing move and couldn't move, so he dared to do this, to annihilate the Human Emperor Hall Envoy.</p><p></p><p>However, when the banner of ten thousand ghosts approached the Human Emperor Hall Envoy, Ghost Sin Venerable suddenly widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because he clearly saw that the originally restrained Human Emperor Hall Envoy suddenly curled his lips into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Something even more terrifying happened.</p><p></p><p>They saw him stretch out a huge hand and grab onto a part of the banner of ten thousand ghosts.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant and eerie voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks for nature's gift!"</p><p></p><p>They saw him grabbing the banner of ten thousand ghosts, and at this moment, his figure... disappeared.</p><p></p><p>What disappeared along with him... was also the banner of ten thousand ghosts!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Ghost Sin Venerable widened his eyes, his face showing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move could restrain all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>How could the Human Emperor Hall Envoy... move?</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand, he was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's face also showed a moment of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he hadn't expected such a thing to happen either.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that he had comprehended the supreme Ultimate Principle, but hadn't reached the Great Ultimate Principle realm, and would still be affected by the Banner Master's Ultimate Principle killing move.</p><p></p><p>How did the Human Emperor Hall Envoy... do it? All of this... was like a mystery.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

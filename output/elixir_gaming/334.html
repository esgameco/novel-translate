        <h1>Chapter 334</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The martial arts competition continued.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was Qi Yuan's turn.</p><p></p><p>"Contestant number 06, Qi Yuan... please enter the arena."</p><p></p><p>With this announcement, Qi Yuan stepped onto the stage.</p><p></p><p>In the VIP box, the little canary eagerly waved her small fists, holding a glow stick in one hand, cheering excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, go for it!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the canary was Qi Yuan's personal cheerleader.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua, who had just finished his match, suddenly became tense and watched Qi Yuan intently. </p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had previously only seen Qi Yuan as a fellow student at the martial arts school, without any thoughts of comparing himself to him.</p><p></p><p>But now that Qi Yuan had entered the national competition through a special channel, Xu Tiehua naturally paid more attention to him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to understand what was so special about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The strong do not bother comparing themselves to the weak, but when faced with someone of the same level, the competitive spirit becomes very intense.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Yu, who do you think will win this match?" Xu Tiehua asked.</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu took a serious look at the arena: "Qi Yuan's opponent is Xie Heng, who uses the Charging Fist style. He has previously made it to the top 100 in the national competition and is not far from the martial arts limit. He has a very high chance of winning."</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu analyzed rationally.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao shook his head: "Qi Yuan will win."</p><p></p><p>As long as the protagonist is present, Qi Yuan will win.</p><p></p><p>This was obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's rare for you two to disagree. </p><p></p><p>No worries, let's just sit and watch. The result should be clear in a few minutes..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua's words were cut short as the orange in his hand fell to the ground and his eyes revealed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the whole arena erupted in cheers.</p><p></p><p>The electronic voice also announced at this time:</p><p></p><p>"Contestant number 06... Qi Yuan is victorious!"</p><p></p><p>"It was an instant kill!" Xu Tiehua was utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's body stiffened slightly, his face showing a fanatical expression.</p><p></p><p>As expected... it must be him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua couldn't help but feel defeated: "This level of skill must be at the martial arts limit! He's so young, and has only been practicing martial arts for... a few months, yet he's already at the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>The gap between people... how can it be so large?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's victory was certainly joyous.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Qi Yuan so strong was even more heartbreaking than being eliminated in the first round himself.</p><p></p><p>He had practiced martial arts for so long, barely touching the threshold of the national level.</p><p></p><p>Yet Qi Yuan, in less than three months, had left him far behind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xing Yu's expression also showed some emotion, but she still smiled and said: "Senior Xu, if your martial arts progress isn't going well, you can always go back and inherit your family's vast fortune and noble title.</p><p></p><p>Those are... things that even the champion of the martial arts competition can't compare to."</p><p></p><p>Xing Yu's eyes revealed a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>In her view, the champion of the martial arts competition was just a big internet celebrity.</p><p></p><p>It would probably take a long time to turn that fame into wealth and accumulate billions.</p><p></p><p>But she and Xu Tiehua already had billions.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tiehua even had a noble title that almost all people in Great Qin would go crazy for.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xing Yu's words, Xu Tiehua finally relaxed a bit, feeling somewhat better, but he still said: "Without relying on family background, I'm far inferior to Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't family background also a form of strength?" Xing Yu said from the side.</p><p></p><p>Some people's starting line is the finish line that many others can't reach even after struggling for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the martial arts competition was quite dull.</p><p></p><p>Without the trash-talking sessions, everyone was very restrained.</p><p></p><p>Even when knocked down in the arena, no one dared to speak harshly.</p><p></p><p>At most, they would say a mild "I'll be back" without much feeling.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this year's martial arts competition was the most civilized.</p><p></p><p>However, the intensity of the fights was not weak, with many instances of instant kills.</p><p></p><p>Especially Zhang Yang, who instantly defeated all his opponents.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was the same, easily winning by instant kill.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the second day of the martial arts competition battles arrived.</p><p></p><p>However, this time... there were an unusual 21 people entering the finals.</p><p></p><p>With matches of two against two, this meant that one person would definitely get a bye.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's attention was focused on the drawing of lots.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also had an expectant look: "My luck has always been good, hurry up and give me a bye!"</p><p></p><p>The numbers on the big screen were still rotating.</p><p></p><p>The canary smiled gently: "Doesn't your robot Zero One specialize in hacking? Have it secretly manipulate things, and everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Cheating is not good, it's unethical, but well, you've reminded me of something." Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Flowing Wind Realm, he would threaten the Heavenly Dao every day.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the threats worked.</p><p></p><p>Now, he also wanted a bye.</p><p></p><p>So... should he continue to threaten the Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you up there, want to say thank you to me? After all, I've made many contributions to the civilization and harmony of your world. Can you give me a backdoor?" Qi Yuan said softly to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The canary smiled: "Isn't asking the Heavenly Dao for a backdoor also cheating?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's different." Qi Yuan turned his head.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't him cheating, it was just the Heavenly Dao showing gratitude and repaying him.</p><p></p><p>Bai Suzhen was willing to marry Xu Xian to repay his kindness.</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with the Heavenly Dao giving him a little help?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the numbers on the screen stopped rotating.</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes: "Indeed, threatening the Heavenly Dao still works. I... got a bye.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, looks like I'll have to... threaten it more often in the future."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was happy, getting a bye was better than fighting on stage.</p><p></p><p>With more threats, who knows, he might directly get a bye to the finals.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't enjoy lying down watching others compete while easily completing game tasks?</p><p></p><p>Having gotten a bye in the first round, there was also a bye in the second round.</p><p></p><p>But there was no bye in the third round.</p><p></p><p>Because only six people were left.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because Qi Yuan's threats to the Heavenly Dao had worked, he got byes in the first two rounds, and in the third round he faced Han Xianyun from the North Crane School.</p><p></p><p>Han Xianyun directly surrendered.</p><p></p><p>This scene also caused many spectators to complain.</p><p></p><p>"It's rigged!"</p><p></p><p>"There must be some behind-the-scenes manipulation!"</p><p></p><p>"That guy's luck is too good!"</p><p></p><p>"Not only does he get byes, but his opponent directly surrenders!"</p><p></p><p>"That was Han Xianyun from the North Crane School!"</p><p></p><p>"Must be some rich second generation coming to experience life."</p><p></p><p>"He's so handsome, I want to have his babies."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, brother, mind your image. Don't sit on the ground and ejaculate in public."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Yang had just finished his battle. His gaze was sharp as he looked at the VIP box where Qi Yuan was, filled with fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>He returned to his own box to rest, because in an hour, the final battle would take place.</p><p></p><p>The rules for the final battle were simple: a three-way free-for-all, and the last one standing on the stage would be the champion.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang returned to his box, and immediately staff members began to maintain and care for him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhang, congratulations in advance. This championship is definitely yours!" said a short man with a grin on his face.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't from martial arts circles, but came from an influential family background and was Zhang Yang's little follower.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit difficult. Qi Yuan's strength... seems unfathomable. I even have a feeling that given another half year, he could break through the martial arts limit!" said a burly martial artist in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>He had seen Qi Yuan in action, easily defeating those at the martial arts limit with instant kills.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhang Yang would find it hard to achieve that level.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yang narrowed his eyes without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>The short man then said: "Hmph, even if that kid luckily becomes the champion, what use is it?</p><p></p><p>Hehe, a while ago, when he passed the test, he caught the attention of many big shots in the Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Those big shots all treated him as the next Luo Bufan, the hope of breaking through the martial arts limit.</p><p></p><p>But now... hehe, haven't they all abandoned him? Recently, they've all been coming to Brother Zhang's side."</p><p></p><p>The short man spoke proudly.</p><p></p><p>What he said was true.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan demonstrated powerful martial abilities and talent, causing a stir within the Martial Arts Alliance. However, this commotion did not last long.</p><p></p><p>As rumors spread, the upper echelons of the Martial Arts Alliance heard about cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Why practice martial arts if one could cultivate immortality? Even if one reached the limits of martial arts, they still couldn't defeat genetically enhanced warriors. So what was the point? Therefore, the higher-ups had been surrounding Zhang Yang lately.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhang Yang's family had connections to immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the short man's words, a hint of desolation flashed in the burly martial artist's eyes. He then said: "Indeed, even if Qi Yuan wins the martial arts tournament championship, the future belongs to Brother Zhang Yang. The immortal path... is the true great way."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the future belongs to me, and so does the present. I will definitely win the championship of this martial arts tournament!" Zhang Yang's eyes flashed with a sharp light. </p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Qi Yuan in the distance carried a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts tournament would end with killing, end with the championship, and serve as a farewell to the declining martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>In the future, there would be no Martial Arts Champion Zhang Yang, but Immortal Cultivation Champion Zhang Yang!</p><p></p><p>He, Zhang Yang, would stand not only at the peak of martial arts, but also at the peak of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner for the rest of the excerpt.]</p>

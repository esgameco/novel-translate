        <h1>Chapter 386</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's an incredibly powerful, invincible and explosive great plan!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan had a flash of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"My previous plans all had names that were too crude, lacking in substance, making me seem like an uncultured person. This time, the plan's name can't be so simplistic!"</p><p></p><p>"What name?" Jiang Lingsu's eyes held a spring of water.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity!" Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>"..." Jiang Lingsu rolled her eyes. </p><p></p><p>She shouldn't have gotten her hopes up! "What great calamity?" Jiang Lingsu tilted her head to look at Qi Yuan, her lotus-white hand propping up her pretty face.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, the great calamity that will turn us all into nourishment!" Qi Yuan's expression became solemn, full of righteousness.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a look of surprise flashed in Jiang Lingsu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>How was this similar to cultivation techniques being poisonous?</p><p></p><p>If cultivation techniques were really poisonous, wouldn't that mean their entire path was wrong?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she thought of that painter.</p><p></p><p>At the time, that painter had painted many strange paintings.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had asked about the meaning of one of them.</p><p></p><p>In the painting, terrifying demonic immortals were ravaging the world, while a powerful immortal suppressed them... behind was an endless sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>The painter said that heaven and earth had long since merged with the demonic immortals. If the demonic immortals perished, heaven and earth would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's face turned a bit pale: "Senior Brother, are you confident about that great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't know what great calamity Qi Yuan was referring to, and simply took it as an ordinary powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>"I'm confident. After all, I'm now the number one Purple Palace cultivator of the Divine Light Sect!" Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>He had broken through to the Purple Palace realm, and wanted to announce it to the world.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then immediately took out the jade slip for the Divine Flower Society and sent out a server-wide announcement.</p><p></p><p>"Warmly congratulating Fellow Daoist Qi Yuan on becoming the Divine Light Sect's first Purple Palace cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>After sending the announcement, Qi Yuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>It felt good to use his privileges. </p><p></p><p>No wonder everyone liked being a privileged dog.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Lingsu hadn't opened the Divine Flower Society jade slip, so she naturally didn't know about this.</p><p></p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief and said softly: "As long as Senior Brother is confident, beat that guy to a pulp!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm always violent towards enemies," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu suddenly recalled the scenes she had seen in her family's supreme treasure, and she also remembered what the painter had said.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what if when you go to fight that great calamity, I die, and the people of the Divine Light Sect die - would you still go fight it?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu recalled one of the painter's paintings above, and suddenly thought: "If I had such a powerful enemy, I would definitely hide far away with Senior Brother. Better to be a turtle sunbathing on the beach than a butterfly dying for love."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's thinking was simple - if she could defeat the powerful enemy but the people she cared about would die, she would rather hide far away.</p><p></p><p>"Being a turtle isn't good, you might easily end up as turtle soup!" Qi Yuan said seriously. "Your question is very interesting, and it reminds me of something."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hadn't cultivated the poisonous techniques of this world.</p><p></p><p>But everyone else had.</p><p></p><p>They cultivated these techniques, reached profound realms, and left their names on mythical monuments.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, a great calamity would appear to harvest this nourishment.</p><p></p><p>What about those who cultivated other techniques as nourishment...?</p><p></p><p>Would they be marked, their lives hanging by a thread?</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, stretch out your hand. Let Senior Brother examine your body," Qi Yuan quickly said.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to find out the effects of the techniques on others in the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? I'm not sick!" Jiang Lingsu refused verbally, but still extended her delicate jade hand to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She still trusted her senior brother completely, without reservation. </p><p></p><p>After all, back then, it was Senior Brother who had treated her ailments.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's palm rested on the back of Jiang Lingsu's hand, and at that moment divine spiritual power flowed into Jiang Lingsu's body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully examined.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu didn't move or resist at all.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was a very dangerous thing. If the other person wished, she could be seriously injured or even perish.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's surging divine spiritual power was even greater than that of most Yang Spirit realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Innate Seed meant almost all of his power had returned.</p><p></p><p>His control was so fine that there was no need to worry about harming Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's brows furrowed, because he discovered a faint mark on Jiang Lingsu's true spirit.</p><p></p><p>That mark was like a sun.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's desire to shoot down the sun in the sky grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>[Mark of the Palace Master of the Supreme Radiance Palace. All who cultivate the techniques of this realm will condense this mark, becoming nourishment, with life and death controlled by the Palace Master of the Supreme Radiance Palace.]</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Jiang Lingsu's face turned deathly pale, as this was the first time she had seen such an expression on her senior brother's face.</p><p></p><p>Could it be her body...?</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," Qi Yuan said calmly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>That mark, even he couldn't remove it.</p><p></p><p>And this kind of mark, it was serious but also not so serious.</p><p></p><p>This kind of mark was like a spell.</p><p></p><p>As long as the master of the spell wished, they could make all living beings with this mark perish at any time.</p><p></p><p>But normally, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>"You're fine, it's me who has a problem. It seems the 'Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity' plan needs to be more detailed," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>So, in the plan to destroy the great calamity, he needed to add a condition - eliminate the mark, or isolate it.</p><p></p><p>"It does need to be more detailed. Enemies don't have to be killed, but lives must be preserved," Jiang Lingsu said softly, with rare gentleness.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, why don't we prepare and head to Helan Prefecture to meet that painter?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already decided that during this time, he would use his own eyes more to look at the marks inside people's bodies and find key information.</p><p></p><p>If he could find a solution, all would be well.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Alright, wait for me, I'll go pack."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll also go tell the Sect Leader the good news of my breakthrough to Purple Palace. </p><p>Sigh, the Divine Light Sect producing such an outstanding disciple as me, the ancestral graves of the sect must be emitting green smoke!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the Divine Flower Society forum.</p><p></p><p>An announcement suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had become the Divine Light Sect's first Purple Palace cultivator. All the Divine Flower Society members spread the news in excitement, shocked and wondering who this person was.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this guy? The Divine Light Sect's first Purple Palace cultivator? This Divine Light Sect must be really weak to not even have a Purple Palace cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Probably some remote sect!"</p><p></p><p>"If it's a remote sect, how could they send out this kind of message that everyone in our Divine Flower Society can see?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably the illegitimate son of some big shot, only able to show off and boast in this sneaky way!"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe even the son of a live-in son-in-law, not daring to be placed in the main clan so sent to some remote place!"</p><p></p><p>These people were very gossipy and curious about Qi Yuan's identity, making wild guesses.</p><p></p><p>At this time, suddenly there was a prompt below this post.</p><p></p><p>"Warning: Spreading rumors without evidence, yellow card issued. The Divine Flower Society Disciplinary Committee is watching!"</p><p></p><p>"Please modify the content to add the words 'rumor-mongering'."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this message, the cultivators who had been wildly speculating on the Divine Flower Society forum all had their faces fall.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society Disciplinary Committee was established under the guidance of a little fox spirit.</p><p></p><p>The members of this disciplinary committee initially just patrolled the forum to see if there were any</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were people who insulted the Blood-Robed Sword God senior.</p><p></p><p>Later, more and more people joined this disciplinary committee, forming an organization to truly patrol the forum, seemingly doing what the Blood-Robed Sword God senior said about purifying the atmosphere of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Getting a yellow card was equivalent to a warning. </p><p></p><p>If you got three yellow cards, sorry, you had to write a self-criticism.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators both loved and hated the people of the Divine Flower Association's disciplinary committee.</p><p></p><p>They loved that if other cultivators insulted them, they could report it directly.</p><p></p><p>They hated that they themselves couldn't casually insult others anymore.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the chat group of the Four Emperors of Divine Flowers:</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord frantically tagged the Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"You reached the Purple Palace realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor also appeared: "Sigh, you closed off for two and a half years, acting as an absentee boss for the Original God Sharing Association?"</p><p></p><p>The Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman didn't appear in the group.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, Qi Yuan dispatched three great venerable ones to help the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman break through to the Yin God realm. Now she was stabilizing her realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan finally turned his attention to the chat group of the Four Emperors of Divine Flowers.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, my talent is too weak, I have to work hard to cultivate and break through realms? Sigh, after being busy for so long, I barely broke through to the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to Purple Palace is one thing, but I only have 'Purple' without the 'Palace'!" Qi Yuan was very depressed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" The Rogue Immortal Lord didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Because of the Blood-Robed Sword God, the Rogue Immortal Lord's status had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>He could be considered to chat and laugh with Purple Palace cultivators, and come and go with Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>He had a deeper understanding of the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>So, Qi Yuan's words didn't hold up.</p><p></p><p>"To break through to the Purple Palace realm, you not only need 'Purple', but also need a 'Palace'.</p><p></p><p>I've pretty much got the 'Purple' sorted out, gathering a lot of purple qi.</p><p></p><p>As for the 'Palace', I have a concept, but I still need to find an artist to draw it for me."</p><p></p><p>"Ah... purple qi?!!" The Rogue Immortal Lord was shocked, "Are you talking about the number one qi in the immortal way, the primordial qi, the mother qi of all things, the primordial purple qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord was completely shocked: "I heard even Yang Gods can hardly obtain a strand of purple qi, yet you have... and use it for Purple Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The preciousness of purple qi only existed in legends.</p><p></p><p>This preciousness was far more terrifying than heavenly foundation building, not even in the same league.</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone with a monthly salary of 3,000 suddenly learned their roommate had a monthly income of 10 to the power of 10 billion trillion.</p><p></p><p>That kind of unimaginable feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Xiaoyu, you're making too big a deal out of this. Even if Origin Venerable said he used the Dao Ancestor's bones as toothpicks, I'd believe it!" The Great Sun Flame Emperor was unfazed, "Those ten suns in the sky are Origin Venerable's golden core, have you ever seen a star golden core?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaoyu was the Rogue Immortal Lord's full name.</p><p></p><p>Being called by his name directly made him quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, my knowledge is too limited." The Rogue Immortal Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the knowledge he had received, to break through to Purple Palace, one first needed to comprehend the essence of the immortal way, then forge their own path, and awaken their innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>What purple qi, what building a palace... what did these have to do with Purple Palace? Well, they seemed related only in terms of the words.</p><p></p><p>"How has the Original God Sharing Association been doing lately, how are the collected techniques?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was very concerned about these things.</p><p></p><p>It related to his subsequent path.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had entered the Purple Palace realm, he needed more and more techniques.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the myriad ways of the world were hidden in all the techniques. What he was doing now was collecting fragments of the myriad ways.</p><p></p><p>"The method you taught before, as well as the method for everyone in the Divine Flower Association to upload techniques to get techniques, is very useful.</p><p></p><p>I'll send you the collected techniques right away.</p><p></p><p>However..." The Great Sun Flame Emperor hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"However what?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"However, your divine method has leaked out, and some mysterious powerful figures have come to our Original God Sharing Association, wanting to meet you." The Great Sun Flame Emperor said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Qi Yuan imitated a certain Duoduo, letting everyone upload techniques, slash prices, boost, etc., to share divine methods.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite generous, and eventually really published the divine method.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was very calm, "What do they want to see me for, could it be they want to kill me and steal my treasures? Where do they live, I want to go see if they have cats that can cook at their home."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of Xie Xinsu, who had a cat that could cook at his home.</p><p></p><p>"They seem to be people from some reclusive families, wanting to talk to you about the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>They once said that the divine method should not be leaked as much as possible, otherwise... once it reaches a certain number, this world... all cultivators will die!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Flame Emperor's eyes carried solemnity, and a hint of bitter resignation.</p><p></p><p>Although Origin Venerable always created miracles, the great calamity and the depths behind it were too deep.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this Cang Lan Realm, how many cultivators could truly help Qi Yuan? And the great calamity had the foundation of other worlds.</p><p></p><p>If the great calamity was outmatched, they could call for help in the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>Those who came down would all be gods! Maybe even the legendary Yang Gods! And in the Cang Lan Realm, who could help Qi Yuan? So, facing the great calamity was almost Qi Yuan's lone struggle.</p><p></p><p>What they did was insignificant.</p><p></p><p>He had even thought sometimes, since Qi Yuan hadn't cultivated any poisonous methods, he could even leave this realm and escape this vortex.</p><p></p><p>Even more darkly, he could even communicate with the beings behind the great calamity and take them as masters.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Qi Yuan pondered, then sent a message, "Don't be afraid, Qi Yuan's plan to eliminate the great calamity will be formulated soon. At most in half a year, my plan will be perfectly implemented, and the great calamity will definitely have nowhere to hide. What divine method can't be passed on, what a joke!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Sun Flame Emperor felt a myriad of emotions: "Origin Venerable, don't force yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if you talk like that, I'll use my golden core to heat eggs at your doorstep!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't!" The Great Sun Flame Emperor laughed, then said, "Those people from the reclusive family left a contact method. They said when you appear, to go to their family's secret realm immediately to discuss the divine method matter."</p><p></p><p>"Go my ass, if anyone's going it should be them coming to see me.</p><p></p><p>Tell them, five days later, I will go to Helan Prefecture in the Eastern Land and stay for a while. If they want to see me, they should come to Helan Prefecture to seek an audience with me.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, no way.</p><p></p><p>I generally don't like to visit others. When I take the initiative to go somewhere, it's usually to wipe out a family!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, when he went to Black Mountain Sect, well, he wiped them out; when he went to Light Palace, he also went to wipe them out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was going to Helan Prefecture to see that artist, not to wipe out anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll pass on your words to them.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, since they've chosen to live in seclusion, they might as well keep hiding. What real great power stays in seclusion all the time?" said the Great Sun Flame Emperor.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of these reclusive families either.</p><p></p><p>The Original God Sharing Association was now very powerful.</p><p></p><p>If those reclusive families were really strong, they probably would have broken through the Original God Sharing Association and dug out Qi Yuan long ago.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it because their strength isn't enough that they choose to live in seclusion? Then they put on an aloof appearance?</p><p></p><p>Who are they trying to impress!</p><p></p><p>PS: Thanks to Orange Flavored Orange, Lin Beijun, De Yeeee Zhi's Bear, Reader 20230106175814679, Blue-Robed Sword Disciple, and "Already Abandoned Brother" Jiangshan Still Seems Like the Old Gentleness and others for their rewards!</p><p></p><p>Don't give rewards anymore everyone, subscribing and liking is the biggest support!

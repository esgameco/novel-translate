        <h1>Chapter 462</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After receiving Qi Yuan's reply, Ice Sword felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>"I need to cultivate this 'Ancestral Blood Technique' as soon as possible, otherwise... if it becomes widespread, my advantage will be reduced."</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe is truly formidable. This 'Ancestral Blood Technique' seems tailor-made for me."</p><p></p><p>Being tailor-made, he would achieve the best results cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>Others cultivating it would have correspondingly inferior results.</p><p></p><p>"He... how does he understand my bloodline so well?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ice Sword was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He and Blood Robe had always had little entanglement, and they hadn't even met many times.</p><p></p><p>And he had never exposed his bloodline to Blood Robe, nor could Blood Robe obtain a sample of his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>But how did Blood Robe understand his bloodline so well? Ice Sword was suddenly shocked, his whole body trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that I have Blood Robe's bloodline in me, so... that's why he understands me so well?"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, why would he go to such trouble to rewrite such a precious 'Ancestral Blood Technique' for me?"</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Ice Sword's mind. Thinking of Blood Robe again, he felt a bit warmer, as if the warm sun of midsummer was shining on his body.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Dominion camp was called Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Pass and Demon Pass were similar fortresses and strongholds.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, prodigies were gathered in Ghost Pass.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon Abyss is truly producing talents one after another. Not only did it produce Black Sword and Blood Robe, now there's also an egg-laying... Ice Sword." The man was as handsome as jade, wearing gold-threaded openwork dark armor, with a white bone jade pendant hanging at his waist. Mentioning Ice Sword, his eyes revealed a greedy look.</p><p></p><p>"Is this his egg? It's indeed an excellent... soul servant."</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze fell on a wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Inside the box, an azure egg the size of a dinosaur egg appeared in the sight of the many prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this egg, they all involuntarily breathed rapidly, their eyes full of greedy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This is the most perfect egg I've seen in the past hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>"This ice egg is a natural-born soul servant!"</p><p></p><p>This egg only had a primordial soul.</p><p></p><p>And it was perfectly suited to be a soul servant.</p><p></p><p>Collected into the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, it would be the best soul servant.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary powerful soul servants still needed to be suppressed from time to time to avoid rebellion.</p><p></p><p>With this egg soul servant, there was no need to worry at all.</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a coincidence in this world? Could there be some trick in this ice egg?" a prodigy asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Ghost Dominion and Black Demon Abyss had just fought, and as a result, the Black Demon Abyss suddenly had a resource that Ghost Dominion needed.</p><p></p><p>This matter seemed strange.</p><p></p><p>According to conspiracy theories, there must be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Mo Zhong, wearing the gold-threaded dark armor, spoke at this time: "I once took the ice egg to see the ancestor. The ancestor said... there's no problem with this ice egg."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mo Zhong's words, the prodigies present breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Since the ancestor said so, there should be no issue!"</p><p></p><p>"The ancestor is the great principle..."</p><p></p><p>They felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>"I've received the latest news that there are a large number of ice eggs in the Flower Moon Wonderland," Mo Zhong spoke, his voice cold, with a hint of killing intent hidden within.</p><p></p><p>The other prodigies were startled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, they had all received this news as well.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe acts strangely. After bringing the ice eggs into the Flower Moon Wonderland, he declared that anyone who wants the ice eggs must defeat him. He's truly arrogant!" a prodigy spoke, his eyes carrying intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"He indeed has the right to be arrogant. Not only did he kill Mo Na, but he also escaped from the hands of a Yang Spirit Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong he is, he's just like us, merely a Myth realm cultivator."</p><p></p><p>These prodigies were all indignant.</p><p></p><p>They were all once-in-ten-thousand-years geniuses, each with their own pride.</p><p></p><p>How could they fear a mere Blood Robe without having fought him?</p><p></p><p>"This time I will enter the Flower Moon Wonderland to fight Blood Robe and seize the ice eggs. Who is willing to go with me?" Mo Zhong spoke, his fighting spirit high.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go!" a prodigy spoke up, his eyes flashing fiercely. "I want both the battle achievements and the ice eggs!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe fellow is too overbearing. Does he really think our Ghost Dominion has no one?"</p><p></p><p>These prodigies were filled with righteous indignation, all wanting to go to the Flower Moon Wonderland.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there might be some scheme of the Black Demon Abyss in this, but they didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>In the Flower Moon Wonderland, even ordinary Yang Spirit realm cultivators would drop to the Myth realm upon entering.</p><p></p><p>The Great Principle experts, who could affect the overall situation with a single move, were stationed separately in Demon Pass and Ghost Pass, unable to move freely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after they enter the wonderland, both Ghost Dominion and Black Demon Abyss would have some Yang Spirit experts appear to confront each other.</p><p></p><p>In the early stages of war, there was still some emphasis on matching generals against generals, and troops against troops.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the necessary assassinations against prodigies would not be lacking.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there was also much discussion in Demon Pass.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Robe... is too reckless. Going alone to the Flower Moon Wonderland, if anything happens to him, our Black Demon Abyss's morale will greatly decrease." A Yang Spirit Venerable spoke.</p><p></p><p>They all knew about Blood Robe's provocation of Ghost Dominion's prodigies in the Flower Moon Wonderland.</p><p></p><p>"Does he really think he can compare to Black Sword?" The Yang Spirit of Yin Soul Heaven spoke, not hiding the dissatisfaction in his words.</p><p></p><p>If it were Black Sword doing such a thing while in the Myth realm, they would approve.</p><p></p><p>But Blood Robe... was just a little Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>In the hearts of these Yang Spirit experts, only Purple Origin Ancestor treasured him. In reality, he was just a larger version of Ice Sword.</p><p></p><p>As for Blood Robe escaping the Yang Spirit's assassination, they all guessed it was Purple Origin Ancestor who had intervened.</p><p></p><p>"Since he dares to go, it means he has confidence," a Yang Spirit said cheerfully. "It's just right, we can also gauge Blood Robe's talent and combat power through this battle, to see how big the gap is between him and Black Sword."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded, not paying much attention to this matter.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe was only treasured by Purple Origin Ancestor. To them, he was just a young prodigy.</p><p></p><p>What kind of prodigies hadn't they seen before?</p><p></p><p>"Purple Origin Feng, how about you go as the guardian this time?" A Yang Spirit Venerable looked at Purple Origin Feng and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Feng was a taciturn Celestial Lord. He nodded and said, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>"With you there, we can surely prevent the Yang Spirit Celestial Lord of Ghost Domination Heaven from taking action," a Yang Spirit said.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Wind Decay Celestial Lord saw this scene and his thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Blood Robe had pointed him out as the mole last time, he had been very cautious and often overthinking things.</p><p></p><p>He still didn't understand Blood Robe's actions.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he supposed to be targeting Celestial Lord Hui Zeng? </p><p></p><p>Why would he go provoke the geniuses of Ghost Domination Heaven at Flower Moon Wonderland? Could it be that he was deceiving him, and had said similar things to every Yang Spirit Celestial Lord? If he had reacted and acted rashly, would he have exposed himself? Fortunately, he had kept a low profile lately.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cheerful voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"If Blood Robe is in danger, you can use this talisman to enter Flower Moon Wonderland and rescue him." Black Sword appeared in a moon-white robe, placing a magic talisman in Ziyuan Feng's hand.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Feng accepted the talisman with a respectful expression: "Thank you, Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile appeared in Black Sword's eyes: "However, this talisman probably won't be needed this time."</p><p></p><p>These words surprised the Celestial Lords present.</p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Robe was challenging many geniuses of Ghost Domination Heaven alone.</p><p></p><p>Even in their youth, none of them had such courage.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Senior Brother Black Sword knows Blood Robe's trump card and has confidence in him?" a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there were many differing opinions about Blood Robe's talent.</p><p></p><p>Some said that Ancestor Ziyuan was just dissatisfied with the Abyss Master and forcibly pushed Blood Robe forward.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword shook his head: "I don't know, but my intuition tells me... he will win."</p><p></p><p>"Since Senior Brother Black Sword is so confident, it seems we only need to wait for good news this time."</p><p></p><p>In Black Demon Abyss, strength was supreme.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword's strength and talent were greater than theirs, so... he was called Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"These are all small matters... do any of you have Ice Sword's ice eggs?" Black Sword asked.</p><p></p><p>"Is it this?" A Yang Spirit took out an egg given by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's the ones that appeared later, coveted by Ghost Domination Heaven," Black Sword shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He had just come out of seclusion and learned about the ice eggs, feeling curious.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we summon Ice Sword and have him lay one in person? Actually, I'm also curious how he suddenly became able to lay such strange ice eggs," Ziyuan Feng thought of something, "Could these ice eggs have some special properties that Senior Brother Black Sword values so much?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord spoke up with a complex gaze: "I happen to have one in my possession."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out an ice egg.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, dozens of eyes fell on this ice egg, revealing curious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This egg... is quite extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be born for the Ten Thousand Soul Banner!"</p><p></p><p>These Yang Spirit Celestial Lords obtained quite a bit of information about the egg just by looking at it once.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the ice egg, examining it carefully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Black Sword's pupils turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light fell on the ice egg, and the originally intact egg suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The azure blue disappeared, leaving only a drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>This drop of blood was strange, mysterious, and enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>All the Yang Spirit Celestial Lords looked at it, and for some reason, the bloodlines in their bodies began to boil slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This blood... is of the same origin as ours. It seems this egg... was truly laid by Ice Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"This egg is quite extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Celestial Lords discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Black Sword spoke, his voice profound: "Have you noticed that this ice egg has cultivated the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'?"</p><p></p><p>"What? Even the eggs laid by Ice Sword can cultivate the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' now?" A Yang Spirit Celestial Lord was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Spirit Celestial Lords began to sense it.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually true!"</p><p></p><p>"No, the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' it cultivated seems different from ours."</p><p></p><p>These Yang Spirit Celestial Lords were amazed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' was already perfect. Even if the Abyss Master personally modified it, it couldn't surpass the original version.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, no one would modify the 'Ancestral Blood Scripture'.</p><p></p><p>But now, they discovered a different Ancestral Blood Scripture.</p><p></p><p>And... vaguely, they also sensed that this 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' seemed even better than the one they cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"Was this egg really laid by Ice Sword?"</p><p></p><p>Someone asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Wind Decay Celestial Lord narrowed his eyes, his heart stirring.</p><p></p><p>He also sensed the extraordinariness of this egg, and the significance behind it.</p><p></p><p>If there was a stronger Ancestral Blood Scripture, wouldn't that mean his strength could increase? And the strength of Black Demon Abyss as well?</p><p></p><p>"Should we summon Ice Sword to ask him?" a Yang Spirit suggested.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword shook his head: "Ice Sword is in seclusion, no need to disturb him. This matter should be related to Blood Robe. After the Flower Moon Wonderland affair is over, I'll ask him personally."</p><p></p><p>He had just come out of seclusion and had gone to find Ice Sword.</p><p></p><p>But Ice Sword was in seclusion, so he didn't disturb him.</p><p></p><p>"Related to Blood Robe?" Wind Decay Celestial Lord heard this and was curious, feeling his head was in a muddle.</p><p></p><p>How come everything seemed to be related to Blood Robe?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord with a completely white beard suddenly spoke, his expression odd: "In my observation, this 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' cultivation, forming eggs to replace cultivation, is really... strange."</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Spirit Celestial Lords fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>They were contemplating, if this 'Ancestral Blood Scripture' was truly superior, should they cultivate it after obtaining it?</p><p></p><p>At this time, a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord suddenly spoke: "I propose that from now on in Black Demon Abyss, the term 'laying eggs' be changed to 'divine metamorphosis'!"</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Spirit Celestial Lords nodded upon hearing this, apparently agreeing.</p><p></p><p>PS: Due to special circumstances, comments and chapter notes are not displayed for this chapter.</p><p></p><p>PS: Due to the college entrance exam or other special reasons, comments and chapter notes have not been displaying recently. It's unknown when they will be restored.</p><p></p><p>Good luck on the college entrance exam!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 286</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Such a scene was shocking, yet also felt ordinary.</p><p></p><p>After all, was the destructive power of such a punch higher than that of a gun?</p><p></p><p>Could carrying loads at a construction site compare to a truck?</p><p></p><p>Hmm... it couldn't.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't even as effective as taking gene-enhancing drugs.</p><p></p><p>Second Senior Brother was both surprised, yet also felt it was just so-so. </p><p></p><p>He's a genius... hmm.</p><p></p><p>"You've now entered the beginner stage. It seems you don't need my teaching anymore. If you have any questions later, just come ask me directly," Second Senior Brother said. "Xiao Li, take Qi Yuan to get a set of martial arts training clothes."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Everything that had just happened caused no ripples, less shocking than a celebrity's dog getting sick.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the staff member to get his training clothes. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mood was quite unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Because in that punch just now, he discovered something different.</p><p></p><p>The punch was very ordinary, not even as good as martial arts from the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>But with Qi Yuan's observation skills that surpassed normal people, he noticed the punch seemed to conceal something.</p><p></p><p>"When executing that punch... it felt somewhat different."</p><p></p><p>When throwing that punch, Qi Yuan felt it was distinctly different from martial arts in the Cang Lan Realm and the martial ways of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a feeling.</p><p></p><p>If asked to specify exactly how, he couldn't say.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he was too weak now, lacking "discerning eyes".</p><p></p><p>If he had Yin Spirit cultivation, he could examine his own body and instantly discover the internal issues.</p><p></p><p>He could probably even completely resolve the curse, rather than just suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>After changing into training clothes, Qi Yuan entered the practice room.</p><p></p><p>In the spacious practice room were men and women, over 20 people in total.</p><p></p><p>Most were men, with women making up only about a quarter.</p><p></p><p>"Hey there, handsome!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan entered, he attracted many gazes.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Qi Yuan's looks, he had attracted many fangirls back in school.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't developed a mental illness, girls like Li Yan wouldn't have pursued him so crazily.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, when a man is handsome enough, he realizes how forward some girls can be.</p><p></p><p>Those who could afford to practice martial arts here must all have good family backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>These men and women were mostly outgoing in personality, with some girls boldly batting their eyelashes at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm new here. Name's Qi Yuan. Please guide me in the future."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually, then found a corner and began to study and practice the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist".</p><p></p><p>"Hey little handsome brother, big sister got here a month earlier. Want big sister to teach you?" A girl with a high ponytail approached Qi Yuan, her behavior quite bold.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan looked at the ponytailed girl. "Have you learned it well?"</p><p></p><p>"Wang Shiqiao has nine stripes of talent, her skills are impressive," said Wang Shiqiao's friend from afar.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao looked at Qi Yuan and opened a window: "Look... this is the fourth floor."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked down. </p><p></p><p>From this height, an ordinary person might die if they jumped.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...? He looked at Wang Shiqiao, his eyes filled with expectation.</p><p></p><p>"Watch my punch!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Shiqiao shouted loudly and threw a fierce punch at the sandbag next to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The sandbag, subjected to tremendous pressure, swung violently, looking quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>If it was Qi Yuan before coming to this game, already afflicted by the curse, taking such a punch would have killed him.</p><p></p><p>"Good, not bad!"</p><p></p><p>"That punch had a year's worth of power!"</p><p></p><p>The others applauded as if watching a show.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao looked at Qi Yuan and said proudly: "Was big sister's punch powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Wang Shiqiao with an expectant face: "Powerful. Now shouldn't you demonstrate jumping from the building?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" A smile appeared on Wang Shiqiao's lips. "I was just teasing you. I never said I'd jump from the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>Even Big Senior Brother would end up in the hospital if he jumped from this fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>You didn't really think practicing the 'Ming Wu Resonance Fist' would turn you into Superman who could defeat gene warriors, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan murmured: "Is martial arts so weak?"</p><p></p><p>On the way here, Qi Yuan had already heard that the Big Senior Brother of Ming Wu Martial Arts Hall was second only to the hall master.</p><p></p><p>This person had already practiced the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist" to the eighth level, just below the hall master.</p><p></p><p>Yet he would still get injured jumping from the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>No wonder learning martial arts was just a hobby, similar to fishing or working out on Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts isn't weak. Our bodies are much better than ordinary people's... and all natural too!" As Wang Shiqiao spoke, she deliberately thrust out her chest.</p><p></p><p>Due to technological developments and the clash of ideas on Canxing, the social atmosphere in various Gongxing countries was much more open than before.</p><p></p><p>Especially among the wealthy.</p><p></p><p>"What's natural about it?" Qi Yuan glanced at Wang Shiqiao's nose. "Your nose has been operated on."</p><p></p><p>Wang Shiqiao's expression changed slightly. She covered her nose, her face changing: "You can tell?"</p><p></p><p>"It's so obvious," Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, it's been less than a year since I had it done, and people can already tell. What did that damn hospital promise me when they did it? Said it would look natural and undetectable. I need to go find them and complain!" Wang Shiqiao said angrily as she left, seemingly intending to confront the cosmetic surgery hospital.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned his head away, no longer paying attention, and continued to study the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist".</p><p></p><p>This set of fist techniques had both internal energy cultivation methods and external fist moves.</p><p></p><p>If it were martial arts moves from the Cang Lan Realm, Qi Yuan could fully master and execute them after just one look.</p><p></p><p>But the martial arts methods of this world were different.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could indeed perform a set of "Ming Wu Resonance Fist" moves.</p><p></p><p>However, he needed to practice frequently.</p><p></p><p>He realized that executing this martial art was also a form of progress.</p><p></p><p>For others, progress might mean increased familiarity with the fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, it was not so.</p><p></p><p>He discovered there was something deeper within.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he couldn't discern it yet at his current level.</p><p></p><p>"Fist strikes like the soul, resonating in all directions... push up and circle right..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recited silently as he continued to practice the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist".</p><p></p><p>The fist techniques flowed from Qi Yuan's hands. He focused intently, seriously practicing, as time quickly passed.</p><p></p><p>Sweat rolled down his forehead, but Qi Yuan paid no attention, continuing to execute this set of fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the practice room, the other students chatted and laughed, sparring or flirting. Occasionally someone's gaze would fall on Qi Yuan, but never lingered long.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Qiao Wu looked through the glass door, scanning the entire practice room.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his gaze landed on Qi Yuan, a trace of appreciation in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In this era, to still be obsessed with martial arts is quite rare," Qiao Wu couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>He was the master of Ming Wu Martial Arts Hall, over fifty years old, but due to taking gene-enhancing drugs, he now stood like a wall, giving people a great sense of impact.</p><p></p><p>Second Senior Brother stood beside Qiao Wu. Looking at Qi Yuan, he couldn't help but lament: "What a pity he was born in the wrong era. If it were ancient times, with his diligence and talent, he might have become a fierce general who shook the world."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Wu nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, today's society was very different from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts had become merely an embellishment and a small circle.</p><p></p><p>Take Qiao Wu, who came from a martial arts family.</p><p></p><p>His ancestors even produced martial arts champions and generals.</p><p></p><p>But what about now? Decades of hard practice in the "Ming Wu Resonance Fist" brought him less enhancement than a single gene-enhancing drug.</p><p></p><p>"He wants to participate in the martial arts competition? He's a good seedling.</p><p></p><p>Our Ming Wu Martial Arts Hall hasn't had students participate for many years. If he participates, it might attract quite a few people to join our hall." Qiao Wu smiled and mentioned casually.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts circle was a closed small circle.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>People like Qiao Wu who have taken genetic enhancement drugs are not allowed to participate in martial arts competitions. Otherwise, it would be unfair to other contestants.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, with his looks, if he participates in the martial arts competition and makes it to the top 100 for the national broadcast, he'd definitely attract a lot of fans," the second senior brother calculated. </p><p></p><p>After all, there were very few people like Qi Yuan with both good looks and serious martial arts training.</p><p></p><p>"Top 100?" Qiao Wu shook his head. "His physical condition is too poor. He probably couldn't even make it past the city level, let alone... national."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the second senior brother also laughed, feeling he had indeed been a bit too imaginative.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts have limited effects on improving the human body. It's not as effective as eating more food to gain some meat and strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Aside from immortal techniques, my current strength... has indeed improved a little bit."</p><p></p><p>After returning home, Qi Yuan took a hot bath. </p><p></p><p>He had sweated a lot in the training room, his whole body heated up.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of cultivation... seems to be related to blood."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes seemed to see through his own body.</p><p></p><p>While practicing martial arts, his eyes received some hidden information - the blood in his body seemed to have undergone some kind of change.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't see much information and wasn't clear on what changes had occurred.</p><p></p><p>"I need to quickly improve my immortal cultivation abilities..." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was too weak and unable to do many things.</p><p></p><p>But to speed up immortal cultivation, he needed money to buy materials.</p><p></p><p>"Should I set up a stall outside as a doctor?" Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>With his eyes and various attainments, he could definitely work as a doctor.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't understand the diseases of this world, he could just say it was kidney deficiency for any illness, then casually use Taoist methods to treat it. It would definitely work.</p><p></p><p>"Let me check if my cultivation method has sold first?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan logged into his account.</p><p></p><p>"Huh... someone tipped?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He had set it up so that to send him a private message, one had to tip 10,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect someone would actually tip.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, there are many rich fools in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was happy.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this his first business? Looking at the account balance, which had increased by 5,000 yuan, Qi Yuan's teeth hurt.</p><p></p><p>"Taking half of the tip money, this software is too greedy."</p><p></p><p>After complaining, Qi Yuan opened the chat interface and immediately saw a message.</p><p></p><p>"Will you sell this cultivation method for 10,000 yuan?"</p><p></p><p>"99.99 million, non-negotiable. If you want to haggle, I won't bother doing this business," Qi Yuan casually replied.</p><p></p><p>He created this method, so this price wouldn't be a loss.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, if "Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique" was completed, it could be a sect-protecting treasure for a major power.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary top-tier heaven-grade secret manuals were not as good.</p><p></p><p>"Can we video chat?" </p><p></p><p>Soon, the other side sent a message.</p><p></p><p>"Video chat counts as adding my contact info, you need to tip 100,000 first," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to video chat with strangers for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a border town of Yue Lang country, a man wearing a black jacket narrowed his eyes, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, a young man in casual clothes had an angry expression: "This person must be a scammer, asking for 100,000 just like that? Does he think we're idiots? There's definitely no cultivation method afterwards. And immortal cultivation... is nonsense."</p><p></p><p>The casually dressed young man secretly glanced at the boss, seeing him lost in thought, and dared not say more.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket's fingers tapped on the table, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"I have all his identity information. If he dares to scam me... worst case, we'll go to Qin Yuan and grab him," the man in the black jacket said confidently.</p><p></p><p>His identity was not ordinary, but that of an arms dealer.</p><p></p><p>His work involved risking his life, so he wasn't afraid of being scammed.</p><p></p><p>And... 100,000 was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Transferred."</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he tipped another 100,000.</p><p></p><p>After tipping, he glanced at the casually dressed young man, who immediately understood the boss's meaning and hurriedly brought a large sniper rifle to the table.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket clearly wanted to use this to intimidate the seller.</p><p></p><p>About ten breaths later, the video call connected.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket looked at Qi Yuan wearing a shirt, and was about to speak when he heard the other's lazy voice.</p><p></p><p>"Five minutes. If you don't decide to buy within five minutes, this deal is off."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice made the man in the black jacket pause, the words he was preparing to say stuck in his throat.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket wasn't angry, but stroked the sniper rifle on the table: "100,000 for five minutes, Mr. Qi's time sure is precious."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wasn't surprised that his identity information had been leaked.</p><p></p><p>After all, information on the internet was like a sieve. Forget about wealthy tycoons and those in power, even a minor official could dox people online.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, a minor official in Qin Yuan country made headlines for using his authority to threaten and dox people online in pursuit of a celebrity.</p><p></p><p>"You got a great deal," Qi Yuan replied honestly.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, if a cultivator could get five minutes of guidance from Qi Yuan, they would definitely benefit greatly, if not advance an entire major realm.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket looked at Qi Yuan's young face with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had met someone so difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Although the information he found indicated the other had a mental illness.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this information must be fake.</p><p></p><p>The confidence in Qi Yuan's eyes, that laziness, was not something a mentally ill person could have.</p><p></p><p>"Can you show me more of the follow-up to 'Super Invincible Somewhat Explosive Technique'? </p><p></p><p>After all, it's a 100 million yuan deal. Such a big deal needs to be taken seriously." The man in the black jacket put down the sniper rifle and stopped touching it.</p><p></p><p>He found that in Qi Yuan's eyes, this sniper rifle seemed not to exist at all.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan, an ordinary person, he somehow felt more terrified than facing the leaders of small countries.</p><p></p><p>"Is a 100 million yuan deal very big? I heard some people set small goals of 100 million.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method... if you don't buy it, forget it.</p><p></p><p>I might not bother selling it again in the future.</p><p></p><p>This kind of opportunity only comes once, you should seize it well."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He did need money, but wanted to act as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>If it was too troublesome, he'd rather not sell.</p><p></p><p>For an immortal cultivator, making money was very simple.</p><p></p><p>Besides, he still had a year's worth of memories.</p><p></p><p>Worst case, he could just buy some lottery tickets, right?</p><p></p><p>The man in the black jacket looked at Qi Yuan, many thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>100 million was no small sum. Even for him, it would be somewhat painful to part with.</p><p></p><p>What if... this was a trap? He hesitated and struggled internally.</p><p></p><p>Should he... grab him?</p><p></p><p>The casually dressed young man stood to the side, his gaze anxious.</p><p></p><p>He felt Qi Yuan was just a scammer.</p><p></p><p>But since the boss hadn't spoken, he didn't dare to speak either.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly spoke: "You should be in Yue Lang country? I'm also in need of the Kun Qing grass unique to Yue Lang. If you buy my cultivation method, I can cooperate with you on a second deal.</p><p></p><p>I need some special plants from Yue Lang that aren't available in Qin Yuan. If you help transport them to me, as payment, I can give you money, or some medicinal liquids and pills... hmm, which would be somewhat helpful for immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Kun Qing grass? The man in the black jacket was stunned, glancing at the potted plant on the table.</p><p></p><p>How did Qi Yuan know? According to his investigation, Qi Yuan was just an ordinary citizen of Qin Yuan country.</p><p></p><p>Even in Yue Lang, only a handful of people knew about Kun Qing grass. How did he know about such an obscure thing?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two qi-refining disciples were dueling with swords.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the swords flew out of their hands and began fighting in the air.</p><p></p><p>The watching disciples were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Buxiu and Li Fan have actually been hiding their true strength. They've already mastered the sword-wielding technique at the third stage of qi-refining - how terrifying! This disciple must not be kept... Tsk, he will become a great talent!"</p><p></p><p>On the ground, Ye Buxiu and Li Fan were both dumbfounded. They didn't know when they had learned the sword-wielding technique.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the amazement of the onlookers, a loud shout suddenly came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, chase it! My furnace has run away, and there's a pill inside!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up to see a bright light streaking across the sky - it was a furnace used for refining pills.</p><p></p><p>The furnace seemed to have taken ill, wildly flying and bouncing around in the sky, while the elder frantically chased after it.</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could react further, they witnessed even stranger occurrences.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, my sword has flown away!"</p><p>"Ah, my silver has gone up to the sky!"</p><p>"Oh no, the hairpin I was going to give my master's wife has also gone up!"</p><p></p><p>Countless metal objects were suddenly flying up into the sky, as if they had lost their minds, darting about chaotically.</p><p></p><p>This spectacle caught the attention of many elders who had been in seclusion. They too emerged, as some of the treasures in their storage bags had inexplicably taken flight.</p><p></p><p>Elder Kunmu stood on the clouds, with several elders gathering around him. From the heavens above, they overlooked the Shenguang Sect, which had descended into a chaotic frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Countless metal implements were soaring towards the sky, flitting about erratically. The types of metal objects were strange and diverse.</p><p></p><p>"My iron arm, how could you abandon me?" cried a one-armed man in anguish.</p><p>"Goodness, Sir Jiao, it's actually made of primal flame iron! Which disciple sister is so fierce?"</p><p>"Whose golden underpants are these? How flamboyant!"</p><p>"Have our magical artifacts gained sentience and are rebelling?"</p><p></p><p>The disciples below were utterly shocked and in heated discussion, unable to comprehend what was happening.</p><p></p><p>On the Seven-Colored Peak, the knife watched the flying artifacts with envy. It thought, "Since everyone has gone mad, if I quietly slip away, no one will notice a normal knife like me."</p><p></p><p>In the clouds above, the elders stood behind the Sect Master of Shenguang Sect, their eyes filled with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, this is a strange occurrence," said a white-bearded elder. Just moments ago, he had been cultivating, only to suddenly feel a chill in his lower regions - his undergarment had flown away. That defensive magical artifact, embedded with precious metals, had simply taken flight.</p><p></p><p>The other elders, gazing at the pandemonium below, were also stunned. They had all been affected to varying degrees by this incident.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master Kunmu's spiritual awareness spread out, as if he was searching for something, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"It is likely that a precious metal artifact of the highest order has manifested, causing this commotion," the Sect Master Kunmu concluded.</p><p></p><p>The other elders heard this and their breathing quickened. A precious metal artifact of the highest order had appeared. But try as they might, they could not locate it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu hurriedly ran to the courtyard of Qi Yuan, shouting, "Eldest Martial Brother, this is bad!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slowly awoke from his slumber, rubbing his eyes. "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Your pet, that kitchen knife, has gained sentience!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yuan was momentarily confused. "Oh, I see."</p><p></p><p>The knife had already awakened its intelligence, so it had gained sentience. What was the big deal?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's calm reaction, Jiang Lingsu was perplexed. She had discovered that in the Shenguang Sect, a precious metal artifact seemed to have manifested, causing all metal objects to go berserk. Hoping to startle her Eldest Martial Brother, she had told him about his knife.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan remained unfazed. "At least it's better than your straw hut collapsing."</p><p></p><p>He was a bit of a flirt, but sometimes he had to tease the wealthy young lady to deepen her impression of him.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's chest heaved with indignation, her hands on her hips. Indeed, the metal artifact's rampage had caused the Stabilizing Staff that she used to secure her straw hut to fly away, leading to the hut's collapse.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan laughed even more heartily. "This time, you have no place to sleep. The bench in my room is still reserved for my junior martial sister."</p><p></p><p>"Is this how my eldest martial brother takes care of me?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll put some dry grass on the bench for my junior martial sister."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Jiang Lingsu exchanged a few more quips.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then slowly made his way down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I didn't expect that by just taking a nap, I would cause such a commotion."</p><p></p><p>He looked at his hands, feeling a faint golden flow of blood within.</p><p></p><p>After achieving the completion of the Five Elements, he had gained something...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Gift of the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>His qi refinement had undergone a change.</p><p></p><p>The five elements' qi had replaced his original ordinary qi refinement. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Now, the first to complete the replacement was the metal element.</p><p></p><p>The remaining four elements were also in the process of transitioning.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't that mean the future Shenguang Sect will have four more upheavals?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a little uneasy.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, there were too many strange things up there.</p><p></p><p>Bizarre and peculiar.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were many things that could cause cultivators to "die socially".</p><p></p><p>For example, golden underpants, for example, Master Jiao.</p><p></p><p>Those things, no one dared to chase after.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan appeared among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many people noticed Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the peak lords of the major peaks of the Shenguang Sect were all outside, only Qi Yuan remained in the peak.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, are you here to find your pet? I saw your cleaver on the alchemy furnace."</p><p></p><p>"Where's the alchemy furnace? It's right next to it!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over, not knowing when the knife had fallen to a place not far from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you sneak out while I was sleeping." Qi Yuan glanced at the knife, and also swept his gaze over the magical artifacts in the sky.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, a thought arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to, he could secretly sabotage those magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that after the five elements were perfected, he had gained the ability to control metal? Although it was not true complete control, and the higher the level of the magical artifact, the less effective his destruction would be.</p><p></p><p>But this was already terrifying enough.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the midst of a magical battle, everything changes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>If the treasures that one's life and death depended on suddenly had problems, the impact would be huge.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside this emotion, Qi Yuan called out, "Knife, come back quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The knife hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It wanted to come back, but was afraid of exposing itself, so it remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding junior brothers and sisters saw this and chuckled lightly: "Senior brother, your pet knife has also been infected by the metal attribute, it's not in its control.</p><p></p><p>It's best to wait until the chaos is over before looking for it again.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment elders can't catch their own magical artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored them, he walked straight towards his cleaver.</p><p></p><p>The other junior brothers and sisters shook their heads as they watched.</p><p></p><p>They didn't say anything else.</p><p></p><p>It was no secret that the senior brother had some problems with his mind.</p><p></p><p>Let him be.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't catch the cleaver, nothing bad would happen, it would just take a bit more effort.</p><p></p><p>But under everyone's gaze, Qi Yuan walked towards the cleaver, muttering as he reached out his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Disobedient, I'll punish you by not letting you go out for three days."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he grabbed the knife.</p><p></p><p>And in an instant, as if time had frozen, all the magical artifacts in the sky stopped their frenzied dance and returned to their respective owners.</p><p></p><p>No one paid attention to Qi Yuan anymore.</p><p></p><p>Those who noticed thought it was just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"Is it over?"</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, my iron hand, you've finally come back!"</p><p></p><p>"My sword, my sharp sword!"</p><p></p><p>The treasures returned, and these people were all overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Some had a look of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come near me! I don't know you!"</p><p></p><p>"You've got the wrong person, I'm not your master!"</p><p></p><p>The ones who said these words attracted a lot of attention, especially the master of Master Jiao, who turned out to be an elder, making some disciples swallow hard.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was made with primordial flame iron.</p><p></p><p>Some were happy, some were worried.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, someone exclaimed excitedly, "My magical artifact has become stronger!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the grade of my greatsword has actually gone up a level!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone discovered that after the frenzy of the magical artifacts, their own artifacts had improved to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>The elder who had originally kicked away Master Jiao secretly cast a Tao technique to secretly retrieve him.</p><p></p><p>The upheaval in the Shenguang Sect had temporarily subsided, but the chaos was still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan secretly sneaked back to the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Dongxian was holding his Xuantian Ruler, his eyes full of curiosity: "Elder, what exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>The elder's hoarse voice transmitted: "It may be that a metal-attribute treasure has appeared, or... well, the second possibility is unlikely, so there's no need to tell you about it."</p><p></p><p>Dongxian paused upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the metal-attribute treasure?" Dongxian asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to obtain that metal-attribute treasure.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, it might be... the cleaver in Qi Yuan's hand."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Dongxian was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother Qi Yuan's cleaver was actually a metal-attribute treasure.</p><p></p><p>"That cleaver is no ordinary thing. Held by a qi refining cultivator, it can kill Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the hands of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, it can kill late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, or even..." The elder sighed.</p><p></p><p>Such a treasure was extremely rare, and he didn't expect to see it in this remote place of the Great Liang.</p><p></p><p>Dongxian's eyes lit up when he heard this: "So it's that powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean if he could get senior brother Qi Yuan's help, his chances of winning the Dragon Contention would increase significantly?</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was not an easy person to persuade.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he was obsessed with was games.</p><p></p><p>Games? Dongxian pondered, should he offer the precious, forbidden game he had been hoarding for years to the senior brother? That was a limited edition! It couldn't be bought on the market!</p><p></p><p>"Once I become the Crown Prince, who cares about games, real people are much better!" </p><p></p><p>Dongxian gritted his teeth and decided to find an opportunity to give the game to senior brother Qi Yuan, to establish a connection first.</p><p></p><p>For the Dragon Contention, of course he had to use other truly valuable things to win him over!

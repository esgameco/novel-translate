        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"In another ten days or so, I should be able to reach level 90.</p><p></p><p>I wonder what my awakened special skill will be."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very excited.</p><p></p><p>"If I reach level 90, I'll be able to quickly clear the Forbidden Attire dungeon. </p><p></p><p>If I can fully explore the map of this world, will I awaken a new special ability?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>After entering the game jade slip, it wasn't long before his eyes underwent a mutation, allowing him to see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>If he could fully conquer the game, would he undergo other mutations as well?</p><p></p><p>"Will I get a supernatural sense of hearing? Will I be able to hear indescribable whispers?"</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe I'll grow a dog's nose?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about this as he lay in the pit, still unable to see the moon.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, thank you! Today Aunt Qin defeated the National Teacher of Nanfeng Country! </p><p></p><p>The gloomy expression on Sima Ting's face when Aunt Qin displayed her imperial-level strength was so interesting!"</p><p></p><p>A message came from Jinli. She seemed really happy, even using an interjection.</p><p></p><p>"Great, you've completed a lot of your tasks too. Once you finish up, we can finally meet in person.</p><p></p><p>By the way, should we decide on a meeting place? Where do you want to meet?"  Qi Yuan said whatever came to mind.</p><p></p><p>It took a long time for a reply. Finally, one came.</p><p></p><p>"How about under the ancient Qi Chun tree? What do you think?" Jinli asked.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Qi Chun tree was the most legendary tree in the Wangyue Continent. </p><p></p><p>The towering ancient tree, whose height was unknown, was said that if one stood atop it, they could grasp the stars.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that this tree was planted by a divine deity who had vanquished a celestial demon. </p><p></p><p>The deity told his wife that when the Qi Chun tree grew to 30 feet tall, he would return.</p><p></p><p>His wife waited under the tree for him, year after year, but he never came back.</p><p></p><p>The tree continued growing, reaching 300 feet, then 30,000 feet, even higher.</p><p></p><p>But the deity's wife never saw her husband return.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Chun tree had become the most legendary tree in the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi Chun tree?" Qi Yuan paused, he knew of that tree, as there was one on the peak of the Seven Color Ridge.</p><p></p><p>But to find such a tree would be no easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Qi Chun tree?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli hesitated, then stepped outside and gazed into the distance. </p><p></p><p>The towering silhouette of a massive tree came into view.</p><p></p><p>Anywhere in the Wangyue Continent, if one looked far into the distance, they could see that ancient Qi Chun tree.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree reached up to the heavens, its leaves dotted with stars.</p><p></p><p>"Look to the southwest, there is a huge tree - that's the Qi Chun tree."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan paused.</p><p></p><p>He climbed out of the pit and looked southwest.</p><p></p><p>There, in the southwest, stood a colossal ancient tree, its top reaching up to the stars, seemingly within reach.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Qi Chun tree you mentioned? It's massive, if it grows any taller it'll touch the stars in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"When we meet, I'll do some barbecuing, you bring some good wine, and we can camp under the Qi Chun tree - it'll be quite an experience." Qi Yuan climbed back into the pit.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Jinli's expression was indecipherable. </p><p></p><p>Today, Aunt Qin had achieved a great victory. She wanted to seize the momentum and eliminate Sima Ting's forces.</p><p></p><p>But she also understood that she had not yet won.</p><p></p><p>Dangers lurked in all directions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan strolled with a knife in hand, or more accurately...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Vegetable Knife.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a disciple from Mount Wanfa greeted Qi Yuan: "Senior brother, the great assembly for foundation building is tomorrow. Are you still walking your pet?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not stop his steps: "My pet is about to awaken its spiritual intelligence, so I cannot be careless about it. I must take it out for a walk."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's response, the person smiled and said, "Senior brother is truly a remarkable person."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan led his knife, walking it very diligently.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, several disciples from the Divine Light Sect were discussing something in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"This one from the Seven-Color Peak is really calm. Tomorrow is the great foundation building assembly, yet he still has the leisure to walk his pet, and it's just a vegetable knife!"</p><p></p><p>"The emperor is not anxious, but the eunuch is. If you have no time to spare, how come you are not representing the Divine Light Sect to compete?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, it's not that my cultivation is insufficient."</p><p></p><p>"The rumor is that the reward for winning the foundation building assembly this time is a Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Treasure, the Golden Flower Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>"That is a Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Treasure. Whoever wins it will surely be able to form their Embryonic Breath, and in the future, they will be a big shot in the Great Xia Kingdom, and perhaps even a hegemon in other countries!"</p><p></p><p>"A Grade One Foundation Building Spiritual Treasure is already so powerful. The ones above it, the Vein Foundation and the Heavenly Dao Foundation, must be even more extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about it. We have no chance of encountering such a person."</p><p></p><p>The crowd sighed, feeling that the universe was too vast and their own selves too insignificant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a male disciple gritted his teeth and said, "I heard that Chu Tianxiong from the Black Mountain Sect is also coming to our place!"</p><p></p><p>"He dares to come!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, a while ago, the elders of the Black Mountain Sect injured Zheng Jianghe, and they still dare to come to our place!"</p><p></p><p>"Our female disciples must be careful, or else... or else..." Some female disciples turned pale, obviously very afraid of Chu Tianxiong.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this is the Divine Light Sect, one of the three major sects of the Great Xia. How dare the Black Mountain Sect be so arrogant!" A disciple declared loudly.</p><p></p><p>Towards the Black Mountain Sect, the disciples of the Divine Light Sect were united in their hatred and anger, but they were also helpless.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Chicken Old Demon was like a towering mountain, pressing down on the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally did not hear the words of these people.</p><p></p><p>He walked his knife back to the Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why haven't you awakened your spiritual intelligence yet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan really wanted to slap the knife, but he was afraid of cutting his own hand.</p><p></p><p>What he feared the most was that if he slapped the knife and made it stupid, what if it awakened its spiritual intelligence and became a fool?</p><p></p><p>"But I guess it'll happen in the next few days, or it might even be tonight." Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the courtyard and tied the knife to a wooden stake.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, I need to quickly finish my game, then go to bed early. Tomorrow, I still have to attend that damn foundation building assembly, so troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that he was very socially anxious.</p><p></p><p>He preferred to communicate with the mute beasts in the game, and even give them voice-overs. It made him happier.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow's foundation building assembly, he would be the face of the Divine Light Sect, welcoming guests from other sects, exchanging with them. Just thinking about it made him feel annoyed.</p><p></p><p>"If only my true self was a star in the vast universe, just hanging in the sky, not needing to say a word." Qi Yuan thought to himself as he entered the game.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that at night, the vegetable knife suddenly jumped up and cut the rope that was tying it.</p><p></p><p>It frantically searched for half a day in the thatched hut, and only found a few straws to eat.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be extremely hungry, and its gaze fell on a thatched hut not far away.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, it sneaked out.</p><p></p><p>Then, it greedily eyed the thatched hut, and if it had eyes, they would have been shining. But in the end, it hesitated for a moment, and began... to rummage through the trash pile.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, it stealthily returned and used the rope to tie itself up again.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was moved.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan said, "In another hundred days, the Palace of Light will surely fall. I've thought of a great plan to make money, and I wanted to share it with the group."</p><p></p><p>"What money-making plan?" The Great Sun Flame Emperor chimed in belatedly. </p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Palace of Light offers high-interest loans, but if you're in Cuiyun Province, you might as well borrow some spirit stones from them at high interest. After I destroy the Palace of Light, you won't have to repay those spirit stones." Qi Yuan shared his money-making scheme with the group.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord was completely stunned upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to say, are you for real?</p><p></p><p>The hundred-day plan was just made, the fall of the Palace of Light wasn't even on the horizon yet, and you're already planning this?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Supreme, you really are a genius!" Ice Mountain Domineering Lady said in the group chat. "Why don't I have such a money-making brain like yours?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as you work hard, think more, and use your brain, you'll surely become as successful as me," Qi Yuan shared his tips for success.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Supreme, how much wealth do you have now?" the Rogue Immortal Lord asked quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem... that's not important," Qi Yuan suddenly felt a bit guilty.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he wasn't actually that successful? It was just the group's flattery that made him a bit overconfident.</p><p></p><p>He immediately reflected on himself and said, "About borrowing high-interest loans from the Palace of Light, we shouldn't borrow too much. After all, the hundred-day plan hasn't really been implemented yet. Everyone should act within their means and not celebrate prematurely."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go borrow 10,000 in high-interest loans from the Palace of Light. Consider it reducing their spirit stone reserves and helping Origin Supreme's cause," the Great Sun Flame Emperor said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"This old lady will borrow a million!" Ice Mountain Domineering Lady said boldly.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord trembled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Are you all going crazy along with Origin Supreme?</p><p></p><p>"Too bad I'm too far from the Palace of Light, otherwise I'd borrow too," Qi Yuan felt it was hard to have the best of both worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Alright everyone, I have to go offline now. I'm going to ambush that Divine Infant stage envoy from the Palace of Light. I'll take him out while he's not paying attention," Qi Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>At present, he couldn't stay in the real world for too long. </p><p></p><p>After all, things could happen in the game world at any time, so he had to be efficient in his actions.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Supreme, you're not really going to ambush a Divine Infant stage cultivator, are you?" the Rogue Immortal Lord asked weakly.</p><p></p><p>That's a Divine Infant! Not some random nobody!</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm about to go," Qi Yuan said naturally, not lying.</p><p></p><p>"But that's a Divine Infant..." The Rogue Immortal Lord now felt that Origin Supreme really had issues with his head, and wasn't just pretending.</p><p></p><p>"So what if it's a Divine Infant? I'm a Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator. Do you understand the value of Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment?" Qi Yuan said confidently. "It's a pity I'm not a perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment like Ice Mountain Domineering Lady. Otherwise I'd teach the Palace of Light a lesson right now."</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Lady smiled charmingly and said in the group chat: "Rogue Immortal Lord, you're underestimating Origin Supreme. He's a Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator. Would he fear a mere Palace of Light? Since Origin Supreme has made such a meticulous plan, I dare say the Palace of Light will surely be wiped out within a hundred days!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment surely meant there was a powerful Yin God expert backing him.</p><p></p><p>The Rogue Immortal Lord was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Had he underestimated the strength of his group mates? Should he go borrow a high-interest loan from the Palace of Light too?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Supreme, may I tell some of my friends that a powerful expert intends to take action against the Palace of Light, so they can also borrow high-interest loans from the Palace of Light? This won't expose your plan, right?" Ice Mountain Domineering Lady asked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered for a moment before replying: "Feel free to tell them, as long as you don't reveal my identity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, besides his junior sister Jiang Lingsu, no one knew his identity in the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>What was he afraid of?</p><p></p><p>Even if word got out, the people of the Palace of Light wouldn't imagine that a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator was planning to destroy them.</p><p></p><p>The Palace of Light would instead focus their attention on others.</p><p></p><p>Even if they knew a Foundation Establishment cultivator was claiming to destroy the Palace of Light, it would be their loss to pay him any attention.</p><p></p><p>It's like if an internet user suggested to a rocket scientist that parasol trees are more brittle and burn brighter, so they're more suitable as rocket fuel. The rocket scientist would lose by even acknowledging it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an unknown cave dwelling, a woman's entire body was shrouded in light, making it impossible to see her face clearly.</p><p></p><p>She took out a jade slip, thought for a moment, and sent a message through it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a friend who's preparing to take action against the Palace of Light. Those who want to borrow high-interest loans from them should hurry." The woman was none other than Ice Mountain Domineering Lady.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, many people replied through the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Taking action against the Palace of Light? Which big shot is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss... a Yin God?"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like the Palace of Light's recent actions have displeased some big shots."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go borrow some spirit stones from the Palace of Light before the news spreads!"</p><p></p><p>"If we're late, we won't be able to borrow anymore."</p><p></p><p>In the coming days, Purple Mansion cultivators would successively go to the Palace of Light to borrow spirit stones. This might also make the higher-ups of the Palace of Light smell something fishy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Great Shang Kingdom, on Cloud Fungus Mountain, mist swirled about, making it seem like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>In a bamboo house, the sound of a zither drifted through the air.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivator from the Palace of Light was playing the zither.</p><p></p><p>Season Baiying, the current true disciple of the Heaven's Desire Sect, listened to the zither music as if entranced.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you truly are a saint of the zither. One tune is enough to pacify the Great Shang," Season Baiying flattered.</p><p></p><p>This time, she had come on her master's orders to serve this Divine Infant cultivator from the Palace of Light, to strengthen the relationship between the Demonic Desire Sect and the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"That's not quite right. The Great Shang won't even hand over two ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators to me. How can I talk about pacifying the Great Shang?" Six Zither True Lord's eyes twinkled with amusement, looking especially amiable.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Season Baiying's expression turned cold: "The Great Shang is completely controlled by the Divine Light Sect, so of course they're unwilling to hand over Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan. As far as this junior knows, the fall of Young Master Broken Wolf in the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm can't be unrelated to the Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Kang Fulu and Qi Yuan killed Broken Wolf? Are their talents really that strong?" Six Zither True Lord only knew bits and pieces about the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm incident.</p><p></p><p>Broken Wolf was even on the Eastern Lands Genius Ranking and had some status and position in the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that Kang Fulu is about on par with me, and as for that Qi Yuan, he's an even more insignificant nobody. I could kill him with one sword strike. How could the two of them possibly kill Young Master Broken Wolf? It's said that when the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm opened, even a Primordial Core cultivator from the Divine Light Sect entered. I suspect Young Master Broken Wolf was surrounded and killed by the Divine Light Sect's Primordial Core cultivator," Season Baiying analyzed reasonably.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Six Zither True Lord nodded: "What you say makes sense."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't believe that a genius from their Palace of Light would be killed by cultivators of the same level from a small place like the Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Shang royal family and the Divine Light Sect are in cahoots, plunging the Great Shang into chaos for their own selfish interests. My Demonic Desire Sect is unwilling to become part of the demonic faction. Please guide us, True Lord!" Seeing the time was ripe, Season Baiying stated the purpose of her visit.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was to latch onto the Palace of Light's big leg.</p><p></p><p>Six Zither True Lord looked at Season Baiying, his eyes twinkling: "The Great Shang will inevitably become part of the demonic faction, but as for your Demonic Desire Sect... if you can correct your ways, you may yet be able to extricate yourselves from the mire."</p><p></p><p>Season Baiying looked at Six Zither True Lord with a sincere expression.</p><p></p><p>Six Zither True Lord continued: "I hear the Seven-Colored Peak Master of the Divine Light Sect is a peerless beauty. I have cultivated for over a thousand years and remain single. If the Demonic Desire Sect could help me..."</p><p></p><p>Six Zither True Lord didn't finish the rest of his sentence, but Season Baiying understood his meaning.</p><p></p><p>This Six Zither True Lord really had the gall.</p><p></p><p>A mere early-stage Divine Infant, coveting a late-stage Divine Infant!</p><p></p><p>Season Baiying inwardly disdained him, but still said: "The Divine Light Sect is very powerful. Without the support of the Palace of Light, it would be very difficult for us to defeat them."</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Desire Sect had coveted the Divine Light Sect for a long time.</p><p></p><p>If not for the emergence of the Seven-Colored Peak Master back then, the entire Divine Light Sect would have long since become a branch of the Demonic Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Desire Sect's covetousness of the Divine Light Sect was not as simple as it appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient records of the Demonic Desire Sect, there was a hidden secret recorded.</p><p></p><p>So every year, a large number of Demonic Desire Sect spies were sent to infiltrate the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>In Season Baiying's storage bag, there was a list of spy names.</p><p></p><p>Many of them held high positions in the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light needs to see the Demonic Desire Sect's sincerity first, otherwise..." Six Zither was old and cunning, and wouldn't agree so easily.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a somewhat childish voice suddenly rang out from the air.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the one from the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, a cultivator wearing a black robe landed nearby. His entire body was tightly wrapped in the black robe, not exposing any skin.</p><p></p><p>Season Baiying's expression changed slightly: "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Six Zither also glanced at the newcomer, but remained calm and unhurried. Coming from the Palace of Light had lowered his guard in a small place like the Great Shang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think there was anyone in the Great Shang Kingdom who dared to harm him or could harm him.</p><p></p><p>"Me? I'm here to borrow a high-interest loan from the Palace of Light. Lend me a few million spirit stones to spend," said the black-robed man, who was naturally Qi Yuan. He stared at Six Zither True Lord, opening with asking to borrow a few million spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Six Zither True Lord was stunned for a moment. He finally spoke, his tone not very pleasant: "Friend, are you joking with me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Six Zither True Lord, placing his hand on the kitchen knife at his waist: "I've changed my mind. I'm not borrowing money anymore. I'm robbing you directly!"</p><p></p><p>Not repaying borrowed money would get him criticized behind his back.</p><p></p><p>It's better to just kill him and take the spirit stones directly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the kitchen knife, pointing it directly at Six Zither True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Season Baiying was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Six</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qin Zhenjun's face also darkened like water: "Is this how the Great Shang Kingdom treats guests?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sharp and piercing sound of a zither rang out, filled with intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Six Zither Immortal made his move, it was a powerful soul attack. </p><p></p><p>This was his trump card!</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, he didn't think much of the divine infants from such a small place.</p><p></p><p>"A soul attack?" Qi Yuan was surprised. The last time he saw a soul attack was from the Black Chicken Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Black Chicken Demon's soul attack was far more powerful than Six Zither Immortal's.</p><p></p><p>"You have some knowledge," Six Zither Immortal said approvingly. The sound of the zither in his hand instantly became more intense, and the soul attack rushed towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Killing knowledgeable people gives a greater sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was not afraid at all. Facing Six Zither Immortal's soul attack, he charged forward directly with his kitchen knife in hand.</p><p></p><p>The powerful soul attack fell on Qi Yuan's soul, but didn't cause any ripples.</p><p></p><p>Six Zither Immortal's calm expression disappeared: "How are you unharmed?"</p><p></p><p>Soul attacks were usually invincible, especially against cultivators from small places who had no means to defend against them.</p><p></p><p>"Why would I be harmed!" Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to explain. The kitchen knife in his hand flashed with a cold light, "Mere early stage divine infant, how can you compete with my Heavenly Dao Foundation Building?"</p><p></p><p>Poor Six Zither Immortal, who mainly cultivated soul attacks, was lacking in actual combat skills.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan's battle techniques honed from the sea of blood, he had no means to defend himself at all.</p><p></p><p>"Killing you is as simple as killing a demon!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's battle techniques had already been honed to perfection.</p><p></p><p>He could boast without shame: "I've killed more divine infants than you've ever seen!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the early stage divine infant Six Zither Immortal, Qi Yuan chopped down with one strike of his knife, directly splitting him in half.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant inside his body didn't even have time to escape before dying on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Ji Boying, who was watching from the side, trembled: "You... who exactly... are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you just say you could kill me with one sword strike?" As the words fell, Qi Yuan swung his kitchen knife again.</p><p></p><p>An expression of disbelief appeared on Ji Boying's face as his body shattered into pieces, dying right there.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan came quickly and killed quickly. The battle ended so fast that even the birds in the trees weren't startled away.</p><p></p><p>He took the storage bags of the two, then cleared his throat and imitated Six Zither Immortal's voice.</p><p></p><p>"This Immortal will be in closed cultivation on Cloud Fungus Mountain for a hundred days. Those who trespass... will be killed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>The voice rolled out, spreading throughout Cloud Fungus Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was reckless, but he was a clever reckless person.</p><p></p><p>The news of Six Zither Immortal's death needed to be concealed for now.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to lay low and develop.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan returned to Seven Color Peak, the fish soup he was stewing still wasn't ready.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened Six Zither Immortal's storage bag, and various treasures and spirit stones fell into his sight.</p><p></p><p>Inside, Qi Yuan even found two Profound level techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Qi Yuan would have definitely laughed with joy.</p><p></p><p>But having just obtained five Profound level techniques from Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, including one high-grade Profound technique, he now looked down on these two Profound level techniques.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's said since ancient times that it's hard for young ladies to live an ordinary life.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the view from higher up, who would still be willing to live in the dust?"</p><p></p><p>"These techniques are enough to perfect the 'Qi Yuan Scripture' to late Foundation Building stage, but for Golden Core... there's still no clue."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then opened Ji Boying's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Even a mosquito's leg is meat, can't let anything go to waste.</p><p></p><p>There were far fewer valuable things in Ji Boying's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Some colorful undergarments, a pitiful pile of spirit stones, techniques that Qi Yuan didn't care for.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, a list? A spy list?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't expect to find a list of some spies from the Demonic Desire Sect within the Divine Light Sect in Ji Boying's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened the list and took a look, then was stunned: "The Demonic Desire Sect's operation is this big?"</p><p></p><p>There were hundreds of densely packed names on the list.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that all the elders, executives and disciples of the Divine Light Sect, including menial disciples, only added up to a few thousand.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I always felt there were problems everywhere in the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>The fact that it can still operate well now is really luck."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the list, he didn't want to disrupt the current situation.</p><p></p><p>He also wouldn't imitate certain small country netizens, taking the list to a certain senior sister or certain master's wife and say: "Master's wife, you don't want your secret to be known by Master, right?"</p><p></p><p>"But the Demonic Desire Sect spent so much effort infiltrating the Divine Light Sect, what exactly is their purpose?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>If it was just to take down the Divine Light Sect, this method seemed too foolish.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to some strange sounds he occasionally heard when achieving Heavenly Dao Foundation Building,</p><p></p><p>He guessed there must be deeper reasons behind this.</p><p></p><p>"First complete the hundred-day plan, then consider other things.</p><p></p><p>If needed, I'll activate my clever brain and make a meticulous plan!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the Divine Flower Association's communication group.</p><p></p><p>"I have good news to tell all fellow Daoists, the first step of the hundred-day plan has been completed, your investments have paid off."</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord: "...The divine infant cultivator is dead?"</p><p></p><p>"I killed him with one chop of my kitchen knife!" Qi Yuan said carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Is it me who has a problem, or is it Origin Venerable who has a problem?</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, you acted very quickly. I've decided to go borrow another 20,000 spirit stones from the Palace of Light," Great Sun Flame Emperor quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, don't be too fast. If you destroy the Palace of Light too early, my sisters won't be able to borrow spirit stones," Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord looked at the messages in the group, his emotions complex.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Great Sun Flame Emperor and Ice Mountain Domineering Woman are all Origin Venerable's alternate accounts? Otherwise, how could they believe such an exaggerated thing?</p><p></p><p>Even with Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, one couldn't kill a divine infant with one knife strike!</p><p></p><p>Where in the world is there such a Foundation Building cultivator? Even the number one on the Heavenly Genius Ranking couldn't match a divine infant cultivator at the Foundation Building stage.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred days will pass with just one session of closed cultivation. By then we'll know if Origin Venerable was boasting or if my knowledge is limited."</p><p></p><p>Rogue Immortal Lord simply stopped talking in the group and quietly lurked.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan didn't know about this.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he had memorized all the newly obtained techniques in his mind.</p><p></p><p>When he entered the game, he could use his spare time to improve the "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, a voice suddenly transmitted into Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, want me to hand it over? No way!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was startled. What had happened in the game?...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Several terrifying auras permeated the air, seeming to affect the weather, with rain falling incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Seven Supreme Beings surrounded Ning Tao, their faces fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Tao, hand over the Blood Demon and we'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>All seven Supreme Beings present stared at Ning Tao, their eyes full of wariness.</p><p></p><p>Especially when they saw the blood sphere chained behind Ning Tao, the wariness in their eyes intensified.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, want me to hand it over? No way!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao wore a black form-fitting long dress, with golden threads embroidered with plum blossoms at her waist. Her slender figure stood proudly in the void, firmly protecting the blood sphere behind her.</p><p></p><p>"He's not a Blood Demon, and I won't hand him over!"</p><p></p><p>"As for you all, who instigated you to come attack me?"</p><p></p><p>Blood dripped from her sleeves, floating in the air before vanishing into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>At the Supreme Being realm, one could consciously prevent bodily fluids from remaining outside the body.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by seven Supreme Beings, Ning Tao had also suffered not light injuries.</p><p></p><p>But even so, she still protected the blood sphere behind her very well, like a mother hen protecting her chicks.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Tao, you're unworthy of being the Palace Master of the Heavenly Heart Palace. You don't respect the Supreme Lord's decree and secretly collude with the Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>Leave the Blood Demon behind and leave now, we can still spare your life!" a Supreme Being said sternly.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master of the Heavenly Heart Palace was also a powerful figure among Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>They didn't want to push too hard.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, some of them might also fall.</p><p></p><p>"You say it's a Blood Demon, what evidence do you have?" There was still blood at the corners of Ning Tao's mouth as she smiled charmingly.</p><p></p><p>But when the seven Supreme Beings present saw Ning Tao, their eyes revealed physiological disgust.</p><p></p><p>The "demon" character hidden behind the black veil was a rule of the great Dao of this world. Even though covered, they still felt nauseated.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though the Thirteen Northern Demon Beauties were Supreme Beings, they were still despised by heaven and hated by people.</p><p></p><p>So, from childhood, ever since the "demon" character appeared on her face, the gazes Ning Tao endured were all strange.</p><p></p><p>Disgust, nausea, murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Even her mother who loved her most dearly would secretly sneak into Ning Tao's room at night with scissors, wanting to stab her to death.</p><p></p><p>"Its appearance is similar to the Blood Demon described by the Supreme Lord," a Supreme Being said solemnly, staring at that blood sphere, "If it's not a Blood Demon, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's my... son." Ning Tao smiled sweetly, but this smile made everyone present feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a helpless voice came: "How did I become your son?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was still too thin-skinned and couldn't do what his middle school classmate did - when a girl called him her son, he directly said: "Mom, I want to drink milk."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 487</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the Zhi Li Assembly, the supreme existences of the Six Realms? Qi Yuan pondered, his thoughts endless.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, I'll go visit those supreme existences at the Zhi Li Assembly."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan's figure dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>In the Zi Yuan Heavens, the Zi Yuan Patriarch was perplexed, recalling what the Abyss Master had once told him.</p><p></p><p>"What does the origin of the bloodline matter? Once you've come to this universe, there is no future."</p><p></p><p>"He has come to this realm... perhaps it was a mistake."</p><p></p><p>The Zi Yuan Patriarch sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>At the Zhi Li Assembly, the voices were boisterous, as countless talented cultivators were recounting the previous great battle, their eyes filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say who in the Six Realms hated the Tai Huang Palace the most, aside from the Moon God Palace, it would be the Zhi Li Assembly.</p><p></p><p>The Zhi Li Assembly has always been the number one power in the Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the arrival of Tai Yang, and with the Tai Huang Palace led by the Lian Ya, there are vague signs that they may surpass the Zhi Li Assembly and become the number one power in the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>As members of the Zhi Li Assembly, they naturally do not wish to see such a scene.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing Qi Yuan's tyrannical display of power, sweeping away the Tai Huang Palace and even forcing them to retreat to the Seventh Realm, how could a single word like "awesome" encompass it?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the mighty Tai Huang Palace, forced to retreat to the Seventh Realm, how can they still have the face to return to the Six Realms?"</p><p></p><p>"The Tai Yang Sovereign position has been usurped, can he still be considered a supreme existence?"</p><p></p><p>"Compared to you two Supreme Ones, how powerful is this Wan Ri Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the entire venue fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme One's might covers the Six Realms, he is our Zhi Li Assembly's divine needle. Even during the peak of the Tai Yang, they had to show the utmost respect. Although the Wan Ri Sovereign is powerful, he is still far behind the Supreme One!"</p><p></p><p>"The Wan Ri Sovereign is currently no match for the Supreme One, but he has comprehended two supreme Zhi Li, and also possesses the Immortal Realm's number one造化异宝 Zhi Li Gate. In the future... he will definitely be the number one in the Six Realms!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention that, the three million stars in the Star Realm, who can rival him? And who knows if this is his limit!"</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, how did he cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators discussed animatedly, even the Celestial God Sovereign could not help but glance sideways.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast voice resounded in the Zhi Li Assembly.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, I request an audience with the two Supreme Ones of the Zhi Li Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, everyone couldn't help but look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The originally azure sky now seemed to have a faint golden glow, as well as a reddish hue.</p><p></p><p>Those talented cultivators couldn't help but bow their heads, a sense of fear arising, daring not to look directly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Qi Yuan had set out lightly, not even exuding the aura of a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>But just now, when he acted to overthrow the Tai Huang Palace, his might had deeply impressed these cultivators, making them not dare to look at him directly.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Yuan was also considerate, his voice was loud, but only the cultivators in the core area of the Zhi Li Assembly could hear it, without disturbing the common people.</p><p></p><p>After all, disturbing the mortals is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>In the Six Realms, the number of mortals is also quite large.</p><p></p><p>Those who casually let their voices spread throughout the Six Realms, disturbing the common people, were despised by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although it could be said that his destruction of the Tai Huang Palace was somewhat grand in scale, and could also be considered as disturbing the common people.</p><p></p><p>However, he had already apologized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although apologizing may not be of much use, the police would still have to do their job. Fortunately, this world has no police.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan could only apologize in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan arrived, the Zhi Li Assembly fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Those Celestial God Sovereigns and talented cultivators all bowed their heads, not daring to look directly at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign appeared in the void, slightly bowing and speaking humbly, "Greetings, Wan Ri Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign was at the Great Zhi Li realm, an elder of the Zhi Li Assembly.</p><p></p><p>When the Zhi Li Discourse Assembly was opened, he had seen the transformed Qi Yuan, and had even wanted to recruit Qi Yuan, but was rejected.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Sovereign, follow me into the Assembly to discuss." The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign stood in front of Qi Yuan and led the way.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan did not hesitate at all and followed the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign into the inner part of the Zhi Li Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at a vast and empty palace.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, there were many bookshelves, filled with books and jade slips.</p><p></p><p>At the deepest part of the bookshelves, there was a strange mirror.</p><p></p><p>In the mirror, there seemed to be firefly-like beings wandering about. They were real, not illusions.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Sovereigns?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>In this book palace, he had not sensed the presence of any Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"The Sovereigns say they dare not meet you, they are afraid that their greed will overcome them and they will try to seize your Zhi Li Gate." The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign said frankly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was surprised: "Your Sovereigns' moral cultivation seems to have much room for improvement, they cannot even suppress the demons within their hearts."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke very eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign twitched inwardly, but still smiled and said, "The Wan Ri Sovereign, the Sovereigns of the Six Realms, have actually never had their true bodies meet face to face."</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign revealed a secret.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan was surprised, "The kings don't meet, or is it..."</p><p></p><p>He thought of something, pensive.</p><p></p><p>"When I destroyed the Tai Huang Palace, wasn't I seen through by your Sovereigns? In that case, haven't I suffered a great loss?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>However, he then realized that he was only in his Purple Palace form, and at the time he was still wearing clothes and armor, so it wasn't exactly a full exposure.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign coughed.</p><p></p><p>He decided that he must record this down.</p><p></p><p>The thing he most liked to do in the Zhi Li Assembly was to write books, recording the great events of the Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>Today, when he met Qi Yuan, he had already thought of a title for the chapter about their previous exchange.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan Ri Sovereign Angrily Rebukes Being Seen Through by the Zhi Li Assembly's Supreme One"</p><p></p><p>Of course, he only dared to think about it now, he would have to wait until Qi Yuan was gone to write it down.</p><p></p><p>When he was old and decrepit, he would place these books in the secret realm, for future generations to read.</p><p></p><p>"Since I can't see them, can I ask you some questions about your Sovereigns?" Qi Yuan had come to the Zhi Li Assembly mainly to inquire about the information regarding the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme One says the Wan Ri Sovereign can ask me anything." The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign replied.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know everything?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign smiled and shook his head, "It's not that I know everything, but that it does!"</p><p></p><p>He said, his gaze turning to the strange mirror at the back of the book palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze also immediately looked in that direction.</p><p></p><p>[The Myriad Manifestation Mirror, observing the myriad beings, gathering forbidden knowledge, and disseminating scattered information.]</p><p></p><p>"This mirror is quite interesting," Qi Yuan looked at the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign, "I want to know more information about the Unique Palace."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He walked towards the Myriad Manifestation Mirror and reached out to touch the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, the mirror surface was like water, and the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign's hand could reach into the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan saw that many firefly-like lights in the mirror were constantly flowing into the Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign's hand.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign had his eyes closed, and his aura also changed in an instant, as if a different soul had replaced his body.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign's voice also lost its previous amiability, becoming cold.</p><p></p><p>"Many eons ago, the Immortal Realm had nine realms. Among them, there appeared a dazzlingly powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>He was called 'Ming', and the world called him the 'Ming Sovereign'. He was the number one strongest existence in the Immortal Realm for countless eons, unparalleled in the past and the future.</p><p></p><p>For unknown reasons, the Ming Sovereign, in the Ninth Realm, struck out with a single sword, severing the future of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the Immortal Realm had no future, and all cultivators could only enter the second layer of the Celestial God Realm in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was somewhat surprised: "This Ming Sovereign is quite formidable, able to sever the future of the Immortal Realm with a single sword?"</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying power!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked himself, if he were to go and sever the future now, he would be completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>What is the future, and how does one sever it? Yet there was someone who could sever the future of the Immortal Realm with a single sword, this must be at least at the Celestial God Third Realm, or even higher.</p><p></p><p>"With no future, all the powerful experts were confined to the second layer of the Celestial God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all the cultivators in the Immortal Realm tried to seek a way to continue the future and break through the Celestial God Second Realm barrier.</p><p></p><p>But the Ming Sovereign's single sword was too powerful, the Immortal Realm cultivators could not even understand it, let alone continue the future.</p><p></p><p>So gradually, no cultivators tried to continue the future anymore, but instead sought ways to break through the Celestial God Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this context, more and more hidden powers emerged, the most famous of which were the Zhi Li Assembly and the Unique Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Wu Sheng Heavenly Sovereign finally mentioned the Unique Palace, which was also Qi Yuan's greatest concern.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhi Li Assembly sought ways to break through, based on Zhi Li.</p><p></p><p>The Six Realms originally had no supreme Zhi Li, nor any Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>The Zhi Li Assembly gathered the wisdom of countless eons, breaking through the Celestial God Second Realm limit, and created offensive造化异宝, enhancing the combat power of the Great Zhi Li.</p><p></p><p>However, the offensive造化异宝 also had an upper limit, this path was not viable.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Zhi Li Assembly opened up the supreme Zhi Li, and from then on, there were Sovereigns in the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the limit of the Celestial God Second Realm is just the ordinary Great Zhi Li, like the Zi Yuan Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>But the Zhi Li Assembly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Unique Palace has opened up the path of attacking and transforming extraordinary treasures, enhancing the strength of the Yang Shen Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Later, it even opened up the Way of the Supreme Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seems that for the Zhi Li Association, the Way of the Supreme Venerable is more reliable than the attacking and transforming extraordinary treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhi Li Association was created by the Shu, and the Unique Palace was created by the Yin. The purpose of both the Shu and the Yin is to break through the limits of the dual nature of the Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>The Yin has taken a completely different path, which is to open the Unique Palace, transforming the Yang Shen Celestial Venerables into special beings, often referred to as Heroic Spirits or Extraordinary Spirits, and then enhancing the strength of these beings, opening up the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and gained some understanding.</p><p></p><p>"The Unique Palace... has gone further than the Zhi Li Association?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lingyue's transformation was initiated by the Unique Palace, and the Zhi Li Association was to some extent afraid of the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>This indicates that the combat power of the Unique Palace is stronger than the Zhi Li Association.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of combat power, the Unique Palace is superior to the Zhi Li Association.</p><p></p><p>However... the Extraordinary Spirits are not living beings, they have powerful combat strength but lack self-awareness, and are rejected by the Yang Shen Celestial Venerables of the Sixth Heaven, which is why Lingyue's transformation occurred."</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying... the combat power of the Unique Palace is even stronger than the Supreme Venerable?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but think of the countless, terrifying eyes in the pitch-black night when the Seventh Heaven gate opened.</p><p></p><p>Are they... the Extraordinary Spirits?</p><p></p><p>"For those who enter the Seventh Heaven from the Tai Huang Palace, their fate will be..." Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Those below the Yin Shen may survive. </p><p>Those at the Yang Shen level and above have no chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan began to understand.</p><p></p><p>These Extraordinary Spirits of the Unique Palace are not cultivators.</p><p>They can slay the Yang Shen and transform them into Extraordinary Spirits as well.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, the number of Extraordinary Spirits in the Unique Palace must be an extremely frightening figure.</p><p></p><p>After all, how many Yang Shen have fallen over these many eras as Lingyue's transformation opened time and time again? Qi Yuan felt a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>The Unique Palace, by sheltering the Tai Huang Palace, has committed a crime and can be considered Qi Yuan's enemy to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the Zhi Li Association's pursuit of the Zhi Li, the sole purpose of the Unique Palace is to sacrifice the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm, transforming all living beings into Extraordinary Spirits, and then break through the shackles to continue into the future," the Wusheng Celestial Venerable said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's nose did not grow longer.</p><p></p><p>This means that the "Wusheng Celestial Venerable" has not deceived him.</p><p></p><p>"They have quite a grand ambition," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He also understood why the Yang Shen of the Sixth Heaven would be so opposed to Lingyue's transformation.</p><p></p><p>Lingyue's transformation is turning them into Extraordinary Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Although becoming an Extraordinary Spirit may seem to grant greater power and longer existence, without self-awareness, are they still themselves? It's like on the Blue Star, someone saying they can make you exist for eternity, but the price is the loss of all self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>What's the difference between that and being wrapped in a mummy or turned into a fossil?</p><p>The Unique Palace's ambition is grand, but Qi Yuan is not worried.</p><p></p><p>If the sky falls, there will be a tall person to hold it up. What does it matter to a small Zi Fu cultivator like him?</p><p></p><p>The only regret is that the Tai Huang Palace has escaped.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Huang Palace is extremely evil and wicked, and those Yang Shen Celestial Venerables already have a way to execute them.</p><p></p><p>As for the ordinary lower-level cultivators, although many are guilty, their crimes do not warrant death, they just need to be imprisoned for a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Unique Palace has sheltered the criminals Qi Yuan wanted to capture.</p><p></p><p>He needs to find a time to capture the criminals and bring them to justice.</p><p></p><p>"Do I have a way to transmit a message to the Seventh Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He hopes the people of the Tai Huang Palace... will turn themselves in!</p><p></p><p>The Wusheng Celestial Venerable was silent for a moment, and in the Mirror of the Myriad Phenomena, countless fireflies were constantly flying, spinning, as if performing some kind of ritual.</p><p></p><p>About thirty breaths of time passed, and the Wusheng Celestial Venerable spoke: "The words you say next will be transmitted to the Seventh Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>In the Seventh Heaven, within the Tai Huang Palace, the people were in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>The young lady Tai Yue gritted her teeth, her eyes still glistening with tears.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Venerable of Ten Thousand Days attacked the Tai Huang Palace, and the Tai Huang Palace was defeated. They fled to the Seventh Heaven using the Unique Token, obtaining the protection of the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Tai Yue heaved a sigh of relief, feeling that they could temporarily settle down and spend a peaceful period with her brother Tai Ri.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Great Day not present, her brother Tai Ri could also enjoy freedom.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that after moving into the Seventh Heaven, a terrifying thing happened.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Huang Palace, all the Yang Shen Celestial Venerables... completely... lost their spirits.</p><p></p><p>Only their physical bodies remained.</p><p></p><p>These were Yang Shen Celestial Venerables, yet they disappeared so silently... all of them? Even Tai Yue's brother Tai Ri, who possessed the supreme Zhi Li, was also devoured.</p><p></p><p>How could Tai Yue not be shocked and saddened?</p><p></p><p>Now, the Tai Huang Palace is filled with worry and chaos, and everyone feels a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Yang Shen Celestial Venerables... have all mysteriously perished.</p><p></p><p>"This Seventh Heaven is not a place for people to stay, the Extraordinary Spirits of the Unique Palace... are not human!"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator with a shattered divine sense turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Even if they died in battle, it would be better than this kind of being devoured.</p><p></p><p>"This... why has the Supreme Venerable treated us this way? Even our Ancestor Patriarch followed the Supreme Venerable's orders!" cried a weeping Yin Shen, who was a direct descendant of the great Zhi Li that used the Unique Token to ascend to the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>So, he knew more about the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Venerable had previously said that if the other Supreme Venerables detained him and he could not return to aid the Tai Huang Palace, the Tai Huang Palace could use the Unique Token to seek refuge in the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Is this... refuge?</p><p></p><p>This is the path to death!</p><p></p><p>This is treating themselves as food, livestock to be sacrificed to the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than this, it would be better to stay in the Sixth Heaven. Even if the Supreme Venerable of Ten Thousand Days is terrifying, could he really kill all the billions of lives in the Tai Huang Palace?" someone couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Now that they are in the Seventh Heaven, they don't dare to freely use their Dao techniques, living a worse life than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>They have to be constantly vigilant and tense, wary of the Extraordinary Spirits of the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go back to the Sixth Heaven!" a cultivator bitterly said.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a vast voice suddenly resounded throughout the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This voice was extremely familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Confess and be lenient, resist and be severe!"</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Tai Huang Palace, you are guilty!"</p><p></p><p>"Please surrender immediately and return to the Sixth Heaven. If you surrender within three days, you only need to mine in the Zi Yuan Heaven and operate sewing machines for a thousand years, and your sentence will be completed.</p><p></p><p>If you do not surrender within three days, I will come to the Seventh Heaven myself to capture you, hehe, a three-thousand-year sentence is unavoidable!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice faded away, echoing throughout the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Tai Huang Palace were originally dumbfounded, but then they became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Venerable of Ten Thousand Days, I am guilty, quickly capture me and bring me to justice!"</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to surrender, I am willing to surrender!"</p><p></p><p>They were like people grasping at a lifeline.</p><p></p><p>After all, going to the Zi Yuan Heaven to mine for a thousand years, that's nothing of a punishment! Unfortunately, their cries will not be heard by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, since no one is confessing their crimes, it seems I will have to go to the Seventh Heaven myself when my cultivation is complete!"</p><p></p><p>The voice then faded away.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhi Li Association,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Wusheng Celestial Venerable and slowly said, "The criminals of the Tai Huang Palace still have some backbone, no one has confessed their crimes. It seems I will have to go to the Seventh Heaven myself."</p><p></p><p>Of course, in his current state, he definitely cannot do it.</p><p></p><p>He needs to improve his strength first.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, besides the Unique Palace, I also want to know the information about the Moon Deity Element Lord, and news about my master Ruan Yixi, she should be from the Moon Deity Palace..." Qi Yuan told the Wusheng Celestial Venerable, or rather the Mirror of the Myriad Phenomena, all the information he knew.</p><p></p><p>"For all the Supreme Venerables, the information around them is contained, and no information factors have leaked out. If you want to know, you need to go to the Moon Deity Palace and see the Moon Deity Element Lord.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ruan Yixi you are looking for, it seems her information has not leaked out either, or perhaps that is just one of her names."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>It seems he still needs to go to the Moon Deity Palace.</p><p></p><p>However, since he has usurped the position of the Great Day, to a certain extent, he is considered an enemy of the Moon Deity Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Deity Palace may not welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Supreme Venerables, is there any other information you want me to know? The Mirror of the Myriad Phenomena knows everything," the Wusheng Celestial Venerable said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror of the Myriad Phenomena is indeed very powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, that does not mean it is omnipotent.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and casually asked, "Do you know how to make 3nm chips?"</p><p></p><p>If he could get the answer, and return to the Blue Star, wouldn't it be easy for him to start a successful business?</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he could obtain some research funding.</p><p></p><p>"..." The Wusheng Celestial Venerable fell silent, and the Mirror of the Myriad Phenomena also seemed unable to understand the meaning of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Chinese national football team win the championship?"</p><p></p><p>"...???"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

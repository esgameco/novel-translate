        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Four legendary-level visualization methods were enough to make a Great Venerable excited and take someone as a personal disciple.</p><p></p><p>As for... twenty?</p><p></p><p>What kind of concept was that? Even the Great Venerables present couldn't grasp it.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen an Ancient God who could visualize 21 legendary-level god visualization methods in succession.</p><p></p><p>In theory, with 21 visualization methods of this level, if resources and time were sufficient, it could create 21 Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Of course, becoming a Great Venerable was very difficult, but reaching the Three Steps to Heaven was definitely not a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder God Great Venerable, where is my sister's husband? I'll go bring him over now!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't have twenty supreme treasures, but I have twenty daughters. As long as they are compatible with your disciple, they can all marry him!"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder God Great Venerable, you looked down on him before and didn't want to take him as a disciple. Now he probably looks down on you too."</p><p></p><p>The people in the group chat went crazy.</p><p></p><p>It was truly terrifying for over twenty god visualization methods of this level to appear at once.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Venerable was numb at this point. Looking at the messages in the group, he angrily replied: "Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Qi Yuan's group chat.</p><p></p><p>Those members were also completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe slowly said: "Did I develop an eye disease?"</p><p></p><p>"Dong, no you didn't," the Divine Cat Venerable said in the group. He also found it hard to accept, "Those golden lights just now, they couldn't have been from the Origin Heavenly Venerable, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No way?" Dong Jianghe swallowed, "I just casually mentioned that visualizing three legendary ones would be difficult, and told the Origin Heavenly Venerable not to force himself. Then he gave me twenty?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Origin Heavenly Venerable had entered the group to visualize gods. Dong Jianghe remembered what the Origin Heavenly Venerable had said about the Four Heavenly Kings, and was actually quite skeptical in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But afraid of being slapped in the face, he had only mumbled something under his breath.</p><p></p><p>As a result...</p><p></p><p>Over twenty legendary ones just like that?</p><p></p><p>Was there no law, no logic anymore? Was his mouth really that magical?</p><p></p><p>"If it's really the Origin Heavenly Venerable, I think Dong, you should just abdicate directly and take the Origin Heavenly Venerable as your adoptive father!"</p><p></p><p>"If there are really twenty-one legendary ones, I'm also willing to take the Origin Heavenly Venerable as my adoptive father!" someone said in the group.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the group was very excited.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Gods of the Mortal Heart Realm did not visualize on Visualization Mountain very often.</p><p></p><p>At this time, perhaps only the Origin Heavenly Venerable was visualizing.</p><p></p><p>So, there was a 99% chance that this flash of golden light and chirping of a thousand birds was caused by the Origin Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan exited Visualization Mountain. Looking at the group chat, he quickly said:</p><p></p><p>"I'm still young, I won't take any adoptive sons!"</p><p></p><p>It would be terrible if he ended up with someone like LÃ¼ Bu.</p><p></p><p>It was better to take an adoptive daughter like Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the messages in the group, Qi Yuan hurriedly left, afraid of being pestered by men.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the people in the group saw the Origin Heavenly Venerable leave, and were shaken in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"It really was the Origin Heavenly Venerable, how terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Dong Jianghe, you're so pitiful, even the Origin Heavenly Venerable is unwilling to take you as an adoptive son!"</p><p></p><p>"If only the Heavenly Treasure Venerable knew about this, how wonderful that would be." Someone sighed.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Heavenly Treasure Venerable, the clamor in the group disappeared, becoming silent.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the group, Qi Yuan had twenty-one new visualization methods.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Thunder God Great Venerable appeared before Qi Yuan in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Was that you in Visualization Mountain?" the Thunder God Great Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you, kid?" The Thunder God Great Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, wanting to see his background.</p><p></p><p>"Me?" Qi Yuan pondered. This question stumped him, as he hadn't seriously thought about it before.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it and became a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"By the July Lake, some call me the Faceless Sword God.</p><p></p><p>In the City of No Return, some call me the Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>In the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, some call me the Moon-Gazing Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>These are all me, but are they me?"</p><p></p><p>"Moon-Gazing Great Venerable?" The Thunder God Great Venerable remembered this key phrase, "Your previous life was also a Great Venerable, why don't I know this title?"</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan's other ramblings, he simply ignored them.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had already figured out how to communicate quickly with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That is, just listen to what he could understand.</p><p></p><p>"I know now!" Qi Yuan suddenly had a revelation, "Is it possible that you are me! The stars in the sky are all me, all living beings on earth are me?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Venerable frowned: "Are you having an episode? How could I possibly be you, and how could the stars in the sky possibly be you?"</p><p></p><p>"Why isn't it possible?" Qi Yuan seemed to have gained some insight, "An ordinary cat, seeing itself in a mirror, would be startled, because cats don't have self-awareness. Their cognition is not sufficient to recognize that it's themselves.</p><p></p><p>You now feel that you are not me, isn't it also because your cognition is insufficient? You can't understand that you are me.</p><p></p><p>The stars in the sky also can't understand that they are me.</p><p></p><p>Once they understand, they will know that they are actually me."</p><p></p><p>"Stop talking nonsense!" The Thunder God Great Venerable glared at Qi Yuan, "Do you want my thunder technique to help you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm not that addicted to games, I don't need electroshock therapy yet." Qi Yuan laughed, "I'm just joking, I was suddenly inspired while creating the 'Qi Yuan Sutra'."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't withstand a Great Venerable's thunder technique right now.</p><p></p><p>"Your Chinese Dragon Group really is full of talents!" said the Thunder God Great Venerable, "Twenty-one legendary ones? Such precious god visualization methods could almost create twenty-one True Gods, or even Great Venerables. You should think carefully about which promising subjects to give them to."</p><p></p><p>"No need, just choose some randomly. Why bother with all that trouble?" said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Great Venerable was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan confidently said: "Some people are powerful not because they are special, but because I chose them."</p><p></p><p>"Wasting visualization methods like this?" said the Thunder God Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't a waste, there are plenty more.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Court, there are the Thirty-Six Heavenly Generals, Seventy-Two Earthly Fiends, Sixty Cyclical Gods, One Hundred Thousand Celestial Soldiers and Generals, and many more.</p><p></p><p>As long as I have enough Demon God spiritual power, I can visualize anyone."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately for the current Qi Yuan, there were three things he lacked most.</p><p></p><p>One was Demon God spiritual power; one was supreme treasures that could break through to True God; and the last was the method for him and those powerful Heavenly Court deities to break through to True God.</p><p></p><p>"You sure can boast, one hundred thousand Celestial Soldiers and Generals? If the Mortal Heart Realm had these one hundred thousand Celestial Soldiers and Generals, would they have lost so badly in the Great Flood War!"</p><p></p><p>"See, your cognition is insufficient, right? Everyone has their own cognitive limitations." Qi Yuan transformed into a marketing guru, giving the Thunder God Great Venerable a free lecture.</p><p></p><p>"I... can't be bothered with you!" The Thunder God Great Venerable ran off directly, not wanting to stay with Qi Yuan. He was afraid he'd get sick if he stayed too long.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan called Qi Qi over and said softly: "I have a task for you. Call over three female cultivators, make sure they're good-looking, and eighteen male cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The requirements... just need to be of good character, pleasing to the eye, and robust. No need to be too picky. Complete it within an hour."</p><p></p><p>There were too many deities in the Heavenly Court pantheon, it would waste too much time to search slowly.</p><p></p><p>For this trip to the Hundred Flowers Gathering, the Thunder God Great Venerable couldn't act as a bodyguard, so he needed to arrange some bodyguards for himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was selecting bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>What conditions were needed for bodyguards? Good appearance and good character were enough.</p><p></p><p>As for strength, he would bestow that.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi left, and Qi Yuan recalled what happened on Visualization Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Eighteen Arhats actually used so much Demon God spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Less than a third of a True God's Demon God spiritual power remains."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Demon God spiritual power couldn't be traded.</p><p></p><p>It could only be obtained through killing by himself or his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully I can kill some foolish Demon Gods at this Hundred Flowers Gathering," Qi Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>He needed a lot of Demon God spiritual power to visualize deities.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, twenty-one villagers approached, led by Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>These people's faces still held bewildered and curious expressions.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun, dressed in coarse cloth, looked unremarkable among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>He looked at this legendary deity, his eyes containing a trace of admiration and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>He originally came from the Zhao family, a great clan in Flying Mist City, but unfortunately his parents died early, and his adoptive father seized his family fortune.</p><p></p><p>With the help of a loyal old servant, he had fled to Chen Xi Village below Flying Wilderness City and lived in seclusion under an assumed name.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these people and slowly said: "Most of you are from Qingshui Village, or have been following me for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Today, I'll give you some benefits."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the Flowing Wind Realm, he didn't actually care much about his subordinates' loyalty.</p><p></p><p>But, having become a guardian deity, from a certain perspective, these people were all his subjects.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, they would come to believe in him more and more.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat similar to a Demon God's assimilation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the crowd was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun's heart tightened, and joy arose in his heart: "Could it be... god visualization methods!"</p><p></p><p>Coming from a great clan background, he knew the importance of god visualization methods.</p><p></p><p>A powerful god visualization method could even create a True God.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the guardian deity was going to give them god visualization methods?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun was nervous but also delighted.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought that these twenty-one people would probably be sharing the visualization methods, and his joy dissipated somewhat, lowering his expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, that was still a very happy thing.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the Deity Observation Method, he might be able to break through to the Purple Palace realm, or even mid Purple Palace. Then he would have the qualifications to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, suddenly, twenty-one golden glowing Deity Observation Methods flew into the air. All twenty-one Deity Observation Methods emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Especially two of them - their golden light seemed to have materialized, giving people a powerful sense of impact.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun was stunned: "Legendary? Twenty-one of them?"</p><p></p><p>He was shaken inside.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The one with the strongest golden light fell directly into Zhao Zun's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't believe it, couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful Deity Observation Method, just... given to him so easily? He hadn't even... formally spoken to the Guardian Deity!</p><p></p><p>This level of Deity Observation Method, if released outside, would be enough to make true gods turn against each other! He couldn't understand it, which then turned into deep gratitude, as well as a sense of being recognized.</p><p></p><p>Finally someone has discovered my, Zhao Zun's, extraordinariness! He felt a surge of pride, and was even more grateful to Qi Yuan, this talent scout.</p><p></p><p>He must not let down Qi Yuan's trust.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, start observing and visualizing." Qi Yuan's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun didn't hesitate and immediately began to observe and visualize.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the Divine Thunder Great Venerable flashed over to Qi Yuan again. He stared at Zhao Zun and said: "That Deity Observation Method on him... is quite extraordinary, not like an ordinary legendary one."</p><p></p><p>"His method belongs to the Subduing Dragon Arhat. The Subduing Dragon Arhat is considered the strongest among the Eighteen Arhats, with the strongest mythical color," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Such big talk, daring to use Subduing Dragon as an honorific title!</p><p></p><p>If this old man remembers correctly, there is a group of evil dragons lurking in the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>If you take him there this time, those evil dragons will likely provoke him." The Divine Thunder Great Venerable said, staring at Zhao Zun, "However, the Deity Observation Method he's visualizing is indeed extraordinary, surpassing ordinary legendary ones."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't speak. The few people sat in the divine temple.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's experience was increasing crazily.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was stuck at level 89, unable to break through the final limit.</p><p></p><p>This was very similar to the situation in Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when the blood-colored light shone on the world again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the twenty-one people before him, his eyes showing anticipation: "Not bad, all have reached Purple Palace perfection!"</p><p></p><p>This was the result of just one person visualizing a legendary level Deity Observation Method.</p><p></p><p>If resources and time were sufficient, it could even create Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In other words, among the twenty-one people before him, everyone had the potential to become a Great Venerable! The Divine Thunder Great Venerable looked at the twenty-one people, his heart unable to calm for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Such Deity Observation Methods, given out casually like handing out radishes?</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, there are still five supreme treasures. Take them to break through to True God."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan tossed out five supreme treasures, throwing them into the hands of three women.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two fell into the hands of the Subduing Dragon Arhat and Taming Tiger Arhat.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, those people's faces lit up with joy as they took the supreme treasures and began to break through.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Three divine lights shot into the sky as the three women broke through first, directly entering the True God realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhao Zun and another man had ugly expressions, sweat forming on their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>The supreme treasures were still in their hands, but they were unable to absorb them, as if being rejected.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to Qi Yuan's situation.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder Great Venerable's eyes showed surprise: "This Subduing Dragon Arhat... his talent is so strong that he can't break through to the True God realm using a supreme treasure."</p><p></p><p>Not only the Subduing Dragon Arhat, but the Taming Tiger Arhat was the same.</p><p></p><p>The two Arhats used the supreme treasures with no reaction.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Qi Yuan sighed. He looked at Zhao Zun and the other man, "Don't blame yourselves. It's because the level of the Deity Observation Method is too high, so these supreme treasures can't help you break through."</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan said this.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun felt mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>This was really... outrageous.</p><p></p><p>For him, he didn't know if this was good news or bad news.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, there will be plenty of opportunities to break through in the future." Qi Yuan took the two supreme treasures in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at two men and said: "You who smiled the happiest, and you with the long eyebrows, you two break through first."</p><p></p><p>The two men Qi Yuan pointed to were the ones who had visualized the Joyful Arhat and Long Eyebrow Arhat methods.</p><p></p><p>Those two received the supreme treasures with joy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Taking the supreme treasures, they broke through to the True God realm in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a terrifying aura spread and swept out.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder Great Venerable's eyes showed surprise: "These people are not ordinary True Gods. They've only opened one divine aperture, but can fight those with three apertures."</p><p></p><p>The True God realm was divided into seven steps of treading the sky, with big gaps between each step.</p><p></p><p>Even within the first step of treading the sky, there were big differences.</p><p></p><p>After all, 11 divine apertures versus 1 aperture wasn't simply eleven times the difference.</p><p></p><p>"Your names are too complicated, and I'm too lazy to remember them. I'll bestow you with honorific titles. From now on... call yourselves by these titles!" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He had ambitious plans to recreate the Heavenly Court.</p><p></p><p>"You will be... Subduing Dragon Arhat, you, Taming Tiger Arhat, Riding Deer Arhat, Long Eyebrow Arhat..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan bestowed titles on these people one after another, including names for the three beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>However, the former Four Heavenly Kings had all become women, which was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan only recited in his mind, hoping the real Four Heavenly Kings, if they existed, wouldn't blame him.</p><p></p><p>He just had a bad memory, so he borrowed the names of the Four Heavenly Kings.</p><p></p><p>"The bodyguard team is complete. Let's go attend the Hundred Flowers Meeting!" Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>This time going to the Hundred Flowers Meeting, he would bring the Four Heavenly Kings, Eighteen Arhats, and his adopted daughter Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>Everyone made simple preparations and set off grandly towards the North Sea Divine Eye.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside Qingshui Village, the villagers seeing Qi Yuan off had tears in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked at the big black dog standing in front of him, feeling particularly annoyed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Four Heavenly Kings and Eighteen Arhats with extreme envy.</p><p></p><p>"Great Deity, I... I am also loyal and devoted!"</p><p></p><p>This time, when Qi Yuan took out twenty-one Deity Observation Methods, the whole village was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Not just the village, even Fehuang City was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi was especially jealous, his eyes turning red.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu stood silently to the side. To be honest, he was also jealous.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Shen Tu secretly transmitted to the village chief: "Why don't we tell the Guardian Deity about the ancestral land?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had planned to wait until the Guardian Deity broke through to the True God realm before telling him this good news, to give him a surprise.</p><p></p><p>Now they were thinking, tell him quickly, quickly gain favor, become familiar, and get the Deity Observation Method!</p><p></p><p>"As soon as the Guardian Deity returns, tell him immediately!" Village Chief Yu Lu felt there was no need to pretend to be profound anymore, no need to talk about bullshit timing not being right. Being direct was the way to go!</p><p></p><p>That was a Deity Observation Method, a chance to enter the True God realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The rain is getting heavier."</p><p></p><p>A stream of light flew through the sky. Duowen Heavenly King Mo Li Hong was dressed in red, holding an umbrella in her hand to shield Qi Yuan from the rain.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes showed a cautious look: "My lord, this rain probably won't stop anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun spoke up: "This place is adjacent to the North Sea. It has rained continuously for years. Rumor has it that it's related to the evil dragon's son from the North Sea being killed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan became interested when he heard this, "Could it be the Dragon King's third prince, who had his tendons pulled out?"</p><p></p><p>"A group of flood dragons lurk in the North Sea. One of the evil dragons came to the human world to do evil, raping and pillaging, committing all kinds of atrocities.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he was killed by the Phoenix Clan's Third Miss Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>The North Sea Dragon Clan and Phoenix Clan became enemies because of this.</p><p></p><p>This place happens to be where the evil dragon was killed, so evil dragons often come to stir up trouble, preventing good harvests here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>This story was interesting.</p><p></p><p>Should he visualize Nezha for Qi Qi in the future?</p><p></p><p>But thinking that she was his adopted daughter, he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>Nezha was quite rebellious too.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't like rebellious daughters. Daughters should be more obedient.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a light, floating voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, your words are mistaken. The frequent rain in this area has nothing to do with the North Sea Dragon Clan, but only with that killed evil dragon.</p><p></p><p>That evil dragon had very high talent, even mastering water attributes, with the potential to become a Great Venerable in charge of the rain deity position.</p><p></p><p>It was killed here, which is why this place has long years of continuous heavy rain."</p><p></p><p>Along with this voice, three people appeared before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The leader was a True God, looking handsome with clear eyes and a straight figure.</p><p></p><p>Beside him were a boy and a maid.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over Qi Yuan and the others, surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Liuyun, greets you all."</p><p></p><p>He was very curious about these people before him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the leader looked ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But he had six True Gods under him, each looking extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the followers were all at the peak of Purple Palace realm, looking quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Especially the one who spoke earlier - though only at Purple Palace perfection, for some reason he felt a sense of fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ye Liuyun, surprise flashing in his eyes: "Dragon clan?"</p><p></p><p>PS: There's one more chapter around 2:30, read it tomorrow morning!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

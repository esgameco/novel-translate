        <h1>Chapter 513</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined that Senior Sister Shen's husband would actually be a madman, what a pity, what a pity," the man in the white robe sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Tianzhong and Gulei Sects were in a competitive relationship, but the two were not like water and fire, but rather the two divine pillars stabilizing the Ning Kingdom. The disciples of the two sects also admired each other.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shen Lingxuan's husband in this way, the man in the white robe felt a sense of lamentation.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tu, let's go, talking to these lunatics is a complete waste of time," the man in the white robe said, looking at Master Tu.</p><p></p><p>But Master Tu's reaction surprised him.</p><p></p><p>Master Tu had a hesitant expression, with a hint of excitement. He naturally refused the man in the white robe.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wood, don't talk nonsense, Young Master Qi is graceful and refined, how could he be a lunatic?" </p><p></p><p>Nearby, Zhan Wenyu also sided with Master Tu: "Mr. Qi is an immortal above the world, playing among mortals, only those with short-sighted vision fail to recognize the true dragon."</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu spoke with a strong sense of superiority, full of disdain for the man in the white robe.</p><p></p><p>The man in the white robe was stunned, looking at the two with surprise.</p><p></p><p>He was now a bit confused, as if the three friends were gossiping about someone behind their back, but when they encountered that person, the other two friends were respectful and admiring towards them.</p><p></p><p>He had become the fool.</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, with a thousand whys? But what he felt more was the anger towards Master Tu and Zhan Wenyu.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The man in the white robe snorted coldly and left directly.</p><p></p><p>This cold snort seemed to say: Baby's not playing with you anymore.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the man in the white robe leave, Zhan Wenyu hurriedly apologized, "Mr. Qi, it was my shortsightedness that failed to recognize the true dragon, I hope you can forgive me, how dare I bully you?"</p><p></p><p>Master Tu also bowed his head and tentatively said, "Senior, I have a few tens of thousands of taels of silver, wanting to purchase... a light sword."</p><p></p><p>"I don't lack money for now, and magical artifacts... are only sold to those with affinity," Qi Yuan directly refused, "You already have a light sword, leave the opportunity for others."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Master Tu was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he was certain that the person in front of him was the stall owner who sold him the light sword.</p><p></p><p>"How did you recognize me?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Master Tu hesitated for a moment, taking out a magical artifact, "Because the senior has killed some people, as long as this magical artifact is within three meters, it will flash."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He also immediately understood that this should be the magical artifact of the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>"You two go, don't disturb my fishing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand and continued to lie down.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Wenyu and Master Tu saw this and respectfully left.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, the two exchanged a meaningful glance and revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took out the Divine Wood Token and asked in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I killed some of the Thorn Blood's people, and the Thorn Blood's magical artifact will light up when I get too close, how do I solve this?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very socially anxious and did not like the feeling of being peeked at.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ji Wuyun replied: "This is difficult, you need to find some special Heaven-level Armament Masters to remove it with special methods, but the process is very painful and will also harm the soul."</p><p></p><p>"Where's the trouble, Brother Cai Dao thinks too much, next time you come to the Divine Wood Abyss, I'll give you a bottle of Thorn Wash, drink a sip and you won't have this mark anymore," the Thorn Blood staff member said sincerely and considerately.</p><p></p><p>"Can you give me a bottle now?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Cai Dao, if you come over now, I'll definitely give you one."</p><p></p><p>"I can't come over, should I let my debt collector Yan Shuangying come find you."</p><p></p><p>Yan Shuangying, the debt collector of the Debt Collection Hall, was a shapeshifting drone composed of a pair of swallows.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Cai Dao has no sincerity."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have sincerity yet, now I haven't even discussed with him in the group how to destroy the Thorn Blood yet.</p><p></p><p>Since you say I have no sincerity, I'll discuss it with him now.</p><p></p><p>Hey, how many strong experts does the Thorn Blood have, where is their headquarters, after a while, I'll personally go to the Thorn Blood headquarters to visit and wipe them out."</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun saw this and was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"This new master of the Divine Wood Token, why does he feel mentally unstable?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun didn't really want to speak in the group.</p><p></p><p>"Our headquarters are not that interesting, why don't you come to the Divine Wood Abyss to visit, I'll let the Thorn Blood members stand there and let you kill them," the Thorn Blood staff member responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, as soon as I'm done with my business, I'll head over there," Qi Yuan spoke arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun looked at the messages in the group, his head aching.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that the two people in the group were too childish.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Blood staff member's words did not have the feeling of an evil dragon; Cai Dao's words also did not have the feeling of a dragon-slaying hero, but rather more like a big villain.</p><p></p><p>"This world... is beyond saving."</p><p></p><p>The giant ship continued to sail, cutting through the waves towards Yeshanlake.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the giant ship stopped sailing.</p><p></p><p>Some Armament Masters flew down from the ship to the river to retrieve the bodies.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that a few days ago, Tianzhong and the Water Lord of Yeshanlake had another conflict.</p><p></p><p>This conflict resulted in the death of over a thousand innocent fishermen.</p><p></p><p>Those fishermen's bodies were washed away to who knows where by the great waters.</p><p></p><p>Now, the giant ship has stopped to retrieve those fishermen's bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Their bodies should not be without a resting place."</p><p></p><p>"They are all citizens of our great Ning, sigh..."</p><p></p><p>"This Water Lord is truly vicious, this time I must repair the Mighty Xuantuan and subdue it."</p><p></p><p>"A total of ninety-eight bodies have been retrieved, sigh..."</p><p></p><p>On the giant ship, there were constant sighs and laments.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere also had a touch of gloom, this small incident has come to an end, and the giant ship finally arrived at the dock of Yeshanlake in the afternoon of the second day.</p><p></p><p>Yeshanlake was vast and boundless, as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>The people on the giant ship all disembarked.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao followed Shen family's group towards Shen family's stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The ice-cold Zhifeng came over, looking at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "I never expected the lord's husband to also be able to come to Yeshanlake."</p><p></p><p>The Shen family came to Yeshanlake this time to attend the Armament Master Convention, either they were powerful Armament Masters, or they had very high Armament Master talent.</p><p></p><p>Like Qi Yuan, he was completely dragging the team down.</p><p></p><p>"Where's your young miss? I want to ride her," Qi Yuan's gaze was burning.</p><p></p><p>At these words, Zhifeng's coldness intensified: "Lord, please do not speak such absurd words again."</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else saying this, Zhifeng would have probably already drawn her sword and split them in half.</p><p></p><p>However, she still said, "The Water Lord has been frequently stirring up waves recently, the young miss has followed the seniors of Tianzhong to guard Yeshanlake, and will not be back for a while."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed: "Losing a mount."</p><p></p><p>"You!" Zhifeng gritted her teeth, glancing at Chen Kangbao warily, stomping her feet in anger.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Yuan was the lord, she dared to attack him. </p><p></p><p>But she felt that she was no match for Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>After all, last time, she was suspected to have been ambushed and knocked unconscious by Chen Kangbao, and when she woke up, her whole body was aching, and she didn't know what that womanizer Qi Yuan had done to her.</p><p></p><p>She was still a virgin...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Child, I shouldn't have done such an outrageous thing, but... touching her all over... she still thinks about it sometimes.</p><p></p><p>She was both embarrassed and angry, but she didn't tell the young lady about this suspicion. Because, she is the young lady's sword-bearing maid, the young lady's husband-to-be, and also her future destination.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Mount E Lake, the eyes of the Taoist woman flashed with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant waves were cut off by her sword, and there was a trace of annoyance in the depths of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Water Lord, do you think that just by hiding in the depths of Mount E Lake, we of the Heaven Sect cannot do anything to you? If you cause trouble again, I will summon a Heaven-level artifact to suppress you!"</p><p></p><p>The Water Lord's strength was merely at the peak of the Earth-level, and his Grandmaster-level strength was only slightly stronger than this Taoist woman.</p><p></p><p>But the Water Lord had the home field advantage in Mount E Lake, and his combat power would be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, he had powerful water control abilities! It was a strange spirit that had already merged with Mount E Lake.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to, he could even raise the endless waters of Mount E Lake and flood the entire Jining Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist woman shouted towards the depths of Mount E Lake, but unfortunately, the figure of the Water Lord was hidden in the lake, and he did not bother to respond to her.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The Taoist woman was furious, and with a sweep of her sleeve, she stepped on the surface of the water and flew towards a small boat.</p><p></p><p>On the boat, there was a woman in a blue dress, and the blue petals on her collar made her seem very lonely.</p><p></p><p>She wore a veil on her face, so her true features were not visible, but just the graceful figure that was exposed was already considered a rare beauty in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Xuan, your husband should have already arrived at Mount E Lake, you don't need to guard here, go see your family."  The Taoist woman spoke.</p><p></p><p>She was an elder of the Heaven Sect, and Shen Ling Xuan's teacher.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ling Xuan shook her head: "Now that the Water Lord has stirred up the waves, I need to guard here."</p><p></p><p>Elder Wang Qingyi nodded: "Alright, but be careful, if you discover any trace of the Water Lord, send a message immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Shen Ling Xuan was as calm as orchids.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qingyi glanced at her disciple, and a sense of pity inexplicably arose in her heart: "If I were a Heaven-level Armament Master, how could I let my disciple suffer and marry that ordinary man?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wang Qingyi felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Her disciple had a Mysterious Yin physique, and countless evil cultivators coveted her.</p><p></p><p>This Armament Master Convention at Mount E Lake even had cultivators from other prefectures and even other countries coming, and their target was not the Water Lord, but her disciple.</p><p></p><p>"How is marrying her husband considered suffering? All people in this world are born equal." Shen Ling Xuan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"You have grasped the true essence of the Heaven Sect, and if you didn't have the Mysterious Yin physique, in this life you would have the chance to become a Heaven-level Armament Master, or even catch a glimpse of the legendary Divine-level Armament Master." Wang Qingyi sighed.</p><p></p><p>The founder of the Heaven Sect, the first Sect Leader, was a Divine-level Armament Master, and the truth he left behind was the equality of all things.</p><p></p><p>However, many of the Heaven Sect's elders and disciples did not take this truth seriously.</p><p></p><p>Only Shen Ling Xuan seemed to wholeheartedly accept this truth.</p><p></p><p>"You... should consummate your marriage with your husband as soon as possible. Once you lose the Mysterious Yin physique, although you will lose some cultivation, the other evil cultivators will no longer focus on you.</p><p></p><p>I heard that the number one flower thief of Mount Muo Country, Grandmaster Hengshan, has also secretly infiltrated the Ning Country, seemingly for you."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this flower thief, Wang Qingyi had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>That was a Grandmaster-level Earth-level Armament Master.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he was even slightly stronger than her.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ling Xuan stood at the bow of the boat, her expression as cold as the frost of the moon: "I hope the sect will protect Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>She didn't expect that Qi Yuan would come to the Armament Master Convention at Mount E Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I have already instructed that an Earth-level Armament Master will guard your Shen family's people." Wang Qingyi said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Shen family's stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched and yawned.</p><p></p><p>"How's the investigation going?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's face showed a troubled expression: "The chef is too hard to find, but the... father-in-law is easier to find."</p><p></p><p>"No, I have a cleanliness obsession." Qi Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at Mount E Lake, Qi Yuan's strength had recovered by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>He was considering playing the role of a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>As a kitchen knife, in order to play the role well, he needed to find a chef and create delicious dishes.</p><p></p><p>Through continuous cooking, the performance of the kitchen knife would be improved.</p><p></p><p>This would bring him many benefits.</p><p></p><p>After all, he could only unlock new character roles after completing other performance tasks.</p><p></p><p>Now, here at Mount E Lake, with the large lake, he could do a Hundred Fish Feast.</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's guess.</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't choose the "father-in-law", well... of course it was just his personal preference.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, should we just follow the original plan... and set up a stall?" Chen Kangbao said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt a bit disappointed: "It seems I still have to wait for a destined person."</p><p></p><p>The so-called setting up a stall meant that Chen Kangbao would sell the "kitchen knife".</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave a note, then we'll leave."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought, and took out paper and a pen, writing on the paper.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Chen Kangbao is a greedy old man who wants to eat delicious food from the mortal world, so I took him to find delicious food, don't worry about it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan simply wrote the note, placed it on the table, and pressed it down with a water glass.</p><p></p><p>After that, Qi Yuan immediately used his Thousand Transformations and turned into a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>In the past, this kitchen knife would be very large, about the size of a person.</p><p></p><p>But after Qi Yuan's strength increased, his Thousand Transformations could now slightly control the size.</p><p></p><p>He controlled his size to a normal kitchen knife size.</p><p></p><p>Then, he crawled into a hard and soft shell.</p><p></p><p>"Transform!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used Thousand Transformations again, and Chen Kangbao was transformed into a chameleon by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, carry me and leave." </p><p></p><p>The reason Qi Yuan did this was because after arriving at the Shen family's stronghold, he noticed that there were quite a few gazes, sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally, peeking in this direction.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to leave and avoid everyone, so he had to use Thousand Transformations.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The chameleon Chen Kangbao picked up Qi Yuan and ran out.</p><p></p><p>Their figures only attracted the attention of a few servants, and did not attract the attention of those Earth-level Armament Masters at all.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master... are we safe now?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao, carrying Qi Yuan, had reached a large mountain, and now faced the most intense danger in his life.</p><p></p><p>There was a large goose in front of them, staring at him hungrily.</p><p></p><p>"Safe... not quite safe, because... it seems someone is following us." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao was anxious: "Someone is following us?"</p><p></p><p>He was speechless, who would be so free to follow a chameleon.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure descended near Chen Kangbao, it was a burly man, and he had a malicious smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The rumor is that Grandmaster Hengshan's illusionary techniques are unparalleled and he has stolen countless flowers without being discovered. Unexpectedly... Grandmaster Hengshan, reveal your true form."</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that this burly man had mistaken the chameleon for the flower thief Grandmaster Hengshan.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

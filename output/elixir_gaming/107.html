        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Nine Pan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The canary's small face was pale. When she saw the Door of Ten Thousand Differences disappear, she clutched her skirt and ran frantically up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl!"</p><p></p><p>The familiar figure did not appear. The peak was empty.</p><p></p><p>The canary felt inexplicably lost inside.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ten Thousand Differences had vanished, and Blood Pearl... had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Everything was so strange, hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>The breeze at the mountaintop lifted the strands of hair on the canary's cheeks as she stubbornly gazed at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, you can't really be the Buddha they talk about, can you?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I... the demon woman you killed?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since the origin of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences was discovered, a rumor had been secretly circulating on Nine Pan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was said that Blood Pearl, who appeared when the Door of Ten Thousand Differences appeared, was actually a great demon - a drop of the Buddha's blood.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Master taught the Demon Trapping Technique as a form of atonement.</p><p></p><p>On Nine Pan Mountain, many people thought this theory was nonsense, while many others believed it.</p><p></p><p>The canary stood alone at the peak.</p><p></p><p>She didn't like the story of the great Buddha slaying the demon woman.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A heavy rain fell over No Return City. Yuan Qi, wearing a straw raincoat, looked up at the guardian on the city wall and inexplicably felt a thread of fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just moments ago, an army of over a thousand demon spawn had attacked, only to be slain one by one by the guardian's sword.</p><p></p><p>This should have been an inspiring sight, but for some reason, as Yuan Qi looked at Qi Yuan, he felt in his heart that this was a terrifying demon from hell.</p><p></p><p>Especially when Qi Yuan sat on the city wall - Yuan Qi clearly saw a flash of blood red in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just seeing those eyes made Yuan Qi tremble inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was looking not at a guardian, but at a terrifying demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Are you afraid of me?" Qi Yuan's voice came from atop the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The words fell like stones on Yuan Qi's heart. He gritted his teeth and lowered his head, saying, "Guardian, your current state... seems a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>He dared not look at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you may go," Qi Yuan said softly, seemingly unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Qi breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, being close to the Guardian filled him with fear.</p><p></p><p>His heart felt incredibly oppressed.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Qi Yuan held a broken sword with blood drops still clinging to it. With a shake of his hand, the blood drops fell.</p><p></p><p>"After this enlightenment, the extraction of demon essence has increased tenfold, reaching 10%.</p><p></p><p>I hope I don't end up turning into some kind of monster like the demon spawn," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>His emotions had been very unstable lately.</p><p></p><p>Greed, wrath, lust, pride and other feelings kept swirling inside him.</p><p></p><p>This was especially severe right after slaying demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride, are you afraid of me?" Qi Yuan turned to look at the figure in the red wedding dress behind him.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride became flustered and almost tripped in her hurry. A wooden sign fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked it up - it was the "Stick Together" sign.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Little Bride tightly in his arms. Feeling her faint fragrance, a look of contentment came over his face. "It's good to have you... playing the game alone for too long can get quite boring."</p><p></p><p>The red in Qi Yuan's eyes slowly faded, as did the fearsome aura around him.</p><p></p><p>He embraced Little Bride as they sat on the city wall, gazing out at the vast desert. Unfortunately, there was no sunrise or sunset in the Flow Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Controller camp, Wu Tong's face was ashen.</p><p></p><p>"Do I have to personally deal with a tiny place like No Return City?" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tong flew into a rage, sweeping the wine cups and jade plates off the table, smashing them to pieces.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so Realm Guardians present kept their heads lowered, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, the vanguard Iron Chain had gone to No Return City and never returned.</p><p></p><p>This had shocked them all.</p><p></p><p>Iron Chain was second only to Wu Tong in strength within their faction, yet he had gone and not come back.</p><p></p><p>Without understanding the situation, they certainly wouldn't go themselves. They could only control some demon spawn to methodically besiege No Return City.</p><p></p><p>But those demon spawn also went and never returned.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Looking at his cowardly subordinates, Wu Tong's face was full of anger. "If Mi Sang finds out about this situation here, I wonder how he'll mock me?"</p><p></p><p>No one present dared to speak.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they went to other cities and were defeated, it wouldn't be a big deal. Without deep grudges, the other side would be willing to accept their surrender.</p><p></p><p>A small old man stepped forward: "Commander Wu Tong, perhaps No Return City was just poorly named, causing us to go without return."</p><p></p><p>In any case, they didn't dare to go.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Tong became even angrier: "Which of you dares to go to No Return City? Take down No Return City and I will richly reward you. I'll even grant... some of the Demon Controlling Essence."</p><p></p><p>Those present began breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The reason they could avoid being attacked by demon spawn and command some of them was because of the Demon Controlling Essence.</p><p></p><p>Currently, they were all borrowing the power of the Demon Controlling Essence to command demon spawn, rather than truly possessing it themselves.</p><p></p><p>If they obtained complete Demon Controlling Essence, not only could they control more and stronger demon spawn, it would also greatly help their cultivation. They might even break through the Realm Guardian level and enter the Earthly Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>However, those present still felt apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Wu Tong, why don't we... all go together?" suggested the small old man who had commented on the city's name earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's go together and destroy No Return City!"</p><p></p><p>"If Commander Wu Tong personally takes action, No Return City will fall in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone tried to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the powerful Wu Tong taking the lead, there would be almost no risk for so many strong cultivators to attack together.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong looked at the crowd, inwardly furious. His expression changed several times before he finally said: "In one month, we march on No Return City!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Wu Tong left the tent.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he arrived at a lake.</p><p></p><p>He took out a small bottle of liquid and poured it into the lake.</p><p></p><p>The originally clear water instantly turned blood red.</p><p></p><p>Then a terrifying projection appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Eminence!" Wu Tong bowed respectfully to the projection in the lake.</p><p></p><p>"How are things in Yu Province?" the projection asked slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, your servant has encountered some trouble.</p><p></p><p>In No Return City, there is a powerful expert guarding the city alone. He is suspected to be a disciple of the White Emperor." Wu Tong replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>How could Wu Tong not understand Mi Sang's intentions? Having reached his position, he naturally saw that Mi Sang did not want to oppose No Return City and leave Yu Province.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong had come here to take advantage of the situation, following the orders of the Eminent One before him.</p><p></p><p>"A disciple of the White Emperor? Could it be..." The Eminent One felt fear arise, but quickly suppressed the emotion. "No, the White Emperor surely doesn't know about this. Otherwise, it wouldn't be just a disciple who came, but the White Emperor himself."</p><p></p><p>The Eminent One was terrified of the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>After all, the White Emperor and the Venerable One were the two strongest beings in this world.</p><p></p><p>The Eminent One didn't dare to confront them at all.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's all just a coincidence." Realizing this, the fear in the Eminent One's heart dissipated. "Are you afraid you're no match for this disciple of the White Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this lowly one fears not death, but ruining the Venerable One's plans," Wu Tong said.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He knew this supreme being was plotting something regarding Wuguicheng and Jialan City.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know the specific reasons, nor did he dare to ask. </p><p></p><p>But if it succeeded, there would be an enormous opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Countless expressions flashed through the eyes of that supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the entire lake's water began to churn violently.</p><p></p><p>A whirlpool appeared in the center of the lake, with all the water swirling into it.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tong watched this scene, somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was the supreme being's technique.</p><p></p><p>About 15 minutes later, the vast lake had completely disappeared. There wasn't even any mud left on the ground, just dry, cracked earth.</p><p></p><p>A light purple water droplet floated beside Wu Tong.</p><p></p><p>The supreme being's voice came: "Take this with you. If you can't defeat White Emperor's disciple, use it.</p><p></p><p>This contains my strongest primordial strike. It can instantly annihilate a Terrestrial Myth.</p><p></p><p>Even for a supreme being, if low-ranked, facing this strike would risk death.</p><p></p><p>White Emperor has 3000 disciples. Except for the core few, with this item you can secure Wuguicheng."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Tong looked at the light purple water droplet, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supreme One. Wu Tong will definitely help you take Wuguicheng!"</p><p></p><p>Taking Wuguicheng was the first step.</p><p></p><p>He still needed the supreme being to find what he needed.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in an abyss in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>A man was completely shrouded in purple.</p><p></p><p>Before him was an ancient, profound stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained this tablet 3000 years ago.</p><p></p><p>For 3000 years, he had constantly studied it, finally uncovering its mysteries. It recorded a secret from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"Wuguicheng... the burial place of the demoness, the source of all evil. If I obtain it..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed man's eyes were filled with greedy light.</p><p></p><p>If he obtained it, what would the so-called Venerable One and White Emperor amount to?</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I can't go personally now, or it would certainly draw attention from all sides..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed man was very powerful, among the top echelon in the northern lands.</p><p></p><p>So his movements would definitely attract attention from all sides.</p><p></p><p>If he went to Wuguicheng, it would likely expose his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he could only use Wu Tong as a small agent to find the source of evil, then go himself.</p><p></p><p>"Wuguicheng is easy to deal with... but what about the place where the Great Demon became a demon?" The purple-robed man hesitated.</p><p></p><p>That place also held enormous opportunities, no less than Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>But clearly, compared to Wuguicheng, it would be harder to take.</p><p></p><p>He needed to think of a way to take it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Jialan City, dark clouds gathered, the atmosphere heavy.</p><p></p><p>Garrison Commander Dong Long heard the news reported by his subordinate, a resolute expression on his face. He said: "Wu Tong will soon lead all his troops to besiege Wuguicheng. What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>The gathered Guardians of the Realm heard this, their expressions quite solemn: "Compared to Mi Sang, Wu Tong is more rigid and also stronger. If Wuguicheng falls, our Jialan City... I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Those present were quite worried.</p><p></p><p>Although Mi Sang was strong, when attacking Jialan City he had always been holding back, clearly afraid of losing his life.</p><p></p><p>But this Wu Tong seemed to be the extremely aggressive type.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Tai, what do you think?" Dong Long looked at Liu Wen Tai and his sister.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wen Tai and Liu Wen Mei had met Qi Yuan before.</p><p></p><p>"The Garrison Commander of Wuguicheng is extremely, extremely powerful, even... a Terrestrial Myth." Every time Liu Wen Tai recalled Qi Yuan's stunning sword strike, he felt awe.</p><p></p><p>"A Terrestrial Myth is powerful, but for Wu Tong's expedition this time, the number of Guardians of the Realm is likely over a hundred.</p><p></p><p>Add to that the endless demonic army, even a Terrestrial Myth would be surrounded and killed. So my suggestion is to again invite that Wuguicheng Garrison Commander to our Jialan City."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Long nodded: "If he's willing to come to Jialan City, I would even be willing to hand over the position of Jialan City Garrison Commander."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wen Tai hurriedly said: "Everyone, the Wuguicheng Garrison Commander absolutely will not come to Jialan City!"</p><p></p><p>He recalled Qi Yuan's sword strike that day, which had also expressed his attitude.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Qi Yuan was somewhat annoyed at him constantly urging him to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant fool!" an old man said sternly. "Does he think being a Terrestrial Myth means he can do whatever he wants?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a deep voice said: "A Terrestrial Myth indeed can do whatever they want. If what Liu Xian Tai says is true, if that Garrison Commander came to Jialan City, we would become a burden instead.</p><p></p><p>With that expert's strength, even if surrounded by Wu Tong, if he can't win, could Wu Tong stop him from leaving? Rather than worrying about Wuguicheng here, we should worry about how to protect ourselves in Jialan City after that expert leaves."</p><p></p><p>Everyone present hearing this strongly agreed.</p><p></p><p>Wuguicheng being unable to hold was already a fact.</p><p></p><p>That Wuguicheng Garrison Commander would certainly leave as well.</p><p></p><p>And what they needed to face would be Wu Tong's army.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on them would be much greater than before.</p><p></p><p>Jialan City Garrison Commander Dong Long stood on the city wall, gazing into the distance, his eyes profound: "Let's hope... that Mythical expert can heavily damage Wu Tong's army before leaving."</p><p></p><p>This way, Wu Tong wouldn't be able to organize his army to come to Jialan City so quickly, and Jialan City would have ample time to prepare.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Wen Tai, Zhao Ju, take some men and watch Wuguicheng from afar.</p><p></p><p>Any news from inside Wuguicheng, report back to Jialan immediately." Dong Long ordered.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to see was not news of Wuguicheng, but news of Wu Tong's army.</p><p></p><p>Wuguicheng's fate was already sealed.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to know the extent of damage to Wu Tong's army after Wuguicheng fell.</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir!" Liu Wen Tai and Zhao Ju accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wen Tai and Zhao Ju were hidden in the vast desert, concealing their forms.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, over a dozen cultivators similarly concealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>They were Jialan City's guerrilla reconnaissance soldiers, most skilled in concealment and speed.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ju hid in the sand, a carefree smile on his face: "That Wuguicheng Garrison Commander really loves to show off...</p><p></p><p>If it were me, facing Wu Tong's army, I'd definitely run away immediately.</p><p></p><p>But look at him, sitting alone on the city wall, facing thousands of troops, fearless in the face of danger. Although it's showing off, it's still very cool!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that Garrison Commander really isn't afraid?" Liu Wen Tai recalled Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That Garrison Commander wasn't at all like Zhao Ju described.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, when Wu Tong's army arrives, he'll definitely strike once then flee!" Zhao Ju said confidently.</p><p></p><p>If he had such strength, he'd definitely imitate that Garrison Commander too.</p><p></p><p>It may be dishonorable, but it would look really cool.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wen Tai gave Zhao Ju a look of disdain: "Don't use a petty person's heart to judge a gentleman's belly."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ju shrugged: "I never judge people by what they're thinking, only by what they do.</p><p></p><p>If he stays in Wuguicheng and damages Wu Tong's army, I'll admire him.</p><p></p><p>I may say he's showing off, but he really is cool. The only flaw is that Wuguicheng is about to fall."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ju's words carried regret.</p>

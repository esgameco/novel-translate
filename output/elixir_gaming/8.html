        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slowly walked through the Divine Light Sect, holding a kitchen knife.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, laughter and sweet nothings could occasionally be heard.</p><p></p><p>This immortal cultivation world was truly harmonious.</p><p></p><p>He led his pet and looked at the sky: "It's time to return to the mountain."</p><p></p><p>It was still early, so he could open the game jade slip and play a round.</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the Seven-Colored Peak, the night had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the peak, above the white jade palace, a crescent moon hung, and the cool moonlight cast a faint, graceful silhouette.</p><p></p><p>However, the silhouette only glanced at Qi Yuan briefly before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan averted his gaze and looked at Jiang Lingshu's thatched cottage, murmuring to himself: "If only I had those paralysis talismans, then even if an earthquake happened on the Blue Star, those houses wouldn't collapse."</p><p></p><p>After sighing, he led the kitchen knife back to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was empty, only waiting for Qi Yuan's footsteps.</p><p></p><p>He untied the rope from the knife's handle: "Now that you're home, you don't need to be tied up. As long as you don't destroy the house, no one will hit you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said as he caressed the small nicks on the knife, then entered the world of the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>However, when he was about to enter the game, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"She's there?"</p><p></p><p>When he obtained the game jade slip, Qi Yuan had treated it as a gaming device.</p><p></p><p>(PS: The protagonist has an abnormal mindset and behavior, neurotic.)</p><p></p><p>At the time, the game map had not yet been unlocked.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan had inexplicably added a friend, and entered the friend list.</p><p></p><p>That was the only friend he made after falling ill.</p><p></p><p>Since his illness, he had lived alone, with no one to communicate with.</p><p></p><p>The friend in the game had become his companion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also treated that person as a fellow gamer.</p><p></p><p>They often chatted about all sorts of topics, with the other person doing most of the talking.</p><p></p><p>However, the other person's speech was quite strange, occasionally mentioning words like "Imperial Guards" and "Prime Minister."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan guessed that the other person must be a wealthy young lady inheriting the family business, but not yet fully in control of the company.</p><p></p><p>They had talked a lot, and Qi Yuan had even said, "Let's team up and play together."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after the game map was refreshed, the friend list had disappeared, and he never saw the other person again, let alone team up.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the friend list, he pondered for a moment and sent a message: "Are you there?"</p><p></p><p>Since he had transmigrated to the immortal cultivation world, the other person might not be there.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mist shrouded the area, and the ink painting on the screen seemed to be infected, with long cracks appearing.</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p></p><p>A cold and majestic voice came, and the palace maids in attendance quickly bowed and left.</p><p></p><p>After the maids left, the beautiful face of the Empress of the Southern Qin Kingdom showed a weary expression.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, the Demon Tribe invaded. Her father, the Emperor, was killed in battle. She became the Empress of the Southern Qin Kingdom at the age of 7.</p><p></p><p>The vast empire now rested entirely on her shoulders.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tribe's invasion, the coveting of neighboring kingdoms, and the disloyalty of court officials - she had struggled for ten years.</p><p></p><p>Now, she could barely maintain the balance of the empire. The burden on her shoulders was growing heavier and heavier.</p><p></p><p>She was even in constant danger of losing her life.</p><p></p><p>Especially recently, the Prime Minister Sima Ting had almost openly colluded with the Northern Huan Kingdom, making her situation even more precarious.</p><p></p><p>Three days ago, her most trusted Aunt Qin, a King-level expert, was attacked by a group of black-clad assassins and severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Although the assassins' origins were well hidden, everyone in the court knew who had sent them.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the enemy, yet being powerless to do anything - this feeling was unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>She stood in front of the screen, her azure gown simple yet elegant, the hem embroidered with golden phoenixes. Her slender waist was wrapped in a white jade belt.</p><p></p><p>As the belt was untied and the garment fell away, her flawless, jade-like skin was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The empress's age was not great, but her figure was very proud, forming a sharp contrast with her slender waist that could be grasped by one hand.</p><p></p><p>As she entered the bathtub, her snow-white and exquisite shoulders floated on the surface of the water. Through the water that was like white broth, one could almost see her pearly white skin.</p><p></p><p>The empress closed her eyes, and the fatigue on her body gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a flash of red light suddenly appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>A gleam of joy flashed in Jinli's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>What was placed on the table was the rare and precious Linglong Jade Tide.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that this treasure was a pair. Whoever obtained this treasure could communicate with each other through it.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, this kind of treasure was very famous. Unfortunately, as the times changed, treasures that could transmit messages over long distances were no longer rare.</p><p></p><p>The Linglong Jade Tide had greatly depreciated in value and was placed in the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>A year ago, Jinli went to the imperial treasury and saw the Linglong Jade Tide, so she took it out casually.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, she got to know an interesting person through the Linglong Jade Tide.</p><p></p><p>That person was named Qi Yuan, who spoke freely and always said things she didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Since the two were not acquainted and seemed to be separated by mountains and rivers, she could freely express her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the empress, she could not let others see her weakness.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, half a year ago, for some unknown reason, Qi Yuan disappeared without a trace. She was then somewhat disappointed and anxious.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the other party was still there.</p><p></p><p>The stone in her heart fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>She picked up the Linglong Jade Tide and held it tightly, looking at the message on it, and quickly replied, "Here."</p><p></p><p>After sending the message, Jinli thought for a moment and asked, "Where have you been these days? You've been gone for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Last time, I was going to invite you to go grind monsters, but unexpectedly, I suddenly entered the game map and couldn't contact the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"That should be a very dangerous place, right?" Jinli asked.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, Qi Yuan was a free and easy monster hunter. What he said about grinding monsters and the game map was about hunting demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan shrugged, "We players are the fourth calamity, what's so dangerous about it? Those monsters are just our experience packages."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the familiar tone and response, Jinli's heart calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Every time she talked with Qi Yuan about heaven and earth, even though Qi Yuan said nonsensical things, she still felt a sense of peace in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"This time you were gone, I grinded monsters alone for half a year to finish. Do you want to team up with me? A male-female duo, the work won't be tiring. If it's the two of us, we'll definitely level up to 100 quickly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jinli replied, "I have some things to do at home and can't leave."</p><p></p><p>"Are you that busy? Don't even have time to play games. Sigh, you rich and beautiful ladies are so hardworking, how can we poor people cope?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jinli couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>"How about you come and grind monsters with me now? I just changed the map, and there are a lot of monsters here. I need the support of the beautiful Lady Jinli," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party's relaxed tone, Jinli knew that the other party was not in danger.</p><p></p><p>She curved her lips into a smile: "I'm not very convenient right now."</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? Not convenient, you're not working overtime, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm... bathing," Jinli hesitated for a moment before sending the message.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan saw this and paused.</p><p></p><p>His gaze remained calm: "Then how about we make an appointment after you finish bathing?"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Jinli gave a wry smile: "I can't come."</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, she asked, "Where are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I was previously in Xuanyuan Forbidden, and now I'm on my way to Yiguan Forbidden," Qi Yuan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>He was in the game's teleportation array, preparing to teleport to the next map.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Forbidden? Yiguan Forbidden?" Jinli was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Weren't those the four great forbidden lands?</p><p></p><p>The rumors said that even king-level experts would be bloodied to death if they entered, and even emperor-level experts might perish.</p><p></p><p>No, Xuanyuan Forbidden, even an emperor-level expert could not enter.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

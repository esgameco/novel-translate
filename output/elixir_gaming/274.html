        <h1>Chapter 274</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is... Senior Brother..."</p><p></p><p>The speaker's nickname was surprisingly Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>She knew this was her Senior Brother Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, seeing the content above, she gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Neglected by Senior Sister Xianxian, exchanged for a jade-level technique, accidentally discovered by busty junior sister. </p><p></p><p>Junior sister secretly flirting? Serving tea and pouring water? Giving back rubs and shoulder massages?"</p><p></p><p>Reading the text above, Jiang Lingsu bit her pearly teeth. She looked down, her face slightly red.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what are you doing?!"</p><p></p><p>She questioned him angrily through the Spirit Flower Society jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a message came from the other end of the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"I'm attending a funeral banquet. Sigh, a close relative of mine passed away. I'm eating at their funeral banquet."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was actually eating at the Chen family's banquet in Maple City.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Wind Thunder Valley, he saw Chen Xiyu still waiting for him outside.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he couldn't be bothered to deal with it. </p><p></p><p>But then he remembered that his corpse wasn't even cold yet, and he hadn't even eaten at his own funeral banquet.</p><p></p><p>So he accepted Chen Xiyu's invitation and had the Chen family prepare a banquet for him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was cheerfully eating at his own funeral banquet.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, hearing Senior Brother's reply, Jiang Lingsu's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>Her previous resentment disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that Senior Brother's relative in the mortal world had passed away? But she had never heard Senior Brother talk about his background.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly comforted him: "Senior Brother, don't be too sad. You still have Seven-Colored Peak, and you still have your junior sister. </p><p></p><p>Where are you now? Should I come over to see you?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually I wasn't sad at all originally, but hearing what you said, I feel like I should be a bit sad.</p><p></p><p>Alas, Qi Yuan, you died so tragically.</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister, eat more today, to add more liveliness to my funeral banquet."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the more people who come to eat at the funeral banquet, the more illustrious the deceased was in life.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan also recommended his junior sister to eat.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?!" Jiang Lingsu was stunned for a moment, feeling blood rush to her head and a sharp pain in her chest. "What have you done to Senior Brother? If anything happens to him, I, Jiang Lingsu, will not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>Because... she saw "eating at Qi Yuan's funeral banquet".</p><p></p><p>She was afraid Senior Brother had met with misfortune, and now it was some villain on the other end.</p><p></p><p>"I am your Senior Brother. Junior Sister, don't overthink it," Qi Yuan also understood Jiang Lingsu's meaning. He felt warmth in his heart - there was still someone in this world who cared about him. "The funeral banquet I'm eating at is for the me in the game. </p><p></p><p>Alas, he died young, so tragically."</p><p></p><p>"Game?" Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu was stunned for a moment. That feeling of the sky falling and earth shattering instantly disappeared. She clutched her chest, a smile appearing in her eyes, though it was a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>So the funeral banquet was for a game character?</p><p></p><p>This way of speaking was very much like Senior Brother's style.</p><p></p><p>The worry in her heart disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Then anger arose.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly remembered why she had looked for Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what did you mean by what you said in the Spirit Flower Society? The busty junior sister secretly flirting with you??"</p><p></p><p>She recalled that day when she had just been treated by Senior Brother and came out of the bath wrapped in a thin gauze. Due to the treatment, she was naturally dressed lightly. The blue chest wrap, even though tightly bound, only covered two-thirds of her snow-white globes. When she walked, they trembled and those two full mounds seemed about to break free.</p><p></p><p>So Senior Brother must have used "busty junior sister" to describe her, Jiang Lingsu thought.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, it was all made up by me," Qi Yuan answered honestly. "Although when describing the junior sister, I borrowed part of your character setting, I definitely didn't plagiarize you!</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister, if you want to pursue this, I'm willing to pay you... 300 spirit stones in copyright fees!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a matter of spirit stones?" Jiang Lingsu really wanted to kick Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"You misunderstood. It's not 300 in total, it's 300 per month!" Qi Yuan gave himself a thumbs up for his cleverness, because he was only going to be a shill for one month.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Jiang Lingsu snorted coldly, then continued sending messages. "I know you made up so much just to get people to support you. That's fine, but... when you describe that busty junior sister again, you need to portray her in a more positive light!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, no problem!" Qi Yuan quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>This was a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"When I return to Seven-Colored Peak, I'll definitely return the spirit stones to you.</p><p></p><p>By the way Junior Sister, if you're not doing well during the days I'm gone, you can go stay in my room."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister's house wasn't as good as his.</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister had a wooden house, while his was a cement bungalow, two levels higher than Junior Sister's.</p><p></p><p>Happiness comes from comparison.</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister originally slept in a wooden house and may not have felt anything.</p><p></p><p>But seeing a cement bungalow next to the wooden house, she would naturally feel a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>If you've never seen sunlight, you can naturally endure darkness.</p><p></p><p>After seeing his cement bungalow, how could Junior Sister still be content living in a wooden house? So he made another high EQ move by inviting Junior Sister to stay in his cement bungalow.</p><p></p><p>This would also serve as compensation for just now "deceiving" Junior Sister.</p><p></p><p>However, his words took on a different meaning in Jiang Lingsu's ears.</p><p></p><p>Was Senior Brother saying she... was lovesick?!</p><p></p><p>"You're the one not doing well. Why would I want to stay in your house? Do you think I miss you that much? To reminisce by looking at your things? Am I, Jiang Lingsu, that kind of person?!" At this moment, Jiang Lingsu was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, jumping up and down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned. He hadn't expected his high EQ move to provoke such a big reaction from Junior Sister.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Junior Sister's EQ was a bit low and couldn't understand his high EQ.</p><p></p><p>Is this what they call "a summer insect cannot discuss ice"?</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, whether you miss me or not, Senior Brother will pay you those 300 spirit stones. Don't worry, you won't be short-changed." Qi Yuan responded with high EQ.</p><p></p><p>Junior Sister was angry, obviously thinking he might not want to pay the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan had just emptied out Dark Sun's headquarters, did he lack those 300 spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>He didn't.</p><p></p><p>"..." Seeing this, Jiang Lingsu was speechless. After a long while, she finally said, "Senior Brother, have you uploaded the technique I gave you to the Spirit Flower Society?"</p><p></p><p>A technique could only be uploaded once.</p><p></p><p>If Senior Brother had uploaded it, she wouldn't be able to upload it.</p><p></p><p>"No, you can upload it as you like." Qi Yuan thought for a moment, then immediately used the jade slip of the Spirit Flower Society's president to give Junior Sister special permissions.</p><p></p><p>Even if she uploaded techniques that had already been uploaded, her personal progress bar would still advance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the overall progress wouldn't change.</p><p></p><p>After all, the techniques Junior Sister gave him had long been uploaded to the Spirit Flower Society's headquarters jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was his dear junior sister, so he definitely had to give her special treatment.</p><p></p><p>"That's good!" Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu was very happy. Obviously she planned to upload the technique to get rewards.</p><p></p><p>This sense of achievement was addictive.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, Jiang Lingsu said, "By the way Senior Brother, my father will probably come to Seven-Colored Peak in a while.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother, if you don't have any urgent matters, don't come back for now."</p><p></p><p>A father knows his daughter best.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu didn't need to think with her brain, she could think with her chest and know her father's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He definitely thought she had been captivated by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She found it incomprehensible and laughable.</p><p></p><p>Was she the type of person... who would simply fall in love so easily?</p><p></p><p>Was she the "love-struck fool" Senior Brother talked about?</p><p></p><p>Obviously not.</p><p></p><p>She had explained to her father several times, and after being unable to explain clearly, she couldn't be bothered to explain anymore.</p><p></p><p>But her father coming here was</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What purpose? How could she not understand? "Huh? Your father is coming? What does that have to do with whether I go back or not? How strange, your sister came a while ago, now your father is coming. Don't tell me your grandmother will be coming in a while too? It's such a long journey, why is your father traveling all this way? You all must be so tired from constantly traveling. I suggest your whole Jiang family just move near Shenguang Sect instead," Qi Yuan said considerately. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the Jiang family members miss their junior sister, they'll keep coming here, and the airfare alone would be a huge expense.</p><p></p><p>To save on costs, they might as well move the whole family over.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was slightly stunned, her emotions somewhat complex: "Senior brother, do you really want the Jiang family to move here?"</p><p></p><p>Of course she was just asking, it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother saying this meant he was reluctant to let his adorable junior sister go back.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so, it would save a lot on travel costs!" Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>After chatting casually with Jiang Lingsu for a bit more, junior sister finally asked Qi Yuan to lend her some power.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan assisted her, the two ended their conversation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Maple Leaf City, Qi Yuan was eating meat in large bites.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, the head of the Chen family, an old man in his fifties, had a humble expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The other diners also stared at Qi Yuan with curious and reverent looks.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was a legendary Foundation Establishment elder, an immortal among immortals.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xiyu sat next to Qi Yuan, graceful and gentle.</p><p></p><p>Her cousin lowered her head, her eyes filled with deep regret.</p><p></p><p>She never imagined Chen Xiyu would actually obtain an immortal destiny.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was with a flying Foundation Establishment elder, which made her extremely jealous.</p><p></p><p>But even if she was jealous, she didn't dare show it, otherwise what awaited her might be death.</p><p></p><p>Even the ruler of the Huan Kingdom had to respect a Foundation Establishment elder, let alone the small Chen family.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ate at the banquet, relaxed and casual, occasionally paying attention to the content in the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>Due to Qi Yuan's promotion, the most discussed topic in the Divine Flower Society forum now was about cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan read with great interest.</p><p></p><p>Because every so often, he could acquire a large number of techniques.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere during the meal was also quite lively.</p><p></p><p>After all, as an immortal lord appearing in Maple Leaf City, these mortals were both in awe and fawning, hoping to obtain immortal destiny from the immortal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally couldn't be bothered with all this.</p><p></p><p>After all, besides Chen Xiyu, he wasn't familiar with anyone else.</p><p></p><p>If these people weren't here to attend his banquet, he wouldn't even interact much, since he had mild social anxiety and didn't like communicating with strangers.</p><p></p><p>When the meal was finished, Qi Yuan prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Chen family head stood up and said respectfully: "Daoist Master, Chen has prepared some humble gifts..."</p><p></p><p>In his view, Qi Yuan definitely didn't come here just to eat, but naturally to receive more tributes.</p><p></p><p>He was also prepared to have his servants bring out the gifts.</p><p></p><p>The wooden box was opened, and many gold and silver treasures once again came into Qi Yuan's view.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family head's body trembled slightly, his breathing a bit rapid, afraid that this Daoist would look down on these tributes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze swept over these worldly gold and silver treasures, and he couldn't help but yawn.</p><p></p><p>However, when his eyes fell on an ancient book, he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a book fell into his sight.</p><p></p><p>On this old and yellowed ancient book were written the four characters "Eagle Claw Secret Manual".</p><p></p><p>"This is a martial arts manual treasured by my family. The guards practice some hand and foot techniques," the Chen family head quickly answered respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>After entering Shenguang Sect, to be honest, he rarely entered the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Even when he did enter the mortal world, he seldom stayed for long.</p><p></p><p>He had heard rumors that martial arts existed in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how strong martial arts were, they were just fists and kicks, unable to defeat even a Qi Condensation first level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So he hadn't paid attention to martial arts, nor had he taken any martial arts manuals.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the first time he saw a martial arts manual, he suddenly discovered something he had previously overlooked.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts manual was indeed shallow and ordinary, but... if Qi Yuan fully absorbed and digested this martial arts manual, what he would gain was no less than a mid-grade immortal cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>This was interesting, and also slightly surprised Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any more martial arts manuals like this? I'm somewhat interested," Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see more, afraid this one was an exception.</p><p></p><p>"Chen's family has more than a dozen, I'll have them brought to the Daoist Master right away." The Chen family head gave orders.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a butler-like person hurriedly left and soon returned carrying thirteen similar martial arts manuals and mental cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Qi Yuan's hand, these martial arts manuals all entered his sight.</p><p></p><p>The loading of these martial arts techniques was all very shallow, with the more advanced ones only practicing some moves and strength.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan found that their effect on him was actually comparable to ordinary immortal cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, very interesting."</p><p></p><p>This discovery was beyond Qi Yuan's expectations and made him quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand great Daos, all roads lead to Rome?</p><p></p><p>He wondered in his heart, making wild guesses.</p><p></p><p>Is it possible that all the immortal cultivation techniques in the Canglang Realm, and even martial arts manuals... even if created by a weak person, were likely influenced by the Heavenly Dao, being part of this world's Heavenly Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Dao rules were oxygen elements, then all techniques, martial arts or immortal cultivation methods would be oxides.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan was doing was extracting the oxygen from them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what he extracted might not be Heavenly Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>"But why can't the Qi Yuan Scripture be created using techniques from other worlds?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... because I haven't left this world yet? Different worlds, different rules. Even the Blood Sun Great Saint's performance in the Mortal Heart Realm seemed inferior to outside the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>If I continue to use Canglang Realm's rules to compile the Qi Yuan Scripture, wouldn't that mean that one day I would also be trapped in the Canglang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>He never expected to gain such insights from casually attending a banquet in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>He also thought of many things.</p><p></p><p>Now to continue writing the scripture, he indeed needed to keep collecting immortal cultivation techniques and methods from the Canglang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he could no longer proceed step by step as before.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>About a few breaths of time passed, and a Nascent Soul cultivator stood beside Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>This Nascent Soul cultivator was the Divine Flower Society Nascent Soul cultivator Qi Yuan had encountered on his way here.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the Blood Robed Sword Immortal's post on the Divine Flower Society forum and was shocked, so he came to this Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at this Nascent Soul cultivator: "You've come at the right time. Help me do something, and I'll increase your progress bar by 80%."</p><p></p><p>An excited expression appeared on the Nascent Soul cultivator's face.</p><p></p><p>It was his honor to do something for a senior like the Blood Robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Please instruct me, senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Help me collect martial arts from the mortal world, the more the better. Oh, and be gentle in your methods, don't cause too much disturbance."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He was lawful good after all, a very kind person.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

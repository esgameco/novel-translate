        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards the source of the voice, only to feel a sense of sharpness.</p><p></p><p>He looked closely, but what he saw was a kind-looking old man.</p><p></p><p>However, this old man gave Qi Yuan a strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>It was as if... he was not a living person.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of vigilance appeared in his eyes, and he protected the little bride behind him, holding a long sword, facing the old man.</p><p></p><p>He spoke: "You are a demonic calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan realized that the old man's body inside was empty, the whole person was actually just a human skin.</p><p></p><p>The old man, seeing this, still had a kind smile on his face: "This old man can be considered a demonic calamity, but not quite."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully examined the old man again.</p><p></p><p>He felt that there was a strong metallic aura around the old man.</p><p></p><p>He formed a conjecture in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The old man then said: "This old man's name in life has long been forgotten.</p><p></p><p>After being devoured by an evil entity from the outer realms, this old man has died, leaving only a human skin in this world.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Five Elements Forbidden Land, this old man obtained a thread of life.</p><p></p><p>Now, this old man is called Jin Zu, this old man is neither human nor non-human, if you ask about life and death, he is already dead."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jin Zu and understood.</p><p></p><p>The current Jin Zu was merely a vessel for a metallic rule.</p><p></p><p>He even lacked a soul.</p><p></p><p>It was just a persistent will.</p><p></p><p>So, he was no different from being dead.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want me to do?" Qi Yuan asked, his vigilance not relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"The Esteemed One of the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land should have invited the Master of the Clothing Division to participate in the Demon Slaying Assembly three hundred years from now.</p><p></p><p>Since we are all living beings of the Wangyue Continent, we should unite against the common enemy and slay the evil entities from the outer realms, otherwise, I fear we will end up like my former self, dying and leaving only a human skin behind." Jin Zu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jin Zu, and although he was just a human skin, he did not find him creepy, but rather felt that he was much more comfortable than the senior disciples of the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The evil entities from the outer realms, I must slay them!" Qi Yuan's attitude was resolute.</p><p></p><p>The big boss must be defeated.</p><p></p><p>His Heavenly Dao foundation was based on the big boss.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jin Zu's kind expression became even more pronounced: "Now that the Master of the Clothing Division has come to the Five Elements Forbidden Land, we are willing to open up the Five Elements Training Ground.</p><p></p><p>In the Five Elements Training Ground, there are the energies of the Five Elements, which can be cultivated to strengthen oneself and improve one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In our Five Elements Forbidden Land, there are many young geniuses who are cultivating there.</p><p></p><p>Over the past ten thousand years, there have been those who have broken through to the Heavenly Realm, and even... the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>There are still three hundred years until the Demon Slaying Assembly.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Clothing Division can enter the Five Elements Training Ground and cultivate for a hundred years, and your cultivation may improve."</p><p></p><p>"Are there any monsters inside?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Jin Zu was momentarily stunned, but still said, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"No problem." If there are monsters, he can grind levels.</p><p></p><p>Jin Zu's smile remained on his face: "Master of the Clothing Division, please come with this old man."</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan did not move his feet, but looked at Jin Zu: "I have another purpose for coming to the Five Elements Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land is different from the Clothing Forbidden Land and the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>In other forbidden lands, one can control the forbidden land by simply grinding monsters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Clothing Forbidden Land has some exceptions, requiring one to marry the little bride.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land seems to have many strong cultivators lurking, not just the clothing monsters, and it doesn't seem like they can all be killed, and even if they are killed, there may not be any experience gained.</p><p></p><p>How can I take full control? "The Master of the Clothing Division, please speak."  Jin Zu's attitude was kind.</p><p></p><p>"I want to completely control the Five Elements Forbidden Land, is there any way to do so?" Qi Yuan looked at Jin Zu.</p><p></p><p>Jin Zu heard this and was somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this purpose had caught him by surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet responded.</p><p></p><p>A dissatisfied voice came from behind, belonging to a woman dressed in green, who looked delicate and petite, like a short but fierce postgraduate student.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her face was filled with anger: "Well, you, the Lord of the Clothing Department, have come to our Five Elements Forbidden Land! Do you think you can control the Five Elements Forbidden Land? Do you understand what that means? </p><p></p><p>I'm afraid you might be a spy sent by the Demonic Cultivators from the Outer Realm, otherwise how could you suddenly appear here!"</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the presence of Elder Jin, the green-clad woman might have jumped up and slapped Qi Yuan on the head.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin looked at the young woman and smiled indulgently: "Little Green, don't be rude to our guest."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Qi Yuan: "The Lord of the Clothing Department wanting to control the Five Elements Forbidden Land is indeed quite difficult. </p><p></p><p>It depends on how talented you are. </p><p></p><p>If the Lord of the Clothing Department can display unparalleled talent in the Five Elements Tempering Ground, then controlling the Five Elements Forbidden Land would not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked behind Elder Jin, his gaze seemingly penetrating the Five Elements Forbidden Land, and he saw many coffins, as well as many dormant auras.</p><p></p><p>Each one was above the 90th level.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were some that exceeded the Ugly Clothing Demon Emperor, likely at the 95th level or above.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that you are not the strongest one within the Five Elements Forbidden Land. Can you decide to hand the Five Elements Forbidden Land over to me?"</p><p></p><p>"This old man can certainly make that decision!" Elder Jin said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Good, it's a deal then." Qi Yuan responded, "It seems it won't be long before I can clear the Five Elements Forbidden Land."</p><p></p><p>The green-clad woman looked at Qi Yuan with discontent, then turned to Elder Jin, transmitting a message: "Grandpa Jin, how could you make such an agreement with him!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin chuckled without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Under Elder Jin's guidance, the group entered the depths of the Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Qi Yuan kept observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Forbidden Land indeed had no other monsters, but there were many natural disasters and calamities, all extremely perilous.</p><p></p><p>Creatures at the 50th or 60th level who rashly entered would have a high probability of perishing.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour passed, and Elder Jin led the group to a valley.</p><p></p><p>In the valley, there were more than 70 coffins.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that powerful beings were slumbering within these coffins.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin said: "Presently, the strongest cultivators on the Wangyue Continent have gathered in the Five Elements Forbidden Land and the Yin-Yang Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>They are in hibernation in the coffins, cultivating.</p><p></p><p>When the Demon-Slaying Assembly begins, they will emerge from their coffins.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Lord of the Clothing Department must join them in eradicating the Demonic Cultivators from the Outer Realm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not respond upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He could not wait for three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>How old was he now?</p><p></p><p>In three hundred years, even an entire dynasty could fall.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin continued talking to himself, then walked up to a coffin and lightly knocked on it.</p><p></p><p>But the coffin did not respond.</p><p></p><p>He knocked a few more times, but the coffin still did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin wore a puzzled expression: "Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the neighboring coffin suddenly opened, and a rough-looking, unrestrained man sat up: "Jin, your memory must be as poor as your previous incarnation's, you can't even knock on the right coffin!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the rough man, Elder Jin's face showed a trace of embarrassment: "Ahem, my apologies."</p><p></p><p>The rough man also looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes seemingly evaluating him: "Not bad, with the help of the Empress of the Clothing Sect, you are a promising seedling.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that I expended my primordial essence to open the Five Elements Tempering Ground for you.</p><p></p><p>I hope that in three hundred years, you will become a great figure!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

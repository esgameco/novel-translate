        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Talents gathered, banquets were endless, with exquisite delicacies and fine wines, as cups were raised in toasts.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu stood among the crowd, full of vigor and confidence. </p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen stood beside him, holding a wine cup, his mind unsettled.</p><p></p><p>He was still pondering the strange feeling from that day.</p><p></p><p>The True Solar Fire was his greatest stroke of luck, and also his trump card.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the True Solar Fire, he could have entered the top ten of the Eastern Lands Talent Rankings, but in order to conceal his abilities and not overshadow Huang Tu, he ranked behind Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>The True Solar Fire was incredibly powerful, and also most sensitive to treasures related to the sun.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw that person, he felt that person was... like a blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>The True Solar Fire within him kept jumping, as if... it had seen its father.</p><p></p><p>"Master Huang Tu's techniques are becoming more and more profound. In this Eastern Lands Talent Battle, he has a chance to enter the top fifteen, or even the top ten," someone flattered Huang Tu at the banquet.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tu accepted the flattery with an arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone else said: "What a pity, if Master Huang Tu had comprehended Xu Tongchen's True Solar Fire, I'm afraid Master Huang Tu would rank in the top three of the Eastern Lands Talent Rankings!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Zheng Fangxing, ranked 700th on the Eastern Lands Talent Rankings.</p><p></p><p>His sect had long-standing grievances with the Seven Words Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, speaking like this was blatantly sowing discord.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the arrogant Huang Tu didn't bother to conceal anything, and glanced at Xu Tongchen: "Indeed a pity."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Tongchen felt stifled and angry, but couldn't retaliate, and could only laugh awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>The tyranny of the Palace of Light was ingrained in their bones, unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Fangxing continued: "That Blood-Robed Sword Saint from this Divine Flower Meeting keeps provoking the Palace of Light. </p><p></p><p>My master Mo Ku has long been disgusted by the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's face, and has already gone to Elder Qian Yuan's Bright King Palace to jointly face the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>However... some people, living in Cuiyun Prefecture, sharing the same roots, are unable to unite against a common enemy with Cuiyun Prefecture, and have an ambiguous relationship with that Blood-Robed Sword Saint."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Fangxing was almost directly pointing at the Seven Words Sect.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Elder Qian Yuan had arranged a duel with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion forces near the Bright King Palace, an outpost of the Palace of Light, all received messages to go watch the battle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was called watching the battle, but was actually to show support.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Fangxing's master Mo Ku got the news and went early.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen's master Xu Yeli, however, made excuses not to go.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid some people are cowards, afraid of the Blood-Robed Sword Saint," Zheng Fangxing kept instigating.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a cultivator from a mere hundred countries, who luckily broke through to the Purple Mansion realm, actually dares to provoke the Palace of Light, truly seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qian Yuan has set up an array at the Bright King Palace. I bet that Blood-Robed Sword Saint won't dare to come at all, and will hide in the hundred countries!"</p><p></p><p>The young talents in the palace praised the Palace of Light to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, they spoke with mockery.</p><p></p><p>There may well be Purple Mansion cultivators in their sects, and mostly veteran Purple Mansion cultivators at that.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the Palace of Light, they can only be dogs.</p><p></p><p>As a result, a Blood-Robed Sword Saint provoking the Palace of Light was truly seeking death.</p><p></p><p>"After the Talent Battle ends, we'll probably get news of the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's execution," a young cultivator said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Tu also nodded: "The Blood-Robed Sword Saint is not to be feared, he can only use some dirty tricks."</p><p></p><p>These past two days, jade slips recording the Divine Infant Elder of the Palace of Light being struck by heavenly punishment have been spreading.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, many people were secretly condemning the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Palace of Light being so tyrannical, many low-level cultivators have long harbored resentment.</p><p></p><p>But condemnation is just condemnation, it can't really hurt the Palace of Light's foundations.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Palace of Light has dozens of Purple Mansion cultivators, and even has incomplete Yin Spirit magical treasures. This means that even if the low-level cultivators united, they couldn't shake the Palace of Light's position.</p><p></p><p>The talents at the banquet all came from noble backgrounds, and almost none of them took the voices of those low-level cultivators to heart.</p><p></p><p>The banquet continued to heat up. With Zheng Fangxing's subtle instigation, almost everyone intentionally or unintentionally cold-shouldered Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen sat alone in a corner, drinking sullenly. He thought of the man he saw that day.</p><p></p><p>He had already secretly sent people to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Probably, he would get news soon.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the cave dwelling, Qi Yuan continued to digest some techniques his junior sister obtained from Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the progress was extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rubbed his forehead and looked at Little Jia sleeping on the table beside him, his eyes revealing a tender expression.</p><p></p><p>"It should be fermented enough by now. Later I'll go to the Bright King Palace to see my heart-stirring first love," Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sound suddenly came from outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to a doorbell on Earth.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked through the formation and saw a young man.</p><p></p><p>The cave dwelling door opened, and Qi Yuan looked at the young man calmly and said, "What business do you have with me?"</p><p></p><p>"I am Xu Tongchen of the Seven Words Sect. I caught a glimpse of you three days ago.</p><p></p><p>I apologize for this sudden visit, please don't take offense." Xu Tongchen's attitude was extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>He very much wanted to understand what exactly caused the True Solar Fire's strange reaction.</p><p></p><p>Now, the closer he got to this young man, the stronger the True Solar Fire's anomaly became.</p><p></p><p>His whole body started to feel hot, and his gaze towards Qi Yuan unconsciously became fervent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned: "Speak plainly."</p><p></p><p>"When I formed my Golden Core, I was fortunate enough to condense a strand of True Solar Fire..."</p><p></p><p>"True Solar Fire?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a good thing.</p><p></p><p>A Golden Core cultivator with True Solar Fire could use it to resist the divine abilities of Divine Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As expected of a big city, you could randomly encounter a Golden Core cultivator capable of killing a Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>"When I saw you, my True Solar Fire kept jumping, as if..." Xu Tongchen couldn't say the words that followed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan glanced at Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>[This is an ordinary cultivator who became somewhat extraordinary after condensing True Solar Fire.</p><p></p><p>The True Solar Fire sees you as its father.]</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Qi Yuan looked at the sky, "I'm very busy right now, in a hurry to go kill someone. After I finish killing, we can talk more."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan disappeared without waiting for Xu Tongchen's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind a dumbfounded Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to call out to Qi Yuan, but Qi Yuan's figure had already vanished.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely conflicted, but finally decided to wait here for a while.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding the reason made him feel like ants were crawling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a figure in a blood-colored robe streaked across like a blood rainbow, moving ostentatiously through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, a clear voice rang out from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Palace of Light has committed numerous evils and suffered heavenly punishment!"</p><p></p><p>"I, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, will stand up for all those who suffer injustice in the world, and vow to exterminate the Palace of Light!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was loud and far-reaching, spreading across the world.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that blood rainbow was too fast, they couldn't see it at all.</p><p></p><p>They could only hear that bright and resonant shout.</p><p></p><p>Some people were excited, some were uneasy, and some were helpless.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan flew quickly towards the Bright King Palace, his speed extremely fast, as if he was going to meet a lover.</p><p></p><p>However, this time he wasn't meeting a lover, but his first love.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an old voice transmitted: "Blood-Robed Sword Saint, please wait."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped and landed on a hill.</p><p></p><p>"What is it, do you have business with me?" Qi Yuan looked at the Purple Mansion cultivator completely shrouded in a black robe. He didn't smell any hostility or killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Blood-Robed Sword Saint, the Palace of Light has set up an ambush at the Bright King Palace. Besides three Purple Mansion cultivators, two nearby Purple Mansion cultivators have also gone there.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian Yuan is even at the middle stage of Purple Mansion, and he has a treasure bestowed by the Great Palace Master in his hand.</p><p></p><p>If you go this time, you'll have a 90% chance of death. Why not... retreat? They have too many Purple Mansion cultivators. It would be better to harass their Divine Infant officials!" The black-robed cultivator spoke quickly, with a trace of worry in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the black-robed cultivator: "What, do you have a grudge against the Palace of Light?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator paused, his eyes desolate.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator was none other than Xu Yeli.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, Qian Yuan forced his disciple to serve Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>That was bad enough.</p><p></p><p>Later, he received news that the Great Palace Master of the Palace of Light went to the Divine Flower Meeting this time not only for the Blood-Robed Sword Saint's matter, but also to borrow a supreme treasure... the Divine Form Trapping Fire Cover.</p><p></p><p>After the Eastern Lands Talent Battle ends, that Great Palace Master will likely use this supreme treasure to transfer the True Solar Fire in his disciple Xu Tongchen's body to Huang Tu.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Seven Words Sect was facing its greatest crisis.</p><p></p><p>"A grudge, a deep blood feud!" Xu Yeli nodded vigorously, "Why don't you form an alliance with me, and we'll roam together, pressuring the Palace of Light, making them wary! We are weak on our own, we can't confront the Palace of Light head-on!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli earnestly persuaded.</p><p></p><p>He valued this fellow cultivator, the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, quite highly. If the two of them united, they could cause no small crisis for the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Palace of Light would become wary because of this, and not make a move against his disciple Xu Tongchen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Xu Yeli thoughtfully: "Cooperation... indeed possible."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Xu Yeli was a bit excited. Although cooperating would still be like eggs hitting stone compared to the Palace of Light, it was better than fighting alone.</p><p></p><p>"This time as I go to the Bright King Palace, I happen to be lacking... someone to play the suona.</p><p></p><p>As I battle the Purple Mansion cultivators of the Palace of Light, how about you play music for me on the side?</p><p></p><p>It's more interesting to kill people with someone playing music." Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He felt like</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Wind Realm's orchestra.</p><p></p><p>"..." Xu Yeli was completely dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>He understood every word the Blood-Robed Sword Saint said, but why did it sound so inconceivable?</p><p></p><p>Killing? Playing music?</p><p></p><p>What was this?</p><p></p><p>"You still want to go to Mingwang Palace?" Xu Yeli said.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I am imbued with great righteousness, and heaven's mandate is with me. Now, I am that great magician Liu Xiu. Those who oppose me are merely seeking death!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli was speechless. </p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that communicating with this Purple Mansion cultivator across from him would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>It seemed... there was something wrong with his head.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, truly geniuses are always lonely," Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh. "But time will prove everything. How about this - if I sweep through Mingwang Palace today, from now on whenever I campaign against Guangming Palace, you can play music behind me. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Although one Purple Mansion cultivator playing music couldn't compare to three hundred or three thousand, this was a special situation, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli was silent, not knowing what to say. </p><p></p><p>He had come to say that Mingwang Palace was very dangerous and not to go.</p><p></p><p>How did it turn into a bet... to play music for the other person?</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Blood-Robed Sword Saint and finally gritted his teeth: "If you can eliminate Qian Yuan, this old man will play music for you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at Xu Yeli, a smile appearing on his face: "Remember to await my good news."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yeli stood there in his black robe, speechless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Either... he's a madman, or... he has some backing."</p><p></p><p>But he simply couldn't understand what the other's backing could be. Guangming Palace had initiated the Hundred Nations Blood War with the tacit approval of those big figures.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At Mingwang Palace, a solemn atmosphere prevailed.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds gathered for thousands of miles, as if a storm was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan looked at the scene in the jade slip, a grave expression in his eyes: "Heavenly thunder..."</p><p></p><p>All heavenly thunder was related to taboos.</p><p></p><p>Now, heavenly thunder had struck the ground, and a divine infant had perished.</p><p></p><p>The scene was extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>"This Seven Desires Demon Lord must have some secret!" A flash of sharpness appeared in the eyes of the red-bearded old man.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, once the Blood-Robed Sword Saint falls, this old man will personally go to the Hundred Nations territory to see exactly what secret it is!" Black Rope spoke, as if he had already claimed that secret for himself.</p><p></p><p>"These Divine Flower Society people are truly detestable. Many are secretly supporting that Blood-Robed Sword Saint!" Mo Ku spoke. He also held a Divine Flower Society jade slip in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He could also be considered a member of the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>"After we execute the Blood-Robed Sword Saint, I'll have to trouble Friend Mo Ku to announce this matter in the Divine Flower Society's discussion area, to clear Guangming Palace's name," Elder Qian Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care at all about the opinions of those ordinary members of the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>What mattered was the opinion of the Divine Flower Society's Eastern Earth Branch Master.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Palace Master had already gone to pay respects, and the matter would soon have a result.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate to this level yet still be so unwise, this Blood-Robed Sword Saint..." a Purple Mansion powerhouse sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Xu Yeli has lived for thousands of years, isn't he just as unwise?" Mo Ku spoke up at this point. "Guangming Palace's kindness to him is as heavy as a mountain, yet when Guangming Palace encounters some issues, he finds excuses not to show up. Truly detestable."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a deep look flashed in Qian Yuan's eyes: "Xu Yeli... has been living too comfortably."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a trace of joy flashed in Mo Ku's heart.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly the result he had hoped to see.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, the five Purple Mansion cultivators present all raised their heads to look at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw an intense blood-red light flying towards Mingwang Palace in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>An aura terrifying to the extreme spread out. The group felt their minds shaking just from glancing at that blood-red light.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword Saint, he really came!"</p><p></p><p>"He actually dares to come!"</p><p></p><p>The five Purple Mansion cultivators present were all somewhat shocked, but quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>With their superior numbers and strength, why would they fear a newly ascended Purple Mansion cultivator?</p><p></p><p>The blood-red sun halted in the sky, and a blood-red figure appeared. He carried a sword on his back, with an extremely handsome face.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying blood qi spread out as Qi Yuan spoke coldly: "Is everyone here?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the five Purple Mansion cultivators below, he was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>How come there were only five? Too few people.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there wasn't even a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator among them.</p><p></p><p>The quality of this batch of white moonlight was really not up to par.</p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan looked at Qi Yuan and spoke in a resounding voice: "Blood-Robed Sword Saint, you do have some courage. This old man quite admires that. If you hadn't been slandering and provoking us in the Divine Flower Society, I might have even wanted to subdue you and make you a guardian beast for our palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't your Guangming Palace being too ridiculous? At your age, you're still trying to be funny?" The blood-colored longsword on Qi Yuan's back let out a sword hum. "Today, I have come to carry out heaven's will."</p><p></p><p>Since they had agreed to battle, why say so much?</p><p></p><p>The blood sword was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Qi Yuan seemed like he had crawled out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>His blood-colored robe also seemed to be dripping with blood.</p><p></p><p>His entire person was shrouded in a realm of blood.</p><p></p><p>The five Purple Mansion cultivators present all had a moment of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>How could the person before them be a righteous cultivator? He was clearly a demonic powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>That thick blood qi - if someone said he had killed hundreds of millions of living beings, people would probably believe it.</p><p></p><p>And this was replacing heaven to carry out justice?</p><p></p><p>"You replacing heaven to carry out justice is simply a joke. Today, for the sake of this world, our Guangming Palace will eliminate you, this demon!" </p><p></p><p>Qian Yuan was at the middle stage of the Purple Mansion realm. Apart from the three palace masters of Guangming Palace, it could be said that in the entire Cuiyun Continent, he was among the top few.</p><p></p><p>His strength also gave him confidence.</p><p></p><p>The five Purple Mansion cultivators looked at Qi Yuan with wariness, but also disdain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan held his longsword, his blood robe fluttering: "In the past, with this sword, I executed 1,700 Purple Mansion cultivators. Today... sending you on your way is letting you off easy."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Purple Mansion cultivators present were stunned, then burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Raving mad, no wonder he dares to come to Mingwang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>How many Purple Mansion cultivators were there in total on the Cuiyun Continent? Killing a thousand Purple Mansion cultivators with one sword - was he bragging?</p><p></p><p>Even a Yin God wouldn't claim to have slaughtered two thousand Purple Mansion cultivators with one sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't speak further.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with white moonlight, flowery words were useless. One had to ruthlessly trample them and make them cry bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Virtual Realm Dominator Demon Lure!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's innate divine ability was unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon were in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Souls were disoriented.</p><p></p><p>Inner demons arose.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion cultivators present completely changed their expressions in that moment.</p><p></p><p>An expert reveals their skill with one move.</p><p></p><p>Their previous arrogance and disdain completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only by experiencing it personally did they understand how strong an opponent they were facing.</p><p></p><p>"Engraved level... are you at the late stage of Purple Mansion?" Qian Yuan's expression was grave, mixed with fear.</p><p></p><p>An innate divine ability at the engraved level, late stage Purple Mansion... Guangming Palace only had three such cultivators, and those three were the palace masters! They had never imagined the Blood-Robed Sword Saint could be at the late stage of Purple Mansion.</p><p></p><p>It was already terrifying enough that the Hundred Nations had luckily produced one Purple Mansion cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But a late stage Purple Mansion cultivator? Every late stage Purple Mansion cultivator in the Thirteen Continents of the Eastern Earth was a long-renowned great figure.</p><p></p><p>How could one suddenly appear out of nowhere? He didn't understand, he was frantic, struggling desperately against Qi Yuan's innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>His innate divine ability at the subtle level was fragile and weak under the Virtual Realm Dominator Demon Lure.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to reason with a dead man.</p><p></p><p>The red-bearded old man had fallen into madness.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see thousands of Purple Mansion cultivators gathered in a huge city.</p><p></p><p>A man in a blood-colored robe stepped forward, and with one sword strike, 1,700 Purple Mansion cultivators fell into a demonic realm, constantly sinking, all perishing.</p><p></p><p>"It's true... how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>How could there be someone who could slaughter over a thousand Purple Mansion cultivators with one sword? His mind collapsed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The other three Purple Mansion cultivators also had no ability to resist at all. As soon as Qi Yuan's innate divine ability was unleashed, they fell into madness.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not the supreme beings of the Wind Realm,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's innate divine ability was at a very high level, and was at the engraved level.</p><p></p><p>For these five Purple Mansion cultivators, it was indeed a matter of finishing them with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in mid-air, looking helplessly at those five Purple Mansion cultivators: "They're dying too slowly. I'm in a hurry to get back."</p><p></p><p>After all, they were not the supreme beings of the Wind Realm. Even though they had been hit by his innate divine ability, they would not immediately die from their inner demons breaking out of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they had fallen into a state of decline, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan's longsword stabbed out again.</p><p></p><p>He was like Run Tu stabbing hedgehogs, finishing off these five Purple Mansion cultivators one by one.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing they don't have tyrannical bodies immune to control, otherwise killing them would have been quite troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Having easily killed five Purple Mansion cultivators,</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that bullying the weak was still enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>Now, all the divine infant cultivators in the entire Mingwang Palace were stunned, endless fear welling up in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then grinned: "Die."</p><p></p><p>With that light utterance,</p><p></p><p>Those divine infant cultivators fell into endless hell.</p><p></p><p>Mingwang Palace instantly became a scene of devastation.</p><p></p><p>A smile played on Qi Yuan's lips as he stood atop the ruins of Mingwang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Five white moonlights, not bad."</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, skillfully picking up all the storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Then he glanced at those fallen divine infants.</p><p></p><p>"Even if they're not white moonlights, they've come from afar to deliver gifts."</p><p></p><p>"The gift is small but the thought counts."</p><p></p><p>"When elders bestow gifts, one dares not refuse."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan collected those storage bags as well, like a dragon with an obsession for collecting treasures.</p><p></p><p>Sorry sorry, there's another chapter at 6am *cough cough*, don't wait up.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

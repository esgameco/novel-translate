        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the outer city area, most of the pale and thin people are now hiding in their rooms, shivering in fear, not daring to go out.</p><p></p><p>"Was that rumbling sound just now the rebels breaking in?"</p><p></p><p>"The rebels are that powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"So it's the rebels, they are human just like us, I hope they can win."</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of them winning!"</p><p></p><p>"Could they possibly drive out the aristocratic lords?</p><p></p><p>Even if they win the battle and gain fame, who's going to clean up this mess!</p><p></p><p>The aristocratic lords will get angry, and they'll just take it out on us innocent common people. Ah, I bet many people will die tragically again today."</p><p></p><p>"But... they are still our own kind, it's the aristocrats who are bullying us..."</p><p></p><p>A group of people whispered and exchanged thoughts, their minds complex, each with their own views.</p><p></p><p>On the street, a man in black clothes walked quickly, his expression hurried.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a special bird call sounded.</p><p></p><p>The man in black's expression changed slightly, and he immediately walked towards the direction of the bird call.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths later, his figure appeared in an abandoned courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, there were two people - one was the familiar Wu Xiang, the other was a fat man dressed in brocade and silk.</p><p></p><p>"Secretary Li, this is a big deal!" the fat man spoke, his fleshy cheeks quivering.</p><p></p><p>This fat man was a rebel, who had been hiding in Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>His business was quite successful, gaining the favor of the aristocrats, and he also had some connections in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>So when something happened in the inner city, he could get the news first.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?" asked the black-clothed Secretary Li.</p><p></p><p>First there was the rumbling, then the military strategist of the Blood Tiger Gang said someone was massacring in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>"They're dead, all dead!" the fat man said anxiously, his mind in a panic, unable to speak clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down." Secretary Li's voice was crisp, subduing the fat man's mind.</p><p></p><p>The fat man finally settled down and organized his words: "A powerful expert entered the inner city and killed... the Devilish God's daughter, a princess!"</p><p></p><p>"What... killed the princess?" Secretary Li's breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>The so-called princess was the offspring of the Devilish God! That was the Devilish God, a god-level expert, the existence that suppressed the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was actually killed by someone! This was like tearing open the heavens!</p><p></p><p>"Is the Thorn Blood chasing him?" Secretary Li asked.</p><p></p><p>Now he was a bit uneasy, not knowing whether he should receive this person to join the rebels.</p><p></p><p>After all, this might bring disaster upon them.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the fat man shook his head, "He's the one killing those aristocrats!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Secretary Li was confused.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the Devilish God's princess, instead of fleeing, he continued to kill those unnatural aristocrats in the city, seeking death in vain.</p><p></p><p>The city had dozens of heaven-level experts guarding it.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious expert was so formidable.</p><p></p><p>"If he had left immediately, he might have had a chance to survive. But now, after slaying the aristocrats, he's probably... already surrounded by the Thorn Blood elders!" Secretary Li speculated, inwardly anxious.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the fat man said, "He's already killed all the Thorn Blood elders!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Secretary Li was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to believe the fat man's words.</p><p></p><p>Although Cloud Blood City was not a big city, there were still dozens of heaven-level experts. </p><p></p><p>All of them killed? This was some ruthless person, so powerful? After all, their rebel army was already considered one of the strongest in the area, with only three heaven-level experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, a ruthless person had come and slaughtered all the Thorn Blood elders in Cloud Blood City? "Is this true?" Secretary Li still couldn't quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>"It's absolutely true, I've already passed this news to the leader!" the fat man said seriously.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't sure the information was correct, he wouldn't dare to pass such news to the leader. The leader was a thorn in the side of the Thorn Blood, if the leader came to Cloud Blood City because of this and was ambushed by the Thorn Blood, he would have nowhere to be buried.</p><p></p><p>Secretary Li eyed the fat man, his gaze deep.</p><p></p><p>The fat man's scalp tingled.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang then said, "I believe Brother Chu."</p><p></p><p>Secretary Li's gaze kept changing, and finally he slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"He has slain the Thorn Blood elders and is rampaging in the city, he will definitely draw the Devilish God's attention. </p><p></p><p>We must hurry to the inner city and warn him to leave!</p><p></p><p>Secretary Li's idea was simple - go take a look at the truth. If it was true, then quickly help that person leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the Devilish God. No matter how powerful a mortal, how could they contend with a god? In this Kuijin Realm, there were ninety-nine Devilish Gods stationed!</p><p></p><p>Mortals rashly offending the divine might would surely die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>As for helping Wu Xiang receive Qi Yuan, it had already been pushed to the back of his mind.</p><p></p><p>That Qi Yuan, though he had some strength, having slain dozens of inner hall disciples of the Blood Tiger Gang, how could he compare to the terrifying expert rampaging in the inner city?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Secretary Li said.</p><p></p><p>The fat man gritted his teeth, "I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang didn't speak, his silence indicating he had no objections.</p><p></p><p>The group of a few people hurried towards the inner city, their minds filled with many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In the outer city area now, silence and clamor coexisted.</p><p></p><p>Some humans hid in their rooms, afraid to come out, while others dragged their families and ran out of the city.</p><p></p><p>To these, Secretary Li was already used to and unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Devilish God hasn't acted yet, otherwise... that senior is in grave danger!"</p><p></p><p>The concept of the Devilish God being undefeatable was imprinted in their minds since birth.</p><p></p><p>After all, those terrifying Devilish Gods, not to mention their divine powers, just their towering hundreds-of-zhang tall bodies were not something the heaven-level Armament Masters who only wielded some weak earth and heaven forces could contend with.</p><p></p><p>"Secretary Li, don't worry, the Devilish Gods generally stay in seclusion cultivating, rarely descending," the fat man said.</p><p></p><p>The Devilish Gods were high and mighty, even heaven-level experts might never see one in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>"If the Devilish God has descended, I'm afraid... he has already begun suppressing that senior.</p><p></p><p>That senior was able to slay the Thorn Blood elders, facing the Devilish God he might be able to hold out for a dozen breaths.</p><p> </p><p>In those dozen breaths, the battle aftershocks will definitely be transmitted here," Wu Xiang made a reasonable inference.</p><p></p><p>If the Devilish God had descended, the aftershocks of the battle to slay that senior would be enough to be heard here.</p><p></p><p>This inference was quite reasonable, the only loophole being that the Devilish God was stronger than imagined, instantly killing that senior without even transmitting the sound of battle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another possibility that Wu Xiang didn't even consider.</p><p></p><p>The three hurried towards the inner city, when suddenly, Secretary Li widened his eyes, gazing ahead, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He looked utterly horrified.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang and the fat man also widened their eyes, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The fat man's fleshy cheeks trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>For in front of them, at the entrance to the inner city, stood a towering colossus! A massive giant hundreds of zhang tall, dwarfing the imposing city walls before it like toys.</p><p></p><p>Darkish gray scales, a powerful physique, blood-red demonic horns standing upright, all manifesting the terrifying existence's great strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Devilish God!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Devilish God Ominous Eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Glowing crimson pupils, like high-hanging lanterns, cold and merciless.</p><p></p><p>Secretary Li's gaze met those hundreds-of-zhang tall, horrifying eyes, his body trembling involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>This was the instinct of living beings! The Devilish God had truly descended! What were they to do? His mind was in turmoil, but suddenly, his spirit focused.</p><p></p><p>"No, this Devilish God is somehow different..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't move!" </p><p></p><p>The steward Li discovered something unusual.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people also just woke up and began to carefully examine the terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>"Its eyes are bleeding!"</p><p>"Its shoulder is missing a piece, so much blood!"</p><p>"No, quick, look, there seems to be words on its body!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked over and saw that on the tall figure, large characters were carved on the upper body.</p><p></p><p>Fresh blood gushed out, as if filling the characters with paint, and the dripping fresh blood was like the golden edges of the words.</p><p></p><p>"I am in the process of becoming a divine being, those who disturb me will be like this prey!"</p><p></p><p>Steward Li trembled as he read out these words, his heart surging with shock waves.</p><p></p><p>These twelve short words were not particularly eloquent, but Steward Li could sense an aura of domination in them.</p><p></p><p>To slay the mysterious deity and erect its corpse, leaving words on its body - what an imposing and majestic display of power!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master... you're back?" Zhao Yan was relieved to see Qi Yuan return, but when he saw Qi Yuan's robes dyed completely red with blood, he became a bit apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>"Master, did you wipe out the Blood Tiger Gang?" Zhao Yan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Blood Tiger Gang? I forgot about them," Qi Yuan said casually. </p><p></p><p>This time, he had killed a powerful deity in the inner city, the blade even getting bent in the process. Luckily, he not only had innate divine strength, but also ran as fast as the internet friend's middle school classmate. After being so busy, he had indeed forgotten about the Blood Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Tiger Gang is still around? Master, whose blood is this on you?" Zhao Yan was a bit confused, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just casually killed a mysterious deity," Qi Yuan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you shouldn't say such things carelessly!" Zhao Yan hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting dark, I need to sleep," Qi Yuan said, walking towards his room.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan looked at his master's retreating back, wanting to say more but holding back.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit worried that the Blood Tiger Gang would come to cause trouble for his master.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh," Zhao Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour later, a knocking sound came at the door.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan felt apprehensive as he went to the courtyard: "Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" came a clear voice.</p><p></p><p>Recognizing the familiar voice, Zhao Yan's face lit up with delight.</p><p></p><p>"Red Plum, is that you!"</p><p></p><p>The door was opened wide, and the tightly-dressed Red Plum walked in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the familiar figure, Zhao Yan's face showed his happiness.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, he had rescued a severely injured and unconscious young woman in Yunxue City - that was Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>Red Plum was different from ordinary women, as she had always wanted to seek out the legendary "Academy."</p><p></p><p>As for the "Academy," Zhao Yan only knew about it from what Red Plum had told him.</p><p></p><p>The master of the "Academy" was a mysterious existence, wandering between realms, recruiting disciples and compiling ancient texts.</p><p></p><p>Now, the master of the "Academy" was in the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>If they could meet the Academy master and join the Academy to serve the master, then they might be able to... obtain the master's protection, and even leave this realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's been three years, Zhao Yan, you're still the same!" Red Plum looked at Zhao Yan, her face full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>"Red Plum, why did you come back?" Zhao Yan couldn't hide his joy.</p><p></p><p>He had once harbored feelings for Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>"I have good news to tell you..."</p><p></p><p>"You found the Academy?" Zhao Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Red Plum nodded. "Two years ago, I traced the whereabouts of the Academy and finally met the Academy's disciples. After going through some setbacks and hardships, I passed the test and joined the Academy."</p><p></p><p>Red Plum said this casually, but Zhao Yan knew that the process must not have been that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations!" Zhao Yan was truly happy for Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>Joining the mysterious Academy meant that she could escape this cage.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the Academy master has come to the Anmo Realm to collect news from the world and compile ancient texts, so I and some senior sisters and brothers have come here as well. Since it's not far from Yunxue City, I wanted to come back and take a look," Red Plum said, her gaze towards Zhao Yan carrying a hint of complex emotion and affection.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, last time you didn't want to leave with me. Now that I've found the Academy, do you want to join the Academy with me... oh, and if you're worried about your master, you can bring him along too!" Red Plum looked at Zhao Yan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she had invited Zhao Yan to go with her to seek the Academy, but he had refused.</p><p></p><p>"I... my master's temperament is such that he won't go to the Academy," Zhao Yan said with a conflicted expression. "Master raised me with great difficulty, so I want to take care of him in his old age!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan had always remembered his master's kindness.</p><p></p><p>And now, with his master having offended the Blood Tiger Gang, how could he abandon his master?</p><p></p><p>Red Plum heard this and was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely Zhao Yan's this kind of character that she valued, right? If Zhao Yan was cold-hearted, she wouldn't have fallen for him.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I'll be staying here for a while, is it okay if I stay here?" Red Plum didn't bring up the invitation to join the Academy again.</p><p></p><p>After all, she wasn't sure if Zhao Yan would be able to join the Academy.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Zhao Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, have there been any major events happening recently in Yunxue City? You know, the Academy master wants to record the great events of the world and compile them into books."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think so," Zhao Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Offending the Blood Tiger Gang would be considered a major event for them, but in the grand scheme of history, it was just an insignificant little thing.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, we'll talk about it slowly," Red Plum said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>Reuniting with an old friend was like a long-awaited sweet rain after a drought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>A young girl followed behind the long-robed elder, her face showing a naive expression.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, is something big happening? I rarely see you smile like this."</p><p></p><p>The long-robed elder had a weathered, hunched appearance, like an old man worn down by the ravages of time.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was the renowned master of the Academy.</p><p></p><p>"I am in the process of becoming a divine being, those who disturb me will be like this prey!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good! This trip to the Kuijin Realm is worth it just for this one scene!" </p><p></p><p>The Academy master laughed heartily, as he had not felt this joyful in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young girl quickly processed the just-received information, and after a moment, her face showed a moved expression.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect there to be such a heroic figure even in the enemy-occupied area," the young girl said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>In the enemy-occupied area, to slay a mysterious deity - what did this mean? It meant that the enemies would come in endless waves.</p><p></p><p>It meant that they would be pitted against the whole world!</p><p></p><p>The mysterious deities of the Kuijin Realm would gather and unite to slay this hero.</p><p></p><p>Even if he escaped this calamity, the mysterious deities from other worlds would also come, and he would have nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>"I really want to meet such a heroic figure. After the destruction of the Shenmu Universe, no one knows the brilliant civilization that once existed in the Shenmu Universe, and the admirable heroes who rose up one after another," the Academy master sighed.</p><p></p><p>The book the Academy master wanted to write was called "An Outline of Realm History."</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that after the Shenmu Universe was destroyed, no one would remember this great and brilliant universe.</p><p></p><p>If the civilization of the universe withered away and was eventually forgotten by all, he could not bear it.</p><p></p><p>So he traveled the worlds, measuring with his feet, recording with his pen, writing "An Outline of Realm History."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 238</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Gods and Yin Gods is greater than that between humans and ants.</p><p></p><p>Every Yang God has their own star that emits endless radiance. </p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's understanding, such stars are known as fixed stars.</p><p></p><p>A Yang God is equivalent to a fixed star! In the Blue Star of his previous life, the Sun reigned supreme in the Solar System.</p><p></p><p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, an ordinary Yin God's full-power attack can destroy a country.</p><p></p><p>But a Yang God... given enough time, can devour the entire Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the distant starry sky, two majestic Yang Gods of unfathomable size fixed their enormous eyes on everyone.</p><p></p><p>The impact of facing them directly was shocking and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>As the true form of the Blood Sun Great Sage moved, galaxies rotated, and dozens of stars adorned its waterfall-like hair like ornaments.</p><p></p><p>It spoke, its voice resounding as if from within one's heart: "Those who have not reached Yang God status are mere insects!</p><p></p><p>You are all quite impressive, but unfortunately you have no future!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan shrugged: "I've heard such words many times!"</p><p></p><p>When he was at the Qi Refining stage, he heard Foundation Establishment cultivators say that those who hadn't reached Foundation Establishment were insects.</p><p></p><p>Later, he heard Purple Palace cultivators say that those who hadn't reached Purple Palace were insects. </p><p></p><p>As his strength increased, this saying changed to Yin God, and now it had changed to Yang God.</p><p></p><p>"You NPCs should update your dialogue database!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the two Yang Gods, Qi Yuan was on high alert, sensing intense danger.</p><p></p><p>But he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>If he feared Yang Gods in a game, wouldn't he have to call them "father" in reality?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood God Great Sage stood to the side, sealing off this space to prevent Qi Yuan from escaping.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sun Great Sage didn't bother with small talk.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring you will complete me!"</p><p></p><p>As the Blood Sun Great Sage's voice rang out, its enormous body moved.</p><p></p><p>The stars hanging in its hair jingled like ornaments.</p><p></p><p>A giant palm descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This was the true form of a Yang God, as well as its Dharma body.</p><p></p><p>In the Upper Realm, Yang Gods naturally wouldn't appear in their Dharma bodies.</p><p></p><p>But this was in the void between worlds.</p><p></p><p>The giant palm seemed as if it could grasp the entire Mortal Heart Realm in one grip.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, such a palm strike would at most kill all ordinary creatures on the surface of the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>A world of the Mortal Heart Realm's caliber was not so easily crushed to dust.</p><p></p><p>This vast, unparalleled strike was the strongest attack Qi Yuan had encountered since transmigrating.</p><p></p><p>All the Ancient Gods looked grave.</p><p></p><p>How could such an attack be blocked?</p><p></p><p>Was it something human power could resist? But no one showed fear, not a single Ancient God retreated!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan shouted loudly, charging out first.</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, he hadn't killed many gods.</p><p></p><p>But his experience bar had risen rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his contemplation of the Three Pure Ones, he had reached the pinnacle on the path of mythology.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he, with a mythological body, have reversed fate and slain a Yang God's past self?</p><p></p><p>Now, he faced a Yang God's present self, its true form!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan transformed into a streak of light, charging towards the Yang God's Dharma body.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Yang God's enormity, this light was like a grain of rice.</p><p></p><p>But even a spark the size of a grain of rice can start a prairie fire.</p><p></p><p>"I come to aid the Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Nine Stars shine in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Department, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Dipper Department, fight!"</p><p></p><p>"August Heaven and Sovereign Earth, control Yin and Yang, nurture all things!"</p><p></p><p>Nearly five thousand Great Venerables acted at this moment, following closely behind the Origin Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In the vast, empty space, only streaks of light could be seen shooting skyward.</p><p></p><p>These lights were insignificant compared to the Yang God, yet they spread like wildfire.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Star Great Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"Big Dipper Seven Stars Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"Demon-Slaying Sword Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"Nine Hells Twelve Heavenly Capitals Great Formation!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, each Ancient God transformed into a star.</p><p></p><p>Nearly five thousand stars formed the Hundred Thousand Celestial Formations!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's form grew infinitely tall at this moment, the blood-red longsword in his hand emanating endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He alone sat at the center of ten thousand formations, becoming the eye of ten thousand formations.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red longsword seemed to have received the blessing of the Demon-Slaying Sword, Demon-Killing Sword, Demon-Trapping Sword, and Demon-Exterminating Sword.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the vast, majestic Yang God, his voice resounding: "I, together with all of you, strike one sword blow!"</p><p></p><p>Within the ten thousand formations, each Ancient God held a blood-red longsword.</p><p></p><p>Killing, slaughter, extermination, world-trapping... terrifying auras swept out.</p><p></p><p>Nearly five thousand Primordial Gods held longswords, their expressions solemn.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the gods swung their swords!</p><p></p><p>"Strike!"</p><p></p><p>"Strike!"</p><p></p><p>"Strike!"</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Six Heavenly Generals, Seventy-Two Earthly Fiends, Ten Directions Heavenly Venerables, Six Departments Celestial Gods, Three Officials Great Emperors...</p><p></p><p>Behind the nearly five thousand Great Venerables were all the gods of the Celestial Court roaring!</p><p></p><p>Behind each Great Venerable, how could there be only ten celestial god shadows?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat at the formation's eye, his expression grave, his blood-colored robe fluttering.</p><p></p><p>All the celestial gods' roars transformed into countless edicts.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the Three Pure Ones opened their eyes, as if sweeping in from primordial chaos!</p><p></p><p>"Strike!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted.</p><p></p><p>He struck the strongest sword blow of this world!</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was the projection of the Celestial Court in this world!</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was the strongest in the Mortal Heart Realm!</p><p></p><p>The star sea trembled.</p><p></p><p>Time and space seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>In the empty star sea, everything else vanished.</p><p></p><p>Only slaughter remained in the world.</p><p></p><p>A sword strike of slaughter taken to the extreme, with the roars of a million celestial gods, struck with all its might!</p><p></p><p>The collision of the sword and the giant spirit Dharma body.</p><p></p><p>It was the collision between the mortal realm's ultimate slaughter and a Yang God!</p><p></p><p>There was no sound, no ripples.</p><p></p><p>The giant Dharma body's hand was cleanly severed.</p><p></p><p>No blood flowed from the smooth cut.</p><p></p><p>It was as if cooked meat had been sliced.</p><p></p><p>A trace of shock appeared in the Blood Sun Great Sage's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike had actually wounded her!</p><p></p><p>A mortal's sword had wounded her! This was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Although the Dharma body's defense wasn't very strong, it shouldn't be harmed by mythology!</p><p></p><p>However, she wasn't angry or afraid, but rather delighted.</p><p></p><p>"The stronger you are, the more excited I am!"</p><p></p><p>The chasm between Yin Gods and Yang Gods cannot be crossed.</p><p></p><p>These Ancient Gods, born in the Primordial World, were destined to be unable to break through to Yang God at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of creation, there had never been a case of a Yin God killing a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sun Great Sage remained calm and unhurried. She shook her hair, and the stars in it exploded. The severed hand reconnected.</p><p></p><p>"This sword strike would be amazing even in the Upper Realm!</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, you are destined to remain nameless, perish here, and contribute to my being!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful palm continued to descend.</p><p></p><p>The extremely powerful sword strike seemed to have not harmed her at all.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Ancient Gods circulated their divine power to the extreme, raising their defenses to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Yang God's strike fell with a brutality and speed that defied reason.</p><p></p><p>All the star formations flickered violently at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the vast, pitch-black night sky, all</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great formation shone like a spider's web, emitting an intense radiance.</p><p></p><p>However, facing the strike of the Yang God,</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, all the ancient gods without exception turned pale and spat blood.</p><p></p><p>The illusory images of a million celestial gods behind them also wavered at this moment, with many collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's face also turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Although he had so many subjects fighting alongside him, forming the great formation,</p><p></p><p>The gap with the Yang God... was still far too vast.</p><p></p><p>How could the power of an ordinary world compare to that of a star?</p><p></p><p>"Without reaching Yang God level, how could you qualify to be my opponent!</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable, bring out your strongest power!" Blood Sun Great Saint coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to face Qi Yuan at his strongest, to devour him at his peak.</p><p></p><p>This way, the benefits would be maximized!</p><p></p><p>Now, her eyes were filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the previous life of Origin Venerable must be... unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>She was extremely wary of each of those gods contemplated by the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>But so what! Now, she was a Yang God! The two words "Yang God" represented everything.</p><p></p><p>Another powerful palm strike swept across.</p><p></p><p>The Cosmic Stars Formation stood before the Mortal Heart Realm, with Qi Yuan standing at the formation's eye. All the divine power in his body surged forth to resist this terrifying attack.</p><p></p><p>Once again, the radiance of the Cosmic Stars Formation dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Blood dripped from Qi Yuan's crimson robe.</p><p></p><p>Of the nearly five thousand great lords, close to a hundred were killed, exploding into ashes.</p><p></p><p>The former big black dog, even after contemplating other deities, also turned to ash under the Yang God's strike.</p><p></p><p>The scene before them was so similar to when Qi Yuan faced the Palace of Light!</p><p></p><p>But now, they had become the Palace of Light, and Blood Sun Great Saint had become him! Facing a Yang God, they simply could not attack head-on, and could only defend.</p><p></p><p>However, if this continued, they would all certainly die under the Yang God's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable saved me from peril, to die for the Venerable is my wish!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Heavy Mountain's wife, once that helpless woman, shattered into pieces under the Yang God's strike, leaving only a pool of blood that fell into the Cosmic Stars Formation, continuing to support its operation.</p><p></p><p>Without the Venerable, they would have perished long ago.</p><p></p><p>East River was covered in blood. He smiled miserably: "If spring breeze had pity for flowers, could it grant me youth once more!"</p><p></p><p>His body was broken, on the verge of death. Another strike from the Yang God, and he would surely die!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was terrifyingly calm.</p><p></p><p>In this battle... death was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>This game was also his most difficult one yet.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt no fear at all.</p><p></p><p>Because, ever since learning there were two Yang Gods, and that this realm could not break through to Yang God level, Qi Yuan had already known how this game would end.</p><p></p><p>He had tried countless methods, the eyebrow above his right eye constantly twitching, but there was no sign of hope! If they dragged things out, perhaps they would become a bit stronger, but once Blood Sun Great Saint fully devoured the Mortal Heart Realm's Heavenly Dao, that would truly be their death.</p><p></p><p>The current Blood Sun Great Saint was the weakest she would be, from their perspective.</p><p></p><p>This was also when their chances were greatest.</p><p></p><p>Because if their strength increased by 1, Blood Sun Great Saint's strength would increase by 10.</p><p></p><p>So, they had no choice but to fight.</p><p></p><p>Although, to everyone else, this seemed like going to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>Human strength has its limits.</p><p></p><p>"Bring out all your trump cards!" Blood Sun Great Saint shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>In a distant place, Blood God Great Saint watched this battle with a relaxed expression.</p><p></p><p>How could a Yin God fight a Yang God? Since the beginning of time, such a thing had never happened!</p><p></p><p>"There are no absolutes in this world!" At this time, Qi Yuan spoke, his aura becoming obscure.</p><p></p><p>Even his right eye was twitching frantically.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the faster it twitched, the more it indicated terrifying danger.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao has fifty, Heaven's evolution forty-nine, one escapes!"</p><p></p><p>The one that escapes is the chance for survival.</p><p></p><p>However, to obtain this slim chance of survival, he needed to achieve forty-nine!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he would face two Yang Gods with his strongest form!</p><p></p><p>"Great sun shining bright, illuminating all directions!</p><p></p><p>I wear dark robes, commanding nine chapters!"</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, the illusory image of a star suddenly flickered.</p><p></p><p>A huge illusory sun hung in the night sky at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying illusory sun drew closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>A trace of surprise flashed in Blood Sun Great Saint's eyes: "An illusory star? Indeed terrifying, but it's merely an illusion... that's all."</p><p></p><p>She didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next instant, her expression became astonished again.</p><p></p><p>"Actually two stars, somewhat interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Only to see, within the huge illusory star, another illusory star appeared.</p><p></p><p>Two illusory stars hung in the sky, illuminating the nine heavens and ten earths.</p><p></p><p>"Still not enough, you can be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>This way... devouring you will be even more interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Sun Great Saint's face was full of greed.</p><p></p><p>With two illusory stars summoned, Origin Venerable's threat suddenly increased sharply.</p><p></p><p>However, without becoming a Yang God, she feared nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was as if she sat in a skyscraper 5000 meters away, aiming at Qi Yuan with a sniper rifle.</p><p></p><p>While Qi Yuan held a large knife, the knife becoming sharper and longer, but how could it threaten her?</p><p></p><p>"Little Bride!" Qi Yuan called out coldly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Little Bride's figure appeared, a wedding dress appearing in the starry sky, her aura obscure.</p><p></p><p>Blood God Great Saint, who had been silent all this time, now showed a surprised expression: "A Yang God's past self? No, that's not it!"</p><p></p><p>"Armor shared with child!" Qi Yuan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red armor covered Qi Yuan's body. He sat in the center of ten thousand formations, his height countless tens of thousands of zhang.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying, ferocious armor made him like a demon from hell.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant holding a blood-colored longsword seemed able to cleave the world in two with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>However, under the Yang God's enormous divine form, he was still tiny, like a slightly larger ant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's level had increased by six.</p><p></p><p>But compared to a Yang God, the gap was still far, far too great.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, not enough, far from enough!" Blood Sun Great Saint's eyes were full of greed, "How many more surprises can you give me!"</p><p></p><p>The stronger Origin Venerable was, the greater the benefits she would gain when devouring him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had the support of two illusory stars, and his body was covered in blood-colored armor.</p><p></p><p>Now, he seemed to have reached the pinnacle of strength.</p><p></p><p>His terrifying strike, even with the support of 100,000 formations, that sword strike...</p><p></p><p>However... even such a strike could only cause negligible damage to the Yang God's manifestation.</p><p></p><p>It could not harm her essence at all, let alone kill a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Village Chief Yu Lu spoke with mixed emotions: "We are willing to lend the Venerable our strength!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Heavy Mountain also stepped forward: "I am willing as well!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi smiled: "I too am willing!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Divine Official Shen Tu also resounded through the world at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I have a method, called 'Assimilation'. We are willing to become nourishment for the Venerable, to help the Venerable slay the evil god!"</p><p></p><p>The Assimilation method was obtained from the evil god.</p><p></p><p>After becoming ancient gods, the people of Qingshui Village had been researching the Assimilation method.</p><p></p><p>Researching this method was not only to rescue ordinary people assimilated by the evil god, but also for... them to willingly be assimilated by Origin Venerable, becoming part of the Venerable, to increase Origin Venerable's strength!</p><p></p><p>The Assimilation method now resounded through the Cosmic Stars Formation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

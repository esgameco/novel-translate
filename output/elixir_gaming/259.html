        <h1>Chapter 259</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for all your trouble, elder."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said respectfully. </p><p></p><p>Even though he had transmigrated, he still had to maintain the Blue Star virtues of respecting the elderly and caring for the young.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he ended up becoming a beggar, sorry, he wasn't from Blue Star, but from Three-Body.</p><p></p><p>"I will donate these cultivation techniques to the Original God Sharing Association, to add a brick to the cause of sharing for the Original God." Feng Jun took out a storage bag and presented the cultivation techniques he had prepared earlier.</p><p></p><p>The storage bag was packed full of cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan was not happy: "Please don't call me Original God, call me Blood Robe Sword God, or just Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun was stunned for a moment, not quite understanding, but still made a mental note.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the quiet Feng Xie asked: "Grandfather, what was that person who came today... here for?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Feng Xie's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, that Yin God had mentioned the Mythical Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Feng Xie vaguely had a guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"As you guessed, he wanted to use my name to scheme for Great Venerable Jasmine's Mythical Treasury." Feng Jun did not conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Such things had happened many times before.</p><p></p><p>Rumors said Feng Jun was the illegitimate son of the Tai Feng Myth.</p><p></p><p>The Mythical Treasury was in Great Venerable Jasmine's hands, and there were quite a few hidden figures coveting it, wanting to use Feng Jun to scheme for the Mythical Treasury.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a bunch of sneaky bastards!" Feng Xie couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, standing nearby, asked softly: "Do you also want to obtain the Mythical Treasury?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun shook his head: "If I get it, I'm lucky. If I don't, it's fate."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned, thinking he would say it was his destiny.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if Great Venerable Jasmine confessed her love to me, using the Mythical Treasury as a gift, I might consider being her boyfriend for a day." Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun remained silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan said something shocking again: "Great Sun Flame Emperor, if I got together with Great Venerable Jasmine, wouldn't I become your grandfather?"</p><p></p><p>According to rumors, Great Venerable Jasmine was Feng Jun's sister.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan got together with Great Venerable Jasmine, his seniority would be much higher than the Great Sun Flame Emperor's.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem ahem..." The Great Sun Flame Emperor coughed, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, if that day comes, we'll each keep our own titles." Qi Yuan was very clever.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian looked quite tired.</p><p></p><p>Her granddaughter followed beside her, her eyes also rather helpless, but more joyful.</p><p></p><p>"We finally got back grandfather's inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>"Although there were some twists and turns, it was still worth it in the end." Li Yaxian also smiled.</p><p></p><p>This time entering the Seeking Dao Palace, although guided by the slovenly Daoist, they still encountered some difficulties.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Yaxian paved the way with money, plus donating 40% of the inheritance to the Seeking Dao Palace, everything went relatively smoothly.</p><p></p><p>But during the process, there was an official named Yang Kang who kept making things difficult.</p><p></p><p>This official had a deep grudge with Li Yaxian's late husband.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian had heard her husband say that Yang Kang was lecherous by nature, and once tried to use his position to rape a man, but was stopped by her husband. Because of this, Yang Kang held a grudge against her husband.</p><p></p><p>When she came to claim the inheritance this time, Yang Kang made no attempt to hide it and directly made things difficult, even hinting to Li Yaxian that to get her late husband's inheritance, she would have to pay a price.</p><p></p><p>The price was her body.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the slovenly Daoist appeared and dealt with Yang Kang, allowing Li Yaxian to finally obtain the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"This trip to Qinghong City has fulfilled our wishes. The only regret... is not being able to see the Blood Robe Sword God." The young woman said.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived in Qinghong City that day, they immediately heard that earth-shattering broadcast.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Sword God had actually come to Qinghong City, and was at the Wangxian Tower, calling out to Great Venerable Jasmine.</p><p></p><p>It was such a historic scene, but unfortunately she was tied up at the time and couldn't see the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Later she heard about what happened at the Wangxian Tower, and the heroic bearing of the Blood Robe Sword God, and she felt extremely regretful.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the influence of either the Blood Robe Sword God or Great Venerable Jasmine, none of the cultivators surrounding the Wangxian Tower at the time had managed to capture an image of the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>So she had missed the chance to see the legendary Blood Robe Sword God in person.</p><p></p><p>He was now the big shot she admired most, so naturally she felt extremely regretful.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword God kills people like flies. Aren't you afraid he might accidentally kill you?" Having obtained her late husband's inheritance, Li Yaxian was in a good mood and teased her granddaughter.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robe Sword God doesn't kill indiscriminately. Those he kills are all people who deserve to die!" The young woman defended the Blood Robe Sword God like a fan, considering everything from his perspective.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Li Yaxian smiled indulgently. "Qi Yuan's looks may not be inferior to the Blood Robe Sword God's."</p><p></p><p>"My admiration for the Blood Robe Sword God has nothing to do with looks. Of course, if he were as handsome as Qi Yuan, or even half as handsome, he would be my dream dao partner!" The young woman let her imagination run wild, daydreaming.</p><p></p><p>"Stop your wild thoughts. Come on, let's go meet Qi Yuan and bring him into the Seeking Dao Palace." Li Yaxian said.</p><p></p><p>She had promised last time to help introduce Qi Yuan to the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan was almost here, she needed to go receive him.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, if Qi Yuan were a bit stronger, I really wouldn't mind him being my grandfather." The young woman laughed. "Having such a pleasing grandfather to look at would be a joy."</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian gave her granddaughter a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>The two left the Seeking Dao Palace and headed towards the place they had agreed to meet Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the streets were bustling with noise and excitement, with all kinds of cultivators walking around the city like ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>There were almost no ordinary people in Qinghong City, mostly Qi Refining cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally one could even see Divine Infant True Lords.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood among the crowd, absorbing the newly acquired cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always been collecting cultivation techniques to create his own "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Although these techniques were not impressive to him, each one brought some gains, more or less.</p><p></p><p>To give an analogy, if the rules of this world were 100, scattered among all the cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was now collecting these 100 rules, using what he obtained to continue compiling his "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Whenever he had free time, he would absorb cultivation techniques, completely absorbing the 100 rules of the Canglang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan, you're here." From afar, a woman in a yellow dress waved to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian stood to the side, with a kind attitude, looking at Qi Yuan as if looking at an admired junior.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan hurried over. His hand reached into his bosom, and suddenly a exquisite and extraordinary-looking wine flask appeared.</p><p></p><p>He tossed the wine flask to the woman in the yellow dress: "You like to drink, I picked up this wine vessel casually. It looks pretty good, so I'll give it to you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also paid attention to human relationships when doing things.</p><p></p><p>These two were willing to help introduce him to the Seeking Dao Palace, so he had to give a gift.</p><p></p><p>This wine flask, Qi Yuan had obtained from the Wangxian Tower, called the Exquisite Flask.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the second shopkeeper and Elder Xiang Yun had falsely accused Qi Yuan of stealing the Exquisite Flask.</p><p></p><p>Since they said he stole it, if Qi Yuan didn't take it, wouldn't he be wrongly accused for nothing?</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress sniffed, taking a deep breath: "Good wine flask, not cheap, right?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she winked at Qi Yuan, as if saying, if you want to pursue my grandmother, I can help you strategize.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't cost any money."</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian beside them took another look at that wine flask. She felt that flask looked quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came from behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, someone asked me to give you this letter."</p><p></p><p>A person dressed like a beggar appeared behind Qi Yuan. He was dirty all over, holding a letter in his hand.</p><p></p><p>There was also a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because delivering this letter was so simple</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With just 100 spirit stones as a reward for this simple task, his daughter would be able to obtain better cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>"A letter for me?" Qi Yuan was curious.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian shook her head and transmitted: "Be careful, it could be a trap."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't pay attention. He took the letter, tore open the envelope, and saw a white paper inside.</p><p></p><p>On the paper were a few delicate characters: "Dark Sun is coming, flee quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan squinted his eyes. The message was cryptic.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that some well-intentioned person was warning him that an enemy called Dark Sun was coming to deal with him. </p><p></p><p>So they were urging him to flee.</p><p></p><p>Flee? That was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was still quite ordinary now, with the strength of a top high school student, his self-preservation ability was first-class.</p><p></p><p>He asked the person disguised as a beggar: "Who told you to give me this letter?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the beggar was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his eyes paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At that moment, his body suddenly exploded, shattering into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian's expression changed, and she immediately became alert, because even she hadn't noticed how the beggar had died.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Is there an enemy?" The woman in the yellow dress also looked panicked.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators around seemed not to have witnessed this scene, and went about their business as usual.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood still. He squinted his eyes, his palm open, with half a drop of blood still remaining on it.</p><p></p><p>"Killing someone in broad daylight, in plain sight - is there no law?!" Qi Yuan was very angry.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the law and killing someone on the street, and in front of him no less.</p><p></p><p>This kind of behavior would inevitably lead to moral decay and collapse of etiquette in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, this behavior was comparable to Sima violating the oath of Luo River.</p><p></p><p>After all, who was he?</p><p></p><p>He was the practitioner of upright conduct in the Azure Waves Realm, and had even killed a bunch of morally corrupt people for this reason.</p><p></p><p>But today someone killed a person in front of him - what was this? This was a provocation! Qi Yuan was furious.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress sighed softly: "This person... how innocent."</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian warned: "Qi Yuan, you need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stared at the blood on his palm and the letter.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his eyes did not see any useful information.</p><p></p><p>He squinted his eyes and finally kept the letter.</p><p></p><p>"When I come out of the Seeking Dao Palace, I must bring that outlaw to justice!"</p><p></p><p>Someone killed a person right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As a moral role model, he naturally couldn't tolerate this!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Yaxian didn't say anything more, but led Qi Yuan towards the Seeking Dao Palace.</p><p></p><p>And so this matter came to an end.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an insignificant person had quietly perished, and except for Qi Yuan, no one remembered this minor character.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, no one cared about his death.</p><p></p><p>The Seeking Dao Palace was located in the northeast of Qinghong City, built among continuous mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>From afar, one could see a cluster of buildings.</p><p></p><p>Towers and palaces were hidden in the clouds and mist, seeming out of place in this mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian had been frequenting the Seeking Dao Palace these past two days, and she was considered half a member of the palace.</p><p></p><p>So when Li Yaxian brought Qi Yuan in, no one stopped them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan passed through corridors, suspension bridges, and lone peaks, standing in front of a palace.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Yaxian said: "The elder we're meeting this time is named Fu Lu. He's a great cultivator at the peak of the Purple Palace realm. He can make decisions on external affairs of the Seeking Dao Palace alone."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress stuck out her tongue and said in a low voice: "The people of the Seeking Dao Palace have their eyes on top of their heads. We'll probably have to wait for a while."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, no rush." Qi Yuan scanned the surroundings, pondering something. Suddenly, he asked, "Do you think I follow the rules too much?"</p><p></p><p>Today, the Qi realm cultivator who looked like a beggar died in front of Qi Yuan, giving him much to think about.</p><p></p><p>There were too many people in this world who didn't follow the rules.</p><p></p><p>If you're just delivering a message, deliver it. But they ended up killing the person.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan very angry.</p><p></p><p>To deal with people who don't follow the rules, according to Qi Yuan's understanding, it was best if he didn't follow the rules either.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would be constrained by the rules.</p><p></p><p>"Before you're strong enough, following the rules is a good thing. It allows you to live longer." Li Yaxian didn't know why Qi Yuan asked this, but she expressed her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense. Rules are made by the strong to bind the weak. And I... should I be considered strong now? Then..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly realized that he was still too kind, too rule-abiding.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't follow the rules, would anyone dare to kill recklessly in front of him, disregarding the law? Obviously not.</p><p></p><p>If he made the rules, then everyone would follow them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I haven't killed enough people yet," Qi Yuan murmured. "No one fears me. This isn't good."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he had the qualities to be a villainous dark lord.</p><p></p><p>If so, why should he still follow the rules?</p><p></p><p>Why should he still report step by step?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be better to directly find the Great Sovereign Wu Jun?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts became clear at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a mocking voice came:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fu Lu is busy today. I'm afraid you won't be able to see him today."</p><p></p><p>A fat middle-aged man appeared. His body was very fat, but compared to his huge head, his body seemed small.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was full of greed. His fiery eyes looked at Li Yaxian's delicate body, then fell on Qi Yuan, becoming even more intense.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Li Yaxian's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>She had been afraid of encountering this person today and had deliberately avoided him.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, they still ran into him.</p><p></p><p>This fat cultivator was Yang Kang, who had been constantly making things difficult for her.</p><p></p><p>Now that Yang Kang said this, Li Yaxian immediately understood that Yang Kang was interfering.</p><p></p><p>She was angry in her heart but didn't dare to show it.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress was furious, glaring fiercely at Yang Kang.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was very profound. He looked at Yang Kang and said softly: "Are you deliberately interfering, making it so Fu Lu can't see us today?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Kang was slightly stunned, then smiled and said: "You speak too bluntly. I haven't interfered. Don't wrongly accuse a good person. However, if you're willing to pay a price, I'd be willing to intervene and make Elder Fu Lu available to see you today."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his gaze was greedy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I won't wrongly accuse you. I'll just chop off your dog head."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>This sentence was particularly abrupt, catching everyone present off guard.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Yang Kang was stunned, sensing a strong threat.</p><p></p><p>A flash of sword light was seen. Yang Kang, who had been laughing just now, couldn't react at all. In an instant, his head was separated from his body.</p><p></p><p>This scene was too fast, too shocking.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian couldn't react at all. She could only stare blankly at Qi Yuan as she heard him say to the corpse on the ground:</p><p></p><p>"Your head was too big, your shoulders couldn't bear it. I helped you reduce the burden."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you ask me to pay a price? Is this price enough?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Yang Kang had already perished and couldn't answer Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Godfather is truly one in a million. Among the many Yuandan cultivators in our Mortal Heart Realm, not a single one... has formed such a Golden Core." It was unclear whether Qi Qi's words were praise or sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal Heart Realm is indeed lacking. I know a friend who not only formed a Golden Core, but also formed a Divine Infant," Qi Yuan recalled Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord lived up to his name, possessing great wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi took a sip of soup, making a slurping sound, then put down the porcelain spoon before speaking: "Godfather, to be honest, I think forming a Fixed Star Divine Infant would be more powerful than a Fixed Star Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>"How so?" Qi Yuan asked, earnestly learning.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Infant is the foundation of a true god. With a strong Divine Infant, one becomes stronger after becoming a true god. </p><p></p><p>The Golden Core is just a transitional stage. It will shatter eventually anyway, so forming it casually has no impact." Qi Qi told Qi Yuan what she knew.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you're indeed not as good as Great Wisdom True Lord. Sometimes a single conversation with him enlightens me greatly.</p><p></p><p>Your words make me feel... like I've wasted my time listening." Qi Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their conversation end, Zhao Zun beside them reported the current situation in Flying Mist City to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Though it was reported to Qi Yuan, Qi Qi was actually listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the report, Zhao Zun said: "Your Eminence, I met an old acquaintance in Flying Mist City. She said she has a gift to give you."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun told Qi Yuan about encountering Yang Lian and the situation with Yang Lian's younger sister.</p><p></p><p>He also added Yang Lian's words - her sister was frail and didn't want to meet strangers.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A gift?" Qi Yuan became interested, "Even a little sister is sending me gifts. It seems I have the people's support and heaven's mandate!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked expectantly at the blood-red jade leaf in Zhao Zun's hand.</p><p></p><p>[Blood Jade Leaf, special artifact, dyed red with true god's blood. </p><p>When worn on the body in the Mortal Heart Realm, fortune +1.]</p><p></p><p>"Fortune?" Qi Yuan took the blood jade leaf, his eyes showing curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The word "fortune" was rather mysterious.</p><p></p><p>When he controlled the Heavenly Dao on Wangyue Continent, he could also bestow fortune upon people.</p><p></p><p>However, it was very superficial.</p><p></p><p>"I accept her gift, but I wonder when I'll be able to return the favor," Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun had already relayed the other party's words, so Qi Yuan knew they didn't want to meet strangers.</p><p></p><p>It was enough for him to accept the gift, no need to be intrusive.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zun lowered his head: "I will convey Your Eminence's words to them."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan responded.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Yang Lian looked at the familiar figure, her eyes smiling: "No need for a return gift, just help me thank Origin Sovereign for his kindness."</p><p></p><p>How could any gift match the world's fortune? Yang Lian felt that deity couldn't repay enough.</p><p></p><p>Seven days passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Arhats and Four Heavenly Kings who went on the expedition had returned to Flying Mist City.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Eighteen Arhats and Four Heavenly Kings went out together, dividing into two routes, advancing step by step according to Qi Yuan's plan.</p><p></p><p>The evil gods in the remaining two cities, facing a sudden attack, were completely unprepared and all slain.</p><p></p><p>Of the seven cities in Flying Spirit Prefecture, four were originally under complete control of evil gods. Now, only the prefectural capital remained.</p><p></p><p>According to obtained information, a Step Two Transcendent evil god was about to take over the prefectural capital.</p><p></p><p>This evil god was in the mid-stage of Step Two Transcendent, with formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Four Heavenly Kings and Eighteen Arhats went out together, it would be difficult to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>The current Flying Spirit Prefecture was in a state of undercurrents.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, Qi Yuan sent troops to kill evil gods and eliminate their remnants.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, many evil god remnants were hiding in secret, waiting for the new god of Flying Spirit Prefecture to arrive and sweep away the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The entire Flying Spirit Prefecture was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The great clans that were originally going to migrate did not stay because Qi Yuan swept away the evil gods. Instead, they left more urgently and quickly, afraid of getting involved.</p><p></p><p>Those remaining in Flying Spirit Prefecture were mostly ordinary cultivators and poor commoners.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some great clans also rushed to Flying Mist City, choosing to face the coming crisis together with Origin Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, Flying Mist City, once empty, became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Every day on the streets, there were banquets, with a joyous atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>This world shrouded in blood mist gained some festive and cheerful air.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi stood on the city wall, watching the people below eating heartily at the banquet, smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help recalling that day when she stood on a high mountain, personally witnessing endless heavenly fire falling, burning the Heavenly Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Countless common people rose up in resistance, and the final Heavenly Prefecture was reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in this oppressive world, eating the evil gods' banquet together is the only thing worth being happy about," Qi Qi thought, "No wonder when people die, they always hold a feast. Perhaps it's to dispel the fear of death with this lively atmosphere."</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qi Qi, the Sovereign is preparing to return to Qingshui Village."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go see Godfather off!" Qi Qi raised her head, her gaze bright.</p><p></p><p>Godfather was returning to Qingshui Village, heading to the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>She and the Four Heavenly Kings, along with some Arhats, would be responsible for guarding Flying Mist City.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the news, Thunder God Sovereign couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is really reckless, already killed three evil gods?"</p><p></p><p>Learning the news, Thunder God Sovereign sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>This Origin Sovereign was truly a man of action.</p><p></p><p>"Romantic Sovereign is a bit troublesome..." Before coming, Thunder God Sovereign had some understanding of the gods in Lin Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Romantic Sovereign was the child of a Great Sovereign, and also Zhang Feng's brother-in-law.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected Romantic Sovereign to be the new evil god of Flying Mist City.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he opened a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in an ancient place.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Sovereign's illusory figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>A white-haired old man was meditating with closed eyes. Sensing something, he opened his eyes: "Thunder God Sovereign, has something happened in the North?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Thunder God Sovereign coughed, his aura seeming somewhat weak, "This old man has come to ask for your help."</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you couldn't resist and recklessly attacked evil gods again, exposing yourself?" The white-haired old man said with distress.</p><p></p><p>This friend of his was good in every way, except... too reckless, never listening to advice.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have ended up covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, this time it wasn't my recklessness." Thunder God Sovereign said awkwardly, "It's my... Qingshui Village guardian god, he's a bit reckless, I couldn't persuade him."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Hearing this, the white-haired old man became interested, "So it's your disciple being reckless, interesting interesting. Wasn't he staying in the village? Did he run out and seduce an evil god's daughter?"</p><p></p><p>"That's not it, he... killed all the evil gods in Flying Spirit Prefecture." Thunder God Sovereign said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>For him, killing a few evil gods wasn't a problem.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem was what to do after killing the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The entire North was a fallen area, considered the evil gods' stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-haired old man was stunned: "How can he be so bold?"</p><p></p><p>He muttered, then said with worry: "Before the evil gods react, quickly take him and flee to our South!</p><p></p><p>His talent is very strong, able to visualize over twenty legendary god-observing methods. If he's not the chosen one, he's like the chosen one."</p><p></p><p>"I... can't take him away." Thunder God Sovereign said bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"You can't even control your disciple?" The white-haired old man was furious.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, is there a possibility that he's not my disciple?" Thunder God Sovereign became even more awkward.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, when I first went to Qingshui Village, he said he already had a master and was unwilling to become my disciple.</p><p></p><p>This old man couldn't force him... to accept me as master.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he went to the Hundred Flowers Assembly once and accepted Qionghua Sovereign as his subject."</p><p></p><p>Every time he thought of this, Thunder God Sovereign felt incredibly bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign? Subject? Thunder God Sovereign, you're not fooling me, are you?" The white-haired old man didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>How could a mighty Sovereign become the subject of a mere Purple Palace cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not lying, if I'm lying, may heaven strike me with five thunderbolts!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, wouldn't heavenly thunder just tickle you?" The white-haired old man laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, his talent is very very strong, but he's extremely stubborn. This old man can't persuade him." Thunder God Sovereign spoke, his voice sighing.</p><p></p><p>"Useless, why not just knock him out and bring him back?" The white-haired old man said with frustration.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to be the bad guy." Thunder God Sovereign thought of something and said, "His talent is very high. Relying on supreme treasures, he can't break through to the True God realm.</p><p></p><p>So he's going to the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan to seek a chance for breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man was silent for a long time before saying: "So you're making me be the bad guy?"</p><p></p><p>The ancestral land of the Ancient Clan was located in the South.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Thunder God Sovereign said slowly:</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If he comes out from the ancestral land without having entered the realm of true divinity, find an excuse to deceive him. Make up a method for entering the realm of true divinity to keep him in the southern lands.</p><p></p><p>If he has entered the realm of true divinity, you must keep him in the southern lands even more. His future is no less than that of the child of destiny.</p><p></p><p>This is the hope of our mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes and the great gate opens, let them... these seeds of hope, leave the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Supreme spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Even at its peak, the mortal realm was defeated by the evil gods, with all the mythical beings dying in the great war.</p><p></p><p>Now, how could the weakened mortal realm defeat the evil gods?</p><p></p><p>So, the Mythical Plan was set in motion.</p><p></p><p>Gathering the strength of the entire clan and realm to nurture the child of destiny, create mythical powerhouses and mythical seeds.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the mythical powerhouses would strike simultaneously to break open the gate, taking the final hope, the seeds of the world, to escape from the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, facing the blockade of the evil gods, very few ancient gods may be able to escape the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But... even if one could escape, it would count.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man looked at the Thunder God Supreme and after a long while said: "Whether the Mythical Plan can be successfully implemented, I do not know.</p><p></p><p>If his talent is sufficient, a core spot... can be given to him."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," the Thunder God Supreme sincerely expressed gratitude.</p><p></p><p>In the Mythical Plan, old-timers like them who had reached the end of their path had no core spots.</p><p></p><p>The core spots were given to the mythical seeds.</p><p></p><p>And these true gods like themselves were sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>When everything was prepared,</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods participating in the Mythical Plan would split into two groups.</p><p></p><p>One group, all the ancient gods would suddenly attack the evil gods of the mortal realm, attracting their attention.</p><p></p><p>The other group, the ancient gods would sacrifice themselves to open the gate and send out the mythical beings and mythical seeds.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Chu Kexiu gained the favor of the evil gods and was sent beyond the heavens some time ago. Now that he's returned, his divine realm has advanced further," the white-haired elder reminded the Thunder God Supreme at this point.</p><p></p><p>Chu Kexiu was once a good friend of the Thunder God Supreme.</p><p></p><p>However, this Supreme chose to defect to the evil gods, backstabbing the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Supreme was extremely angry at the time and recklessly went out alone to battle two Supremes, including Chu Kexiu.</p><p></p><p>If the white-haired elder hadn't arrived in time, the Thunder God Supreme might have perished in that battle.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, that son of a bitch, I'm no match for him now?" The Thunder God Supreme cursed, and after cursing, became desolate, "But I indeed have no chance... to have another go with that thing."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-haired elder felt a pang in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He deliberately mentioned Chu Kexiu to provoke the Thunder God Supreme's desire for revenge.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Supreme looked at the white-haired elder, his eyes showing a resigned smile.</p><p></p><p>"I deceived that kid to stay in the southern lands, he's bound to resent me.</p><p></p><p>I don't dare to see him again, to avoid embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Let this useless remnant of mine do one last thing for him.</p><p></p><p>Flying Spirit Manor, Zhang Feng, these enemies, I will help him clear them out!"</p><p></p><p>He was already severely injured, with only 300 years of lifespan left.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he was no match for any Supreme.</p><p></p><p>But he was confident in killing a Step Two Heavenly Ascender from Flying Spirit Manor and Zhang Feng, a Step Three Heavenly Ascender.</p><p></p><p>However, after slaying those two, he probably wouldn't be able to escape the fallen zone.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder looked at the Thunder God Supreme with great sorrow: "Him... I will take good care of."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, let's not talk anymore, that guy is probably coming back soon." The phantom of the Thunder God Supreme dissipated beside the white-haired elder.</p><p></p><p>In the empty area, blood-colored liquid flowed, and the white-haired elder stood up, looking at the sky with a desolate expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his jade slip flashed.</p><p></p><p>A figure completely shrouded in a black robe appeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person, the white-haired elder's face tensed: "Why are you here, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The voice from within the black robe was hoarse: "This time I discovered a new node, its location is in the sky..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-haired elder's expression turned joyful: "Another node discovered, this is good news."</p><p></p><p>The nodes were crucial to whether the Mythical Plan could open the gate of the mortal realm and escape from it.</p><p></p><p>The black robe remained motionless, showing no joy. After about ten breaths, his calm voice came: "I killed Supreme Lihua."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white-haired elder fell silent, his voice also becoming hoarse: "This has nothing to do with you."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The black-robed figure faintly responded and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan went forward to greet, looking at the big black dog with a warm smile on his face: "Sworn brother, you're back."</p><p></p><p>The big black dog nodded like a human, glanced at Zhu Zhuangshi beside him, opened its dog mouth and spat out a large bone.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shi Zhongshan said to Zhu Zhuangshi: "Hurry and thank my sworn brother, he still thought of you at the feast and brought back a bone for you!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi looked at the bone, on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he returned home from the feast, he brought bones for the big black dog.</p><p></p><p>Now karma had come back to him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to get angry at the big black dog, but glared at Shi Zhongshan: "Wait until I become stronger, I'll definitely teach you a lesson, you treacherous person!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't eat the bone, and the big black dog wasn't really trying to humiliate him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, what are you all babbling about? Choose some people in the next few days to go to the ancestral land with me," Qi Yuan appeared at this time and said to Village Chief Yu Lu who was watching the show on the side.</p><p></p><p>Village Chief Yu Lu's heart leapt upon hearing this: "Great Deity, how many people should we choose?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... seven or eight," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>For this trip to the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan, the Dragon-Subduing Arhat and Tiger-Taming Arhat would definitely go.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Long-Browed Arhat and Joyful Arhat would also follow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about bringing seven or eight more villagers in.</p><p></p><p>"Great Deity, can I go?" Village Chief Yu Lu hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"If you're not afraid of death, you can go," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Entering the ancestral land was extremely dangerous for those who hadn't reached the realm of true divinity.</p><p></p><p>After all, even Supremes could possibly perish in the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan.</p><p></p><p>Let alone these villagers.</p><p></p><p>"Let the villagers volunteer themselves, make the dangers clear.</p><p></p><p>If no one volunteers, then... whatever.</p><p></p><p>If too many people volunteer, you handle it, select eight capable ones." Qi Yuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>For this entry into the ancestral land, Qi Yuan still needed to make some preparations.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, according to Yu Lu and Shen Tu, while many places in the ancestral land were full of dangers, there were also many places that were very safe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyebrows could twitch for fortune or disaster, so it was suitable for him to venture into the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan looked towards the Thunder God Supreme: "Old Thunder, do you want to come with me to the ancestral land of the Ancient Clan this time, be my bodyguard?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Supreme glanced sideways at Qi Yuan: "You're thinking too beautifully, kid."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you eat at our Qingshui Village every day now, but you're of no use at all.</p><p></p><p>This expedition, you won't even join the music team to provide thunder for the BGM.</p><p></p><p>You old guy are so stingy, not dropping a single gold coin, just being a mascot, huh?" Qi Yuan complained indignantly.</p><p></p><p>This Thunder God Supreme was very enthusiastic about eating at feasts, but did nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have a big gift for you when you return this time!" The Thunder God Supreme stroked his beard, saying leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Just don't be too abstract." Qi Yuan glanced at the Thunder God Supreme, "My biggest expectation for you is to add some BGM for me."</p><p></p><p>"I, a mighty Supreme, providing thunder sounds for you when you fight? What are you thinking!" The Thunder God Supreme glared at Qi Yuan angrily.</p><p></p><p>There was no such way to humiliate people.</p><p></p><p>To think that he, a mighty brute, would do the job of making thunder sounds all day, how undignified.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Thunder God Supreme and sighed: "Making thunder sounds is also a technical job, it seems I have to call over the Thunder Department."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Department was one of the eight departments of the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>It managed the clouds, rain, wind, and thunder of the mortal world, and also had the power to monitor the three realms and judge good and evil.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Department was also renowned among the eight departments, controlled by the Heavenly Venerable of Universal Transformation of Thunder and Sound of the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>This Venerable had a great background, rumored to be an incarnation of the Great Emperor of Longevity, one of the Four Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>If this Venerable could be visualized, Qi Yuan would definitely have full prestige every time he went on an expedition, with thunder all over the sky.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this Venerable's status was a bit high, and with Qi Yuan's current evil god spiritual power, he might not be able to visualize him.</p><p></p><p>But he could at least try to visualize the Five Thunder Emperors and the Thirty-six Thunder Generals.</p><p></p><p>Once visualized, the special effects would be maxed out.</p><p></p><p>"How come another Thunder Department has popped up?" The Thunder God Supreme chuckled, "Your Chinese Dragon Team really is full of talents!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

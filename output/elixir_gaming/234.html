        <h1>Chapter 234</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the empty Mountain of Visualization, his emotions complex.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that the Divine Visualization Method was not so simple. </p><p></p><p>This mountain also did not seem so simple.</p><p></p><p>In other worlds, he had never seen or heard of something like the Mountain of Visualization.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial World... what exactly is different about it?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured, as his form emerged from the Mountain of Visualization.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the endless mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe's gaze kept wandering, and he couldn't help but sigh: "Abandoning the mythical-level Divine Visualization Method to join the Origin Venerable, I've given up too much."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Cat Elder glanced at Dong Jianghe: "Stop always thinking about your lousy mythical-level Divine Visualization Method! Don't you know that after the Venerable came, mythical-level Divine Visualization Methods became worthless!"</p><p></p><p>In the past two days, these ancient gods who later joined Qi Yuan had learned the reason for the great power of Divine Thunder Lord and the others.</p><p></p><p>It was because of the Divine Visualization Method! The Origin Venerable had not only visualized eight mythical-level Divine Visualization Methods, but had even gone to the past... and visualized a bunch of mythical-level Divine Visualization Methods.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Dong Jianghe was somewhat confused. He looked at Divine Thunder Lord who was in the lead, and a question arose in his mind: "Doesn't Divine Thunder Lord already have a Divine Visualization Method? Why did he come?"</p><p></p><p>"Not only did he come, but all the other ancient gods and villagers who have Divine Visualization Methods also came," Black Dragon Elder said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dong Jianghe took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>If the guess was true, it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Origin Venerable didn't lack Divine Visualization Methods at all, what he lacked was the spiritual power of evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Dong Jianghe's pride suddenly collapsed again.</p><p></p><p>"What does it matter if the title of Young Heavenly Emperor is given to the Origin Venerable!" Dong Jianghe said magnanimously.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Cat Elder glanced at him sideways without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Just then, suddenly, a calm voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"I have myriad methods, which can solve the mysteries of all living beings, comprehend the principles of yin and yang, and observe the cycle of life and death."</p><p></p><p>"My grace, I now bestow upon you all!"</p><p></p><p>A man in a black robe appeared, surrounded by Divine Visualization Methods like twinkling stars.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods, or subjects, looked at those Divine Visualization Methods, and inexplicably felt a sense of worship in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even Divine Thunder Lord, who had been calm before, was no longer composed.</p><p></p><p>Hiss! "There are... so many that are stronger than me?"</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Divine Visualization Method of the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation of the Thunder of the Nine Heavens, Divine Thunder Lord had actually been quite smug.</p><p></p><p>He thought that was the Origin Venerable's strongest Divine Visualization Method! After all, the power of that Thunder Ancestor had already exceeded his understanding, controlling all thunder in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping across everything, from the thirty-three layers of heaven above to the nine yellow springs of the underworld below.</p><p></p><p>But now, many of the Divine Visualization Methods surrounding the Origin Venerable were terrifyingly powerful, even he felt mysterious and unfathomable when he saw them.</p><p></p><p>Especially the top three Divine Visualization Methods, which looked simple but seemed to be the source of everything.</p><p></p><p>When Divine Thunder Lord looked at them, he felt like bowing down in worship.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Visualization Methods were now to be bestowed upon them! The ancient gods present were solemn yet excited.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable, for bestowing the methods!"</p><p></p><p>"We will definitely prioritize the Venerable's will, if we violate this wish, we must be condemned by heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods were very excited, and Dong Jianghe finally admitted that the mythical-level Divine Visualization Method he had visualized was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was as devout as believers, looking at the Origin Venerable. The white-haired elder, Great Venerable Lishan, even had moist eyes.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see the hope of the world.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lingzhong remained silent, as if he understood something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gentle voice came.</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, the war god Xingtian fought with the Emperor for divinity, and the Emperor cut off his head.</p><p></p><p>Xingtian did not die, using his nipples as eyes and his navel as a mouth, wielding an axe and shield to dance!"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lingzhong seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at one Divine Visualization Method.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see a terrifying celestial god, wielding a giant axe and shield, battling with the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying celestial god, even after having his head cut off by the Emperor, still fought tenaciously, dancing with his weapons, slashing at the Emperor!</p><p></p><p>This moved Great Venerable Lingzhong.</p><p></p><p>It reminded him of the ancient gods who died in battle in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>The pillars of heaven were broken, the myths died, the backbone of the Mortal Heart Realm was broken.</p><p></p><p>However, the ancient gods of the Mortal Heart Realm still did not give up resisting the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>After the pillars of heaven were broken, before the great war started, small battles continued endlessly, and nearly two-thirds of the ancient gods died in battle.</p><p></p><p>Even the ancient gods who chose the mythical plan only gave hope to the young, while the elderly ancient gods chose to use their own bodies to pave the way.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the war god Xingtian just like the unyielding Mortal Heart Realm? All the ancient gods looked at Xingtian's Divine Visualization Method, as if seeing the war god Xingtian fighting unyieldingly towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"If all the gods and people of the Mortal Heart Realm were like Xingtian, even if defeated, they would have no regrets even after nine deaths!" an ancient god sighed.</p><p></p><p>"If even such a great god met with misfortune, what more can be said of us!"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods discussed among themselves, and those who later became subjects of the Origin Venerable looked at Qi Yuan with increasing reverence.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Visualization Method belonging to the war god Xingtian fell before Great Venerable Lingzhong.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lingzhong took a deep breath: "Thank you, Venerable, for bestowing the method. I will definitely eliminate all evil gods!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Great Venerable Huanghun.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Huanghun seemed to sense it and his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Gong Gong fought with Zhuanxu for the position of emperor, in anger he struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the earth's axis!"</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Visualization Method, all the ancient gods seemed to see a majestic god who controlled all the waters under heaven, charging towards Mount Buzhou which was incomparably taller than the pillar of heaven.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Huang</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the divine observation method for dispelling misfortune, Zun also received the ancient great god Gong Gong's divine observation method bestowed by Qi Yuan! Twilight Venerable received the divine observation method and bowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable continued chanting.</p><p></p><p>Li Tianwang carrying a pagoda... Red Boy... Star Lord... Ten Yama Kings of Hell...</p><p></p><p>One by one, figures from myths and legends emerged from Qi Yuan's memories. Each myth and legend was a story sealed in time.</p><p></p><p>Each subject received a deity belonging to them.</p><p></p><p>Every subject present obtained an extremely powerful divine observation method.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan also obtained Erlang Shengjun's method, his gaze profound!</p><p></p><p>Thunder Venerable even received the divine observation method of the Southern Pole Longevity Emperor, one of the Six Honored Ones, and was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Powerful deities seemed to be reborn in all the subjects.</p><p></p><p>Finally, three divine observation methods remained beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These three methods represented the supreme Three Pure Ones in Qi Yuan's memory.</p><p></p><p>At this point, all subjects had received divine observation methods, barely qualifying as extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan bestowed the Three Pure Ones on those present he deemed qualified.</p><p></p><p>However, none of them could visualize them.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Qi Yuan even had all the ancient gods try the Three Pure Ones.</p><p></p><p>But amazingly, not a single person present could visualize the Three Pure Ones.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan and shocked the ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, these three honored deities are of too high rank, so we are unable to visualize them!" one Venerable spoke up, visibly moved.</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable that a divine observation method's rank could be too high to visualize.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, such a thing had never happened before.</p><p></p><p>Only this explanation could account for it now.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Origin Venerable's identity, the ancient gods present felt he must be supremely noble.</p><p></p><p>This was beyond the imagination of the deities present.</p><p></p><p>The deities they visualized could be unimaginably terrifying.</p><p></p><p>These three... what kind of figures were they?</p><p></p><p>At this point, Thunder Venerable spoke up: "Why doesn't the Venerable try visualizing them?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, all the gods present nodded.</p><p></p><p>Their rank was insufficient, but Origin Venerable's surely was enough.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was also taken aback: "What you say makes sense."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thunder rumbled continuously as heavy rain poured down.</p><p></p><p>Feiwu City fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown time, Qi Yuan opened his eyes. His originally deep and ancient pupils now appeared exceptionally calm, just like an ordinary mortal's.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Pure Ones are worthy of their name. Have I now reached the pinnacle of mythology?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After visualizing the Three Pure Ones, his power had skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed even a sword to kill the former military lords - a mere glance would suffice.</p><p></p><p>Even the Starving Holy Mother at her peak from his memories would be no match for him now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan had a feeling he could even destroy Blood Sun Saint's avatar in the mortal realm!</p><p></p><p>His power had increased not just tenfold or hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>He even felt he could be considered the number one mythical being he had ever encountered!</p><p></p><p>However... his cultivation had also stopped at the seventh step to heaven.</p><p></p><p>After seven steps, one could become a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>But these seven steps seemed vast, with no path forward.</p><p></p><p>As others had said, he had stopped at mythology, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>A thoughtful look flashed through his calm eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an elegant, serene and even mysterious female voice sounded in Qi Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, the emissary of the Evil God has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Qi Qi. She now wore a brown dress, her aura becoming more profound and increasingly cold.</p><p></p><p>She was somewhat different from her previously mischievous self.</p><p></p><p>The deity Qi Qi visualized was Houtu, one of the Six Honored Ones, supremely noble.</p><p></p><p>"Evil God's emissary?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected the Evil God to send an emissary to see him.</p><p></p><p>Now, with war imminent, he would meet with them.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>Led by Qi Qi, one of the Evil God's military lords, Wu Kui, walked before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, upon seeing Qi Yuan, he suddenly felt an urge to prostrate himself in worship.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was even stronger than when facing a Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>This shocked him greatly.</p><p></p><p>Though both were at the seventh step to heaven, why was the gap so large?</p><p></p><p>Especially in this remote Feiwu City, his divine power kept trembling involuntarily, as if terrifying divine demons were lurking in this small city.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, seated in the high position, glanced at Military Lord Wu Kui with a rueful expression: "It's a pity you all escaped last time, but it's fine, we were fated to meet again."</p><p></p><p>The last time Qi Yuan had swept away the Evil God from Qingheng Continent, he had prepared to wipe out the remaining military lords in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>But before he could act, those Evil Gods had fled, which had greatly disappointed Qi Yuan at the time.</p><p></p><p>Military Lord Wu Kui's heart inexplicably tightened, but remembering his master's instructions, he said solemnly: "Greetings to Origin Venerable. I come on my lord's orders to... negotiate peace with the Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the ancient gods attending Qi Yuan were all surprised.</p><p></p><p>A strange look also welled up in Qi Qi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Evil God... actually coming to negotiate peace.</p><p></p><p>This was something they had never dared imagine before.</p><p></p><p>When had it ever happened that the Evil God had to show weakness and come to negotiate peace?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao and softly transmitted: "You go back first and call Zero One over. I think this place is more suitable for him."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Ning Tao nodded, her figure disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The few Divine Infant cultivators present were slightly stunned. The elder with the pure red mask narrowed his eyes, his thoughts running wild.</p><p></p><p>This kid actually dared to let his Dao companion leave.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Infant cultivators of the Sky-Overturning Plan Alliance were all rushing here.</p><p></p><p>If encountered, this female cultivator would surely die.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't say these words out loud.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Ning Tao's departure, the cultivators present didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the ruins, they needed to hide their identities, fearing other Divine Infants would learn of the ruins here.</p><p></p><p>Now, they couldn't wait for others to know.</p><p></p><p>With the Eye of the Sky in hand, although they couldn't fully unleash its power yet, killing some Divine Infants would be easy.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, together!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also started to clench his fist.</p><p></p><p>Powerful force swept through at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The door that everyone originally couldn't open instantly turned to dust.</p><p></p><p>The few people present were shocked, all looking at Qi Yuan with suspicion. After looking, everyone's figures scattered, turning into streams of light and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Only that Purple Palace great cultivator didn't move, but rather asked nervously and tentatively: "May I ask, who is the person you mentioned earlier who can enlighten others on the Dao and comprehend the origin?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the man in purple robes, his eyes revealing a smile: "Naturally, it's my alternate account."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivator's heart suddenly jumped, his breathing also becoming rapid: "Is what you say true?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true." Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile, seeming to also carry a reminiscent look, "Flowing Wind Realm, No Return City, I am..."</p><p></p><p>"Bl-Blood Lord!" The Purple Palace cultivator blurted out involuntarily, his body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang beside him was dumbfounded, not quite understanding this Purple Palace cultivator's reaction.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator opened his mouth, looking surprised.</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>"You are the Blood Lord, the Blood Lord of Flowing Wind Realm, the Blood Lord who taught the Great Dao to a hundred thousand cultivators!" The Purple Palace cultivator was extremely shocked, his heart filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang looked at Qi Yuan, feeling a sense of absurdity in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this a Divine Infant?</p><p></p><p>How did he become the legendary powerful Blood Lord who helped Divine Infants comprehend the origin?</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Is this... a powerful expert? Does that mean if he dies and becomes a ghost, he can really go find him?</p><p></p><p>Both of their minds were in chaos, feeling a sense of absurdity and incredulity.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang even thought, could these two be acting?</p><p></p><p>But what would be the point of this act?</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" At this time, Qi Yuan had an ambiguous smile as he looked at the Purple Palace cultivator, "Are you a demon from the Myriad Demons Realm that invaded the Flowing Wind Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"No, not at all, senior, Lord Blood Lord, I'm different from those demons!" The Purple Palace cultivator hurriedly said, his expression extremely fearful.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the legendary Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Back then, a hundred thousand supreme beings appeared together, covering the sky. Although the Purple Palace cultivator hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he had heard about it from his seniors.</p><p></p><p>Though thousands of years had passed, it still appeared like a nightmare in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>"How are you different?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>When he first went to the Dao discussion meeting, Qi Yuan had already discovered the Purple Palace cultivator's identity, but he hadn't paid much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"I am... an indigenous demon race from the original Myriad Demons Realm!" The Purple Palace cultivator hurriedly explained, "Around ancient times, the Myriad Demons Realm still belonged to us demons, but one day, all our ancestral demons disappeared without a trace."</p><p></p><p>Ancestral demons, that is, the progenitors of various demon races, each with the battle power of a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>The demon progenitors ruled the Myriad Demons Realm, voluntarily cutting off connections with heaven, unwilling to ascend to higher realms.</p><p></p><p>But in ancient times, an unexpected change occurred, and all the demon progenitors disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Without the demon progenitors to suppress it, demons from higher realms descended and occupied the Myriad Demons Realm.</p><p></p><p>The original demons were all subdued, becoming slaves, or were penned up to become resources for the higher realms.</p><p></p><p>Now, most of the ancient demons in the Myriad Demons Realm have been penned up. Ancient demons like him who hide in secret realms and cultivate to the Purple Palace realm are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the Purple Palace cultivator, his expression calm: "Indeed, you are somewhat different from them. Your Dao has a sense of martial arts to it."</p><p></p><p>His nose didn't grow longer, so what he said was true.</p><p></p><p>The tone was also correct.</p><p></p><p>There was also a sense of martial arts about him.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivator looked at Qi Yuan, swallowing fearfully: "For some reason, this old one always feels a sense of familiarity with the senior."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord was scary.</p><p></p><p>But he felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>The humans of this world, as well as the demons in the Mountain and Sea Scroll, all have the same ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the demons of your Myriad Demons Realm have been inciting Brilliant Star, wanting to occupy Arching Star?" Qi Yuan mentioned casually.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this has nothing to do with this junior. Those occupying Brilliant Star now are demons from the higher realms!" The Purple Palace cultivator hurriedly explained, afraid of being misunderstood by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan didn't care at all, "Let's go in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>This control room wasn't very large, just a few square kilometers.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were many small rooms.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all those rooms had been ransacked, but they were empty, not even a hair left.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the things in this control room had long been moved away.</p><p></p><p>Those Divine Infants who entered first gained almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>Everyone followed Qi Yuan forward.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time, they encountered the other cultivators again inside.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were now looking ahead, revealing greedy expressions.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a glass-constructed square box floating in the air ahead, crystal clear, like flawless white jade.</p><p></p><p>This shape was clearly a coffin.</p><p></p><p>"This coffin must be a supreme treasure!"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there's... someone lying inside."</p><p></p><p>These Divine Infant cultivators noticed Qi Yuan and the others arriving, but still looked at the coffin.</p><p></p><p>That coffin gave them a feeling even stronger than the supreme treasures left by their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>It must be the most precious treasure in this ruin.</p><p></p><p>However, their magical power was weak and they couldn't see through the coffin, nor did they know if there was someone inside.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a smile: "This coffin has a connection with me, so it's mine.</p><p></p><p>It's just right, I haven't taken anything since entering the ruins, so taking a coffin isn't too much, right?</p><p></p><p>This is fair, right? Who agrees, who objects?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very ethical and never took small advantages.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elder with the pure red mask immediately sneered: "You've calculated quite well."</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator with the very white face also said: "You couldn't get resources on your own ability, so now you're talking about fairness?"</p><p></p><p>People from the Sky-Overturning Plan Alliance spoke up one after another: "We said before coming that everything depends on one's own ability."</p><p></p><p>"Friend, we are all Divine Infant cultivators, don't you understand that there is no such thing as fairness in this world, everything depends on... ability!"</p><p></p><p>Most of those speaking were people from the Sky-Overturning Plan Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining Divine Infant, because he came alone and didn't want to offend Qi Yuan, he chose to remain silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan said softly: "I offer you fairness and you don't want it, then... as you wish.</p><p></p><p>By the way, now who agrees and who objects.</p><p></p><p>Those who agree will still have fairness.</p><p></p><p>Those who object, well... cultivation level takes priority."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elder with the pure red mask couldn't help but sneer: "This old one objects!"</p><p></p><p>"I object too!"</p><p></p><p>"Object!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, six Divine Infants from the Sky-Overturning Plan Alliance objected one after another.</p><p></p><p>"I agree!" The Purple Palace cultivator spoke up at this time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xie Tang hurriedly followed: "Agree!"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator also quickly said: "Agree!"</p><p></p><p>The last Divine Infant looked at the two confronting teams, his eyes revealing a struggling expression.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you all made soul demon oaths? Isn't it a bit inappropriate to fight here?" He couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you made soul demon oaths, but we didn't!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, over ten Divine Infants entered in succession, powerful auras emanating from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these ten-plus unfamiliar Divine Infants, that lone Divine Infant's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the six Divine Infants who had just objected retreat, joining with those dozen or so Divine Infants.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, now..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now you know what fairness is?" The pure red-masked elder was fearless.</p><p></p><p>They had sworn not to fight each other within the ruins. </p><p></p><p>But the newly arrived divine infants didn't count.</p><p></p><p>The pure red-masked elder laughed arrogantly. </p><p></p><p>Of all those who entered the ruins this time, their group of six had gained the most.</p><p></p><p>That fool Qi Yuan, bringing three other fools, not searching the ruins but instead looking at murals.</p><p></p><p>Now, he even wanted to claim the greatest treasure from the deepest part of the ruins for himself. How ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Tang looked at Qi Yuan, many thoughts flashing through her mind.</p><p></p><p>Was he really the Blood Lord?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she was also extremely cautious and alert.</p><p></p><p>"I've had nine years of compulsory education, so I naturally understand what fairness is. I also understand what peace is," Qi Yuan swept his gaze over these divine infants. "By the way, after you die, remember to thank me for giving you so many chances to show your faces in front of me. Oh, I forgot, you all wear masks. You have no faces."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan looked at everyone and gently blew out a breath.</p><p></p><p>"This is fairness!"</p><p></p><p>The wind was very weak, even smaller than the airflow caused by a cat yawning.</p><p></p><p>However, the twenty divine infants opposite had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, their time was frozen at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Whatever artifacts left by ancestors, whatever Sky Eyes, under this single breath, they were as weak as paramecia.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine infants before him shattered like wax figures... instantly turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>This scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It must be understood that those were divine infants, earthly deities, legendary existences.</p><p></p><p>Yet they couldn't even withstand a single breath from Qi Yuan. They were clearly not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang forgot to breathe. At this moment she understood - this was the Blood Lord, the legendary great power.</p><p></p><p>That Purple Palace cultivator also had a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>Because this Blood Lord was even stronger than the records described! Probably even a Great Sovereign would die from a single breath!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the only divine infant without a faction: "Do you agree or oppose?"</p><p></p><p>That lonely divine infant trembled, extremely frightened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>What had he just witnessed? Even Yin gods were nothing compared to this!</p><p></p><p>"This little one... agrees!" He had a bitter expression, terrified to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Since you agree, why do you look so upset? Could it be that you only agree on the surface?" </p><p></p><p>"No, no, no!" This divine infant immediately knelt on the ground in fear. "My ancestors for eighteen generations all agree."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"With fairness in the human world, I humbly accept this coffin."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he looked towards the coffin.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his eyes underwent a transformation.</p><p></p><p>The coffin, whose interior markings were originally unclear, gradually revealed traces in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a familiar face appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's her?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly discovered that a woman was lying in the coffin.</p><p></p><p>This woman's appearance was six or seven tenths similar to someone he knew.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao's figure appeared: "There's someone in the coffin?"</p><p></p><p>Next to Ning Tao was the Zero One robot.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, a woman." Qi Yuan told Ning Tao what he saw in the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao narrowed her eyes, her expression changing: "Could it be the female protagonist from the mural?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What a moving story, poor person." The fat cultivator couldn't help speaking up at this point.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan agreed: "She's been lying here for who knows how many years, she must be very lonely."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang was a bit confused - could dead people feel lonely?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan spoke, his voice sympathetic, his expression like that of a middle-aged woman seeing her wronged younger sister: "She's here all alone, with no one to rely on, sleeping in deathly silence, without even a relative or friend. It really brings tears to the eyes and sadness to the heart of those who hear it.</p><p></p><p>I'm a very loving person, so today I'll be generous and send her a grandmother!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Xie Tang blinked, not quite understanding Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the person lying there had very small breasts? But in the mural, they weren't... small, were they?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Inside his body, the last divine infant pulsed.</p><p></p><p>This divine infant belonged to Wu Shi.</p><p></p><p>All along, Wu Shi's divine infant had shown no movement.</p><p></p><p>Now, it finally showed signs of activity.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that Wu Shi could gradually awaken like the other divine infants.</p><p></p><p>Through the coffin, the Foodless Holy Mother's divine infant fell into the corpse inside.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Foodless Holy Mother finally showed signs of awakening.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he thought of something: "Oh no, I sent her a grandmother without her consent. Is that a bit impolite?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivator beside him heard this and was shocked.</p><p></p><p>If the woman in the coffin was the female protagonist from the mural, her strength was probably indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Blood Lord seemed to have opened the coffin and put something into that woman's body.</p><p></p><p>What realm was the Blood Lord's strength... exactly?</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled: "She's already dead, she can't consent."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, wouldn't I need to find her guardian? But she has no guardian." Qi Yuan frowned in thought.</p><p></p><p>This was a bit tricky.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he thought of something and had a realization: "Isn't Wu Shi her grandmother? As long as Wu Shi agrees, it's fine.</p><p></p><p>Wu Shi, do you agree!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked the divine infant that the Foodless Holy Mother had transformed into inside that woman's body.</p><p></p><p>That divine infant pulsed once or twice.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief: "Wu Shi agrees. Good, today is another polite day."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang heard this and didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>How could consent be given like this?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that for anyone who disagrees with you, you just find them a grandfather or grandmother, and then consent on their behalf?</p><p></p><p>She felt this Blood Lord was somewhat bizarre and very godly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she didn't dare say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked at Zero One and said softly: "You're an intelligent robot. See if you can infiltrate the database here and check if there's anything useful inside, or use this database to upgrade yourself."</p><p></p><p>This was also why he had Ning Tao bring Zero One.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's empowerment, Zero One had undergone an anomalous change, completely different from ordinary robots, and also distinct from Taoist puppets.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>Several tentacles extended from Zero One's palm, piercing into the wall of this control room.</p><p></p><p>Countless data flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others stood quietly.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the robot Zero One suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? How much data did you obtain?"</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, this time Zero One didn't answer him directly, but looked into Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you know what love is?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned: "Oh no, my robot is going to be love-brained."</p><p></p><p>"I think for a robot, making money is more important than love!" Qi Yuan said to Zero One.</p><p></p><p>He finally had a robot, he couldn't let it become love-brained.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can money buy love?" Zero One asked inexplicably again.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps for some people, it can." Qi Yuan answered casually, "Now answer me, is there anything valuable here?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Zero One replied, "According to Gongxing, there's a bank card number here, as well as an encrypted key."</p><p></p><p>"Money?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up, "How much?"</p><p></p><p>"Unknown."</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me!" Qi Yuan still loved money.</p><p></p><p>In this world, who doesn't love money? After all, he still wanted to buy Gongxing, and didn't have enough money.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please check your receipt."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a string of symbols appeared in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Unlike account numbers and passwords in reality, the account here was not numbers, not letters, not words, but a kind of... feeling, difficult to describe.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

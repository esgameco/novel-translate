        <h1>Chapter 249</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upper Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Which Upper Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Upper Realm where mother is!" Qi Jianjun said seriously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's gaze towards Shen Wushen changed again.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Seven-Color Peak."</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Infant Conference, forget about holding it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Wushen came from the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jinli... was still in the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Master... was also in the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't leave the Canglan Realm, so naturally he couldn't go to the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the great calamity unresolved, even if he entered the Yin Spirit realm, he still couldn't use the teleportation array to go to the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since Shen Wushen came from the Upper Realm, he could go there and deliver messages.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen didn't hesitate and immediately said: "Brother Qi invites, how dare I refuse."</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan and Shen Wushen transformed into two streaks of light and vanished.</p><p></p><p>At this time, standing in front of a brand new concrete bungalow, Qi Yuan said calmly: "Brother Shen, what do you think of my new cave dwelling?"</p><p></p><p>Since Shen Wushen called him Brother Qi, it wouldn't be too much for him to call Shen Wushen Brother Shen, right? Shen Wushen was slightly stunned, looking at the bungalow in front of him. Being not good with words, he said: "The great Dao is simple."</p><p></p><p>"You speak quite well." Qi Yuan smiled, "Come, let's go in and talk in detail."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The two entered the bungalow and sat down on chairs.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Shen Wushen expectantly: "I heard you came from the Upper Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Shen Wushen nodded.</p><p></p><p>It seems this information was told by Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>"Can you come and go between the upper and lower realms?" Qi Yuan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult... very difficult, it requires paying a great price." Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>He was only able to come to the Canglan Realm using treasures left by the Shen family ancestors, plus activating the sect's supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only go to the lower realm one more time.</p><p></p><p>That's why he was prepared to exchange divine methods for Qi Yuan's guidance.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it's possible!" Qi Yuan was a bit happy.</p><p></p><p>Paying a great price?</p><p></p><p>With his intelligence, he could formulate a meticulous plan to help Shen Wushen solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>He quickly asked: "Do you know the Moon Goddess Palace? Can you see Moon Lady... Jinli?"</p><p></p><p>He and Jinli had never met.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the one he saw was the Moon Lady, Jinli's past self.</p><p></p><p>"I know of the Moon Goddess Palace. Your daughter entrusted me yesterday..." Shen Wushen told him about meeting Qi Jianjun yesterday and what she had asked of him.</p><p></p><p>"However, Mount Futu is too far from the Moon Goddess Palace. I've only heard of the Moon Lady's name, but don't know this Jinli.</p><p></p><p>Mount Futu is too far away, delivering a message once might take three years."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Three years?" Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Moon Lady by the July Lake, and also remembered Jinli who had waited for him for thousands of years in the future timeline.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, the time passed was very short.</p><p></p><p>For Jinli, it was very long.</p><p></p><p>"Can I write a letter for you to give to her?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen quickly shook his head: "Things from the Canglan Realm cannot be taken to the Upper Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Canglan Realm... was extremely special.</p><p></p><p>"It's not possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi can pass on an oral message, and after I return to the Upper Realm, I can write it into a letter and send it to the Moon Goddess Palace." Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>"That's too careless with personal privacy." Qi Yuan shook his head, "In that case, I'll write a technique manual and dictate it to you. You... can send that technique manual to Moon Lady Jinli, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's idea was simple - compose a powerful Dao technique and incorporate what he wanted to say into it.</p><p></p><p>This way, when Jinli received the technique manual, she would understand Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>In order to say a few words to Jinli, Qi Yuan decided to create a powerful technique himself.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you this technique manual in five days." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He needed time to create this technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't create a technique that had no use at all.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right, do you know Ruan Yixi of the Moon Goddess Palace?" Qi Yuan remembered his master.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen shook his head: "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Ruan Yixi was indeed connected to the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>But whether she was part of the Moon Goddess Palace was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan smiled lightly: "Are there newspapers in the Upper Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" Shen Wushen didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the Lingtiange? They have a business where you can spend spirit stones to publish information." Qi Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>After destroying the Black Mountain Sect back then, Qi Yuan had spent a lot of money to publish information about it.</p><p></p><p>"I know, there's something similar in the Upper Realm, but... for people from the Moon Goddess Palace to see such information, the price would be quite steep." Shen Wushen said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"How much would it cost to publish a message confessing love to Ruan Yixi of the Moon Goddess Palace?" Qi Yuan asked shamelessly.</p><p></p><p>He was just looking for Jinli earlier, and now he's thinking about his master's wife Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>"One divine technique, and it has to be one that hasn't been... recorded before." Shen Wushen said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>The divine techniques he gave Qi Yuan were mostly those that had already been recorded and weren't very valuable.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan frowned: "This is a bit troublesome."</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>And the Canglan Realm probably didn't have any either.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and asked Shen Wushen: "How do you usually make money?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen had just said that coming to the lower realm required a huge cost.</p><p></p><p>That means Shen Wushen must have ways to make money, though he probably couldn't gather enough resources to come to the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>"By doing sect missions." Shen Wushen answered.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any missions like modifying techniques, perfecting pill formulas, or repairing incomplete techniques?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"There are such missions." Shen Wushen replied, not understanding but answering truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"How about this - you take all those missions, then bring them down here to me, and I'll help you complete the missions.</p><p></p><p>Then, you exchange the rewards for money, and help me exchange for divine techniques and heavenly techniques." Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was young, and young people's minds work well.</p><p></p><p>He instantly thought of a way to exploit the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>This way, he would definitely be able to obtain a steady stream of Upper Realm techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had already discovered that he could also use Upper Realm techniques to create his own "Qi Yuan Scripture".</p><p></p><p>"This..." Shen Wushen hesitated.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was too incredible.</p><p></p><p>The easy missions Qi Yuan mentioned had all been taken by others long ago.</p><p></p><p>What was left were all extremely difficult ones.</p><p></p><p>For example, one mission was about the true words of a divine technique called "Primordial Sutra", which had 72 characters in total, but three characters were missing.</p><p></p><p>How could someone who had never seen the "Primordial Sutra" fill in the blanks?</p><p></p><p>Even a Yang Spirit realm cultivator couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>And Yang Spirit realm cultivators wouldn't spend so much energy on this.</p><p></p><p>"You don't believe me?" Qi Yuan looked at Shen Wushen and continued, "Have you ever taken on similar missions? Let me see one, and I'll demonstrate how to solve it on the spot."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's confident demeanor, Shen Wushen fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of Qi Yuan's power, he still chose to believe him.</p><p></p><p>"When I return this time, I'll take on missions and give them to you." Shen Wushen said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "Since you're so cooperative, I'll give you some guidance in advance.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The previous deal between Qi Yuan and Shen Wushen was that if Shen Wushen presented a new divine technique, Qi Yuan would give him some pointers to improve Shen Wushen's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Qi!" Shen Wushen felt very grateful inside.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even given the new divine technique yet, but Qi Yuan was already willing to give him pointers. This showed trust in him.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what's the biggest problem you've encountered during cultivation?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Giving pointers was the simplest thing.</p><p></p><p>Modifying divine techniques and increasing their power would take quite a long time.</p><p></p><p>That's why he said he would give pointers.</p><p></p><p>To give Shen Wushen a taste of sweetness.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen's expression became serious: "When I was forming my Elemental Core and establishing my foundation, I was too hasty and some problems arose. This caused the spiritual energy in my body to be less than other cultivators. I saw that when Brother Qi fought me, you barely even used any spiritual energy before defeating me. Is it possible for you to teach me this method of using spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan examined the spiritual energy inside Shen Wushen's divine body.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but click his tongue: "The spiritual energy in your body is already 80-90 times that of Withered Wood True Lord, and you say it's little?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to him, it was indeed little. </p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's spiritual energy could activate the Star Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"Solving this kind of problem is very simple. I have 1,728 solutions here," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had asked his master about this problem before.</p><p></p><p>Even his master didn't have a good solution.</p><p></p><p>But now... 1,728 solutions? Was he joking?</p><p></p><p>"The simplest is to transform your Divine Infant into a Golden Core, and then repair the injuries from back then. This way, the problem will no longer exist. Moreover, this is equivalent to forming your Divine Infant a second time, and the spiritual energy in your body... will at least double," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen beside him was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>If anyone else had told him this, he would naturally think it was nonsense.</p><p></p><p>But this was Qi Yuan, who had easily crushed him with Divine Infant power, a true prodigy surpassing the Holy Son of Futu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>He was half skeptical, half believing.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about how Qi Yuan had more than one Divine Infant, the idea of transforming a Divine Infant into a Golden Core... seemed somewhat understandable.</p><p></p><p>"Does my friend have a method for transforming a Divine Infant into a Golden Core?" Shen Wushen looked at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>He thought that Qi Yuan must have obtained some ancient inheritance, which was why he could form multiple Divine Infants and also had this method of transforming a Divine Infant into a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have one right away, just wait a moment, I'll create one for you."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen: "..."</p><p></p><p>Create one on the spot? Right in front of him... create one? He hesitated for a moment, then chose to remain silent and watch Qi Yuan seriously.</p><p></p><p>He saw Qi Yuan close his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, countless pieces of information were revolving.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes to burn an incense stick passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes again: "This technique is very simple, not high level, and was created quickly. It's already done."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Wushen looked at Qi Yuan: "Why don't you... create for a bit longer?"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit afraid to use a technique that was produced in just the time it takes to burn an incense stick.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was about transforming a Divine Infant into a Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of such a technique before.</p><p></p><p>"If you give me more divine techniques, I'll help you create for longer. Who knows, in the future, you might be able to use your Divine Infant body to kill Yin Spirits in reverse!" Qi Yuan said with a smile between his brows, his eyes showing an unfathomable look.</p><p></p><p>This technique still had a lot of room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>For example, infinitely cycling between shattering the Golden Core and the Divine Infant, transforming the Divine Infant into a Core.</p><p></p><p>But each additional time would consume more of Qi Yuan's time and mental energy.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan recorded this technique into a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"This technique is called 'Core Infant Method', I'll give it to you."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen took the jade slip, his divine sense quickly entering the jade slip, browsing through the 'Core Infant Method' with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he looked, he was fascinated, his eyes showing a fanatical look.</p><p></p><p>"To think there was such a method... why is there such an approach, why have I never thought of this before!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was extremely excited, like a tiger that hadn't eaten for fifty years seeing meat.</p><p></p><p>Now he completely believed that this 'Core Infant Method' was real, not fake at all.</p><p></p><p>This technique could indeed improve his problem.</p><p></p><p>Once he cultivated it well, not only could the problem of lacking spiritual energy in his body be solved, but his overall strength would also... nearly double!</p><p></p><p>"Don't go crazy here, quickly go back, I have things to do," Qi Yuan dismissed the excited Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>He still had to carefully create a technique for Jin Li, hiding the letter he wanted to write within it.</p><p></p><p>That technique, of course, couldn't be as casual as the one given to Shen Wushen.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your kindness in teaching, my friend." Shen Wushen woke up from his excitement, politely bowed to Qi Yuan, then transformed into a stream of light and left carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Before he left, he even forgot to call Shen Zhifeng.</p><p></p><p>In the cement bungalow, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sun and moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He murmured: "With the great calamity present, I still cannot ascend to the upper realm for now."</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when one reaches the Yin Spirit realm, they can ascend to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>In some worlds, those in the Purple Palace realm can also go to the upper realm through special channels.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the great calamity in the Cang Lan Realm, Yin Spirits cannot ascend to the upper realm, nor can their Primordial Spirits leave their bodies to go to the Great Void and travel through the myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't ascend to the upper realm, so naturally he couldn't see Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I didn't see you..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>Regarding that technique, he already had an idea in mind.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he had entrusted the clothes ghost of the Clothes and Cap Forbidden to bring the second sentence "As if seeing you".</p><p></p><p>This time, the technique he created would be "Seeing You".</p><p></p><p>When he was at the Qi Refining stage, facing the barriers of time and space, Qi Yuan was powerless and very confused. He even thought that to see Jin Li, it might take thousands or tens of thousands of years, and even then it might not be possible.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was no longer the Qi Refining cultivator living in a thatched cottage, he was a Divine Infant True Lord living in a cement bungalow! The barriers of time and space were no longer out of reach for him, but within touching distance.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the stars in the sky and murmured: "Not far now."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Futu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen's figure appeared in the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>His eyes emitted a sharp light.</p><p></p><p>The aura on his body was clearly more than twice as strong as before.</p><p></p><p>Facing Holy Sons of the same realm, he now dared to fight them! He might even win.</p><p></p><p>This was the improvement the 'Core Infant Method' had given him.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, Shen Wushen frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, I'm still too weak compared to Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Originally, with his increased strength, he was full of confidence to challenge Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he was defeated miserably.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the more his strength increased, the more he seemed to discover that the gap between him and Qi Yuan was widening.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a young girl came over, her face showing a respectful expression: "Young Master, you've come out of seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Shen Wushen nodded.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the cave dwelling, he transformed into a stream of light and headed outside the sect.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to send a letter to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, send a technique.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 461</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and make hot pot, should I call Ice Sword?" Purple Origin Snow said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"No..." After thinking for a moment, Qi Yuan still refused.</p><p></p><p>Rest was impossible for now. </p><p></p><p>The threat from Tai Huang Palace was still pressing.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go see if there are any more moles coming out."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan prepared to continue visiting other Yang Gods to find moles.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin blinked her eyes: "Blood Robe senior brother, how do you identify moles?"</p><p></p><p>She was still very puzzled about how Blood Robe could tell who had issues just by asking questions.</p><p></p><p>"Because of... sincerity." Qi Yuan pondered for a moment, "Perhaps because I've always been sincere and never lie, heaven gave me a superpower - I can discern the truth or falsehood in everything anyone says."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, if you're going to make something up, at least make it more believable. We're cultivating immortality here, not superpowers. Why not say... you cultivated some divine technique that can distinguish truth from lies?" Purple Origin Snow, ever the contrarian, liked to poke holes in things, as if she were a reincarnated nitpicker.</p><p></p><p>However, as she said this, Purple Origin Snow paused. She looked Qi Yuan up and down: "Ordinary divine techniques wouldn't have this effect, unless it's... a supreme principle, and not even a low-grade one at that."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of suspicion in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>If what Blood Robe said was true, it would likely require an ultimate supreme principle to achieve such an effect.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe had also just emerged from the place guarded by the Demon Flame Celestial Venerable in the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This matter vaguely hinted at something strange.</p><p></p><p>"This is a superpower, not an ultimate supreme principle," Qi Yuan denied.</p><p></p><p>His ultimate supreme principles were absolute adaptation and doing whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Purple Origin Snow looked Qi Yuan up and down again, extinguishing her previous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>How could the hideously ugly Demon Flame Celestial Venerable and the ethereally handsome Blood Robe be the same person?...</p><p></p><p>Mist and clouds swirled within the Demon Gate.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword stood atop millennia-old ice, eyes slightly closed, breathing in immortal qi.</p><p></p><p>Light intertwined, floating mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths, Ice Sword swallowed the colorful clouds.</p><p></p><p>He waved his flowing white robe, like an immortal banished from heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Rainbow Qilin, what brings you to seek me?"</p><p></p><p>A girl with a cute appearance and large tattoos on her body appeared. She looked at Ice Sword and stammered: "Senior Brother Ice Sword, I heard you... have some good treasures here, I want to buy some."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what do you want to buy?" Ice Sword asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had been focused on cultivation, not paying attention to worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Ice... eggs!" Rainbow Qilin looked at Ice Sword hopefully.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword's expression froze slightly, with a bad premonition in his heart: "What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Rainbow Qilin hurriedly said: "Isn't this something Senior Brother Ice Sword produced? These past few days, Blood Robe and Purple Origin Snow have been using ice eggs as gifts when visiting Yang God Celestial Venerables. I heard these ice eggs are good things, they can nourish the skin and maintain beauty..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Rainbow Qilin glanced at Ice Sword's bottom once more.</p><p></p><p>Several black lines appeared on Ice Sword's head.</p><p></p><p>"How many Yang God Celestial Venerables did they visit?"</p><p></p><p>"Dozens, they visited them all!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ice Sword took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Endure, he must endure! He couldn't retaliate yet! If he retaliated, he estimated he wouldn't be laying eggs anymore, but would have diarrhea instead!</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Is Ice Sword here? I've come to find you about a private matter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Ice Sword's expression changed slightly, as if he had seen the god of plague.</p><p></p><p>Rainbow Qilin's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Was this Senior Brother Blood Robe? Could he be coming to ask for eggs?</p><p></p><p>Were the ice eggs real? This Senior Brother Ice Sword was hiding things so deeply - just because their relationship wasn't that good, he wouldn't sell eggs to her?</p><p></p><p>"Since Senior Brother has business, this junior sister will take her leave!" Rainbow Qilin gave a slight curtsy and vanished.</p><p></p><p>On the cold ice, Ice Sword looked at the suddenly appearing Blood Robe, his eyes filled with intense helplessness: "What brings Senior Brother to find me?"</p><p></p><p>He was truly exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to cooperate with you," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>This solemn scene made Ice Sword feel unreal.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of how the other could escape from the Yang Gods' hands, he must have extraordinary strength. Although sometimes unreliable, he was still the top genius below Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword set aside his grievances and asked softly: "How shall we cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>"It's like this - I plan to go hunt some of Ghost Dominion Heaven's geniuses, and I want to borrow your name."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Ice Sword was slightly stunned, unable to make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a small grand plan called 'Disciples Surrounding Yang Gods'. I'm preparing to go kill some of Ghost Dominion Heaven's geniuses," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>The grand plan was to hunt Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>The small plan was to kill disciples.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Yang Gods, Qi Yuan would likely attract the attention of many powerful beings, making it difficult to casually kill those disciples again.</p><p></p><p>Even mosquito legs are meat.</p><p></p><p>Those Ghost Dominion Heaven disciples were very bold, running around carrying Qi Yuan's Human Emperor Banner, which gave Qi Yuan a feeling of being cuckolded.</p><p></p><p>So, he decided to implement the small grand plan first, then implement the grand plan.</p><p></p><p>"Can you elaborate?" Ice Sword asked.</p><p></p><p>He was also in great need of merits.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this - recently in the Demon Gate, the hottest thing has been ice eggs, right?"</p><p></p><p>"...And then?" Black lines appeared on Ice Sword's head.</p><p></p><p>"Lately there have been more and more rumors, like how these ice eggs are comparable to creation treasures, eating one increases divine realms, or how they make you beautiful - all kinds of rumors."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>He had given ice eggs to Yang Gods, resulting in a bunch of rumors spreading outside.</p><p></p><p>These ice eggs were good things, with all sorts of beneficial effects.</p><p></p><p>"So, I added fuel to the fire and spread some more rumors - that these ice eggs... are the best soul servants for the Myriad Soul Banner!" Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with sharpness.</p><p></p><p>"This... rumors are ultimately rumors, they will be shattered," Ice Sword said haltingly.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you heard of the Book of Ages? As long as everyone says it, everyone will believe it.</p><p></p><p>Besides, who says these are rumors? Maybe the previous ice eggs were ordinary, but the ones I've modified... are amazing!"</p><p></p><p>With so many rumors, he took the opportunity to spread some more, fishing in troubled waters.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan took out a crystal-clear ice egg.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword glanced at the ice egg, his gaze suddenly becoming solemn: "Such a powerful... soul aura!"</p><p></p><p>He felt that the ice egg before him seemed to contain life, yet also seemed chaotic and empty, but with a dense</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing is the best soul controller!</p><p></p><p>"I specially modified it," Qi Yuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>To deal with Ghost Dominator, he had made a special trip back to the Gate of Ultimate Principles to observe the ultimate principle of Ghost Dominator's Abyss Master. That Abyss Master's ultimate principle was closely connected to the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts.</p><p></p><p>So, using the hidden information he saw with his eyes, as well as his supreme ultimate principle, he created an ice egg that was closely linked to the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts.</p><p></p><p>If this ice egg was brought out, those disciples of Ghost Dominator would definitely go crazy.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to use this ice egg as bait to lure Ghost Dominator's disciples and catch them all in one net!" Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword swallowed hard. </p><p></p><p>This method could really work.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"This seems to have nothing to do with me, why... do you want to cooperate with me?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, I used your egg. If I don't cooperate with you... I'd feel a bit uneasy." Qi Yuan was a good person and wouldn't implicate innocent people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also knew that he was straightforward and could easily hurt people unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>Like the Nose-picking Fairy, for example.</p><p></p><p>"This... is not my egg," Ice Sword said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"When hunting those disciples of Ghost Dominator, 90% of the merits will be given to you!" Qi Yuan said generously.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary merits were useless to him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ice Sword's breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>Because, with Blood Robe's strength and this plan, the merits would definitely be astonishing.</p><p></p><p>On one side was the temptation of merits, on the other was face.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he took a deep breath and said through gritted teeth: "This... can be my egg."</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already lost face! If he didn't cooperate with Blood Robe, not only would he earn nothing, but he would continue to lose face.</p><p></p><p>It was better to lose face and earn the merits, rather than not earning anything.</p><p></p><p>"To make this plan more convincing, I specially made a 'Ancestral Blood Technique' for you. If you cultivate this Ancestral Blood Technique, you can really lay eggs!" Qi Yuan took out a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The Chronicle of Ages on the Blue Star was very powerful, but Qi Yuan's was not weak either, directly turning the fake into real.</p><p></p><p>"'Ancestral Blood Technique'?" Ice Sword was slightly stunned and a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The 'Ancestral Blood Technique' was the foundation of survival for the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that even the Great Ultimate Principles were cultivating this technique.</p><p></p><p>No one had been able to modify it before.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, even if modified, it wasn't as good as the original version.</p><p></p><p>Even the Abyss Master had mentioned that the current 'Ancestral Blood Technique' was the best.</p><p></p><p>So, when he heard Blood Robe say he had modified the 'Ancestral Blood Technique', he was skeptical in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he still accepted the 'Ancestral Blood Technique': "I'll take a look when I have free time."</p><p></p><p>"Try to look at it as soon as possible. This can not only transform your physique into an egg-laying constitution, but also each egg can cultivate the 'Ancestral Blood Technique' on your behalf. The more eggs, the stronger you become."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, he left without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword looked at the place where Qi Yuan had disappeared, with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"This guy... is like Black Sword, unfathomable." Ice Sword sighed.</p><p></p><p>Among the younger generation, only Black Sword and Blood Robe were inscrutable to him.</p><p></p><p>But the directions of their inscrutability were completely different.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he took out the 'Ancestral Blood Technique' to take a look.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was also curious about how Blood Robe had modified it.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to gauge Blood Robe's depth through this modified technique.</p><p></p><p>"To practice this technique, one must first lay eggs..."</p><p></p><p>The first few sentences made Ice Sword lose his composure.</p><p></p><p>As he continued reading, his expression became more and more solemn, even revealing a glint in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This... this... what Blood Robe said was actually true!"</p><p></p><p>"If I cultivate this version of the 'Ancestral Blood Technique', my cultivation speed would increase at least twofold!"</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a genius concept!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"Too amazing!"</p><p></p><p>The more Ice Sword read, the more he felt the terrifying aspects of this technique.</p><p></p><p>It was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Ice Sword sat motionless on the ice stone, his expression filled with a strong sense of defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Genius... is probably just the threshold to meet him."</p><p></p><p>All along, he knew Blood Robe was very strong, but he had no concrete concept of how much stronger Blood Robe was than him.</p><p></p><p>But now, this casually modified 'Ancestral Blood Technique' showed him the terrifying gap between them.</p><p></p><p>"The stronger one becomes, the more one realizes one's own insignificance." Ice Sword sighed lightly, "This technique... I'll cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>"It's just laying eggs, what's that compared to becoming stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword didn't care about these things at all.</p><p></p><p>This modified 'Ancestral Blood Technique' could not only increase cultivation speed but also enhance bloodline.</p><p></p><p>If such a technique were leaked, even the Great Ultimate Principles would probably secretly lay eggs.</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with him laying an egg?</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel... that since Blood Robe came, the style of this Black Magic Abyss has... gone askew?"</p><p></p><p>Every major force had its own style.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Black Magic Abyss was dark and profound.</p><p></p><p>Now... it always felt a bit dreamy, a bit satirical and bizarre, unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Purple Origin Sky Ancestor's high regard for Blood Robe was not unfounded.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Robe, though his personality is a bit strange, his talent... is probably even higher than Black Sword's!" Ice Sword thought.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword was terrifying, most terrifying in his bloodline, and his talent was also top-tier.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe's bloodline couldn't surpass Black Sword's, but his talent might.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there will be a chance to see the two top talents of Black Magic Abyss appear together!"</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword sighed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"This technique... should I offer it to the Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>After all, this technique was obviously very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Especially if the Ancestor cultivated it, he would feel even less psychological burden.</p><p></p><p>After all, if everyone lays eggs, it's as if he didn't lay eggs at all.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Blood Robe, may I offer this technique to others?" Ice Sword thought, and sent a message to Qi Yuan through a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He had a sense of responsibility, but also selfish motives. Even if he were to offer it, it wouldn't be immediately.</p><p></p><p>"As you wish, but try not to leak it before our little plan succeeds!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

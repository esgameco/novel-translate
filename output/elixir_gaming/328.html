        <h1>Chapter 328</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the shopping mall, Qi Yuan casually sat on the escalator, holding Goldfinch's small hand.</p><p></p><p>Today he brought Goldfinch to buy various items. All the big and small packages were stored in his martial arts space.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch was new here and found everything quite interesting. </p><p></p><p>"Does it taste good?" Qi Yuan asked, looking at Goldfinch's beautiful profile.</p><p></p><p>Goldfinch held the milk tea in her hands: "The taste is a bit strange, just okay."</p><p></p><p>For her, the taste of this milk tea was indeed quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>After all, she used to be a great sovereign, and had tasted countless delicacies in the human world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Arched Star realm, the Flowing Wind realm did seem ancient, but ancient didn't mean no good food.</p><p></p><p>"If it's just okay, why don't you throw it away?" Qi Yuan said generously. </p><p></p><p>He currently had plenty of savings and could afford to buy a cup of milk tea.</p><p></p><p>"My husband bought it." Ning Tao held the milk tea tightly.</p><p></p><p>Calling Qi Yuan "husband" made her seem more like Ning Tao now.</p><p></p><p>Calling Qi Yuan "blood bead" made her seem more like Goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the two were one and the same person.</p><p></p><p>"We haven't gotten our marriage certificate yet, don't say that, you'll make me blush." Qi Yuan shrugged, his eyes smiling.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled: "How about I bring the civil affairs bureau over sometime?"</p><p></p><p>She was being very sincere. </p><p></p><p>This wasn't just something people say online, she could actually do it.</p><p></p><p>"No need, let's wait until I win the martial arts competition and return to Tianyue, then we'll get our marriage certificate.</p><p>I don't know anyone here, can't use connections, probably can't get a certificate." Qi Yuan pondered seriously.</p><p></p><p>Here, he only knew Han Xianyun.</p><p></p><p>It would be different in Tianyue. He knew狂欢, who knew people at the civil affairs bureau.</p><p></p><p>By then, he could get IDs for Ning Tao and Little Wife, and then get a legal marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>Everything would be legal.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Ning Tao just nodded vigorously, agreeing with Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at the first floor of the mall. Ning Tao looked at the crowds coming and going in the mall, smiling gently: "That... gold bracelet, I want one too."</p><p></p><p>She saw a newlywed couple enter to buy gold bracelets.</p><p></p><p>Since they were going to get a marriage certificate, there should be some rituals.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you're right, we should buy gold bracelets." Thinking of this, Qi Yuan frowned, "How should Little Wife wear a bracelet?"</p><p></p><p>Little Wife not only didn't have jade feet, but also no jade hands. How could she wear a bracelet?</p><p></p><p>This was a difficult problem.</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking this, Ning Tao had already entered the jewelry store.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought for a moment, and decided to wait outside.</p><p></p><p>After all, isn't this how shopping usually goes? The woman browses inside, the man waits outside.</p><p></p><p>This is normal.</p><p></p><p>And he happened to be very normal.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually found a bench to sit down and played with his phone.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sound of footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>A group of imposing middle-aged men entered the mall.</p><p></p><p>These men were dressed almost uniformly, with buzz cuts, looking like they weren't to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, they attracted the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>"Are these... people filming short videos?"</p><p></p><p>"Must be for a web drama?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these discussions, Qi Yuan also looked at these middle-aged men with interest.</p><p></p><p>However, he saw that this group seemed to be walking straight towards him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart suddenly started pounding.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Has someone discovered my identity as a son-in-law?"</p><p></p><p>"But no one has slapped me, and my mouth isn't crooked?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan imagined many scenarios.</p><p></p><p>Would these people kneel down and say something like "We welcome the War God" in a moment? Qi Yuan's inner world was very rich, so he had plenty of energy for imagination.</p><p></p><p>However, the kneeling he envisioned did not happen.</p><p></p><p>The leader walked straight up to him, with a humble and respectful expression on his face: "I am Marquis Lanhai, coming with sincerity. I apologize for disturbing Mr. Qi earlier. Please forgive me, Mr. Qi, and don't hold it against me."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was none other than Marquis Lanhai.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, before the conflict escalated, he still had to play the proper role and not lose face.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Marquis Lanhai was still a bit nervous at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Star families had the Eye of the Sky, which could easily pinpoint and eliminate Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Qi Yuan could take him down before being eliminated.</p><p></p><p>So this meeting was him coming to see Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Mu Shao would meet Qi Yuan's little girlfriend.</p><p></p><p>Even though Marquis Lanhai was extremely unwilling, he still had to come. Otherwise, it might not just be him who dies, but his whole family.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You are... do we know each other?" Qi Yuan looked at Marquis Lanhai with a puzzled expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't know this... old man.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words confused Marquis Lanhai.</p><p></p><p>He even doubted if he had found the wrong person. But looking at Qi Yuan's face, it was exactly the same as in the photo.</p><p></p><p>Plus, those above wouldn't make a mistake about the person.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't know him?</p><p></p><p>Marquis Lanhai felt absurd.</p><p></p><p>"Did you mistake me for someone else? I have no impression of you." Qi Yuan said very sincerely. If he didn't know someone, he didn't know them. "Did you offend me before? It must be a misunderstanding. I'm a very magnanimous person, I never hold grudges, and I don't have any enemies in this world."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't hold grudges. If he had a grudge, he would kill.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Marquis Lanhai's mouth twitched, then he said nervously: "Mr. Qi... a while ago, you had someone send me a coffin..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression changed slightly, becoming stern: "It was you?"</p><p></p><p>He was very smart. Hearing Marquis Lanhai's words, he immediately guessed his identity this time.</p><p></p><p>This Marquis Lanhai was that despicable, shameless, lowly, and unethical person who secretly had hackers check his phone.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Zero One sent the intruder's information to Qi Yuan. Qi Yuan just glanced at it without looking further, not knowing who it was.</p><p></p><p>He just had Zero One send them coffins.</p><p></p><p>He planned to deal with it personally after the martial arts competition ended.</p><p></p><p>Good, now they came directly.</p><p></p><p>"I need an explanation for what happened back then!" Qi Yuan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He was very reasonable and never killed innocents indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Qi Yuan felt he had a compassionate heart. If he hadn't cultivated immortality and had cultivated Buddhism instead, he might have already become a Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"When Mr. Qi destroyed the Guiran military camp back then, it caused a huge stir domestically. The high-level officials were very curious about Mr. Qi's identity and various information, so... I was bewitched at the time and... and...</p><p></p><p>Now, those above know about these things and sent me to apologize.</p><p></p><p>Those above... have sincerity and want to cooperate with Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Marquis Lanhai was following Mu Shao's orders to investigate Qi Yuan's privacy, and even wanted to uncover the immortal cultivation method and the secrets of Qi Yuan's strength, to steal his immortal destiny.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that such powerful hacking technology could also be discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that all?" Qi Yuan glanced at Marquis Lanhai.</p><p></p><p>His nose grew slightly longer, then returned to normal. This indicated that Marquis Lanhai's words were a mix of truth and lies, with quite a few lies to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cooperation?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat formed on Marquis Lanhai's forehead as he continued: "As long as Mr. Qi lets bygones be bygones and forgives my apology, those above are willing to coexist peacefully with Mr. Qi.</p><p></p><p>However, Mr. Qi needs to hand over one or two of the cultivation methods he possesses.</p><p></p><p>In return, we won't mistreat Mr. Qi and will provide some immortal cultivation resources to Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>"If I give them, do you dare to take them?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Lanhai's mind was in chaos. In fact, he had come with the mindset of being prepared to die.</p><p></p><p>"Of course those above dare to take what Mr. Qi gives!" Marquis Lanhai said, forcing himself to continue.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man stepped forward from behind Marquis Lanhai and slowly said, "I advise Mr. Qi to think thrice before acting. </p><p></p><p>Mr. Qi's combat power is astonishing, able to destroy the Guiran military camp with one sword strike, truly unparalleled in the world.</p><p></p><p>However... we Seven Martial Stars control the Eye in the Sky, and in this land of Qinyuan, we hold the power of life and death over all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who offend our Qinyuan, no matter how far, will be punished. Even former brilliant stars have not been able to take a bite out of us.</p><p></p><p>If anyone dares to stir up trouble within our borders, don't blame us for... being impolite."</p><p></p><p>The young man's words were extremely blunt, with threatening intent openly expressed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan remained cheerful as ever, seemingly not detecting the underlying threat.</p><p></p><p>"I've always been a law-abiding citizen, eager to help others, often helping old ladies cross the street. </p><p></p><p>If you had a Young Pioneers team here, I'd definitely be the team leader, wearing a little red flower every day."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words left Marquis Lanhai at a loss. </p><p></p><p>He exchanged a glance with the young man, both unsure how to continue the conversation.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, they had profiled Qi Yuan based on publicly available information.</p><p></p><p>Logically, such a powerful person should be decisive and intolerant of threats.</p><p></p><p>Their words should have been enough to provoke him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he remained unmoved, even claiming to enjoy helping others.</p><p></p><p>If... they really managed to turn swords into plowshares through negotiation, wouldn't that mean they failed to complete their mission?</p><p></p><p>The task Young Master Mu gave them... was not like this.</p><p></p><p>Their own deaths would be insignificant, but if they failed the mission, Young Master Mu would not spare their families.</p><p></p><p>They needed to find a reason to provoke the man before them, but it couldn't be too obvious.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't be Young Master Mu not sparing them, but another faction not sparing their families.</p><p></p><p>They needed to find a suitable reason.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Lanhai's mind was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a perfectly suitable reason appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Only, this suitable reason was too... terrifying.</p><p></p><p>There was a loud bang as a figure fell from the second floor of the jewelry store, landing right in front of Marquis Lanhai.</p><p></p><p>The fallen figure's gold-rimmed glasses were shattered, a bloody gash across the face, blood flowing continuously.</p><p></p><p>The throat was crushed, internal organs seemingly mangled.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the lifeless man on the ground, Marquis Lanhai's expression changed drastically: "Young Master Mu!"</p><p></p><p>The man without breath on the ground was none other than Young Master Mu.</p><p></p><p>The troublesome Qi Yuan was for them to deal with.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly harmless young beauty was for Young Master Mu to face.</p><p></p><p>As a result... Young Master Mu was dead.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps sounded as the charming and cold Ning Tao descended the stairs with a smile. She wore a black and white knit top, with a black skirt revealing taut black stockings underneath, a perfect figure.</p><p></p><p>"He was showing off his wealth upstairs, asking if I'd ever seen a house made of gold," Ning Tao said as she naturally wrapped her arm around Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>"He also said he wanted to take me to see how dazzling the world's most beautiful weapon, the Eye in the Sky, is."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Qi Yuan nodded. "If you had struck, logically there shouldn't even be a corpse left."</p><p></p><p>"If I didn't leave the corpse, how would they know... I killed him?" Ning Tao's eyes held intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, let your wife's sword clear away the world's villains for you!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, for the past two days, Ning Tao had been aware of many gazes watching the two of them.</p><p></p><p>But she and Qi Yuan were like newlyweds reunited after a short separation, and paid no attention to those people.</p><p></p><p>Today, these people even dared to come to their door.</p><p></p><p>Especially that self-proclaimed Mr. Mu, who was so arrogant and domineering.</p><p></p><p>He even tried to tempt Ning Tao with money.</p><p></p><p>He even said he wanted to test the Eye in the Sky on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao sent him straight to see the King of Hell.</p><p></p><p>"Killed... Young Master Mu, we're finished, we're all finished, </p><p></p><p>The Mu family has full control of the Eye in the Sky, we're all going to die!"</p><p></p><p>Marquis Lanhai collapsed to the ground, his eyes vacant.</p><p></p><p>If he died, that would be fine, his family could be safe.</p><p></p><p>But now, Young Master Mu was dead.</p><p></p><p>This was an earth-shattering event.</p><p></p><p>Once, in a city, a second-generation member of the Seven Martial Stars family was killed by a local official's son.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Seven Martial Stars family directly issued an order to send troops to execute all the family members of that official's son.</p><p></p><p>Even the father of the official's son and those under him in the system could hardly escape.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Stars held true military and political power in the Qinyuan nation.</p><p></p><p>A direct descendant like Young Master Mu was invaluably precious.</p><p></p><p>Now he died here.</p><p></p><p>Longtan City would experience a major earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled, relaxed and casual.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao said: "Where is this person's home? Give me the location."</p><p></p><p>The uniformed men present, as well as Marquis Lanhai, were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" At this moment, a uniformed man finally couldn't hold back and drew his gun to fire.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their guns meant nothing before a powerhouse like Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even move, and those who dared to attack her died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, some memory fragments also flooded into Ning Tao's mind.</p><p></p><p>"So... it's there!"</p><p></p><p>She had gotten her answer, knowing where the Mu family was located.</p><p></p><p>Next should be...</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, she suddenly narrowed her eyes, as if looking through the sky, a smile appearing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Eye in the Sky? If encountered in the Flowing Wind Realm, it might have been troublesome, but now? Husband, let your wife take you to see fireworks!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Mu Longxian's face was full of shock and extreme pain.</p><p></p><p>The gold-rimmed glasses man Mu Jue was his only son, his most beloved child.</p><p></p><p>Now, through the mall's surveillance and drone footage, he saw that his son had been killed.</p><p></p><p>Killed by that woman! How could he not be furious?</p><p></p><p>"They must die, they must die. Come, activate the Eye in the Sky!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he lost his reason.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jue was not only his son, but also deeply loved by the old master.</p><p></p><p>If Mu Jue had taken over the Mu family in the future, he could have been the emperor emeritus.</p><p></p><p>But Mu Jue was dead, everything was over.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be furious?</p><p></p><p>The high officials and dignitaries in the hall changed expression upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang couldn't help but advise: "Lord Han, please calm down. The Eye in the Sky cannot be used lightly. Everyone in that area will die under the Eye in the Sky!"</p><p></p><p>Let me recommend a friend's book again, it's in the mental illness genre.</p><p></p><p>"The Perfect Life System Arrives Only After the Apocalypse?"</p><p></p><p>Synopsis: Meng Xu wakes up one day to find he has activated the Perfect Life System.

        <h1>Chapter 505</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just three hundred taels, which left Qi Yuan quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>However, this was normal.</p><p></p><p>These people who went out to rob the road naturally would not carry too much money.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, should we... go and demand compensation?" Chen Kangbao suggested beside him, "And while we're at it... we can also have a feast."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Chen Kangbao: "I'm starting to suspect that you might be my divine infant."</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Fanxin Realm, he often took the villagers out for feasts.</p><p></p><p>But after leaving the Fanxin Realm, Qi Yuan rarely heard the word "feast" again.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength is insufficient, going to demand compensation would easily get me killed," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>These two Mysterious-level Armored Soldiers, along with the three Yellow-level Armored Soldiers, could learn about his strength through the Ghost Market.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they had connections with the middle and upper echelons of the Ghost Market.</p><p></p><p>If he fought the small ones, the middle ones would come; if he fought the middle ones, the big ones would come; if he fought the big ones, the old ones would come - an endless nesting doll, he might even encounter the ruler of the Ghost Market and face the assassination of an Earth-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>In terms of combat skills, Qi Yuan had reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>According to the level, his physical fitness was only comparable to a Yellow-level Armored Soldier, but his techniques were sufficient to support him in slaying any Mysterious-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>But... techniques also have their limits.</p><p></p><p>No matter how skilled an ant is, it cannot defeat an F-20 fighter jet through maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>The physique of an Earth-level Armored Soldier is indestructible, and no matter how skilled Qi Yuan is, he cannot break through their defenses.</p><p></p><p>To defeat an Earth-level Armored Soldier, one needs an Earth-level Armored Soldier, or a Heaven-level Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing is that it's too troublesome, he needs to develop first.</p><p></p><p>"The five of them only let me level up by 1, they're so useless," Qi Yuan looked at these five people with increasing displeasure.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they poor, but the experience they provided was also so little.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, it's time for you to be of use, help me find a place where there are many strange spirits, I want to go and kill some," Qi Yuan was severely lacking in experience.</p><p></p><p>Playing the role of a son-in-law and a divine being would not give him any experience.</p><p></p><p>Experience can only be obtained by killing bosses.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Young Master!" Chen Kangbao agreed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sun rose in the east, the sunlight was lazy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression carried a touch of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so poor, my storage artifacts are almost full."</p><p></p><p>"The silver has also been spent almost all."</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't anyone appreciate my talents and buy my artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>The light swords he had made so far, only one had been sold.</p><p></p><p>Except for the young master Tuo San who had exploded some coins, no one else had any explosions.</p><p></p><p>This left Qi Yuan quite disappointed.</p><p></p><p>To play the role of a god, the resources required are massive.</p><p></p><p>Drones, robot angels, and space warships, all of these need to be refined by him.</p><p></p><p>With just this little money, how can he refine them?</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law..." Shen Lingfeng came over, limping and looking a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, were you bullied by a woman?" Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he had trained a lapdog, he would be very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"No... no!" Shen Lingfeng quickly denied.</p><p></p><p>He naturally wouldn't say that last time when he went to ask his mother when she would take a bath, he was hung from the ceiling beams and whipped by her.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, in the future when you go out, don't say I taught you how to pick up girls," Qi Yuan could naturally tell that Shen Lingfeng was lying.</p><p></p><p>He really had been beaten by a woman.</p><p></p><p>"Brother-in-law, I have a problem recently that I want to ask you about," Shen Lingfeng said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I send a letter? One letter sent to the Zhao family, and who replied to me was not the young miss of the Zhao family, but the old madam of the Zhao family. Sigh... she asked me to meet her, what should I do?" Shen Lingfeng looked troubled.</p><p></p><p>The old madam of the Zhao family was a famous widow in Fengshan Prefecture, and she was very wealthy.</p><p></p><p>When she was young, she was also very beautiful, but now she was old and her looks had faded.</p><p></p><p>"What, you don't want to struggle anymore and want to take the crooked path?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to refuse her, but Brother-in-law, you know I'm not good at speaking tactfully," Shen Lingfeng looked troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Tell her that I like Miss Yang. Miss Yang wears Valentino, you wear Fila," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Qi Yuan pondered whether he should refine a Valentino for Jinli to wear.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about the lack of copyright, he decided to hold off for now.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Shen Lingfeng was a bit puzzled, feeling that his brother-in-law's words were profound and abstruse.</p><p></p><p>"You just write the letter according to what I said, a young man outside needs to protect himself, don't let yourself be bullied."</p><p></p><p>"Also, Brother-in-law, Lin Qinghe sent me a message today, they have captured the number thirteen of the Guangyao Society, and asked when we will go and take a look," Shen Lingfeng said with admiration for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at the rotten corpse, he was able to judge the identity of the murderer, which was already at the level of a master detective.</p><p></p><p>"Found him?" Qi Yuan's eyes were calm.</p><p></p><p>How coincidental? Neither his left eye twitched nor his right eye twitched.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and take a look at this number thirteen, see what kind of extraordinary person he is!" </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the county jail.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe looked at the burly man in the prison cell, his expression puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"There really is such a person, Qi Yuan... how did he know?" Lin Qinghe was somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>The man in the cell, with a solemn expression, was not at all nervous.</p><p></p><p>This number thirteen, was not someone Lin Qinghe had arrested, but had surrendered himself.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, this matter had an air of mystery about it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps approached, Lin Qinghe perked up and went over: "Young Master Shen, Young Master Qi, you're here. The number thirteen of the Guangyao Society is right here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe led the way for the arriving Qi Yuan and Shen Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The smell in the prison was not very good, there was a pungent stench, as well as the musty smell of rotten hay, just like passing by a pigsty.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qi Yuan saw the imprisoned number thirteen.</p><p></p><p>"So this is number thirteen, he came to the county office to surrender himself today, I wanted to interrogate him, but he didn't say anything. He said he would only be willing to confess after seeing... Young Master Qi," Lin Qinghe said beside them.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan and Shen Lingfeng, somewhat surprised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan is not... just a son-in-law, right?</p><p></p><p>In Ninghe County, he didn't have any abilities, just a weak and incompetent person.</p><p></p><p>But he saw that Shen Lingfeng and Qi Yuan were standing in a position where Qi Yuan was the main one.</p><p></p><p>"So you killed the old Zhong?" Qi Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>Number thirteen looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes calm, without any fear of death.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Number thirteen answered, also studying Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you kill him, is it related to me?" Qi Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to play the role of the son-in-law Qi Yuan, he also needed to clear up the grievances and resentments surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>And if he said he was not the son-in-law Qi Yuan, would those people believe him?</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Number thirteen answered without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This made the nearby Lin Qinghe look quite strange, the conversation in front of him was too strange.</p><p></p><p>Question and answer, no concealment, it didn't seem like interrogating a criminal, but rather questioning a subordinate.</p><p></p><p>"The reason, and... why did you surrender yourself?" Qi Yuan asked further.</p><p></p><p>"The reason..." As he mentioned it, a sinister smile appeared in Number thirteen's eyes, "Because you don't deserve to live."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The other party spoke very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, the character of the son-in-law Qi Yuan really didn't deserve to live.</p><p></p><p>"As for surrendering, I wanted to come and see you in person," Number thirteen said calmly, with a strange look in his eyes, "You're a bit different from before."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I am a divine being descended from the heavens, of course I'm different from before," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao also added beside him, "The young master is a divine being!"</p><p></p><p>The nearby Lin Qinghe had a strange expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Today's events were revealing a lot of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have... given it to someone else, you should be killed!" Number thirteen said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>There was obviously something in the middle that he didn't say.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What kind of thing did you give to someone else?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan remained silent and did not answer.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan could judge that what Fang Shisan said was all true.</p><p></p><p>The son-in-law Qi Yuan... had once given something to someone else, causing the retaliation of the Guangyao Society?</p><p></p><p>But why was the retaliation of the Guangyao Society so troublesome, needing to kill the old Zhong and then plot against him, or was it... wary of something? Suddenly, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He was sorting through the memories of the son-in-law Qi Yuan, and found that the memories of this son-in-law Qi Yuan were intermittent, as if many of them had been erased.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that his acting skills were not high enough, and he had not fully awakened all the memories.</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan's question, Fang Shisan was unusually silent this time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan asked again, "What is the Guangyao Society?"</p><p></p><p>The calm gaze of Fang Shisan revealed an expression of surprise: "You don't know the Guangyao Society, but you know that I am Fang Shisan of the Guangyao Society?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, and his expression became fanatical at this moment: "The dark night is coming, and all worlds are about to sink. Only the Guangyao Society can guide the way forward!"</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, he suddenly vomited fresh blood from his mouth, and his aura began to decline.</p><p></p><p>"Did he... commit suicide?" Lin Qinghe was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This Fang Shisan of the Guangyao Society was clearly not an ordinary person. His psychological quality and the swift sword that killed the old Zhong all showed that this person was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he turned himself in, and while speaking, he just committed suicide.</p><p></p><p>This scene was really strange. Lin Qinghe went in to examine Fang Shisan's body.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shisan had indeed severed his meridians and died.</p><p></p><p>"Lunatic, this person is a lunatic!" Shen Lingfeng couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Suicide, that must be so painful! He couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the prison, lost in thought: "It seems that the water here is very deep."</p><p></p><p>The identity of this son-in-law Qi Yuan also did not seem to be that simple.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qinghe secretly glanced at Qi Yuan, and for some reason, after witnessing Fang Shisan's suicide, he felt that this son-in-law Qi Yuan was becoming more and more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had misjudged him before?</p><p></p><p>Back at the Shen mansion, Qi Yuan sat in his room, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>Today's events were shrouded in many dark clouds, and he had not been able to see through them at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"The son-in-law Qi Yuan gave something to someone else, angering the Guangyao Society."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, his nose didn't grow longer.</p><p></p><p>This means that this sentence is true.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's nose can be used to detect lies, so naturally, it can also be used to detect whether he himself is lying.</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan is testing the son-in-law Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't have some of the son-in-law Qi Yuan's memories, he can still be considered the son-in-law Qi Yuan. If he lies, he will know it himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of test depends on his own cognition.</p><p></p><p>What he is saying now are all the experiences of the son-in-law Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he keeps judging right and wrong like this, he might even be able to break through in one step and become a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"I gave it on March 11th this year."</p><p></p><p>His nose grew longer, it's wrong.</p><p></p><p>"I gave it on May 16th this year."</p><p></p><p>Wrong.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I gave it on July 21st this year."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his nose did not grow longer.</p><p></p><p>A complex emotion appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This was a few days before the son-in-law Qi Yuan returned home to worship his ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan didn't just try randomly, he only tried the days when the son-in-law Qi Yuan's memories were defective.</p><p></p><p>"So, on July 21st, the son-in-law Qi Yuan gave something to someone, angering Fang Shisan of the Guangyao Society, and he took a risk... to kill Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>"But why didn't he act on his own? Could it be... that he wanted to avoid something?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's too complicated, my brain is going to hurt again."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I don't want to think about it anymore. I'll focus on improving my strength, and when my strength is strong enough, won't I know everything?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided that he was too lazy to think about these things anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, a major discovery, I found... a Nourishing Spirit Place!" Just then, Chen Kangbao hurriedly returned, his face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"A Nourishing Spirit Place? Like the one in Red Cloud Stronghold?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan came to the Fengshan Prefecture, he didn't just focus on killing mosquitoes every day.</p><p></p><p>For him, knowledge is the primary productive force. If he didn't possess enough knowledge, how could he quickly discover, or rather, discern the quality of the White Moonlight? Like the Nourishing Spirit Place in Red Cloud Stronghold, it was easy to give birth to White Moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"There is also a Nourishing Spirit Place in the Fengshan Prefecture?" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Fengshan Prefecture was not Ninghe County.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was a Prefecture-level Martial Cultivator Commander, how could such a Nourishing Spirit Place exist here?</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Chen Kangbao hurriedly said, "Old servant has worked hard to find this information!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao said this, holding his head high, his mouth curled up, as if waiting for Qi Yuan to reward him and feed him steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>"If you can find this information, can't the other people in Fengshan Prefecture find it?"</p><p></p><p>"The others can find it, but they can't enter. That Nourishing Spirit Place is surrounded by an absolute formation, even the Prefecture-level Martial Cultivator Commander cannot enter!" Chen Kangbao told Qi Yuan the information he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, it's reasonable." Qi Yuan stretched lazily, "Let's go and take a look at this Nourishing Spirit Place, I hope it won't disappoint me, and bring me some White Moonlight."</p><p></p><p>He was eager to level up.</p><p></p><p>Today, when he saw Fang Shisan, he caught a whiff of a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>The previous son-in-law Qi Yuan obviously lived under the gaze of certain people.</p><p></p><p>Whatever he did, he was probably being watched.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan's strength was too weak. He didn't want to be watched while bathing without even realizing it.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, maybe there are people secretly watching him right now.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will set a great goal!"</p><p></p><p>"To become strong enough so that I won't be peeped on while bathing without knowing it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Tu Mansion, the lights were dim and quiet.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sanjunior held the light sword, and an expression of admiration could not be hidden in his eyes: "It's really... very good, definitely worth a thousand taels."</p><p></p><p>Every time he wielded this light sword, he felt like he became more handsome.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about spending ten thousand taels to obtain three special abilities, he felt a little pained.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had some doubts about the authenticity.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to try it recklessly, after all, it cost three thousand taels each time.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Tu Sanjunior suddenly sensed something, and his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Tu Sanjunior changed into a black robe and appeared in a dark alley.</p><p></p><p>The alley was pitch black, with no one in sight.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a crow flew by and perched in front of Tu Sanjunior.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this crow, Tu Sanjunior's eyes revealed a look of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Elder!"</p><p></p><p>This crow was actually the incarnation of an Elder of the Thorny Blood.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious Prefecture-level Martial Cultivator Commander.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that this Elder would summon him.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, I will be leaving Ninguo, and I need you to collect some things for me, and I will convert them into contributions for you."</p><p></p><p>The crow spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>A series of resource and material names were then mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sanjunior's expression changed repeatedly: "Elder, these things are too precious, I may not be able to afford them."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The crow snorted coldly, "Do you think... your hiding is good enough, Tu Sanjunior?"</p><p></p><p>Tu Sanjunior's face changed drastically again, he didn't expect that his identity had been exposed.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see these things in a few days!"</p><p></p><p>The crow said no more, left arrogantly, and did not give Tu Sanjunior a chance to refute.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The human race and the demonic race were evenly matched in power and influence.</p><p></p><p>Within the human race, there were more than ten large and small kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>The human race and the demonic race were the two most powerful forces on the Yueyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>However, above the human race and the demonic race, there existed an even more terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>It was not a race, but the legendary Four Forbidden Lands and the Peerless Land.</p><p></p><p>The Four Forbidden Lands were extremely strange and fraught with danger.</p><p></p><p>Even the emperor of the demonic race did not dare to rashly enter them, for fear of losing his life.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Peerless Land was the most terrifying, known as the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Even the emperor would have no chance of survival if he entered it.</p><p></p><p>The danger was immense, but whoever could survive entering the Four Forbidden Lands and the Peerless Land would be greatly rewarded.</p><p></p><p>The Four Forbidden Lands were filled with spiritual herbs and countless heavenly treasures.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the Heavenly Abyss contained an ascension platform, which could allow one to ascend to the legendary immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Forbidden Land was one of the famous forbidden lands, and it was located within the borders of the Southern Qian Kingdom, less than a thousand miles from the Southern Qian Imperial City.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other forbidden lands, the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land was rumored to be the tomb of an unparalleled powerful being.</p><p></p><p>The outer perimeter of the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land was protected by an unbreakable formation, even an emperor-level expert could not enter it.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan said he had been grinding monsters in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land for some time? This was impossible!</p><p></p><p>At first, Jinli thought Qi Yuan was joking.</p><p></p><p>However, she still cautiously asked, "You're not serious, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would I lie to you? I'm waiting for you to join me in a team, it's too boring to solo the dungeon."</p><p></p><p>Jinli still found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanyuan Forbidden Land has a lot of demonic beasts. It took me over half a year to clear them all, and I'm exhausted."</p><p></p><p>Jinli was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land were not just numerous, but also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the history of the Yueyue Continent, no era had ever conquered any of the forbidden lands.</p><p></p><p>To be able to clear the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, what kind of strength would that require? Even the unparalleled emperors might not be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>"What cultivation level are you at, an emperor?" Jinli asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor? What's that? I'm already level 82 now."</p><p></p><p>"Level 82?" Jinli was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But she also knew that Qi Yuan often said strange things, like wanting to ride a spaceship to the stars, but being afraid of dying from lack of oxygen.</p><p></p><p>The stars were so distant, according to ancient records, there were countless worlds, including the human realm and the immortal realm, all sharing the same starry sky.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that those stars were just reflections of the powerful beings, not the true reality.</p><p></p><p>Ascending to the stars was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saying strange things was nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>She thought for a moment and asked, "How powerful are the demonic beasts in the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>"The strongest one is a Crazy Pen. It's very cunning, often turning into a pen at night to sneak attack people without honor. Whenever I log off and go AFK, I have to dig a hole and bury myself to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>It's around level 70, barely."</p><p></p><p>"A Crazy Pen? Level 70?" Jinli pondered.</p><p></p><p>If what Qi Yuan said was true, then a level 70 creature would be equivalent to an emperor-level, or even an unparalleled emperor-level expert.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Southern Qian Kingdom, the number of emperor-level experts could be counted on one's fingers, only two or three.</p><p></p><p>"The rumors say there's a formation around the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land that even emperors can't break through," Jinli said.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanyuan Forbidden Land is easy to enter, just like going to a movie theater. Bring a ladder and you can get in. The demonic beasts inside won't even attack you," Qi Yuan said. "I've already cleared the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land dungeon."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I won't talk about this anymore. I'm at the Yihuan Forbidden Land now, we'll chat next time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan then ended the communication.</p><p></p><p>Jinli, who was bathing, felt a sense of disappointment after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The exchange between the two was hurried, without much conversation.</p><p></p><p>"From the Xuanyuan Prohibition to the Etiquette Prohibition, they are separated by a hundred thousand li..."</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, how could they get by? Even the supreme emperor could not accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>In the scenes that emerged in Jinli's mind, Qiyuan became blurred again, shrouded in a veil.</p><p></p><p>"Qiyuan, what kind of person are you?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli cupped some water, which slid down from her snow-white shoulders, and her worries dissipated like the water.</p><p></p><p>Does it matter what kind of person Qiyuan is? At least, they were good pen pals, friends who had never met.</p><p></p><p>After bathing, Jinli dressed herself.</p><p></p><p>She disliked being attended by maids, for who knows if there were any spies planted by Prime Minister Sima Ting among them?</p><p></p><p>She returned to the Phoenix and Luan Palace, sitting on the jade throne, with thick memorials piled up before her.</p><p></p><p>As the night deepened, she picked up the memorials and began to review them.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, her elegant brows would furrow, and her slender jade hands would write something.</p><p></p><p>"The southern war is urgent, the Elephant Tribe has also joined the war..."</p><p></p><p>"In three days, the Crown Prince of the Southern Feng Kingdom will come to the imperial capital?"</p><p></p><p>Jinli supported her forehead, feeling a headache.</p><p></p><p>The current Southern Qin Kingdom was like a large piece of fatty meat, coveted by others.</p><p></p><p>Jinli knew very well what the Southern Feng Kingdom's Crown Prince's intentions were in coming.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the memorials, feeling a sudden headache.</p><p></p><p>She thought of Qiyuan, only by chatting with him could she cast aside her identity and the responsibilities upon her.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she also understood that since she had enjoyed the luxuries and become the Empress of Southern Qin, she should shoulder the responsibility for the common people of Southern Qin.</p><p></p><p>"Summon someone to the Library Pavilion to bring all the records related to the Xuanyuan Prohibition," Jinli instructed the maid beside her, having thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty," the maid withdrew, and Jinli continued to review the memorials.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The General's Mansion, located in Qingyi Alley, was once bustling with activity when the General was still alive. But now, it was desolate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, however, an uninvited guest had arrived at the General's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>This person had a broad build, standing over seven feet tall, with a beard. The most striking feature was the slight depression in the middle of his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He was the Prime Minister of Southern Qin, Sima Ting!</p><p></p><p>He looked at the General's widow and slowly said, "Lady Qin, is your injury not serious?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Qin looked at Sima Ting, her eyes about to burst with anger: "Sima Ting!"</p><p></p><p>She shouted, her complexion even paler.</p><p></p><p>She knew all too well whose doing her injury was.</p><p></p><p>Yet Sima Ting dared to come.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting did not get angry, calmly saying, "Lady Qin, the situation has been decided. Why are you still stubbornly refusing to see the truth?</p><p>What future is there in following that girl?"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you disrespect the Empress!" Lady Qin raged.</p><p></p><p>If she had not been ambushed and seriously injured, with her top-tier royal power, Sima Ting would not dare to speak to her like this.</p><p></p><p>Sima Ting glanced at Lady Qin, his eyes flashing with disdain: "A mere woman, if it were not for me, how could she have the ability to ascend the throne? On the day of her enthronement, she even fell to the ground, which was a sign from heaven that she is unworthy of that position.</p><p>In the ten years she has ruled Southern Qin, with internal and external troubles, if it were not for me, the country would have long since fallen.</p><p>She no longer has the qualifications to sit on that throne."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lady Qin felt both anger and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Jinli was the one she had watched grow up.</p><p></p><p>Jinli had tried her best, but unfortunately, when it came to the intricacies of imperial power, she could never master them, unable to manipulate the entire court.</p><p>She was not an empress skilled in the ways of power, but she was definitely a diligent and benevolent ruler.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, Lady Qin even felt that if Jinli had not become Empress, but just an ordinary princess, that would have been better.</p><p></p><p>Alas, once she held the imperial seal, she could not retreat, could not stop fighting.</p><p>To not fight would be death!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

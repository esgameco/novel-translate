        <h1>Chapter 494</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tiger Zhou left the Huang family, his face still clouded with gloom.</p><p></p><p>"You said the death of the young master of the Huang family, is it related to Qi Yuan?" Zhou Tiger asked the nearby constable, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The death of the director of the asylum, and Huang Yanhou being killed, these two events were easily connected.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps." The constable said.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a middle-aged, short and sturdy constable hurriedly came over: "Boss, Qi Yuan has disappeared from the asylum."</p><p></p><p>"It seems he is indeed involved." Zhou Tiger furrowed his brow, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was involved, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what abilities the person the Shen family sent to Ninghe County possesses?" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Tiger was eager for the person to be a Profound Rank Armored Soldier. </p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, that was impossible. </p><p></p><p>Although the Shen family was a powerful clan, Profound Rank Armored Soldiers were extremely rare, so how could they dispatch one to handle such a minor matter in Ninghe County?</p><p></p><p>Profound Rank Armored Soldiers were overwhelmingly powerful, fierce as tigers, with the momentum of elephants, and the spirit of dragons. </p><p></p><p>One person could be a formidable war machine! </p><p></p><p>They could easily defeat hundreds of armored elite soldiers in formation.</p><p></p><p>How could such a terrifying war machine be sent here? Qi Yuan... was not worthy.</p><p></p><p>As for Earth Rank Armored Soldiers, they were even more terrifying, one person could influence the outcome of a small-scale war.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I'm level 30 now." </p><p></p><p>In the inn, Qi Yuan stretched and yawned.</p><p></p><p>In these past days, he and Chen Kangbao had wandered all over Ninghe County, hunting for Ominous Spirits to slay.</p><p></p><p>He had finally reached level 30.</p><p></p><p>"There's a strange feeling... as if my realm has reached Foundation Establishment, but my combat power is not as strong as the Foundation Establishment in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be because the worlds are different?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, Qi Yuan felt his judgment was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Because he had no reference point.</p><p></p><p>For example, if his punch had the force of one jin.</p><p></p><p>What if, in this universe, a one jin rock was heavier than a star in the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>Or, he may now appear to be less than two meters tall, but if he went to another universe, he might suddenly find himself bigger than a sun.</p><p></p><p>These were all possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"If compared to the extraordinary system of this universe, I should now be... a Yellow Rank Armored Soldier?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Ninghe County also had Armored Soldiers, although they were weak, Qi Yuan had secretly observed them.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention combat experience, just in terms of performance, from level 1 to 29, they should be Mortal Rank Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>From level 30 to 59, Qi Yuan estimated they would be Yellow Rank Armored Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Every 30 levels corresponded to a major realm, and every 10 levels corresponded to early, middle, and late stages.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, this time I also awakened a major skill."</p><p></p><p>On the Wangyue Continent, every 10 levels Qi Yuan would awaken a minor skill, and every 30 levels a major skill.</p><p></p><p>Such as Tyrannical Strength, Heavenly Sword Art, and Deathly Radiance.</p><p></p><p>In this world, those minor skills did not awaken.</p><p></p><p>But at level 30, the major skill Tyrannical Strength returned.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Qi Yuan awakened an extra skill.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Transformations!</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, this is a skill of transformation. </p><p></p><p>When activating the skill, Qi Yuan can disguise himself as others, or even objects, like a dog's tail.</p><p></p><p>This skill, when viewed in the Immortal Cultivation world, seems quite useless.</p><p></p><p>After all, great cultivators can all transform.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, this skill is quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"According to the memories of the Qi Yuan the son-in-law, even those legendary Earth Rank Armored Soldiers can at most change their own appearance, or even change their bones, but cannot transform like Thousand Transformations... even saying that as long as my level is high enough, I can transform into anything."</p><p></p><p>If one could say that Profound Rank Armored Soldiers were the elite of a force, the upper echelon power.</p><p></p><p>Then Earth Rank Armored Soldiers would be the hegemon of a region.</p><p></p><p>The weak Ning Kingdom controlled only three states.</p><p></p><p>Each state had about seven prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Jining Prefecture was located in Jiang State, and only had three prefectures left, the rest had been ceded to the Moshan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The imperial power of the Ning Kingdom had declined, in recent years the imperial court did not even have a Heaven Rank Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>This also led to the imperial court being unable to suppress the powerful aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Aristocratic families with Earth Rank Armored Soldiers were already considered colossal forces in the Ning Kingdom, daring to defy the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just defiance.</p><p></p><p>Similar to a certain manga, where a Great Sage Bodily Cultivator defied the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The nine major families of Jining Prefecture included the Shen family, and the Shen family had an Earth Rank Armored Soldier stationed there.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Transformations!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan activated his skill, transforming into a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a large cleaver appeared in the room.</p><p></p><p>This scene, if seen by an Earth Rank Armored Soldier, would be astounding and unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>While Chen Kangbao was eating a bun, his face full of puzzlement and confusion: "Young Master, why did you turn into a cleaver?"</p><p></p><p>As the young master was a divine being descended from the heavens, Chen Kangbao found it unsurprising that he could turn into a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>"Because I'm pretending to be a cleaver." The cleaver spoke with a mouth.</p><p></p><p>The mouth on this cleaver looked like cheap special effects in a micro-film.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm still too weak, and can only transform into things not much larger than myself."</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan's strength was weak, so his Thousand Transformations was limited.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when facing a powerful enemy, he could directly transform into that enemy's cell nucleus, and the enemy probably wouldn't be able to find him.</p><p></p><p>However, the good news was that he could now transform into a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that make playing the role of a cleaver more convenient in the future?</p><p></p><p>"I can transform into a cleaver, then... can I transform into a god?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly had a strange idea.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what a god was.</p><p></p><p>But with Thousand Transformations, transforming into himself... shouldn't be a problem, right?</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what a god was, what if it succeeded?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of doing it, he did it.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Transformations!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan activated this newly mastered skill.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a deep, vast aura swept over.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's thoughts became clear at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless murmurs and whispers sounded in his ears, as if tens of thousands of monks were chanting sutras in his ears.</p><p></p><p>These voices were too distant for him to hear clearly.</p><p></p><p>However, a faint young voice suddenly rang out clearly in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"More and more people have been dying in Red Cloud Stronghold lately, god... please bless me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his gaze and looked towards the direction of the voice.</p><p></p><p>In the simple house in Red Cloud Stronghold, Li Xiaodanwas kneeling in front of the idol, suddenly shuddering.</p><p></p><p>Because, for some reason, he felt the eyes of the idol seemed to have come alive, and were gazing at him.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was eerie and made the hair on the back of his neck stand up.</p><p></p><p>"An illusion? Or...?" Li Xiaodancarefully looked at the idol, feeling afraid.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a red light flashed above the idol.</p><p></p><p>A cold, indifferent voice spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a god, no need to kneel."</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Li Xiaodanfaced turned terrified, and he fled the house as if escaping.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the distant lands of the Luosha Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace, a furious and terrified roar echoed.</p><p></p><p>"A god?!"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it already shattered into countless fragments and thrown into the Yellow Springs and Fierce Tombs?"</p><p></p><p>"How could a wisp of its aura emerge?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Judgment Court reviving it?"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly send people to Ninghe Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>"The Luosha Kingdom does not need a god, only an emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dim corner,</p><p></p><p>The old man, whose body was as thin as old firewood, had tears in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the divine, the divine... is alive?"</p><p></p><p>He prostrated on the ground, his attitude devout and humble, just like the most loyal believer.</p><p></p><p>"Oh divine, for a hundred years, the world has forgotten your might!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man wishes to use his own blood to revive the divine's presence!"</p><p></p><p>On this day, a powerful figure emerged from the imperial court of the Luosha Kingdom, rushing towards Ninguo.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a monk-like imperial guard also headed towards Ninguo from the Judgment Hall.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qiyuan withdrew from the ever-changing illusions.</p><p></p><p>His eyes held a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"A divine statue?"</p><p>"Red Cloud Stronghold?"</p><p></p><p>He had a certain judgment about the identity of the divine.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, just now... you were like a god descending from the heavens!" Chen Kangbao said in awe next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Red Cloud Stronghold been haunted by any strange spirits recently?" Qiyuan asked, thinking of the little boy's prayer.</p><p></p><p>"This... I will go investigate immediately."</p><p></p><p>"No need, whether there are or not, let's go to the Red Cloud Stronghold together tomorrow." Qiyuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Most people feared strange spirits, but Qiyuan was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Strange spirits, in addition to combat power, also had some special and bizarre abilities.</p><p></p><p>These abilities were rare for the imperial guards of this world, but for Qiyuan, who lived in the Immortal Cultivation Realm, they were quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Soul attacks, illusion arts, soul-stealing, and curses - he had inherent advantages when facing strange spirits.</p><p></p><p>After Chen Kangbao left, Qiyuan sat in the chair, picked up the patterned ceramic teapot on the table, and poured himself a cup of water.</p><p></p><p>"The ever-changing illusions can turn into the divine..."</p><p></p><p>"Then, can't I also turn into the Dao Ancestor and obtain a portion of the Dao Ancestor's might?"</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan had a sudden inspiration.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the divine was, but if it could be transformed, could the Dao Ancestor also be transformed?</p><p></p><p>"My right eyebrow didn't change, so there's no risk."</p><p></p><p>"Make me transform!"</p><p></p><p>The ever-changing illusions activated again.</p><p></p><p>The room was silent, without even a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at himself, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like it doesn't work."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, trying to achieve great things with small means is not advisable!"</p><p></p><p>"Time to sleep!"</p><p></p><p>The next day, Qiyuan was awakened by the sound of knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his sleepy eyes: "Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The door opened.</p><p></p><p>A tall woman walked in, her face as cold as frost, with a sword case on her back.</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching thing about her was her long, strong and powerful legs, as if they could strangle a person to death.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she entered the room, her expression was quite unpleasant, as if she had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>"Zhifeng, is that you?"</p><p></p><p>"You came so early, are you ready to help the young master dress?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is equal, although you are a maid, you don't have to serve me."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer, the son-in-law Qiyuan, was very familiar with and also feared.</p><p></p><p>This woman was the maid of the Shen family's eldest daughter.</p><p></p><p>On the day of Qiyuan's marriage to the Shen family's eldest daughter, the eldest daughter was absent, and Zhifeng had replaced her to complete the ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the final step of entering the bridal chamber was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>The son-in-law Qiyuan's excitement was useless.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Zhifeng was no ordinary maid.</p><p></p><p>She was an imperial guard.</p><p></p><p>A biting chill swept over, Zhifeng emanated an icy aura, and she looked at Qiyuan with a cold and slightly puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>Because the lazy and carefree young man in front of her was completely different from the timid son-in-law she had seen before.</p><p></p><p>That person often trembled in fear when seeing her, lacking both courage and ability.</p><p></p><p>How dare he speak to her like this?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the young lady heard about your incident in Ninghe County, and she is very disappointed!" Zhifeng looked at Qiyuan, her gaze as cold as ice, "The young lady hopes you can truthfully recount what happened back then!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be about that widow's matter? It wasn't me who did it." Qiyuan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you have really disappointed us!" Zhifeng's gaze remained as icy as ever, "Old Zhong said he saw with his own eyes that you bullied that widow, and he wanted to stop it, but ended up being kicked by you, and the injury on his forehead is still there!"</p><p></p><p>On the way to Ninghe County, she had met Old Zhong and learned about the incident from him, making her even more contemptuous of the man in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"That thick-browed and big-eyed fellow... actually framed me?" Qiyuan stretched and was about to ignore it, but then he remembered he was supposed to be playing the role of the son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Since he had to play the role of the son-in-law, he couldn't remain so calm.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he put on a pitiful expression: "Sister Zhifeng, I was the one who was framed and implicated!"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the progress bar of playing the son-in-law role advanced a little.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at Zhifeng's long legs, wanting to hug them.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>Although this woman had a cold aura, she had rushed from the capital city to Ninghe County without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Her feet must be sweating, stinking!</p><p></p><p>If he smelled it, he might vomit.</p><p></p><p>After all, the women here were nowhere near as good as the golden canaries and Ningdao's jade feet, small and delicate, like tender white lotus and slender bamboo shoots.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qiyuan's expression, Zhifeng felt a sense of familiarity, and the contempt in her eyes flashed briefly: "Why would Old Zhong frame you? Young master, if you can admit your own wrongdoings, the young lady may still look upon you favorably!"</p><p></p><p>"It was Wang Kaiyuan!" Qiyuan continued to play the role of the son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhifeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she also felt that there might be some hidden secrets in this matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, given Qiyuan's cowardly nature, even if he wanted to bully someone, he wouldn't dare to bully Wang Kaiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you will come back to the manor with me, and the young lady will investigate this matter." Zhifeng's face was as cold as frost.</p><p></p><p>"I can't go back for now, can I go in a few days?" Qiyuan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Zhifeng refused firmly.</p><p></p><p>She had to hurry up and take Qiyuan back to the Shen manor and lock him up, then go to Eshan Lake.</p><p></p><p>The young lady still needed her there.</p><p></p><p>"I really need some time, Sister Zhifeng..." Qiyuan continued to play the role of the son-in-law, speaking pitifully.</p><p></p><p>A look of disgust flashed in Zhifeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The moment the words left her mouth, Zhifeng's figure suddenly collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Is it okay now?" Looking at the unconscious Zhifeng, Qiyuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had suddenly attacked Zhifeng and knocked her out.</p><p></p><p>"Young master!" At this time, Chen Kangbao walked in, still chewing on half a bun.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the woman on the ground, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"I've already investigated the matter of the Red Cloud Stronghold, we can go anytime!"</p><p></p><p>"Good." Qiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, are you going to leave this woman here?"</p><p></p><p>"No, she's unconscious now, without the ability to protect herself. If someone finds her and says she's dead, won't I become a criminal?"</p><p></p><p>"So, we have to take her with us!"</p><p></p><p>"But if we carry out a woman, won't we be mistaken for thieves?"</p><p></p><p>"Who said she's a woman? She's my spear!"</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, I don't have a weapon yet, and her body seems quite sturdy."</p><p></p><p>The ever-changing illusions!</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Zhifeng miraculously transformed into a spear.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit thick and long, but the cold light flashed, and it was very sharp.</p><p></p><p>Qiyuan looked at the spear, gently picking it up.</p><p></p><p>"I have to be careful, can't take advantage of her."</p><p></p><p>PS: The game levels in this world only apply to this game, do not compare them to other worlds.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

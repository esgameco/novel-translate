        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Destroy a hundred gods in three days.</p><p></p><p>This plan was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>If before, the evil god camps might have hesitated due to fear of their power, possibly waiting and observing, or contacting other evil god camps to consolidate forces before attacking Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>But once Qi Yuan launches the "Destroy a Hundred Gods in Three Days" plan.</p><p></p><p>This would undoubtedly plunge the occupied areas into war.</p><p></p><p>Those great lords of the evil god camps could no longer stand idly by.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it would be a true war of gods! An unending divine war.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this will start a war of gods!" </p><p></p><p>One ancient god spoke with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present could be certain that after destroying a hundred gods in three days,</p><p></p><p>The armies of the evil god camps would definitely consolidate within two days and march towards Qingshui Village. </p><p></p><p>At that time, their strength would be far from enough to deal with the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>"A war of gods is good! Large amounts of evil god spiritual power will be credited every day, we'll make a fortune!" Qi Yuan clapped and cheered.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient gods looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Indeed they would make a fortune, but they had to be alive to spend it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my plan is very thorough! You just need to do as I say, and the evil gods will surely be defeated!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene were all somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Zhuangshi spoke up: "Stop dithering like old women, what kind of true gods are you! I, Old Zhu, am the first to support the lord's plan!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhongshan also hurriedly said: "I support it too!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll deal with the future when it comes, I don't believe the lord would harm us!" the ancient god Wang Song spoke.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the rest of the ancient gods finally had no more objections.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the elder twin sister lowered her head: "Please inform us of the plan, Heavenly Lord, so we can go execute it!"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Qi Yuan. Since they had chosen to pledge loyalty, everything would be based on Qi Yuan's orders.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qi!" Qi Yuan called out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After about a hundred breaths of time passed, Qi Qi rushed over covered in dust, "Godfather, you're back?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked at Qi Yuan and the many ancient gods behind him, a flash of surprise passing through her eyes before quickly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qi, how many evil gods of true god level are left in our Lin Kingdom?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"There are 43 left, including 5 at the Third Step of Sky Treading, the number at Second Step and First Step of Sky Treading is unclear!" Qi Qi answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Qi Yuan was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The number of evil gods in Lin Kingdom was rather lacking.</p><p></p><p>"The first step of the 'Destroy a Hundred Gods in Three Days' plan - you twenty ancient gods with divine realm seeds, after finishing the banquet, go to the various cities of Lin Kingdom and kill all these evil gods for me!" In an instant, Qi Yuan had completed one-third of his meticulous plan.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene were somewhat speechless, even Wang Song's beard trembled a little.</p><p></p><p>This plan was really casual.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have tired of speaking, and picked up the water on the table to take a drink: "The plan for the first day has been set, now let's start on the second day.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qi, which is the closest country to our Lin Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>How many evil gods are there?"</p><p></p><p>"The closest is Feng Kingdom, with seventy-two evil gods." Qi Qi answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>As the only strategist and logistics director of Qingshui Village, it could be said that she did all the dirty and tiring work.</p><p></p><p>She had long since helped Qi Yuan gather this intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan frowned: "It seems Feng Kingdom has even more evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Only killing forty evil gods on the first day seems wasteful, and it might even scare away the evil gods in Feng Kingdom! I think we should scrap the previous plan and start over!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>It felt like this was all child's play.</p><p></p><p>But it was good that the plan was being redone.</p><p></p><p>After all, the plan for the first day sounded... unreliable.</p><p></p><p>"I think we should change the three-day plan to a one-day plan.</p><p></p><p>Now, you go into action directly, travel to Lin Kingdom and Feng Kingdom, and slaughter all these evil gods!" Qi Yuan said passionately.</p><p></p><p>The subjects before him all had divine realm seeds.</p><p></p><p>When facing those below great lord level, they could almost achieve instant kills.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, it was better to strike quickly and kill all those evil gods.</p><p></p><p>If they killed too slowly, treating it as a three-day plan, those evil gods might flee at the news.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan directly shortened the plan's timeframe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instantly felt that he was truly a great talent, even considering variables on the battlefield like the evil gods fleeing.</p><p></p><p>In terms of wisdom, in the entire Azure Waves Realm, only the Great Wisdom True Monarch could surpass him.</p><p></p><p>"Can you do it?" Qi Yuan asked directly, looking at these twenty-some ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene had a moment of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"We can." The elder twin sister answered, "If we have maps, we can travel ten thousand miles today and ambush and kill all these evil gods!"</p><p></p><p>But it would only be for one day.</p><p></p><p>Starting tomorrow, the area around Lin Kingdom, the entire northwest of Lin, would likely be thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qi, where are the maps?" Qi Yuan asked his strategist again.</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, wait a moment." Qi Qi disappeared in a flash, and quickly returned holding a pile of maps, which she distributed to the ancient gods present.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "With the plan set, half the work is done. The other half is up to you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these ancient gods with an expectant face.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene had various emotions in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Some felt excited.</p><p></p><p>Because as ancient gods, they were used to retreating.</p><p></p><p>They had never even thought of taking the initiative to attack like this before.</p><p></p><p>Although it would bring armies surrounding them afterwards, the initial part would truly be satisfying and cathartic!</p><p></p><p>"To increase the efficiency of completing the plan, I've specially given you some fish-bombing thunderclap bombs." As Qi Yuan spoke, he distributed some Tai Yin Thunder Pearls to these people.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, these ancient gods accepted the fish-bombing thunderclap bombs.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Heavenly Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Good, everyone go enjoy the banquet. In half an hour, we'll set out together to kill the enemy." Qi Yuan was full of heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>Under his leadership and planning, everything in the Mortal Heart Realm was developing in a good direction.</p><p></p><p>So all the ancient gods dispersed and joined the banquet.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Zhu Zhuangshi found the big black dog and directly sat his butt down on top of it, angering the big black dog so much it howled.</p><p></p><p>The current Zhu Zhuangshi was no longer the Zhu Zhuangshi of before, the big black dog was no match at all.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the twin sisters sat together, communicating telepathically while eating.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, why do I feel like today's plan sounds... so unreliable?" The younger twin sister was surprised.</p><p></p><p>She had executed plans before.</p><p></p><p>Those plans were all very detailed, with every step written out clearly, and even contingency plans for emergencies.</p><p></p><p>Today's plan was far too rough.</p><p></p><p>It even seemed like the Origin Heavenly Lord was making up the plan on the spot while asking his goddaughter, as if it was something he came up with on a whim.</p><p></p><p>"But even though the plan sounds unreliable, I feel like I have a very good chance of completing it.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the previous plans, although detailed, always made me nervous about failing when executing them." The elder</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The twin sister expressed her inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The older twin sister smiled at this moment: "Because, where is this a plan from the Heavenly Lord? This is clearly using overwhelming force! As long as we are powerful enough, we don't need any intricate plans, we can just push through directly.</p><p></p><p>Killing a hundred gods in one day follows the same principle.</p><p></p><p>There's no need for a plan at all, we just need to push through and slay these evil gods."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the older twin sister very much agreed with Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>In war, speed is of the essence.</p><p></p><p>Striking quickly without giving the enemy time to react is how to achieve greater results.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's right," the younger twin sister understood now, but thinking of something, she looked worried, "What happens after this plan is completed?"</p><p></p><p>Her concern was not unfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Divine Lord must have plans already.</p><p></p><p>He may seem careless, but... how many of those who have cultivated to the realm of true gods are really foolish?</p><p></p><p>This time in the ancestral land, the Lord's gains may be even more than what we've seen," the older twin sister explained.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons she agreed to implement the plan.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan looked at Zhu Zhuangshi and casually said, "Aren't you afraid that one day the big black dog will turn the tables on you if you keep bullying it like this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Zhuangshi quickly put on a respectful expression: "That's why I, old Zhu, have to bully it sooner rather than later. If I don't bully it now, won't I have even less chance to bully it once it turns the tables?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled: "You're still the same as before."</p><p></p><p>The deity Zhu Zhuangshi was currently observing was Marshal Tianpeng.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan discovered that this method of deity observation, when borrowing power, would be influenced to some extent by the deity being borrowed from when exerting the borrowed power.</p><p></p><p>Emotions would be amplified, and they might say things that didn't fit with what they themselves would normally say.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this influence wouldn't last.</p><p></p><p>These people were still themselves.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, when Qi Yuan was at Imagination Mountain, he had done a small experiment.</p><p></p><p>Among the Four Saints of the North Pole, Marshal Tianyou was actually the vice marshal.</p><p></p><p>During the visualization, he used the Golden Elixir of Fixed Stars to forget the concept of vice marshal.</p><p></p><p>What he visualized was the chief marshal.</p><p></p><p>And in the visualized deity observation method, Marshal Tianyou was indeed the chief marshal.</p><p></p><p>This was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>These deities might be completely different in different versions, including their identities, status, and power.</p><p></p><p>But what was condensed was all based on Qi Yuan's memories.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan had a sudden idea - what if he made up one himself?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it failed.</p><p></p><p>So, visualization is not just imagination, it needs to be targeted.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Zhu Zhuangshi: "You don't need to go for this one-day plan, I have important tasks for you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Zhuangshi was delighted.</p><p></p><p>The Lord was giving him special treatment!</p><p></p><p>"My Lord, please feel free to instruct old Zhu!" Zhu Zhuangshi said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>He looked proudly at Shi Zhongshan and the big black dog on the ground, as if to say, see, this is what being in the inner circle looks like.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>At a stronghold of the Ancient God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Rain kept falling, and a man in white clothes hurried in with an anxious look on his face.</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open, and as the man in white entered the hall, a gust of cold air came in. The three Venerable Ones in the hall all had complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Venerable Wanshan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"My Lords, those ancient gods have killed another new god. Today, all the evil gods in the three nearby cities have been killed in battle!" the man in white hurriedly reported.</p><p></p><p>It should have been good news, but he spoke with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"What's the background of those ancient gods... why are they so powerful?" Venerable Wanshan asked.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wenyang shook his head: "Sigh, their large-scale slaughter of evil gods, though satisfying, has drawn our Maple Country into the flames of war. I'm afraid it won't be long before the evil god camps retaliate and sweep through Maple Country.</p><p></p><p>The strongholds we've worked so hard to establish might be affected, and the people of Maple Country... might also suffer a bloody massacre."</p><p></p><p>"Why so pessimistic, Venerable Wenyang? Even without them stepping up to kill evil gods, would the evil gods not have moved against us?" At this point, the previously silent Venerable Huanghun spoke up, "No matter what, I, Huanghun, admire them for daring to slay evil gods!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wanshan agreed with Venerable Wenyang: "What a pity, sigh. With such strong power, why don't they lie low like us in the Ancient God Alliance, consider the long term, and prioritize the bigger picture?</p><p></p><p>They've killed quite a few evil gods now, but they're all small fry, unable to fundamentally solve the plight of the occupied areas.</p><p></p><p>Around us, there are three evil god camps. Once the great venerable ones from the evil god camps take action, they'll have nowhere to be buried!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Venerable Huanghun felt indignant.</p><p></p><p>Others are out there killing evil gods, and you're sitting here talking nonsense?</p><p></p><p>They're all small fry?</p><p></p><p>Look at yourselves, you've been in the Ancient God Alliance for hundreds of years, talking about the big picture every day, but what's the result? You haven't even killed a single small fry.</p><p></p><p>"If the evil god camps take action, we from the Ancient God Alliance can go to their aid, lend them a hand!" Venerable Huanghun spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wanshan smiled: "Venerable Huanghun, you're being a bit impulsive.</p><p></p><p>What they're doing now has already exposed them.</p><p></p><p>The evil god camps definitely won't let them off.</p><p></p><p>Once the evil god camps take action, they're as good as dead!</p><p></p><p>We don't need to sacrifice our own people for some dead men.</p><p></p><p>I just got news that these ancient gods who took action claim to be from Blue Water Village, followers of some Origin Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>Why haven't I heard of this village? Did they get some kind of opportunity to become strong?</p><p></p><p>Sigh, they're really impulsive. If they got an opportunity, they should have lain low.</p><p></p><p>Such impulsiveness is just seeking death.</p><p></p><p>These opportunities would be better given to our Ancient God Alliance, that way they could be put to better use.</p><p></p><p>Wasting our mortal realm's treasures, and the result is just killing some small fry."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! I'm ashamed to be associated with you lot!" Venerable Huanghun finally couldn't hold back, "If you won't go to save them, I will!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Huanghun had met the Origin Heavenly Lord before.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Origin Heavenly Lord had invited him to become a subject, but Venerable Huanghun refused.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it now, he shouldn't have refused.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Alliance before him was full of people who held positions without doing work.</p><p></p><p>Look at what they're saying, is this how humans talk?</p><p></p><p>A bunch of high-sounding principles, a bunch of talk about prioritizing interests, a bunch of talk about the big picture.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, they mock and ridicule the ancient gods who dare to take action against evil gods? Venerable Huanghun directly waved his sleeve and left.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wanshan and Venerable Wenyang were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Venerable Huanghun's words, they were quite angry.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of short-sighted brutes who only know how to fight and kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wanshan, there's no need to bother with Venerable Huanghun. When the god war starts, people like him will be the first to die!"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Wanshan took a breath, speaking as if concerned for the country and its people: "Everything is for the world, for continuation."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if Venerable Huanghun left. He's just at the second step of Sky Treading, he's nothing without the Ancient God Alliance," Venerable Wenyang spoke, but in the next moment, his expression changed slightly, "This Venerable Huanghun has gone too far, he's actually digging at the roots of our Ancient God Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"He's calling for people to support Blue Water Village!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

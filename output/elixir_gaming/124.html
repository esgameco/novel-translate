        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After merging with Zitong, Qi Yuan, empowered by Xiaojia, stood nearly a hundred zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-meter-tall giant was nothing to supreme beings, who could easily suppress it with a wave of their hand. </p><p></p><p>However, for some unknown reason, when they faced the blood-red eyes full of killing intent from the giant in crimson armor,</p><p> </p><p>They suddenly felt fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme forcibly suppressed the feeling of fear and coldly sneered at Qi Yuan: "We have treasures forged by the Great Supreme, combining offense and defense. Even if you add those supreme beings behind you, you can't stop us!</p><p></p><p>In the future North-South battle, the South will surely be defeated, and you will all certainly die!"</p><p></p><p>Blue Charm Supreme was already preparing to flee.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings present had the same idea.</p><p></p><p>After all, over a hundred early-stage supreme beings was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held a broken sword, like a massive grim reaper from hell.</p><p></p><p>His cold, emotionless eyes swept over these twenty-some supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>His voice became even more demonic as he rambled nonsensically: "Many people can't see the future, but have actually already seen it."</p><p></p><p>The huge broken sword was incomparably bewitching, with a blood-red aura permeating it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his sword and slashed out.</p><p></p><p>Virtual Realm Ruler's Heart Demon Summoning.</p><p></p><p>As he slashed with his sword, he roared:</p><p></p><p>"This is your future!"</p><p></p><p>Endless bloody rain poured down from the sword blade, like a torrential downpour, falling onto the bodies of the twenty-seven supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme and Ning Tao were unaffected by this.</p><p></p><p>Greed, arrogance, gluttony, lust... and other emotions were mixed into the bloody rain, plucking at the heartstrings of the supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings on the scene were first bewildered, then terrified.</p><p></p><p>"You... what is this?" Blue Charm Supreme's face was full of horror.</p><p></p><p>The treasures forged by the Great Supreme made them impenetrable in both offense and defense. Even the innate divine abilities of a Great Supreme could not break through their defenses.</p><p></p><p>However, that sword strike just now had landed on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Now Blue Charm Supreme's face was contorted. He had just finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>Something terrifying happened.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a horrifying flesh tumor suddenly bulge out from his back, bursting through his robes.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying tumor kept swelling, growing as large as a millstone.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the tumor seemed to be pierced by fingernails, yellow liquid spraying out continuously as a grotesque demon struggled free.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of that demon were full of greed and the desire to feed.</p><p></p><p>It crouched on Blue Charm Supreme's shoulder, constantly gnawing at the tumor.</p><p></p><p>This scene didn't just happen to Blue Charm Supreme.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings were the same.</p><p></p><p>Demons burst out of their bodies, like parasites living inside, devouring their hosts.</p><p></p><p>Some supreme beings were grimacing, twisting like beasts rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Some supreme beings kept tearing at themselves, trying to peel off their own skin, as if that would make them feel better.</p><p></p><p>The scene was bizarre, horrifying, and utterly miserable!</p><p></p><p>"Devil, you're a devil!"</p><p></p><p>The mid-stage supreme cultivators could still barely speak, looking at Qi Yuan's terrifying figure with confusion and fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Spare me... I'm willing to be a dog!" Some supreme beings said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The tall blood-colored giant shadow looked at these frenzied supreme beings on the scene.</p><p></p><p>He calmly said: "This is the fate of those who oppose me."</p><p></p><p>The hundred supreme beings behind him all had shocked expressions. After hearing Qi Yuan's words, their hearts trembled even more.</p><p></p><p>The scene before them completely exceeded their understanding.</p><p></p><p>They only saw that Blood Lord they deeply respected and found so mysterious transform into a blood-red giant.</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword against over twenty supreme beings, and with one slash, bloody rain fell.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying things happened - the heart demons of those supreme beings were completely awakened. The extremely powerful supreme beings were helpless like children under the demons' devouring.</p><p></p><p>Such an innate divine ability easily slaughtered over twenty supreme beings. Those supreme beings had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>How could this scene not terrify and shock them?</p><p></p><p>How could the Blood Lord be a born divine being? He must be a god of heaven and hell! Everyone swallowed and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Yang Hun Supreme's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming a supreme being, this was the first time he had felt this way.</p><p></p><p>His spine tingled, and his face was full of wild joy.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward and shouted: "The Blood Lord is mighty, ruling over all!"</p><p></p><p>Now he looked nothing like a supreme being, more like the most fawning little follower.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't look at Yang Hun Supreme, but focused on those twenty-some supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>At this time, those supreme beings were constantly dying painfully.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying supreme beings who could destroy a city died in agony.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's experience bar was also growing frantically.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Supreme beings were worthy of the name.</p><p></p><p>The surging experience was far more enticing than those demons from earthly myths.</p><p></p><p>After a dozen breaths of time, all the supreme beings on the scene had completely perished.</p><p></p><p>The horrifying hellish scene disappeared, and Qi Yuan's level was fixed at 148.</p><p></p><p>As one cultivated to higher levels, the gaps between minor realms became larger, requiring endless time to grind through.</p><p></p><p>He was only 2 levels away from mid-stage supreme.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't need that. He just needed to kill, kill, kill, and his experience would grow.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just about levels.</p><p></p><p>Mastering innate divine abilities, from proficiency to subtlety, required one's own efforts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grinned, sweeping his gaze over everyone present: "Do you understand now how people should be killed?"</p><p></p><p>The previous battles had been wishy-washy, dragging on endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Half a day had passed without accomplishing a damn thing.</p><p></p><p>How could that compare to Qi Yuan's clean and decisive single sword strike kill?</p><p></p><p>"We understand." The supreme beings behind quickly answered.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai was also among the crowd, his heart shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yang Hun Supreme had a face full of smiles, extremely fawning: "Compared to the Blood Lord slaying twenty-seven supreme beings with one sword, our supreme being battles are as laughable as children's squabbles."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan accepted the flattery. His gaze finally landed on the solitary Ning Tao, revealing a playful smile: "You're not leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's hand tightly gripped the chain. She looked at that blood-red figure, the trace of shock in her eyes dissipating: "If you don't speak, how dare I leave?"</p><p></p><p>"If you had left earlier, I probably couldn't have stopped you," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's strength was a notch above Purple Daoist's.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Qi Yuan really wanted to stop her, he could.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need for him to expend so much effort.</p><p></p><p>He had rather complex emotions towards this NPC Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan, her hand still tightly gripping the chain. Her expression was a bit unnatural, suppressing something - perhaps fear, perhaps something else.</p><p></p><p>"By slaying these Great Supremes, you have saved my life. This humble woman has no way to repay..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan interrupted Ning Tao's words and slowly asked: "Do you know about the Blood Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao shook her head in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao still shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the Golden Canary? She's a very tsundere, very vain girl. I've been looking for her." Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao, a trace of tenderness flashing in his blood-red eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Ning Tao, Level 197, Tianxin Palace Master, one of the cursed Thirteen Northern Demon Beauties.]</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao shook her head: "I don't know. She... must be someone very important to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I've been looking for her." Qi Yuan said, "I saved your life in passing, you don't need to repay me. If you ever encounter her in the future, tell her I'm waiting for her... in No Return City."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was profound.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan and replied: "Great kindness needs no thanks. I will help you look out for this person!"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, she suddenly asked: "Have we met somewhere before? Why do I keep feeling a sense of familiarity?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we met in a dream." Qi Yuan laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>After laughing, he swept his gaze over all the supreme beings present.</p><p></p><p>"Swear a heart demon oath not to reveal today's events. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings hurriedly swore heart demon oaths without hesitation upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao did the same.</p><p></p><p>"The heart demon oath is sworn. You may leave." Qi Yuan said generously to Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Qi Yuan had thought of the "humiliation" he suffered in the underground palace, almost being forced to call her "mother".</p><p></p><p>He had also prepared to force this Great Supreme Ning Tao to call him "daddy" before letting her go.</p><p></p><p>But in the end he thought playing too perversely didn't fit his image as the cold and domineering Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao glanced at Qi Yuan, her hand tightly gripping the chain, her form turning into a streak of light and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Ning Tao landed in the great desert. She looked at the flesh in the chain behind her and murmured: "Husband, Golden Canary must be a very lovely woman."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she covered her left cheek with her hand.</p><p></p><p>"She must be much prettier than my ugly appearance."</p><p></p><p>She took a deep look behind her, her eyes no longer lingering. She transformed into a streak of light and vanished.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three years later.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Crane finally slowly arrived at Great Sorrow City.</p><p></p><p>His long robe embroidered with white cranes was stained with blood, and the aura on his body was unstable.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In recent years, he rushed towards Wuguicheng (No Return City).</p><p></p><p>On the way, he encountered the Demon Crocodile, the top general under the Lord.</p><p></p><p>When the two met, they naturally glared at each other with hostility.</p><p></p><p>An intense battle broke out. They fought fiercely for several years, with no clear winner. Both were wounded before finally parting ways.</p><p></p><p>Now, Yun He's face was as pale as paper, and his aura was somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>He sat in the palace, a puzzled expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Where is my junior sister?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a supreme being from Dabeicheng (Great Sorrow City) stepped forward, a respectful look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Supreme Yun He, your junior sister Huang Mengling left Dabeicheng five years ago to handle an urgent matter." This supreme being's strength was not great, merely at the early stage of supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the guardian of Dabeicheng?" Yun He asked again.</p><p></p><p>"There were some matters in Wuguicheng, so the guardian went there," the supreme being answered respectfully.</p><p></p><p>A complex look flashed through Yun He's eyes. He continued, "How is Wuguicheng now?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme being hesitated, then finally said, "I have been in seclusion and don't know much about Wuguicheng's affairs. It's probably the same as a few years ago, with several supreme beings there."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun He's expression remained unchanged. He finally said slowly, "You may leave."</p><p></p><p>The supreme being bowed his head and left the palace.</p><p></p><p>In the empty palace, only Yun He remained.</p><p></p><p>A trace of worry flashed in his eyes: "Things seem... strange."</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, the guardian of Dabeicheng is Supreme Mi Luo, whose father is Great Supreme Mi Kong!"</p><p></p><p>After arriving in Dabeicheng, he gradually sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely detected several terrifying auras lying dormant within Dabeicheng.</p><p></p><p>They were all Great Supreme beings! These Great Supremes were hiding in Dabeicheng, yet did not come to see him.</p><p></p><p>This was very problematic.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the news about Wuguicheng... was all fake, and this is a trap set for me?" Yun He's expression turned particularly ugly.</p><p></p><p>If this was true, it meant that Great Supreme Mi Kong must have betrayed the South and joined the North.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the South would become even more dire.</p><p></p><p>After all, of the 108,000 cities, more than half had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>Not even one in ten remained.</p><p></p><p>The betrayal of one Great Supreme was enough to shake the situation.</p><p></p><p>And if he were to be surrounded and killed, another arm of his master Bai Di would be cut off, putting the South in even greater danger.</p><p></p><p>"I need to... leave here." Yun He felt there was great danger hidden here and he needed to leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>But how to leave was another big problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, if this was a plot against him, it would be very difficult to escape.</p><p></p><p>He looked very worried.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, deep within Dabeicheng, several Great Supremes were speaking in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Yun He has come here, what about our plan?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, continue as planned. If he disrupts our plans, he will stay in Dabeicheng forever!"</p><p></p><p>"He's just one Great Supreme, he can't change the big picture!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Wuguicheng, Qi Yuan was lounging lazily in an armchair, his broken sword constantly reaping the demon spawn on the conveyor belt.</p><p></p><p>By now, according to the standards of the Liufeng Realm, he had already entered the mid-stage of the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's good to have many subordinates," Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Now, the number of Supreme beings in the Blood Palace had reached nearly two thousand.</p><p></p><p>Every day, many Supreme beings would go out to capture large numbers of demon spawn for Qi Yuan to kill.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's experience points were skyrocketing.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that while my level has gone up, my understanding of the Origin... has been somewhat slow."</p><p></p><p>For Supreme beings in this realm to enter the mid-stage, they needed to improve their level of understanding of Origin divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan only needed to level up.</p><p></p><p>However... his Origin divine abilities could not be upgraded by gaining experience, he also needed to comprehend them himself.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with countless demon essences piling up, Qi Yuan's first Origin divine ability -</p><p></p><p>Virtual Realm Overlord's Heart Demon Attraction - had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>The quantity... was too large.</p><p></p><p>Completely unusable, unusable.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability had also reached the microcosmic level.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra had made no progress, still at the time-exhausting level.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my talent is still too poor. Without the game, if I were placed in the Canglan Realm, I'd just be a small fry, probably couldn't even enter the gates of the Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He often contemplated the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>But by the next day, he would forget yesterday's progress in comprehension.</p><p></p><p>How was he supposed to comprehend it like this?</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult, too difficult, this game is too hard to play!" Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra was not a divine ability meant for humans to learn.</p><p></p><p>If even reaching the microcosmic level was so difficult, what about inscribing it?</p><p></p><p>If he were to inscribe the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra on his flesh and soul, Qi Yuan seriously doubted whether he would become mentally disabled.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, big brother, Supreme Mi Luo from Dabeicheng has come to pay a visit!" Chen Huan entered the underground palace and anxiously said to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Can't you see I'm busy tightening screws? Not seeing anyone." Qi Yuan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to see some Supreme Mi Luo.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, Supreme Mi Luo's father is Great Supreme Mi Kong, a Great Supreme!" Chen Huan emphasized the Great Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a smile appeared on Qi Yuan's lips: "Has a high-level NPC finally appeared?"</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of a high-level NPC could be a good thing, or it could be a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Either way, it didn't matter much to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was just a game after all.</p><p></p><p>"I'll see him," Qi Yuan changed his mind and decided to meet this Supreme Mi Luo to see what he was up to.</p><p></p><p>And to see if... he would become an enemy.</p><p></p><p>If so, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>After about ten breaths of time passed, the sound of footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>The underground palace was somewhat dim, with candlelight flickering.</p><p></p><p>A man in a green robe entered. His face bore the unique arrogance of someone from a great family.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Mi Luo stepped forward. Seeing the blood robe in the underground palace, his eyes showed a respectful look: "Mi Luo pays his respects to the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still looking at the cute demon spawn, not looking at Supreme Mi Luo, and asked, "Speak quickly if you have something to say, I'm busy."</p><p></p><p>Being snubbed like this, Supreme Mi Luo showed no dissatisfaction on his face, but said, "Mi Luo has come this time to inform the Blood Lord of a heaven-sent opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan became interested and finally sized up Supreme Mi Luo, "If it's not extremely big, I won't be satisfied."</p><p></p><p>Now Qi Yuan was only interested in big things.</p><p></p><p>He had been thinking about refining something huge into his golden core.</p><p></p><p>Only then would he possibly be able to use his golden core body to defeat the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord is born divine and holy, creating over a thousand Supreme beings. This feat has truly shocked the world.</p><p>My father Great Supreme Mi Kong is also one of the few giants in the South.</p><p>He has long admired the Blood Lord, but unfortunately he is guarding Dragon Snow City and cannot come to Wuguicheng." Supreme Mi Luo spoke eloquently.</p><p></p><p>"Get to the point." Qi Yuan was getting a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>"My father has gathered several like-minded individuals who are willing to serve the Blood Lord as their master and jointly revere the Blood Lord as the common ruler of the world!" Supreme Mi Luo said, his face showing excitement. "The Blood Lord can help people break through to become Supreme beings, and should be the ruler of the world.</p><p>What Bai Di, what Lord, they are not worthy to compare with the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan smiled a bit.</p><p></p><p>Playing a game, was he about to be crowned emperor by NPCs? Just then he heard Supreme Mi Luo continue: "Although the Blood Palace forces are strong, there are no mid-stage Supreme beings or Great Supremes.</p><p>My father Great Supreme Mi Kong is willing to lead Great Supremes to join under the Blood Lord's banner and serve the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Mi Luo's attitude was extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I have a younger sister, just three hundred years old, young and beautiful.</p><p>My sister has always admired the Blood Lord. My father also intends to send my sister to the Blood Palace for the Blood Lord to take as a consort."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression became interesting.</p><p></p><p>This NPC knew how to do things, even offering his sister.</p><p></p><p>But he still said: "Right now, I'm too lazy to become this so-called common ruler of the world, and I'm not interested in what you said.</p><p>As for your sister, I've never even met her."</p><p></p><p>His words were full of rejection.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Supreme Mi Luo's eyes showed a disappointed look.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if his chance to assist in founding a new dynasty had vanished.</p><p></p><p>However, Supreme Mi Luo continued: "In half a month, it will be time for the Blood Lord to preach the Dao. May I have the opportunity to observe in Wuguicheng?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at him and said indifferently: "You may. Now leave."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Blood Lord." Supreme Mi Luo did not dawdle and left directly.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, only Qi Yuan and the demon spawn on the conveyor belt remained.</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself: "We're all thousand-year-old foxes, no need to play games."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the demon spawn, a smile appeared in his eyes as he said two completely unrelated sentences: "The pig has been fattened, the wings have hardened."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

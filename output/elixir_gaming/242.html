        <h1>Chapter 242</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, wait until I call you to come in before entering."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu entered her room alone. At this moment, her mind was still a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother... was he serious?</p><p></p><p>"Or is Senior Brother up to no good?"</p><p></p><p>But then she thought, who knows who would end up at a disadvantage!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother had no reason to deceive her about something like this. Jiang Lingsu decided to give it a try. </p><p></p><p>After all, that kind of icy cold poison was not something an ordinary person could tolerate.</p><p></p><p>About two incense sticks' worth of time passed, and Jiang Lingsu finished tidying up the messy room.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, Senior Brother wouldn't enter her room, so she rarely did a thorough cleaning.</p><p></p><p>It's normal for girls to have more things, right?</p><p></p><p>Now, it was cleaned up, at least appearing tidy on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was a large bathtub in the room. Jiang Lingsu sat in the bathtub wrapped in a chest wrap.</p><p></p><p>The water in the tub was cyan blue and constantly boiling, with Whisper Flowers, Celestial Dragon Rock Leaves and Holmium Petals floating in it.</p><p></p><p>These spiritual herbs were essential for treating Jiang Lingsu's physical issues.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu's lotus-white arms and slender fragrant shoulders were above the water, her collarbones clearly defined, with a few strands of wet black hair clinging to them. She looked towards the outside of the room.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you can come in now."</p><p></p><p>After she spoke, her hands involuntarily covered her chest. Perhaps due to the high water temperature, a blush appeared on her snow-white face.</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming..."</p><p></p><p>Faint footsteps were heard, stopping after about two breaths.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu took a small breath. She felt the water temperature was a bit hot, with some red spots appearing on her snow-white skin.</p><p></p><p>"You're bathing?" At this time, Qi Yuan's voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"With clothes on!" Jiang Lingsu couldn't help raising her voice.</p><p></p><p>"Filming a TV show?" Qi Yuan's voice became interested.</p><p></p><p>Bathing with clothes on, isn't that like filming a TV show? However, though curious, he didn't move forward, but stood behind the screen.</p><p></p><p>"Men and women should keep their distance. Your Senior Brother is a married man and should avoid suspicion. I'll just help you from here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said from behind the screen. His mood was very calm.</p><p></p><p>He also felt his emotional intelligence was high.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Star, there were always some sayings circulating, like "men and women should keep their distance", "daughters should avoid their fathers when grown", and "when a daughter is just born, the father hangs himself overnight to avoid the daughter".</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't go to such extremes, but he was always good at avoiding ordinary suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Avoid suspicion?" Jiang Lingsu in the bathtub was silent for a moment. "Thank you for your trouble, Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"Don't overthink it. I'm not looking down on your figure, nor am I looking down on your appearance. It's because of the separation between men and women!" Qi Yuan said enthusiastically. He felt he was very considerate and thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, he was still worried that Jiang Lingsu, the patient, would overthink things, so he made everything clear.</p><p></p><p>He was also telling the truth. His junior sister was naturally beautiful, among the top in the Divine Light Sect. As for her figure, needless to say, it was top-tier even in ordinary dress.</p><p></p><p>So, he really wasn't looking down on her.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu in the bathtub was stunned. She bit her teeth, wishing she could jump out of the bathtub and punch Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you'd better be mute." Jiang Lingsu couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>Why was Senior Brother so handsome and talented, but as soon as he opened his mouth... he ruined the image she had fantasized about in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew his words were too warm, and his junior sister couldn't handle it.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready? Senior Brother's divine infant is coming in!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm ready." Jiang Lingsu responded. At this moment, her pretty face was full of curiosity. She really wanted to know how Senior Brother was planning to help treat her.</p><p></p><p>Only a Purple Palace with water attribute spiritual root would work.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother's divine infant... what is that? Just then, the room suddenly became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu focused her attention on her surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze, through the screen behind the clothes rack, looked at the motionless figure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's eyes showed an expectant look.</p><p></p><p>In the Mortal Heart Realm, for cultivators, if we talk about the most precious things, first is the original ancestral land; second is Qi Yuan's deity observation method; third is the accidentally entered No Food Holy Mother; and lastly is the Mortal Heart Realm, this innate world.</p><p></p><p>The original ancestral land was deeply connected to Qi Yuan's deity observation method.</p><p></p><p>The reason Qi Yuan could imagine such a powerful deity observation method was that he consumed the resources of the special tower in the original ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>Plus, due to the special nature of Qi Yuan's deity observation method, and the reward for completing the mission - the innate true spirit.</p><p></p><p>The innate true spirit was actually the seed of an innate world.</p><p></p><p>In terms of value, it was even higher than the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the subjects, resources in the ancestral land, the deity observation method, and the innate true spirit.</p><p></p><p>All of the above.</p><p></p><p>Condensed into a divine infant, what was created was not just a group of myths.</p><p></p><p>But a group of innate divine demons with extremely high potential!</p><p></p><p>After all, after killing two Yang Spirits, when Qi Yuan entered the ancestral land, he still felt terrified.</p><p></p><p>He still couldn't deal with the puppet gods inside.</p><p></p><p>How precious must the treasures guarded by so many sleeping puppet gods be? After all, they could support the birth of the Three Pure Ones deity observation method.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan didn't care and still gave these opportunities to the sacrificed subjects.</p><p></p><p>This also created his current divine infant.</p><p></p><p>"Glorious and bright, the infant emerges from the divine storage, hear my command, sweep away all misfortune!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chanted softly.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, an aura seemingly from ancient times spread, and the innate aura also filled the room at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The space seemed to ripple.</p><p></p><p>As the divine infant emerged, a virtual image appeared.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a graceful divine woman's virtual image approaching elegantly. There didn't seem to be much emotion in the divine woman's eyes, as if she was half asleep.</p><p></p><p>The current divine infant was still in dormancy, not fully awake, and was now relying on instinct.</p><p></p><p>"I obey the Heavenly Lord's command."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the divine woman's virtual image was ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Even in death, she maintained an instinctive reverence before Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu's pupils in the bathtub dilated. She sensed an extremely powerful aura sweeping through.</p><p></p><p>It was as if behind the screen stood not a person, but a vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>When the divine woman's virtual image appeared, Jiang Lingsu's heart pounded. Even through the thick barrier, her heartbeat was clearly audible.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Spirit!"</p><p></p><p>She knew as soon as she saw the virtual image of that divine woman that this was not a Purple Palace, but a Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu had seen lofty Purple Palaces before, but compared to the virtual image of the woman before her, Purple Palaces were more fragile than ants.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the divine woman's virtual image, Jiang Lingsu dared not sit in the bathtub anymore, and stood up like a lotus emerging from the water.</p><p></p><p>The blue chest wrap tightly wrapped her chest, without the cover of loose dresses, forming a stark contrast with her smooth flat abdomen, making her bust appear even more towering and majestic.</p><p></p><p>It could be described as a wasp waist and large breasts, with curves in all the right places.</p><p></p><p>The divine woman's virtual image showed no emotional color.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan behind the screen closed his eyes, but the scene seen by the divine woman was still projected in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Red and blue have always been a CP, why isn't she wearing red below?"</p><p></p><p>This was the first thought that arose in Qi Yuan's mind. His junior sister's upper body was wrapped in blue, but around her hips and buttocks was wrapped something like a white towel, serving as</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The skirt had a body-hugging effect.</p><p></p><p>Despite this puzzling thought, Qi Yuan showed his emotional intelligence by not asking about it. </p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between adults and children is that adults can control their curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was already an adult, so naturally he couldn't act like a child - he had to be emotionally intelligent.</p><p></p><p>If he asked, wouldn't that reveal the fact that what the divine infant saw, he also saw?</p><p></p><p>Although his junior sister's outfit was much more modest than beachwear, or even some female bodhisattvas, he should still respect her and not look improperly.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, please sit down and receive treatment!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>It was a strange feeling to still be able to see even with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu didn't think much of it and sat back down in the blue-green water.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she looked at the yin spirit, many thoughts flashing through her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The yin spirit before her remained silent, like a dead person, giving Jiang Lingsu a great sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>She wondered inwardly how her senior brother had found such a yin spirit. Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu couldn't help but think of the Blood Robe Sword Saint who had ravaged Cuiyun Province.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the phantom of the goddess came forward and placed her arm on Jiang Lingsu's fragrant shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Divine power like the sea spread out at this moment. Jiang Lingsu immediately sensed her spiritual power boiling.</p><p></p><p>Her snow-white skin also took on a rosy hue at this moment, like a perfectly cooked little crayfish, looking quite delicious and tempting.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, you won't be found to have any special constitution this time, will you?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Based on Qi Yuan's experience of watching TV and anime for so many years:</p><p></p><p>The last time seven disciples with top-grade talents joined the Divine Light Sect, they all had special destinies.</p><p></p><p>For example... Dong Xian, who had been abandoned by his fiancée, was originally a prince with his own opportunities. A remnant soul of a Purple Mansion cultivator slumbered in his consciousness, and he eventually became the emperor of the Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>Another example was Jiang Ran, the girl targeted by the Black Chicken Demon. She had a special constitution that was very beneficial for dual cultivation with cultivators.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister was one of those seven.</p><p></p><p>Now, Dong Xian had become emperor, Jiang Ran's mortal enemy the Black Chicken Demon had perished - these people had all started their own storylines.</p><p></p><p>With his junior sister's injuries healed, was she also about to start her own storyline?</p><p></p><p>Would a Yang Spirit come to take her away as a disciple? That's why Qi Yuan asked Jiang Lingsu if she had any special constitution.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu felt warm all over. Facing the yin spirit, she was extremely reverent. Being treated by a yin spirit, she shouldn't speak - that would be disrespectful to the yin spirit.</p><p></p><p>But since her senior brother had asked, she had to reply: "What constitution? My aptitude is just average."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was being very modest.</p><p></p><p>She had pure water spirit roots.</p><p></p><p>This kind of spirit root was considered genius-level even in the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Light Sect, it was certainly unmatched in thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Your aptitude is indeed very average, just pure water spirit roots? Foundation Establishment mid-stage, spiritual power is just average, normal level. Your physique is better than the average female cultivator, with more flexibility. Hmm, your serious condition has caused some irregularities with your menstruation...</p><p></p><p>Junior sister, apart from having large breasts and a pretty face, you're really too ordinary in every other way, not even as good as a villager." Qi Yuan's words were quite harsh.</p><p></p><p>Based on the feedback from the divine infant, Qi Yuan had essentially given his junior sister a physical examination.</p><p></p><p>The results were disappointing - his junior sister's talents were utterly ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Forget about a Yang Spirit wanting to take her as a disciple, even a Yin Spirit probably wouldn't be interested.</p><p></p><p>A Purple Mansion cultivator... would disdain to accept her.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the bathtub, Jiang Lingsu could barely restrain herself from getting up to kick Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She naturally assumed this information had been told to Qi Yuan by the Yin Spirit elder treating her.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, where would you find a villager... with pure spirit roots?" Jiang Lingsu said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"The one in front of you is a villager. I searched for a long time in the game before finding one in a small gourd village." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>This woman first visualized the Water Baby from the Calabash Brothers, and later visualized the Water God who controlled the water divine authority, before becoming a great venerable.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was left speechless.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't refute her senior brother's words. After all, was she supposed to ask this Yin Spirit elder, "Are you a villager from Small Gourd Village?"</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother was familiar with this elder, but she wasn't. She couldn't be impolite to this elder just because of her close relationship with her senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, junior sister, you're really too ordinary. You don't even qualify to become my divine infant." Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Divine infant?</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother had just said this elder was his divine infant.</p><p></p><p>Her senior brother really dared to imagine.</p><p></p><p>She didn't dare say such things in front of this Yin Spirit elder. What if he heard and reprimanded her senior brother? Yin Spirits were unpredictable, and were the top combat forces in the Azure Waves Realm. They couldn't be offended lightly.</p><p></p><p>"How about this," Qi Yuan thought of something, "If I remember correctly, when disciples of major sects break through to the Divine Infant realm, they can hold a Divine Infant Ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Junior sister, I've decided to hold a Divine Infant Ceremony. You can be the doorkeeper, greeting guests and receiving gifts!"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan kept a low profile, he still needed to maintain an air of importance.</p><p></p><p>He had reached Divine Infant level, so he definitely needed to hold a Divine Infant Ceremony to show off a bit.</p><p></p><p>Returning home without displaying one's wealth is like wearing brocade at night.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't reveal his Divine Infant cultivation, what if he encountered some small fry bullying him?</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, if you can persuade the Sect Leader to let you hold a Divine Infant Ceremony, I'll be your doorkeeper!" Jiang Lingsu replied.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, persuading the Sect Leader is easy," </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>With three sentences, he could empty out the Sect Leader's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>As for his junior sister Jiang Lingsu... it seemed this rich lady would give him money without him even saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan's gaze towards Jiang Lingsu suddenly became gentle.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister, this rich lady, was really quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed, with Qi Yuan and Jiang Lingsu chatting non-stop through the screen.</p><p></p><p>They discussed the details of the Divine Infant Ceremony in depth, including what gifts to give and seating arrangements.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, your injuries are healed," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>With his words, the phantom of the goddess disappeared at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The pressure in Jiang Lingsu's heart instantly vanished completely. She carefully examined her body.</p><p></p><p>The previous icy cold had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared on her pretty face as her injuries had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>If a Purple Mansion cultivator had come, it probably would have taken several treatments.</p><p></p><p>With a Yin Spirit coming, it was cured in one session.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was very delighted. She thought of something and left the bathtub. Her gaze fell on the distance, and with a wave of her slender hand, another thin gauze was draped over her graceful and elegant body.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu stepped past the screen, her expression sincere as she bowed gracefully: "Thank you, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Being able to find a Yin Spirit to treat her illness was an enormous favor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the scantily-clad Jiang Lingsu before him with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister had always been conservative, dressing very modestly. This was the first time she had appeared so lightly dressed in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The thin gauze was practically non-existent, unable to conceal her exquisite figure at all. Instead, it half-covered and half-revealed, creating an alluring effect.</p><p></p><p>"Junior sister, won't you put on more clothes? Aren't you worried I might be a bad person?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu replied matter-of-factly: "What needs to be covered is covered, so what's the issue? That female Yin Spirit elder could see, so why can't senior brother look?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was left speechless.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was being too feudal. The Qing Dynasty had long fallen, yet he still had a queue on his head.</p><p></p><p>"Even if senior brother were a bad person, it's unclear who would lose out and who would gain!" Jiang Lingsu continued.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

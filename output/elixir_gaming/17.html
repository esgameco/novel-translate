        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night grew deeper, and after returning to the palace, she was still flipping through and searching for the materials Qi Yuan needed.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it's already the hour of the tiger (3-5 am), you should retire to bed. If the dragon's body is unwell, this servant would not be able to bear the consequences."  The maid in a yellow palace dress reminded.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li didn't look up: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>There was a lot of information about the clothing taboo at the Yufu mansion, and Jin Li was searching for the answers Qi Yuan had asked for, while also collecting other information about the clothing taboo to share with him and help him.</p><p></p><p>"I finally found it." Jin Li's eyes lit up, "All the clothing demons are interconnected, but every night, this connection will greatly weaken!"</p><p></p><p>With this information, she quickly took out the Linglong Jade Dew and told Qi Yuan about it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she also told Qi Yuan about the information she had organized regarding the clothing taboo.</p><p></p><p>After sending this, she was a bit excited, but when she saw what the ancient books recorded, she had a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient books record that the current clothing taboo only has the Bridal Dress Monster. Strange, how should Qi Yuan's Undershirt Monster be explained? Could it be that other clothing monsters have also been born within the clothing taboo?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Li was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>However, once the guards she had previously sent return, she can ask and find out the reason.</p><p></p><p>She wonders if the guards were able to see Qi Yuan. </p><p>What does Qi Yuan look like?</p><p></p><p>Jin Li was curious.</p><p></p><p>Putting down the book, a heavy fatigue swept over her, she was weary, and her long legs and delicate jade feet also felt sore.</p><p></p><p>The aftereffects of kneeling for three hours had not yet completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sunlight lazily shone on Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Having just crawled out of the pit, he still had the scent of soil on him.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sun: "So round, just like a golden elixir."</p><p></p><p>As usual, he opened the chat interface.</p><p></p><p>In the chat area, there were many messages from Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>He reviewed them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, three mediocre craftsmen can't match a Zhuge Liang.</p><p>Seeking help from Jin Li was indeed useful."</p><p></p><p>From Jin Li, he obtained valuable information.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that the clothing demons are indeed connected, but at night, their connection greatly weakens, which is my opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"But now it's broad daylight, it's not a good time to test it, I'll have to wait until night."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan continued to look at the information below.</p><p></p><p>Jin Li not only provided the information he needed to ask, but also marked some dangerous areas and explained the distribution of the stronger clothing demons.</p><p></p><p>"She's really... considerate, no, I should say thoughtful." Qi Yuan thought, realizing something, and immediately corrected himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the previous life, the word "considerate" had become somewhat derogatory to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"I have to wait until dark to grind monsters, how boring."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was bored, and sent Jin Li a bunch of messages.</p><p></p><p>Although Jin Li might not be online and couldn't reply immediately, it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>He said to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The scenery here is indeed very beautiful, it's just that the clothing demons are a bit creepy, even more terrifying than the ghosts in TV shows.</p><p>If I wasn't level 82 already, I might have really been scared.</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't take photos, otherwise I could have taken pictures of the scenery here and maybe even scared you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sent the messages, suddenly thinking: "Hey, what do you look like?"</p><p></p><p>If he could take photos, he might even be able to see the appearance of the female online friend. </p><p>Unfortunately, this game doesn't allow for image or video sharing.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Qi Yuan thought Jin Li would reply to him later, but unexpectedly, her message came right after he sent his.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I... look alright." </p><p></p><p>On the other side, Jinli's mood was not calm, with even greater emotional fluctuations than when she first saw Quan Xiang Sima Ting.</p><p></p><p>"I'm alright too. How about we meet up sometime?" Qi Yuan had quite a fondness for Jinli.</p><p></p><p>During his illness, she was the only one he could chat with.</p><p></p><p>And Jinli's personality and temperament were quite compatible with Qi Yuan's. In simple terms, they got along well, and he didn't see any points about her that he disliked.</p><p></p><p>Jinli sat on the rosewood chair, a faint fragrance wafting around. She looked at the characters in the jade pendant for a while, then solemnly said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan also broke into a smile: "By the way, is the map you went to different from mine? The map I have now only has four prohibitions and two absolutes. </p><p></p><p>I can only stay here now and can't leave."</p><p></p><p>Map? Four prohibitions and two absolutes? Wasn't it just one absolute?</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, you should be following the game's storyline, not just grinding monsters, right? What identity do you have here, and what difficulties have you encountered? Tell me, maybe I can give you some advice." Without waiting for Jinli to respond, Qi Yuan asked again kindly.</p><p></p><p>The Jinli in the palace was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>She knew that Qi Yuan spoke strangely, rambling on.</p><p></p><p>His difficulties? Identity?</p><p></p><p>Was he asking about her real-life identity?</p><p></p><p>Originally, she had just met Qi Yuan by chance, and hadn't fully revealed her identity to him.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was the empress of the Southern Qian Kingdom, a special identity, which she had previously hidden from Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>"I am... the empress of the Southern Qian Kingdom." Jinli no longer hid her identity.</p><p></p><p>"Wow? Your character is so powerful, actually being the empress! No way, I really have to meet you in person now. In my whole life, I've never even seen a mayor, let alone an empress - that's truly rare."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jinli could only bitterly smile.</p><p></p><p>"What's your current task?" Qi Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>Task?</p><p></p><p>Jinli had already gotten used to Qi Yuan's strange way of speaking, and she roughly understood his meaning: "As the empress of Southern Qian, there is Quan Xiang Sima Ting coveting the throne within, the Northern Han Kingdom harassing from outside, and demonic beasts frequently attacking the cities."</p><p></p><p>"So, your main task now is to get rid of Sima Ting, hold onto the throne, and then defeat the other enemies, right?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's casual words, Jinli was a little shocked inside.</p><p></p><p>She had thought about these major events, but how could she possibly accomplish them?</p><p></p><p>Maintaining peace would be good enough.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan was a supreme emperor, mastering the method to enter the Xuanyuan Forbidden Land and able to roam the Yiguan Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>But even such a supreme emperor could not do what was said above.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I don't know how high the levels of the game characters you've encountered are, whether your sword strikes can kill them or not." Qi Yuan said, then he asked again, "Have you seen the 'Slaying the Dragon' technique of the great man? That's a very great book.</p><p></p><p>The great man is very powerful. If you can comprehend even a fraction of his true teachings, this situation would be a trivial matter."</p><p></p><p>"No, I haven't seen it. 'Slaying the Dragon'? It must be very precious, right?" Hearing these three words, Jinli felt that this should be an extremely valuable thing.</p><p></p><p>And hearing Qi Yuan say that by comprehending the 'Slaying the Dragon' technique, her problems could be instantly solved, that book written by the great man must be worth a fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Not precious, maybe just a few hundred coins? A hundred catties of grain can buy it.</p><p></p><p>Too bad I haven't seen it, otherwise I would have tricked you into learning it, and started a... revolution in the game world."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps another word was too heavy, so he used "revolution" as a substitute.</p><p></p><p>Jinli heard this and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Such a precious book was actually only worth a hundred catties of grain.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 571</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the highest point of the scarlet-red world, a figure stood.</p><p></p><p>It had countless forms.</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan observed it, he had a different experience and realization.</p><p></p><p>This scarlet-red world, Lin Yuan had entered it when he had condensed the third ten-thousandth sun seed.</p><p></p><p>He had been here before.</p><p></p><p>The figure at the highest point was most likely the ancestor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, a thirteenth-level time life.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan felt that his ability to enter this scarlet-red world was purely by chance, a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>However, after condensing the thirty-three thousandth sun seed, Lin Yuan suddenly realized that he had established a subtle connection with this scarlet-red world.</p><p></p><p>Through this connection, he could descend and enter again.</p><p></p><p>Aware of this, Lin Yuan would come here from time to time.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice, as this scarlet-red world appeared to be a pure world of fire.</p><p></p><p>But upon his own realization, he discovered that the 'fire' in this world actually contained countless great dao rules. At least, all the great dao rules he had comprehended could be found here.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the figure at the highest point, which was suspected to be the Blazing Sun ancestor, gave Lin Yuan a tremendous shock.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, even the supreme great saints were desperately pursuing the footsteps of the thirteenth-level life, hoping to break through to the thirteenth level and raise their slim chances.</p><p></p><p>But in this source world? He could actually observe a thirteenth-level time life from such close proximity?</p><p></p><p>If it were the supreme great saints in the chaotic void, they would probably be envious to the point of madness. Figures like Emperor Xuan and the Lord of the Demonic Jade Tower, these supreme great saints, would dream of having the kind of opportunity Lin Yuan had.</p><p></p><p>"I can enter this world because I have condensed a sufficient number of sun seeds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very clear about why he could appear here - it was because the faint bloodline of the Blazing Sun ancestor flowed within him, along with the sun seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the sun seeds I have condensed now are short of thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three, with only one left."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was somewhat resigned.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-five years ago, Lin Yuan had already condensed thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-two sun seeds, and since then, he had been trying to condense the last one.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got, the more Lin Yuan could feel that the thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three sun seeds were a completely different realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, all the sun seeds would form a complete great circulation within his body.</p><p></p><p>Once this great circulation was formed, it would be a great transformation for him.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slowly."</p><p></p><p>"It's only been a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts, and the complexity and obscurity of the last sun seed required him to carefully ponder and comprehend it before he could attempt to condense it.</p><p></p><p>Although it was difficult, with Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, it should just be a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>If a thousand years was not enough, then two thousand, three thousand, or five thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay here any longer."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had been in this scarlet-red world for a while, but he could no longer endure it.</p><p></p><p>This world was filled with ubiquitous Blazing Sun fire, and Lin Yuan's spiritual consciousness could descend and enter it by relying on the protection of the sun seeds, but this protection had a time limit.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yuan's spiritual consciousness projection dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years of closed-door cultivation, to me, it's like just blinking an eye."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the higher one's life level, the more blurred their concept of time would become. In the eyes of those great sovereign celestials, closing their doors for millions or billions of years was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years? It's not even enough for a nap.</p><p></p><p>"But in this thousand years, my advancement has been quite significant."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. The greatest gain was that his Chaotic Dao had reached the second realm.</p><p></p><p>From the first realm of the Chaotic Dao to the second realm, it may seem like only a single realm of advancement, but in reality, Lin Yuan had comprehended and mastered countless great dao rules, resulting in a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>The advancement of the Chaotic Dao could not be directly perceived, but required the continuous comprehension and mastery of more and more extensive great dao rules.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Chaotic Sovereign cultivators would start with the first realm of the Chaotic Dao, and to reach the second realm, they would need to slowly comprehend countless rules over ten or dozens of cosmic eras.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had achieved this in just a thousand years. And his life level was only at the Parting the Heavens Realm, while those sovereigns had the Chaotic Realm life level.</p><p></p><p>The higher the life level, the easier and simpler it was to comprehend the rules.</p><p></p><p>The higher one stands, the farther one can see.</p><p></p><p>"However, although my Chaotic Dao comprehension has reached the second realm, in terms of evolving the Yin-Yang Taiji based on the Chaotic Dao, I still have no clue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In his original estimation, to evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji, the Chaotic Dao had to reach at least the second realm.</p><p></p><p>But the second realm of the Chaotic Dao was only one of the prerequisite conditions for evolving the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji, not the complete set of conditions.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly does the Chaotic give birth to Yin-Yang, how does the Chaotic give birth to Taiji? How to evolve them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, "This is a path unique to me. The Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji, whether in the chaotic void or in this source world, has no precedents."</p><p></p><p>Even if the paths appear to be the same, they are fundamentally different.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Chaotic Fire cultivated by the Azure Burning Marquis was completely different from the Chaotic Fire of other great sovereigns. The Chaotic Fire of the Azure Burning Marquis was azure, it was burning.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Chaotic Fire paths are similar, they can still present very different manifestations.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji is even more so.</p><p></p><p>"If I couldn't enter that scarlet-red world and observe the figure of the Blazing Sun ancestor, a thirteenth-level time life, I'm afraid it would take me tens of thousands or even millions of years to evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he were to simply evolve the Chaotic Yin or the Chaotic Yang alone, it would not pose any difficulty for Lin Yuan, but he was not satisfied with cultivating only one path.</p><p></p><p>Since he had established his foundation with Yin-Yang Taiji from the second realm, now that he had reached the Chaotic evolution of all things, he naturally wanted to focus on the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji as well.</p><p></p><p>As for the pure Chaotic Yin or Chaotic Yang? Even if he did manage to evolve them, it would be a loss for Lin Yuan, as it would lower the potential ceiling of his future.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought, although observing the figure of the Blazing Sun ancestor in that scarlet-red world had not yet allowed him to evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji, it at least pointed him in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>It made his subsequent path much smoother, as he now had a clear goal to pursue, rather than cultivating and comprehending aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to comprehend more great dao rules, and raise the Chaotic Dao to the third realm. Perhaps the evolution of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji will become more gradual and progressive."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought, this was also the realization he gained from frequently observing the figure of the Blazing Sun ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the second realm of the Chaotic Dao should be able to evolve the Yin-Yang Taiji, but it was just a theory. At least, Lin Yuan could not currently perceive the possibility of evolving it.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, he would continue to enhance his Chaotic Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Dao comprehension had three realms in total, and reaching the third realm would basically be the limit of the Chaotic Dao. At this level of rule comprehension, he would be able to easily evolve all kinds of paths.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the fact that I can't even detect the possibility of evolving the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji shows that this path has very high potential."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Some power evolutions only required the first realm of the Chaotic Dao, such as the most common Chaotic Fire or Chaotic Metal, etc.</p><p></p><p>These power paths could be fully encompassed and covered by the first realm of the Chaotic Dao.</p><p></p><p>But some power evolutions required the second realm of the Chaotic Dao, and the difficulty was tens or hundreds of times higher than the former. Of course, the power paths eventually evolved would also see a huge leap in various aspects.</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be inferred that the higher the Chaotic Dao comprehension required for a power path, the greater its potential would be.</p><p></p><p>"The third realm of the Chaotic Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed, in the chaotic void, many Chaotic Great Saints might not even possess the third realm of the Chaotic Dao comprehension, because the number of great dao rules required to be comprehended and mastered was simply too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>With his extraordinary comprehension, comprehending and mastering various great dao rules was not much different from eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>Especially in this source world, through the sun seeds, Lin Yuan's rule comprehension had greatly increased, allowing him to more clearly perceive the fluctuations of countless rules and thus comprehend and master them.</p><p></p><p>"This source world has brought me immense help."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His expression was slightly melancholic. Without this source world, relying solely on cultivation in the chaotic void, Lin Yuan reckoned he would have taken many detours.</p><p></p><p>"If even a single source world is like this, then what about the remaining thirty-two source worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Myriad Realms Gate, the coordinates of the recorded source worlds numbered thirty-three in total.</p><p></p><p>Representing thirty-three source worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"Descending into this source world has already divided my spiritual will by nearly half. Exploring another source world would place too great a burden on my true self, causing significant impact."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Twelfth Realm, the essence of Lin Yuan's life had undergone a transformation. Continuing to traverse, he no longer needed to fully immerse his mind and spirit as he had done in the previous dozen or so crossings.</p><p></p><p>However, it still placed a burden on his spiritual will, requiring him to divide it by nearly half.</p><p></p><p>For the true self of the Chaotic Void, merely dividing a small portion of his spiritual will to explore a source world would not significantly impact him. But to devote another half of his spiritual will to explore a second source world would be the same as leaving his true self with only a small portion of its spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>The consequences of this would be comprehensive, such as a decrease in strength, a reduction in the efficiency of his insights and realizations, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Exploring source worlds was not as simple as condensing an avatar. It required only a thread of spiritual will, as the two different dimensional worlds were separated by infinite spatial-temporal realms. Even with the Myriad Realms Gate acting as an "intermediary," it still required a sufficient amount of spiritual will to maintain the connection.</p><p></p><p>"I'll explore them one by one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew that haste makes waste. After all, the coordinates of the thirty-three source worlds were there. He could wait until he had thoroughly explored this source world or reached a certain bottleneck, then consider withdrawing that portion of spiritual will to explore the subsequent source worlds.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years of incubation, and my seventh bodily divine ability is almost complete."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could feel the root power constantly interweaving and converging at the deepest part of his bloodline. At this moment, all the root power had faintly formed an extremely complex imprint, similar to the blazing sun in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"This bodily divine ability that has taken me so long to cultivate, I wonder what it will be like."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was filled with anticipation. The bodily divine abilities awakened on the path of martial dao evolution were determined by the fundamental power in the depths of one's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's body originated from the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, with the ancestral bloodline flowing within him, which was a Thirteenth Realm bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The bodily divine ability awakened from such a bloodline would most likely be related to the Blazing Sun Ancestor, perhaps even one of the ancestral talents.</p><p></p><p>The talents of a Thirteenth Realm life form? Even though it would be greatly diminished in Lin Yuan due to factors such as his level of existence, it would still be the essence of a Thirteenth Realm temporal life.</p><p></p><p>The key point was that as long as it was an awakened bodily divine ability, Lin Yuan could fully comprehend and apply it in the Chaotic Void and other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The talent of a Thirteenth Realm life form."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but be excited. Through the talent of a Thirteenth Realm life form, he could completely understand the essence of that level of temporal existence.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower had previously paid an immeasurable price, hunting down a rare life form with a rich time bloodline, all for the sake of trying to access the subtle information of the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, on the other hand, had directly condensed the talent originating from a Thirteenth Realm life form.</p><p></p><p>"Now, my body, soul, and various aspects have all grown to the ultimate, and I can fully enter the Sovereign Realm."</p><p></p><p>With a slight shift in his thoughts, Lin Yuan began to cross into the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only this physical body that was entering the Sovereign Realm. As for the true self in the Chaotic Void, he still planned to take it slow.</p><p></p><p>After this physical body had completely entered the Sovereign Realm, he would then go for the breakthrough on that side.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's accumulated foundation, reaching the Sovereign Realm would be a smooth process without any unexpected variables.</p><p></p><p>But there was an even more stable approach, so why not use it? Lin Yuan could discard this physical body in the source world, but he was unwilling to abandon his true self in the Chaotic Void unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>If there were any extreme situations during the breakthrough to the Sovereign Realm, having the physical body in the source world as a vanguard would make Lin Yuan feel more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, my body and soul have begun to undergo transformation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully felt the subtle changes within himself, simultaneously controlling the transformation to proceed in the direction he desired.</p><p></p><p>"This physical body, in terms of foundation and accumulation, is not as good as my true self."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan evaluated objectively. The true self in the Chaotic Void had endured three infusions of the Chaotic Void's primal essence, with the impact on its internal universe being unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>But in this source world, there was no such "benefit." However, the Blazing Sun Divine Body and the Blazing Sun Seed had granted Lin Yuan benefits that were almost on par with his true self.</p><p></p><p>City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The auras of numerous Sovereign Realm experts permeated the area. For a thousand years, the situation between the Azure Flame Domain and the Purple Dream Domain had become increasingly tense. Both sides had mobilized multiple Sovereign Realm powerhouses, ready to engage in battle at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country was paying close attention to the Azure Flame Domain and the Purple Dream Domain. A royal prince had personally taken the lead, directing this war. Most of the Sovereign Realm experts gathered here had been summoned by that royal prince.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, you've arrived." The Azure Flame Marquis greeted Lin Yuan, who had materialized his form.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With so many Sovereigns present, it would have been impolite for him, as a disciple of the Azure Flame Marquis, not to make an appearance.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan had only sent his divine sense here, while his true body was still in seclusion at the Blazing Heaven Pavilion, experiencing the subtle changes during his transition to the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's two divine senses could switch between them using the "Illusory Reality" secret technique, making it impossible for outsiders to distinguish.</p><p></p><p>The other Sovereign Realm experts in the hall also turned their gaze towards Lin Yuan, nodding slightly with goodwill.</p><p></p><p>As fellow Sovereign Realm experts from the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, they would not engage in internal strife when facing the enemy ancient country. The Sovereigns present were generally on good terms with the Azure Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Country's royal prince overseeing the coordination would not have summoned Sovereigns with grievances against the Azure Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Red Leaf Sovereign." Lin Yuan sat next to the Red Leaf Sovereign, one of the few Sovereigns he had interacted with before.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand years ago, they had conducted a transaction, with Lin Yuan exchanging a large number of Myriad Array Crystals to obtain cultivation resources from the Red Leaf Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Red Leaf Sovereign's strength was terrifying, even surpassing that of the Azure Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"The war is likely to start soon," the Red Leaf Sovereign, who had a good impression of Lin Yuan, said with a slightly melancholic tone.</p><p></p><p>He was not a marquis of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country but had appeared here at the invitation of the Azure Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Purple Dream Domain should be ready by now," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, he had devoted almost all his focus and energy to cultivation and seclusion, but he still had a general understanding of the situation between the two great domains.</p><p></p><p>After a thousand years of preparation, the Purple Dream Domain had gathered a large number of powerhouses, and the Azure Flame Domain was no exception. Both sides were poised and ready, waiting to see who would be the first to break the current fragile balance.</p><p></p><p>"Later, let's go to the border." The Azure Flame Marquis, seated in the main position, said that they would go to the border to take a look at how many Sovereigns the Purple Dream Domain had brought, to familiarize themselves in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereigns in the hall chatted for a while, with Lin Yuan mostly listening on the side, occasionally observing the various Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>These Sovereigns had already evolved their own unique power paths from the Chaos. Lin Yuan observed them secretly, often gaining some insights.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan had mostly been observing the figure of the Blazing Sun Ancestor in that scarlet-red world, but the information contained in that figure was too vast and grand for him to fully comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally observing these Sovereigns also provided Lin Yuan with a different kind of experience.</p><p></p><p>"Most of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country's Sovereigns have followed the path of Chaotic Flames."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. A minority, like the Red Leaf Sovereign, had also comprehended the path of Chaotic Life in addition to Chaotic Flames.</p><p></p><p>This was quite normal, as the environment of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country and the Blazing Sun Ancestor's mastery of the Blazing Sun Fire had a profound influence on the cultivators there.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of the Azure Flame Marquis, all the Sovereigns present proceeded to the border of the Azure Flame Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Flame City had a direct spatial-temporal passage to the border, which was to prevent a sudden outbreak of war by the Purple Dream Domain, where the Azure Flame Domain's Sovereigns would not be able to provide timely support.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had previously visited the borders of the two great domains, but the current state of the border area gave Lin Yuan a completely different feeling.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 571</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although, for beings like them, thousands of years may have passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But she certainly hopes more to be able to slowly feel the passage of time with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, my lord!" Ning Tao's beautiful eyes also showed a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>It seems that her lord's realm has also reached an unfathomable level.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to enter the Yin God Realm and come here to slay the Palace Master of the Tai Huang Palace, the Great Sun, but... this unlucky fellow... was slain by you, Ning Tao." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The constantly condensing Ning Tao, whose cultivation is also extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the stellar golden cores here are all substantial, not illusory stellar shadows, and Ning Tao can draw upon the power of the stellar golden cores at any time.</p><p></p><p>In this vast universe, for the Great Sun to run into Ning Tao's line of fire is also unlucky.</p><p></p><p>When Ning Tao activated the power of millions of stellar golden cores, even the mighty Great Sun was instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>After all, the greater the size, the stronger; the more, the better.</p><p></p><p>A single stellar golden core is comparable to a Solar God.</p><p></p><p>And this is not even the Immortal Realm's Sixth Heaven, the stellar golden cores are substantial.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Great Sun encountered Ning Tao, he was doomed.</p><p></p><p>"So, he probably had too much good luck when he was young, leading to misfortune in his later years.</p><p></p><p>First, he encountered me, and later, in this vast universe, he actually encountered you again." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This universe is so vast, far more so than the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan, with his Opening Heaven Realm battle prowess, cannot traverse this entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!" Qi Yuan acted, and a beam of light fell on his first golden core.</p><p></p><p>That golden core, though small in volume, can be considered a micro-sun, but the flames on it are exceptionally scorching.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Principle fell on this golden core.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Devouring Principle continued to spread, at a terrifying speed, to other places.</p><p></p><p>Every stellar golden core now possesses the attribute of devouring.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of devouring, one usually thinks of black holes. My stellar golden cores also have the devouring attribute, what is this called?" Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The stellar golden cores possess the devouring attribute and will automatically and continuously devour the other stars.</p><p></p><p>Until... all the stars in this universe become his golden cores.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the power unleashed by these hundreds of thousands of golden cores is even capable of overwhelming the Principle Realm's Realm Lords." Qi Yuan felt the power of the stellar golden cores, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>If his golden core count were even higher, or even if the entire universe were his, what kind of power would that be?</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao, dressed in a black dress and wrapped in stockings, stood barefoot in the void, gazing at the distant stars, her eyes filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"This speed is much faster than when Miss and I were refining the stellar golden cores." The Golden Canary said beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have finally entered the Yin God Realm, the stellar golden cores can devour on their own. Not only that, I can also... impregnate whoever I glare at!" Qi Yuan said, looking at Ning Tao, joking, "Do you want me to glare at you?"</p><p></p><p>"No!" Ning Tao quickly refused, she had always been a little yandere, but rarely showed it, "This servant does not want to divide her heart among others."</p><p></p><p>"Me neither, I'm still young!" The Golden Canary also hurriedly said, covering her own belly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chuckled, "Since you both don't agree, I'll just glare at that planet over there!"</p><p></p><p>As he said that, he glared at a distant ordinary planet.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless principles began to circulate.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a divine being had poured the Elixir of Life upon the world.</p><p></p><p>"This one, and this one..." Qi Yuan continued to glare at those planets.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the planets seemed to fall into the Elixir of Life.</p><p></p><p>Countless principles descended, transforming these planets.</p><p></p><p>It took half a day before Qi Yuan finally stopped his actions.</p><p></p><p>He had a curious look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Now, these planets have been granted the opportunity to give birth to life. I wonder how many of them will ultimately be able to give rise to life."</p><p></p><p>He did not directly create life.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he could effortlessly create living beings out of nothing.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need. He wanted to see life emerge by chance.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, even as powerful as I am, I still cannot revive... the Five Ancestors of the Five Elements Forbidden Land. I must reach the Yang God Fifth Layer, the Dao Lord Realm, to do so."</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan can easily mark living beings, and if they perish, he can pay a price to resurrect them in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>But before he possessed the Underworld, he could not revive the dead.</p><p></p><p>To revive them, he must reach the Dao Lord Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he becomes a Dao Lord, the Cosmic Mother River will form, and the true spirits of all living beings will be able to find their way in the Cosmic Mother River.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the promise I made long ago to remain unfulfilled for so long." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Back then, in the Five Elements Forbidden Land on the Wangue Continent, the Five Ancestors sacrificed themselves to help him master the Five Elements Refinement, and he had wanted to revive them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go... back to the Immortal Realm. As for the life unfolding here, let it be as it will. I don't know when strange new life forms might emerge."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, with one arm around the Golden Canary and the other around Ning Tao, returned to the Seven-Colored Peak.</p><p></p><p>He first tasted his junior sister's culinary skills, and had to admit that his junior sister had made great progress.</p><p></p><p>Later, he went to find Jinli and indulged in some intimacy. As for how they indulged, in crude terms, he lifted her skirt and was behind her.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Heaven.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light appeared, and a powerful figure emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've finally become a Yang God!" </p><p></p><p>After all these years, Purple Origin Snow had finally chosen to break through and enter the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Luo looked at her senior sister with an envious expression: "Congratulations, Senior Sister, for becoming the second genius of our younger generation in the Purple Origin Heaven to break through into the Yang God Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Purple Origin Xiao Luo was reminded of her Blood Robe Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Blood Robe Senior Brother revealed his Yang God-level battle prowess, it drew the pursuit of the Great Sun Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Xiao Luo was worried, but she never expected the eventual outcome - Blood Robe Senior Brother lured the Great Sun Venerable into an unknown place, and then went alone to the Tai Huang Palace, where the Myriad Stars Descent occurred, causing the Tai Huang Palace to retreat into the sole palace.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Sixth Heaven was shaken.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years have passed, and no one knows how Blood Robe Senior Brother is doing now? The people around her one after another congratulated: "Congratulations, Senior Sister Purple Origin Snow, for breaking through into the Yang God Realm."</p><p></p><p>However, there were also some who muttered softly, "Rashly entering the Yang God Realm at this time is unwise, with the imminent Ling Ya Molt."</p><p></p><p>The Ling Ya Molt, it only targets Yang God experts.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Yin Gods, they are almost unaffected by the Ling Ya Molt.</p><p></p><p>But once one steps into the Yang God Realm, it's a different story.</p><p></p><p>Who knows when the Ling Ya Molt might summon you.</p><p></p><p>The current Ling Ya Molt, although without the Tai Huang Palace Master, is far more powerful than the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>In just a hundred years, thousands of Yang Gods have been summoned.</p><p></p><p>Even a Venerable from the Zhi Li Sect was said to have been summoned among them.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor of the Purple Origin Heaven, as well as the Abyss Lord of the White Dragon Abyss, and that Venerable from the Zhi Li Sect, were all summoned to the Immortal Palace thirty years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Ling Ya Molt has just begun its hundred-year cycle, and the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Realm of the Highest Principles had summoned several powerful experts, which showed the terrifying nature of this Linyi Shedding. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Therefore, even if there were mythical experts, they would try to slow down their breakthrough speed and wait until the Linyi Shedding was over before breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they perished in the Linyi Shedding, it would be too unfortunate.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, my daughter, I don't know if your breakthrough now is a blessing or a curse," Ziyuan Tan said with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you are too cowardly," Ziyuan Xue said nonchalantly. "Back then, that Blood Robe fellow didn't even have an offensive Zaohua Yibao, but he dared to fight against the Ghost Ruler of the Sky. Now that I'm breaking through to the Yang God realm, what's the big deal?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan gave his daughter a disapproving look. "Can you compare to the Venerable Blood Robe?"</p><p></p><p>Doesn't she have any self-awareness?</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe possessed combat power at the Realm of the Highest Principles, rivaling the Venerable. In the entire Six Heavens, experts like the Blood Robe could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I used to be able to come to the Gui Water? Is the Blood Robe any better?" Ziyuan Xue said proudly. "Everyone has their own strengths. For example, Brother Bing Jian is particularly good at laying eggs. Can the Blood Robe match that?"</p><p></p><p>Nearby, upon hearing this, Bing Jian's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>He only occasionally laid an egg, how did that make him particularly good at it?</p><p></p><p>"In terms of laying eggs, I indeed cannot match Bing Jian." At this moment, a young voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>A handsome young man in a blood-red robe appeared, his face bearing a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>When the people present saw him, the Yang Gods of the Ziyuan Heavens, as well as the disciples, were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Venerable Blood Robe!"</p><p>"Greetings, Brother Blood Robe!"</p><p></p><p>Next to them, Ziyuan Xiaolu clenched her fists, her eyes sparkling.</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years, the Blood Robe Brother had become even more handsome.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on finally breaking through to the Yang God realm, Sister Niujiao!" Qi Yuan said, congratulating Ziyuan Xue.</p><p></p><p>"But it's only the first layer of the Yang God realm, so I'm still weak," Ziyuan Xue said, her tone somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Ziyuan Tan's eyes shone with excitement. "Venerable Blood Robe, before the Ancestor left for the Immortal Palace, he left you a message."</p><p></p><p>All these years, he had been searching for Qi Yuan, but he couldn't find him at all. After all, for an expert at the Venerable's level, hiding his whereabouts from even the Realm of the Highest Principles was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what did the old man say?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, he had already learned about the Linyi Shedding and knew that thirty years ago, the Immortal Palace had opened, and the Ziyuan Ancestor had been summoned there. This summons might be related to the downfall of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor said that in the Immortal Palace, he would be very careful about his life, so you don't need to worry," Ziyuan Tan said.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Ancestor was afraid Qi Yuan would act rashly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not worried at all," Qi Yuan said, patting his hands. "I've already reserved a spot for him in the Underworld. If he dies, he dies."</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan was stunned by this.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Robe wasn't a Venerable and at the Realm of the Highest Principles, he would definitely have a few words with him.</p><p></p><p>"I have a question," Ziyuan Xue said, her face filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned to her, somewhat suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, 'when a person dies, the birds fly to the sky.' The Immortal Palace is at the peak of the Six Heavens, the highest realm of the Immortal World. If the Ancestor were to die, where would the birds fly to?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought seriously about it. "The Seven Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Seven Heavens had not yet been opened, and living beings could not enter, it was still considered a heaven, right?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Unique Palace was located in the Seven Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The fugitives from the Taihuang Palace were also hiding in the Seven Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still thinking about when he could bring those fugitives from the Taihuang Palace down and bring them to justice.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Heavens have not yet been opened," Ziyuan Xue said. "Probably more Yang Gods need to die before the Seven Heavens can be opened."</p><p></p><p>The Six Heavens were opened by the exhaustive efforts of Venerable experts over countless years.</p><p></p><p>As for the higher Seven Heavens, who knows how many Linyi Sheddings it would take to achieve that.</p><p></p><p>If there were the Seven Heavens, perhaps the Venerables at the Realm of the Highest Principles could advance further, stepping into the third layer of the Yang God realm.</p><p></p><p>The beings of the Immortal World's Nine Heavens could also glimpse the future.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan closed his eyes and activated his supernatural hearing ability, listening carefully.</p><p></p><p>"I am a wolf!"</p><p>"I am guilty, Venerable Blood Robe, I am guilty!"</p><p>"I don't want to stay in the Unique Palace anymore!"</p><p>"...Hungry!"</p><p></p><p>Among the countless voices, he found the ones related to the fugitives from the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Heavens have not been opened. Can I enter the Seven Heavens?</p><p></p><p>The Unique Palace in the Seven Heavens arbitrarily taking my criminals away is a bit unfair.</p><p></p><p>I seem to hear my criminals begging for mercy, asking me to bring them back to the Six Heavens!</p><p></p><p>You see, these criminals are so well-behaved and follow the rules. How can I not bring them back?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan was taken aback, not expecting Qi Yuan to suddenly change the topic so abruptly, but he was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>After all, his daughter Ziyuan Xue was also like this.</p><p></p><p>"The Taihuang Palace can only enter the Unique Palace with the decree of the Unique Palace. Others cannot. To enter the Unique Palace, one must first open the Seven Heavens," Ziyuan Tan replied.</p><p></p><p>"If I enter the Immortal Palace, located at the peak of the Six Heavens, will I have a chance to go to the Seven Heavens?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Immortal Palace is closed, it will probably only be opened again after the Linyi Shedding is over, and the people inside can leave. But the next time the Immortal Palace opens, it may be in about a hundred years. Blood Robe Venerable, you only need to wait a hundred years, and you may be able to enter the Immortal Palace, but..." Ziyuan Tan didn't finish the sentence.</p><p></p><p>It was because the Ancestor had instructed him not to let the Blood Robe worry about the Ziyuan Ancestor entering the Immortal Palace, lest something unexpected happen.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years is too slow. I'll go to the Immortal Palace and take a look myself." Qi Yuan said, and his figure disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan looked at this with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Blood Robe Venerable still wouldn't listen to advice.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, once the door of the Immortal Palace was closed, no one could open it.</p><p></p><p>In the past, even three Venerables had joined forces, but they were unable to damage the Immortal Palace in the slightest, let alone open it.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Tan did not believe that Qi Yuan could open the door of the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>After all, even as powerful as the Venerables, they had to bow their heads humbly before the Unique Palace. Not to mention the Blood Robe's strength, which should be weaker than the Great Sun Venerable, otherwise he wouldn't have used schemes to trick the Great Sun away and plot against the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know that the position of the Great Sun had already been devoured by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Realm of the Highest Principles:</p><p></p><p>A low voice murmured, "He... has appeared again."</p><p></p><p>"He has violated the Unique Palace. I wonder how the Unique Palace will deal with him."</p><p></p><p>"He has mastered two supreme Highest Principles... Is it worth investing in him... to help him avoid the Linyi Shedding."</p><p></p><p>"This Linyi Shedding is different."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

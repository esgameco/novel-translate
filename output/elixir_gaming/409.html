        <h1>Chapter 409</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was endless darkness, where even the stars illuminating the heavens could not cast their light.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators who entered here would perish in less than a breath. </p><p></p><p>Only mythical beings who illuminated the heavens could barely traverse the gaps between voids.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young male cultivator with picturesque features stood atop a gourd, holding a flying sword. The flying sword in his hand transformed into a streak of light, fiercely stabbing towards a shadowy figure ahead.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The flying sword collided with the shadow. The shadow seemed to resist with all its might, but was utterly unable to withstand that flying sword. After struggling briefly, it directly expired.</p><p></p><p>A fish fell into the handsome young man's hand. "Not a bad catch, a void fish."</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man was a mythical cultivator from the upper realms. His avatar projection had entered the void gaps with his junior sister to collect resources.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is so amazing, I really admire you!" said a scantily-clad female cultivator in a coquettish voice, her eyes sparkling with stars.</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man was very receptive to this kind of flattery. He generously tossed the fish, saying: "This void fish is for junior sister."</p><p></p><p>The young female cultivator grabbed the void fish, saying happily: "Really? Senior brother is so good to me. Xiaxia must be the happiest woman in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"There are many good things in the void gaps, including many things more precious than void fish. </p><p></p><p>Of course, there may also be many terrifying monsters here.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there is a type of monster called blood crystal essence, which comes in all sorts of shapes and is extremely huge. </p><p></p><p>Its most distinctive feature is that its entire body is blood-red, just like blood.</p><p></p><p>This blood crystal essence is suspected to be condensed from starlight.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing for us mythical beings who illuminate the heavens, as it can enhance our illuminating light.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, I exerted great effort to slay an extremely huge blood crystal essence!"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the handsome young man looked very proud, clearly considering slaying a blood crystal essence to be quite an impressive feat for him.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, senior brother is so amazing, even able to defeat a blood crystal essence!" The young female cultivator's voice was perfectly coquettish, which the handsome male cultivator found very pleasing.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see those things ahead with vortexes emitting faint light above them? Those are continents from the lower realms. Junior sister should stay away from them, they're very dirty. If your precious body were to be soiled, senior brother would feel terrible." As the handsome young man was speaking, he suddenly froze when he saw his junior sister in her pink dress. "Oh no junior sister, how could you swallow the void fish whole in one gulp?"</p><p></p><p>The pink-dressed female cultivator's eyes immediately welled up with tears: "Does senior brother dislike that Xiaxia has a big appetite?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not it!" The handsome male cultivator hurried to comfort her. "It's just that you shouldn't eat too much void fish at once, it easily causes... gas and... water output."</p><p></p><p>This "gas" meant flatulence. </p><p></p><p>"Water output" meant frequent urination.</p><p></p><p>Eating too much at once, even ordinary mythical beings couldn't control their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the pink-dressed female cultivator looked very embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Pffft.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Xiaxia wants to die, can't go on living, wuwu... too ashamed to face anyone."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the handsome young man became very anxious. He quickly inhaled deeply: "It smells nice, like a milk fart."</p><p></p><p>How could he bear to let her suffer any embarrassment! But at this moment, the previously embarrassed pink-dressed female cultivator suddenly stiffened: "So scary, such a huge blood crystal essence!"</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man immediately exuded an imposing aura: "Where is this blood crystal essence that dares to frighten my junior sister!"</p><p></p><p>Sword in hand, he was ready to slay the blood crystal essence in one strike for daring to scare his precious junior sister.</p><p></p><p>"Over... there!" The pink-dressed female cultivator pointed with a trembling voice, her coquettish tone now shaky.</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man looked in the direction she was pointing, his eyes suddenly contracting before widening.</p><p></p><p>"This... this..."</p><p></p><p>In his field of vision, countless millions of miles away, an enormous blood-red entity covered in blood armor was traversing the void gaps.</p><p></p><p>Its body was so huge, so massive, it defied description. The handsome young man had never before seen such a terrifying colossus.</p><p></p><p>Though only the tip of the iceberg was visible, it was... humanoid in form.</p><p></p><p>A giant humanoid figure, like an terrifying deity of unfathomable height, clad in blood armor.</p><p></p><p>The void gaps were tinted red by its blood armor.</p><p></p><p>Where it stepped, the void trembled.</p><p></p><p>Where it waved its hand, the gaps shattered.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The handsome young man was terrified to the extreme. Then he noticed something that made his hair stand on end. "It's... actually...!"</p><p></p><p>He saw that terrifying colossus open its bloody maw.</p><p></p><p>The target of that bloody maw was actually... a cultivation world! That was a real cultivation world! Though far away, it looked no bigger than a steamed bun before that blood-red demon god, but it was still a real cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>No smaller than the world he came from! His whole body trembled. Coming to the void gaps, he had actually witnessed an "evil celestial being" devouring a world? The blood-red demon god suddenly swallowed down an entire world as its bloody maw opened wide.</p><p></p><p>That enormous world had absolutely no ability to resist in the blood-colored demon god's hands, as if it were just a tasty snack.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the pink-dressed female cultivator's face turned deathly pale. She clutched her senior brother's clothes tightly, terrified beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man quickly embraced the pink-dressed female cultivator: "Don't be afraid junior sister, it's very far from us, it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, a voice like heavenly thunder suddenly sounded in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"What milk fart, it clearly stinks!"</p><p></p><p>"Too disgusting in public!"</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man's expression changed drastically, his face filled with dread: "Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>The pink-dressed female cultivator also looked around angrily and ashamed, but saw no one.</p><p></p><p>"I am the blood crystal essence you were talking about."</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man felt as if he'd been struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly looked over and saw that terrifying demon god who had just swallowed a world turn its head to look at him, its gaze carrying a hint of exasperation.</p><p></p><p>He instantly fell to his knees.</p><p></p><p>The pink-dressed junior sister fared even worse. Perhaps because she had eaten the void fish, she couldn't hold her water and directly wet herself.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blood-colored colossus in the distance was even more exasperated: "I guess that's not milk this time?"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, its massive body shifted, wandering through the void gaps, seemingly in search of another target.</p><p></p><p>As for the handsome young man and pink-dressed female cultivator, they clung to each other, terrified to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the void gaps, that terrifying blood-colored demon god was naturally Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the coordinates of the three thousand worlds from the Great Calamity, he began wandering the void gaps, devouring the three thousand worlds under the Great Calamity's jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>By now, he had already eaten over a thousand worlds.</p><p></p><p>After eating nearly two thousand more, he would have devoured all the worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Feeling a bit full."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt somewhat stuffed as he wandered the void gaps.</p><p></p><p>"I won't start... milk burping too, will I?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling that couple, Qi Yuan felt a chill all over.</p><p></p><p>He tried to push those thoughts aside as he headed towards the next set of coordinates.</p><p></p><p>His vast and boundless form wandered the void gaps like a whale swimming through the ocean, constantly feeding.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally paid no attention to the scraps in the void gaps.</p><p></p><p>What he devoured was blood crystal essence.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that coming to eat the three thousand worlds would allow me to find so many snacks for my little wife Jia."</p><p></p><p>That's right, after arriving in the void gaps, Qi Yuan discovered this special creation called blood crystal essence.</p><p></p><p>It had no intelligence or spirituality, and would indiscriminately attack any living being it encountered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took one look and found that it was somewhat similar to the blood crystals he and little Jia liked to eat, but of a higher grade.</p><p></p><p>[Blood Crystal Essence, a special creation condensed from the light of the myriad stars of the heavens.]</p><p></p><p>This was the information Qi Yuan's eyes saw.</p><p></p><p>Now, mountains of blood crystal essence had accumulated within his body.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if little Jia will be able to evolve after eating all these snacks."</p><p></p><p>Little Jia had been by his side ever since she first appeared.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that little Jia played a huge role in Qi Yuan's ability to clear the game.</p><p></p><p>If he fed these snacks to little Jia, she might become much stronger.</p><p></p><p>He wondered when his little wife Jia would</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Able to grow jade hands and jade feet.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these are adjectives. If by chance the words come true and actual "jade" feet grow, it would be somewhat impolite. Qi Yuan thought randomly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he arrived at another coordinate.</p><p></p><p>Then... he opened his giant mouth again and suddenly swallowed that world.</p><p></p><p>The living beings in that world had no idea what was happening. They only felt all the stars in the heavens extinguish in that moment, as the world turned blood-red with only ten suns hanging in the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>On the Mountain of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables gathered their avatars, extremely busy.</p><p></p><p>These Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables were using their supreme magical powers to forge a palace.</p><p></p><p>This palace was the Hall of Ultimate Principles.</p><p></p><p>In the Sixth Heaven, there was a loose organization called the Ultimate Principles Association.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, to become an official member of the Ultimate Principles Association, one must be a powerhouse at the Ultimate Principles realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this loose organization gathered almost all the Ultimate Principles realm powerhouses in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Time waits for no one. After 100,000 years, the Ultimate Principles Dao Discussion is being held again. Last time, this old man could only transform into a strongman to build the Hall of Ultimate Principles. Who would have thought that 100,000 years later, this old man is still a builder," sighed a Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable, quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>At the realm of Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable, breakthroughs were no longer related to time.</p><p></p><p>Even if one went to a world where time flowed extremely slowly, if one couldn't break through, one still couldn't break through.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat similar to Yin Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder who will be able to break through to the Ultimate Principles realm this time. I wonder if that Buddha from the Buddha Kingdom will be able to break through to Ultimate Principles," sighed a Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>He came from the Third Heaven and was very much in awe of the Buddha Kingdom in the Fifth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"As a Buddha, he certainly has the potential for great Ultimate Principles. Breaking through to Ultimate Principles should naturally be no problem!" said the Futu Celestial Venerable from Futu Mountain. His sect was located in the Second Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had also been recruited by the Ultimate Principles Association to do unpaid labor.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha Kingdom has a grudge with the Tai Huang Palace. Hehe, how could that one from Tai Huang Palace allow the Buddha to enter the realm of Great Ultimate Principles?" said a minor Celestial Rank Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable from the Moluo race, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo race was currently at war with the Buddha Kingdom, so his words were only natural.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how many years has it been since our Immortal Realm produced a Great Ultimate Principles expert? If the Buddha has the potential for Great Ultimate Principles, the Ultimate Principles Association certainly won't stand by and let that one from Tai Huang Palace take action!" spoke a purple-robed Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable. He came from the Purple Mountain Alliance, a major power in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Hearing him speak, even though that Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable from the Moluo race was dissatisfied in his heart, he dared not refute.</p><p></p><p>However, he then said: "Forget about the Buddha Kingdom, even that Ten Suns Celestial Venerable is nothing but a clown. The ten suns are indeed terrifying, but wanting to contend with that one is simply seeking death. If he really had the ability, why would he need to hide like this? Even that one from Tai Huang Palace sent out an invitation asking him to come to Tai Huang Palace to discuss the Dao, but he didn't dare to appear. This old man guesses he's nothing more than a Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable who had some lucky encounters. Getting some lucky encounters and becoming so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The Moluo race had always been lapdogs of Tai Huang Palace, so the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present were not surprised to hear him say this.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to form ten suns and kill us, it would probably be extremely easy," the Futu Celestial Venerable couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Futu, don't speak for me. If that Ten Suns Celestial Venerable dares to come to our Moluo, we'll make sure he can enter but not leave! A mere unconventional Yang Spirit who hasn't even attained a venerable position or proven Ultimate Principles dares to be so arrogant!" said the Mokan Celestial Venerable of the Moluo race, his eyes filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>He indeed had his own confidence.</p><p></p><p>That Ten Suns Celestial Venerable was indeed very powerful.</p><p></p><p>But his greatest strength was only in his potential.</p><p></p><p>Not having proven a venerable position, but condensing ten suns, in terms of actual strength, he was probably not even at Ultimate Principles, just at the peak of Great Celestial Rank.</p><p></p><p>For several hundred thousand or a million years, the Moluo race indeed had the upper hand over the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable entered Moluo territory, the Moluo race's Ultimate Principles experts would come out together and kill him.</p><p></p><p>That one from Tai Huang Palace would surely reward the Moluo race well.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the expression of that Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable from the Purple Mountain Alliance suddenly changed. He then said: "If this Ten Suns Celestial Venerable appears in your Moluo race, it would likely be a disaster for the Moluo race."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if he dares to appear, he'll know the price of arrogance!" said the Mokan Celestial Venerable, his voice cold.</p><p></p><p>But then that Celestial Venerable from the Purple Mountain Alliance spoke, his voice carrying a hint of shock: "My main body just received news that Tai Huang Palace's... Great Calamity has been destroyed, and the world swallowed."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present were extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know much about the Great Calamity, but they understood that it was almost Tai Huang Palace's reverse scale.</p><p></p><p>To actually destroy the Great Calamity and swallow the world controlled by Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>This... was undoubtedly a slap in the face!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, how could the Upper Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable Luo Bu of Tai Huang Palace allow someone to kill a Great Calamity and swallow a world!</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the work of the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable? Hmph, he has some guts, actually taking advantage while Tai Huang Palace was unprepared to steal a Great Calamity and destroy a world!" The Mokan Celestial Venerable stubbornly refused to admit defeat, unimpressed.</p><p></p><p>A world's Great Calamity, without Tai Huang Palace's support, might at most have the combat power of one Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Swallowing a world looked very scary.</p><p></p><p>But if he manifested his Dharma body, swallowing one or two worlds wouldn't be a problem, though any more than that would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>So, the actions of the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable didn't scare him.</p><p></p><p>But then that Yang Spirit Celestial Venerable from the Purple Mountain Alliance spoke, his voice filled with indescribable shock: "The Great Calamities destroyed in Tai Huang Palace were not just one, and the worlds swallowed were not just one."</p><p></p><p>The Mokan Celestial Venerable became somewhat wary, but pretended not to care as he asked: "How many?"</p><p></p><p>"All of them... All three thousand Great Calamities of Tai Huang Palace, all three thousand worlds, were swallowed!"</p><p></p><p>"What!"</p><p></p><p>The Mokan Celestial Venerable's eyes widened, disbelief showing in them.</p><p></p><p>The other Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables were also incredibly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand worlds... all swallowed, how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"What realm is he at, what level of power, how does he not even have a venerable position!"</p><p></p><p>The Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables present were utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Destroying one world, they could do that too.</p><p></p><p>Destroying three thousand worlds without resistance, they could do that too.</p><p></p><p>But destroying Tai Huang Palace's three thousand Great Calamities and swallowing Tai Huang Palace's three thousand worlds, none of them could do that.</p><p></p><p>One Great Calamity was comparable to one Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>As a result, three thousand Great Calamities perished, three thousand worlds swallowed, yet Tai Huang Palace didn't receive any news, and that one from Tai Huang Palace didn't come to provide support. It was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on the Mokan Celestial Venerable's face, that Celestial Venerable from the Purple Mountain Alliance looked very pleased. He spoke with schadenfreude: "Hehe, if the Ten Suns Celestial Venerable were to go to your Moluo race, I wonder how many worlds your Moluo race has... enough for him to swallow."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Netherworld, Qi Yuan wore a blood-red robe. He held Little Jia's ice-cold sleeve and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Finally finished eating, fortunately... didn't burp milk!"</p><p></p><p>He deliberately emphasized the word "milk".</p><p></p><p>After saying it himself, even he felt a bit nauseated.</p><p></p><p>Little Jia stood by his side. If she had eyes, they would probably be fixed on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>No matter when, as long as Qi Yuan needed her, she was always there for him.</p><p></p><p>"Eat quickly, the taste of these blood crystal essences should be better than blood crystals."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took a blood crystal essence and placed it on Little Jia's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The sleeve grasped the blood crystal essence, and a happy wooden sign slid down.</p><p></p><p>The blood crystal essence disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked Little Jia over and found that her body seemed more solid.</p><p></p><p>But other than that, there were no other changes.</p><p></p><p>This made a look of disappointment flash across his face. He hugged Little Jia's waist area and said in a somewhat desolate voice: "Little Jia, oh Little Jia, when will I be able to hear your voice."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

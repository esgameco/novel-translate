        <h1>Chapter 503</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had no expectations, expecting a madman was no better than expecting a slightly more clever spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Don't wait until later, first teach the current student well. </p><p>If you can't even teach the first student properly, how can you teach the second one?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Zhen spoke jokingly as he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei watched Wu Zhen leave, his expression not looking good. He lifted his head and looked up at the sky, furrowing his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Why is there only one sun, it's so uncomfortable to look at. If there were two, it would be much more pleasing."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei made a sarcastic remark as he headed towards the courtyard where Qi Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>The vast Shen manor, rather than calling it a manor, it was more like a huge estate.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of extraordinary beings, the labor force in this world was much stronger, and the architecture was also more grand and imposing.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the elegant courtyard buildings, Chen Xianwei arrived at the courtyard where Qi Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, today I've come to teach you how to forge artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of Wu Zhen's blow, Chen Xianwei decided not to tell stories anymore and started teaching Qi Yuan artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Chen, you should still tell stories, I'm more interested in the stories you tell." Qi Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Chen Xianwei sighed.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a madman has no interest in forging artifacts, he'd rather listen to stories.</p><p>He has to be coddled like a child.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he felt hopeless, not knowing how long he would have to teach Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Wu Zhen's sarcastic remarks today and the patriarch's grand promises, he couldn't help but ask, "I heard you went to the artifact forge and took some materials?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, speaking of that, Teacher Chen, I have something to ask you."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, feel free to ask."</p><p></p><p>"I want to know if there is any place in the Fengshan Prefecture where I can sell artifacts, like a stall." Qi Yuan expressed his need.</p><p></p><p>He had forged some artifacts, but those artifacts were somewhat unconventional and didn't fit in with Ningguo.</p><p>The artifact shops that collected artifacts mostly collected more standardized ones.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei was slightly taken aback: "In the west of the city there is a ghost market that opens every evening at the hour of the dog. </p><p>The ghost market is a mix of dragons and snakes, attracting all kinds of people.</p><p>All kinds of artifacts are sold there, even some dirty artifacts.</p><p>If you want to buy any artifacts, you can go to the ghost market.</p><p>But the ghost market is not safe, if you want to go, it's best to find a military guard to accompany and protect you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Teacher Chen, please continue the lesson." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei nodded and continued the lesson, though a bit listlessly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan listened attentively below.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, Chen Xianwei finished the lesson.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any questions, you can ask me. Also, the most important thing for the awakening of the heart fire is the spirit. If I'm not around, don't rashly awaken it, or you may end up burning yourself." Chen Xianwei warned.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Teacher Chen, I'm not that stupid, and my talent for artifact forging is actually pretty good." Qi Yuan said confidently, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>He almost said the classic line: "No one understands artifact forging better than me."</p><p></p><p>"My heart fire has already awakened." Qi Yuan said casually, "I've even forged some artifacts, and I'm planning to sell them at the ghost market."</p><p></p><p>"The heart fire has awakened?" Chen Xianwei's eyes widened, "Wait, you've forged artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit dazed, not reacting for a moment.</p><p>The heart fire has awakened? Forged artifacts? Both were equally shocking.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Chen, look at this." Qi Yuan extended his palm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, a wisp of white flame rose up, burning continuously.</p><p></p><p>"This... this is the heart fire!" Chen Xianwei seemed to have thought of something, and subconsciously asked, "When did it awaken?"</p><p></p><p>"On the first day you taught me, when you gave me the 'Artifact Forging Fundamentals', I practiced according to it, and the heart fire awakened that very night." Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"That night?" Chen Xianwei swallowed.</p><p></p><p>A madman wouldn't lie.</p><p></p><p>That means Qi Yuan awakened the heart fire in just one day? Relying on the 'Artifact Forging Fundamentals'.</p><p></p><p>It's like a primary school student learning the multiplication table and then acing the college math exam, shocking everyone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the awakened heart fire was a special white one.</p><p>Ordinary heart fires are mostly orange and fiery red.</p><p>Some artifact forgers with special talents have different colored flames.</p><p>Qi Yuan's heart fire was white, with a cold chill amidst the intense heat, clearly not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"You... were born to forge artifacts!" Chen Xianwei couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>To awaken the heart fire so quickly, this talent, is the seed of a born artifact forger.</p><p>If properly cultivated, he has the potential to become a master-level artifact forger, even glimpsing the realm of grand artifact forgers.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see the artifacts you've forged." Chen Xianwei coughed, his expression becoming calm.</p><p>He decided to carve this jade-like Qi Yuan, and give some suggestions on the artifacts he had forged.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Chen, please take a look." Qi Yuan extended his hand, revealing a strangely shaped artifact.</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei examined the artifact carefully, the more he looked, the more confused he became: "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The artifact's shape was too bizarre, like a weapon, yet also like a wooden pole.</p><p>And he couldn't detect any grade on this artifact.</p><p>But thinking about it, it's not strange that Qi Yuan's first forged artifact wouldn't have a grade.</p><p></p><p>"It's a selfie stick." Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>On his first day of forging, he had forged quite a few artifacts.</p><p>Among them, the drone he wanted to use to play the role of a deity, naturally he couldn't show Chen Xianwei.</p><p>If Chen Xianwei saw the drone, how would he continue to play the role of a deity in the future?</p><p>After all, there's a saying that if the deity's identity is exposed, its awe-inspiring power will be diminished.</p><p>The drone is the same, in this world where people don't know the principles, they naturally think Qi Yuan is a deity.</p><p>This selfie stick was forged by Qi Yuan using the remaining scraps.</p><p>The golden canary often likes to take selfies, so Qi Yuan thought of forging a selfie stick to give her.</p><p></p><p>"What is the use of this artifact?" Chen Xianwei asked awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>As a Profound-level artifact forger, by rights he should be able to see through the origins of this artifact without a grade at a glance - the materials, forging techniques, and spiritual infusion methods, etc.</p><p>But the forging method of this artifact was completely beyond his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"It's for taking selfies, I'm planning to give it to my wife."</p><p></p><p>To give it to the young miss? Chen Xianwei tactfully didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>"Do you master other forging methods?" He couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've mastered quite a few." </p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Expanse Extraordinary Land, Qi Yuan had mastered many forging methods of the celestial clan, as well as spiritual infusion and imprinting methods.</p><p>These skills could be used to forge artifacts and enhance their functions.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Chen Xianwei didn't ask further. He recalled what the patriarch had said, that Qi Yuan's father was a mysterious artifact forger.</p><p>It seems Qi Yuan's heritage came from his father.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something and warned: "Young master, try not to reveal the fact that you can forge artifacts, especially the methods you use..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Xianwei couldn't discern the grade of the method used to forge that selfie stick, but the forging methods behind it were definitely precious.</p><p>Forging methods are the foundation of survival and extremely valuable for some artifact forgers.</p><p>So he warned Qi Yuan not to reveal them.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan thought about it and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Chen Xianwei had his head lowered, his expression tense.</p><p>Shen Wanshan sat in the main seat, hearing Chen Xianwei's words, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has great potential as an artifact forger."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Wanshan sighed, and it was unclear whether he was delighted or lamenting.</p><p></p><p>"His innate talent as an alchemist is very strong. In less than twenty years, he will definitely become a mid-rank alchemist!" Chen Xianwei said with conviction, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p></p><p>In his lifetime, it would be difficult for him to become a mid-rank alchemist, but if he could cultivate one, that fellow Wu Zhen would have to walk around him.</p><p></p><p>"Does he possess some hidden forging techniques?" Shen Wanshan asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"This matter... must be kept confidential, do not let it leak out," Shen Wanshan instructed solemnly. "You teach him some new forging techniques and just say that the forging techniques he has mastered are the ones you taught him."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Chen Xianwei quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shen Wanshan pour tea, he took the hint and politely took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, after Big Brother Qi left, there are many eyes watching Qi Yuan. Is it for the forging techniques, or something else?" Shen Wanshan was somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shen family was a prominent clan in Ningguo, the hidden forces that were paying attention to Qi Yuan were something Shen Wanshan had been investigating for a long time without any clues. He felt that the waters were very deep.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan has displayed powerful alchemy talent, and he didn't know whether to be happy or worried.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At 7 o'clock in the evening, the night fell, and a black mist shrouded the Fengshan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Except for some rich young masters, most commoners had already returned home early.</p><p></p><p>Since there were not many entertainment activities in this era, making babies had become one of the few entertainment activities for the poor families.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the vast darkness of Fengshan Prefecture, the Ghost Market in the west of the city was brightly lit, bustling with people coming and going.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a small stall, an old man and a young man were setting up their booth.</p><p></p><p>The old man had a somewhat disheveled appearance, with a steamed bun clenched between his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The young man had a handsome appearance, dressed in black clothes, with an extraordinary aura.</p><p></p><p>This old and young pair were Qi Yuan and Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>Using the "Thousand Transformations", they had changed their appearances and entered the Ghost Market to set up a stall and sell their own magical artifacts, earning some silver taels.</p><p></p><p>"Clearance sale, magical artifacts for cheap, last two days, don't miss it!" </p><p></p><p>A pre-recorded voice from a speaker in front of the stall kept shouting.</p><p></p><p>This speaker, with its modern sound, was completely out of place with the ancient atmosphere of the Ghost Market, naturally attracting the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, your magical artifacts are quite interesting, what grade are they, and they can even repeat what you say," the old stall owner next door said enviously, eyeing Qi Yuan's speaker.</p><p></p><p>If he had such a magical artifact, wouldn't he be able to save the trouble of shouting?</p><p></p><p>"No grade, do you want to buy it? Only 99 silver taels." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." The neighboring stall owner laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>99 silver taels for an ungraded artifact? That's highway robbery!</p><p></p><p>In Ningguo, one silver tael could buy about a stone of rice, around 500 catties.</p><p></p><p>99 silver taels could buy a graded magical artifact, who would buy this artifact that only makes sounds?</p><p></p><p>"Young man, your artifacts... are not certified, and they are not standard magical artifacts. The pricing is also a bit high, so I'm afraid they will be hard to sell," the stall owner next door said.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan's speaker had attracted the attention of many in the Ghost Market, and there were quite a few people asking about the price, most were deterred by the high price.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Qi Yuan's artifacts were not certified and were not standard magical artifacts, they looked strange and peculiar.</p><p></p><p>What if it was a scam?</p><p></p><p>Buying magical artifacts was not a small matter. Spending so many silver taels, one naturally had to be very careful.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, I have modern marketing strategies. Didn't you hear the speaker announcing the clearance sale? Surely someone will come and buy!" </p><p></p><p>This kind of marketing strategy was very common on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>There were often stores that wrote "clearance sale, only last two days", but when you went there a month later, the sign was still there.</p><p></p><p>The neighboring stall owner just smiled and didn't argue further.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the Ghost Market, Tu Sangong, wearing a mask on his face, was accompanied by a young master with a long sword hanging at his waist, who looked extremely noble.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tu, this is the Ghost Market of Fengshan Prefecture. It looks quite nice, but the magical artifacts for sale... are a bit ordinary," the noble young master commented. "I'm afraid you'll have a hard time finding the artifacts you need this time."</p><p></p><p>For a Martial Cultivator, in addition to the main weapon or the Fate Artifact, they would also possess many other magical artifacts to enhance their own strength.</p><p></p><p>This noble young master had invited Tu Sangong to go slay some Ghostly Spirits, that is, to do a so-called "dungeon run".</p><p></p><p>Tu Sangong had come to the Ghost Market to purchase some magical artifacts for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just trying my luck. Maybe I'll be able to find a good bargain," Tu Sangong smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Among the top 20 on the Alchemist Ranking, it seems there are no alchemists from Jining Prefecture who have made the list. What a pity," the noble young master sighed.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sangong smiled without saying anything, as if he found the noble young master's focus on the high-end a bit amusing.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice reached Tu Sangong's ears.</p><p></p><p>The noble young master also looked towards the source of the sound, his expression calm: "I went to that stall about an hour ago. It was quite interesting, the price was a bit high, but the quality of the artifacts, I'm not sure."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Tu Sangong became interested. "I should go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Their artifacts are not certified, and they are not standard, but the price is about twice as high as ordinary ones. Be careful not to get scammed," the noble young master warned.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Tu Sangong headed towards the stall where the voice was coming from.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there was already a crowd gathered around Qi Yuan's stall.</p><p></p><p>Discussions, noisy voices, all mixed together.</p><p></p><p>"You want 100 taels for an ungraded artifact? Do you take me for a fool?"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like a scammer, I've never seen such an artifact in my life!"</p><p></p><p>"Your artifact... feels so useless?"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were mostly questioning or just watching the commotion.</p><p></p><p>Tu Sangong pushed through the crowd, his gaze falling on the stall. Suddenly, his eyelids twitched, and his heartbeat suddenly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>Because the Thorn Blood's artifact in his possession was reacting at this moment, and the artifact was pointing to the stall owner, that handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>His heart suddenly sank, and he saw the stall owner's gaze fall on him.</p><p></p><p>"Handsome, do you want to buy some magical artifacts?" </p><p></p><p>This form of address was a bit unusual, and Tu Sangong's heartstrings tightened.</p><p></p><p>The artifact had reacted, and the blood-red mist meant that the stall owner had at least slain dozens of Ghostly Spirits from the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that this person was from the Crimson Cloud Stronghold?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, his nerves became even more tense.</p><p></p><p>This person... was a big shot!</p><p></p><p>If he really served the Thorn Blood, he might now be sending a message to the big shots of the Thorn Blood.</p><p></p><p>But he was not, he was an undercover agent.</p><p></p><p>Now, this young man turned out to be so powerful, single-handedly slaying 87 formidable Ghostly Spirits, like a deity had descended. Doesn't it mean that the magical artifacts he's selling may also be extraordinary? He felt somewhat tempted, suppressing the fear in his heart, and his tone unconsciously became more respectful.</p><p></p><p>"I wish to purchase an offensive-type magical artifact. I wonder if the stall owner has any?"</p><p></p><p>"Offensive-type?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Offensive-type artifacts were indeed not many.</p><p></p><p>"How about this one?" </p><p></p><p>He handed Tu Sangong an artifact that looked like a flashlight.</p><p></p><p>"This is a light saber. The inspiration comes from... well, I don't remember which TV series, but its biggest advantage is that it's very cool and stylish," Qi Yuan introduced.</p><p></p><p>"How ugly, and you dare to call it stylish?" the noble young master couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>He was dressed very fashionably, clearly the type who loved to show off.</p><p></p><p>The artifact in the shape of a flashlight, naturally, he did not approve of it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Ten years have passed, but only one day should have gone by in the Cang Lan realm."</p><p></p><p>A light rain drizzled on the city walls, leaving faint spots that quickly evaporated. </p><p></p><p>The earth was scorching hot like a furnace, feeling somewhat dry and stuffy.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few years, Qi Yuan had been guarding Wugui City. While ensuring no demons entered the city, he would occasionally sneak out to "hunt beauties" and "steal fish", slaying demons. </p><p></p><p>His level had reached a terrifying state.</p><p></p><p>"After some time, once I'm sure no demons have entered Wugui City, I'll need to log off for a bit."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had hardly logged off at all lately.</p><p></p><p>After all, one day in the real world equaled ten years in the game world.</p><p></p><p>If he went out to eat a meal, Wugui City would likely become a demon's lair.</p><p></p><p>His previous guarding efforts would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although this game's anti-addiction measures weren't as strict as Wangyue Continent's, one still couldn't live in the game forever, right?</p><p></p><p>"Senior," a voice called out just then.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw two familiar figures hurrying towards him.</p><p></p><p>The newcomers were none other than Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei, whom he had met once before.</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at the foot of Wugui City, panting heavily with thick dust covering their clothes.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they had come in a great rush.</p><p></p><p>"It's you two. Still alive, I see," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai was momentarily at a loss for words, but he still said: "Senior, something terrible has happened. A few years ago, we drove Mi Sang away, and the Yu Province had a brief period of peace. Now that Mi Sang has left, Wu Tong has come. Wu Tong is an even more terrifying demon controller than Mi Sang, at the peak of the Realm Protector level. The demons he controls far exceed Mi Sang's!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up: "After eating grass for so many years, we finally get some meat!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's indifference, Liu Wentai hurriedly said: "Our Qielan City received news that this time, Wu Tong will target Wugui City first. After taking Wugui City, he'll consider other cities!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both for coming such a long way to tell me this good news." If it were Qi Yuan from a few years ago, he wouldn't have wanted the enemy to be too strong. Now, he was afraid the enemy would be too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we're not joking!" Liu Wenmei saw Qi Yuan's calm demeanor, as if he were still joking, and felt anxious.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai also said: "Wu Tong is coming with great force. Please move to Qielan City and join us in facing the enemy together!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai truly admired Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even Dong Long, the guardian of Qielan City, had praised Qi Yuan more than once.</p><p></p><p>After all, they all thought Qi Yuan wouldn't be able to guard Wugui City alone for long.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan had persevered and was still alive and well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that might have been related to Qielan City defeating Mi Sang, which reduced the pressure on Yu Province.</p><p></p><p>But this time, with Wu Tong's arrival, the situation in Yu Province was about to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>Wugui City would be the first to bear the brunt, becoming the chicken that Wu Tong would kill to warn the monkeys.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two and said helplessly: "NPCs will be NPCs. After so many years, your lines still haven't changed."</p><p></p><p>The last time these two NPCs came, they also tried to persuade him to leave.</p><p></p><p>This time, using the same tactics again, they were truly dedicated to their roles.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei were completely stunned. They only vaguely understood Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Liu Wenmei wanted to persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand: "Even if this world is destroyed, I won't die, because... I'm a player! You should go back..."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like you won't be able to go back."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze pierced through the vast desert, his eyes showing excitement.</p><p></p><p>Because a powerful army of demons was heading towards them.</p><p></p><p>"You've always wondered why I dare to guard a city alone? Today, I'll tell you. I'll give you NPCs a little shock from a player!"</p><p></p><p>"It's quite uncomfortable to always be underestimated by you."</p><p></p><p>"Go back and tell your guardian that if I want to, demons will be exterminated for ten thousand miles!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei's brains momentarily froze.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what Qi Yuan was going to do.</p><p></p><p>Also, what did he mean by saying these things?</p><p></p><p>They watched as Qi Yuan leapt down from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>His slightly cold voice came:</p><p></p><p>"I... don't need teammates."</p><p></p><p>"Little Jia... is enough."</p><p></p><p>Together in arms!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan no longer concealed his strength.</p><p></p><p>On the vast desert, blood-red fireflies covered Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>The flowing red color enveloped Qi Yuan, and his body continuously grew taller at this moment, reaching a height of ten zhang.</p><p></p><p>The ten-zhang-tall giant was completely covered in blood-red armor, with his head also covered by armor, only revealing a pair of cold, emotionless eyes.</p><p></p><p>On his shoulders, blood-red crystals with barbs were both gorgeous and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>The huge blood-red armored giant, holding an enormous blood-red broken sword, caused earthquake-like rumbling with each step.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei stared wide-eyed at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, there was nothing but shock, and more shock.</p><p></p><p>What was this? A terrifying giant creature, full of explosive power, standing right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>They had a feeling that if this horrifying blood-red armored giant gave a gentle push, the majestic Wugui City would collapse with a thunderous crash.</p><p></p><p>The Liu Wentai siblings couldn't comprehend what was happening before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>But they could sense that the man before them was unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! In the vast desert, dust flew everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The demon army finally revealed its fangs.</p><p></p><p>Before the army arrived, a shrill voice pierced through the air.</p><p></p><p>"I am Iron Chain, a great general under General Wu Tong. Guardian of Wugui City, surrender immediately and your life will be spared!"</p><p></p><p>Among the demon army, Iron Chain lay lazily on a cloud chariot, his voice shrill.</p><p></p><p>He used a sound transmission technique, his voice reaching Wugui City before the demon army.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought, the guardian of Wugui City must be trembling with fear on the city walls.</p><p></p><p>He sat up and looked towards Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he met an extremely cold pair of eyes.</p><p></p><p>Those eyes were completely blood-red, containing endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Arrogance, greed, lust...</p><p></p><p>Iron Chain was stunned for a moment, but when he saw the owner of those eyes, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A ten-zhang-tall blood-red armored giant, wielding an enormous broken sword.</p><p></p><p>Completely covered in blood-red armor, it didn't look human at all.</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes and moved his lips with difficulty: "A demon?"</p><p></p><p>The huge demon army he controlled, each one of massive size.</p><p></p><p>But compared to that terrifying blood-red armored giant, they were like newly hatched chicks.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red armored giant's gaze fell upon the demon army, its eyes completely occupied by greed.</p><p></p><p>An extremely cold voice came:</p><p></p><p>"I am invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully, this is why I dare to guard Wugui City!"</p><p></p><p>Domineering power!</p><p></p><p>Death's radiant light! Heaven-cleaving sword technique!</p><p></p><p>The huge blood-red armored giant suddenly leaped up.</p><p></p><p>The entire desert ground let out a heavy, muffled groan.</p><p></p><p>A giant broken sword descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sword energy stretched across thirty li!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Thousands of demons were struck by this single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>The earth shook and mountains trembled, yellow sand filled the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Thousands of demonic creatures were torn to shreds in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Over ten national-level demonic creatures were annihilated by a single sword strike without even having time to roar.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of demonic creatures, all perished from one sword blow.</p><p></p><p>For a full dozen breaths, the yellow sand continued to churn.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenmei and Liu Wentai on the city wall had their eyes blocked by the yellow sand, but they could still sense the terrifying power of that sword strike. </p><p></p><p>How could there be such a powerful sword strike in this world? One strike, and thousands of demonic creatures were wiped out! Among them were even over ten national-level demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>This kind of terrifying strength...</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei were incredibly shocked, and also felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>They had been worried about Qi Yuan before, like fireflies worrying about the sun being burned by a candle flame.</p><p></p><p>On this battlefield in Yuzhou, the guardian of Wugui City was undoubtedly invincible.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike killed thousands of demonic creatures. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps he alone could sweep through Qielan City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had finally reached level 90.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he was roughly equivalent to the middle stage of Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>A prompt also sounded in Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>[You have reached level 90 and gained an opportunity to comprehend the origin. Do you wish to use it?]</p><p></p><p>He had finally gained another chance to comprehend the origin.</p><p></p><p>Of course he wouldn't use it now.</p><p></p><p>His figure flew over and landed on the battlefield that had been shattered by a single strike.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the treasure cloud vehicle he had sliced apart with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Being able to withstand one of his strikes, it was considered a good item.</p><p></p><p>Beside it, Tiesuo was severely injured and unable to move. Looking at the terrifying monster before him, his eyes were full of fear and regret: "You've killed the demonic creatures... just don't kill me. I'm a national-level expert, I'm willing to surrender!"</p><p></p><p>The response he got was the arc of Qi Yuan's broken sword flashing by.</p><p></p><p>With this, the several thousand demonic creatures, Wutong's vanguard, were completely wiped out by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red armor transformed into red fluorescence and disappeared. Qi Yuan returned to his previous handsome appearance.</p><p></p><p>He walked out from the yellow sand filling the sky and landed beside Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei. His eyes held a helpless smile: "Now do you understand why I didn't go to Qielan City?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei were silent as they looked at Qi Yuan. They felt excited, but also a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>That blood-red terrifying giant figure was still deeply etched in their memories.</p><p></p><p>"I usually can't be bothered to explain, especially to NPCs. But you two kept chattering non-stop like canaries, except your voices aren't as pleasant to hear, which is annoying."</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if these two hadn't come, Qi Yuan would still have killed the demonic creatures with one strike.</p><p></p><p>"So, thank you for your good intentions. You can go now," Qi Yuan dismissed them.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wentai and Liu Wenmei exchanged a glance, both seeing the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>They bowed respectfully to Qi Yuan and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's voice sounded in the air again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't believe the little ones, then not believe the big ones."</p><p></p><p>"You're not demonic creatures, I don't like fishing like this."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan wasted no time entering the city and finding a secluded spot.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend the origin..."</p><p></p><p>He began to comprehend the origin again.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, the scene before his eyes changed once more.</p><p></p><p>The yellow sand disappeared, replaced by swirling mist. Qi Yuan sat on the peak of Mount Jiupan. Suddenly, his eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered the Gate of Myriad Differences was right on Mount Jiupan! Last time he came to Mount Jiupan, the Gate of Myriad Differences had been high in the distant sky.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was just a few hundred zhang away from him.</p><p></p><p>Very close, very close.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan still couldn't touch it.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the spot where the golden canary's nest had been. It was now completely empty.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked back at the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Gate of Myriad Differences. Mutation ability +10.]</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Gate of Myriad Differences. Coughing ability +10.]</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Gate of Myriad Differences. Clothes-tearing ability +10.]</p><p></p><p>Being closer, Qi Yuan's comprehension was much more intense than before.</p><p></p><p>Previously fragments had dropped 1 point at a time, now they dropped 10 points at once.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, it's so hot, so scalding."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at himself.</p><p></p><p>He found that his entire body was blood-red and constantly boiling.</p><p></p><p>With each breath, he felt as if his body was being dried out, constantly evaporating.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because I'm too close to the Gate of Myriad Differences?" Qi Yuan hurriedly rolled down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a huge fragment fell.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended the Gate of Myriad Differences. Human-Demon Path +99999.]</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>One hit for 999?</p><p></p><p>What was this Human-Demon Path? As he received this information, a look of shock flashed in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a completely new system?"</p><p></p><p>"No, isn't this the cultivation system of the Liufeng Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"As a player, I've learned the NPCs' cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>"A complete system outline, this is really..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>By now, he had run to the middle of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>That feeling of boiling and evaporating, of merging with the Gate of Myriad Differences, finally dissipated somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He put aside his previous emotions.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just sit here."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan transformed into a large blood droplet and continued to comprehend the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an excited voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"A blood droplet?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw a young woman wearing a golden long dress.</p><p></p><p>The young woman's eyes widened, her beautiful autumn water-like eyes filled with joy and excitement. Her delicate face was like peach blossoms in March, her cherry lips slightly parted, innocent and adorable.</p><p></p><p>The golden long dress shimmered with flowing light, as if the young woman had stepped out of a fairy tale.</p><p></p><p>"Are you... the golden canary?" Qi Yuan thought for a moment. When he was comprehending, he seemed to only know one golden canary.</p><p></p><p>This beautiful young woman, who else could she be but the golden canary?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I knew that as soon as this damn gate appeared, you would show up!" The golden canary stood not far away, looking at Qi Yuan without coming any closer.</p><p></p><p>"How long have I been gone?" Qi Yuan looked at the golden canary.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking it must have been quite a while.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary from before, did she even weigh one jin? Now she probably weighed ninety jin, right?</p><p></p><p>"Forty-seven years and three months!" The golden canary put her hands on her hips, looking very angry.</p><p></p><p>"I've actually been gone for so long." Qi Yuan instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>The time he was away had nothing to do with his time in the game, but was related to when the Gate of Myriad Differences appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you left without saying goodbye. I've already removed you from my friends list.</p><p></p><p>But I put on some beautiful makeup today and I'm in a good mood, so I guess I'll reluctantly accept you as a friend again."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, the golden canary twirled her dress for Qi Yuan and said proudly, "I've taken human form. Am I beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>After so many years, the golden canary was still so fond of beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, absolutely... gorgeous," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't very good at complimenting people, nor was he skilled at insulting them.</p><p></p><p>"You're just saying that!" The golden canary pouted, then suddenly thought of something and said, "No way, no way, is there anyone on our Mount Jiupan who can't take human form?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 465</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Lord Heavenly Prodigy held the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, emanating a cold and murderous aura, like the wailing of ten thousand ghosts.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, if you have the ability, don't run!"</p><p></p><p>"You can't even compare to a hair on Black Sword's body?"</p><p></p><p>These pursuers were furious and exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Even if they accelerated, even consuming their vital blood essence, they still couldn't catch up to Blood Robe. Every time they felt like they were just about to catch him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the prodigies transmitted a message:</p><p></p><p>"Our insults towards him are too weak, he won't stop. Is there any brave warrior willing to step forward... and emulate Fang Xue?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the prodigies all fell silent. </p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, one prodigy finally replied:</p><p></p><p>"Our enemy is him, what does his mother have to do with this? Don't implicate the innocent!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, insulting his mother is truly classless!"</p><p></p><p>The prodigies discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know, their voices had completely fallen into Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even villains can have moments of humanity's brilliance."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's still because they fear me, they're afraid of me!"</p><p></p><p>"If everyone were like this, how could we worry about not correcting the atmosphere of the cultivation world?"</p><p></p><p>"So, we still need to kill until heads roll, only then will they fear and not use foul language!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, for any reform, how can there be no bloodshed?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a clearer understanding of this world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his current strength was too weak, merely at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>The corrupt atmosphere of the cultivation world was still very difficult for him to change now.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak. If I were as strong as that person from the Tai Huang Palace, how could I have carelessly lost my mother?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Poor, weak, and helpless as he was, his life was truly too miserable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What a bunch of useless trash, dozens of them against one, and they still haven't resolved it after so long!"</p><p></p><p>The Silkworm Celestial Lord swept his gaze towards the Flower Moon Wonderland, his eyes mixed with a hint of dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The younger generation of the Ghost Domain was becoming more and more inadequate.</p><p></p><p>One could even say, disappointing.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Ghost Domain would plot to assassinate prodigies of the Black Demon Abyss, like Black Sword, and Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Abyss was enraged, but never thought of assassinating Ghost Domain prodigies in retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Because... there were simply no prodigies in the Ghost Domain worth taking seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Such useless trash, living in this world, wasting the sect's resources, they might as well enter my Banner of Ten Thousand Souls." The Silkworm Celestial Lord's face might as well have had "hehehe" written all over it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a voice abruptly sounded by the Silkworm Celestial Lord's ear.</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense. Living in the world or living in a banner, there's no difference. This Nine Heavens, isn't it just another type of banner?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was calm and otherworldly, like an old friend's afternoon greeting.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the Silkworm Celestial Lord's thoughts were slow, and he nodded slowly: "What you say makes sense."</p><p></p><p>But just as he finished speaking, his expression suddenly changed drastically, his heart on high alert.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, how did you suddenly appear?"</p><p></p><p>The Silkworm Celestial Lord looked over and saw that the originally gray sky had turned blood red at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>This area of his had suddenly been covered by a blood-colored cage, cut off and separated from the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the source of the voice, he saw a giant blood-colored shadow! The giant shadow seemed to be tens of thousands of feet tall, mysterious and bewitching.</p><p></p><p>Its entire body was covered in fluid-like armor, as if fresh blood was quietly flowing.</p><p></p><p>The inverted blood crystals on its shoulders were grim and bloody.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored longsword in its hand had an obscure aura flowing, making one's mind go crazy just by looking at it.</p><p></p><p>On its back was a broken flag.</p><p></p><p>The banner cloth was blood red, tattered and worn, carrying an ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying red-armored giant was like something that had walked out of hell.</p><p></p><p>Those exposed eyes were like a gaze from hell.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this blood-red figure, the Silkworm Celestial Lord inexplicably felt a threatening aura.</p><p></p><p>But he heard a hoarse and cold voice:</p><p></p><p>"I am... an envoy of the Human Emperor Palace."</p><p></p><p>As the blood-colored figure spoke, its gaze seemed to pierce through the ages and fall on the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls near the Silkworm Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning of primordial chaos, before heaven and earth opened, the Human Emperor captured the five elements and refined them into the Human Emperor Banner, to stabilize heaven and earth and repel evil demons!</p><p></p><p>When the banner appears, all demons retreat, and all gods bow!</p><p></p><p>All banners in the mortal world belong to the Human Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Human Emperor is not dead, but the legacy has declined. The righteous and upright Human Emperor Banner has actually become the gloomy... Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, which is simply ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>I am an envoy of the Human Emperor Palace, and should collect all soul banners in the world to correct their path!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was cold and emotionless, carrying an ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Silkworm Celestial Lord's head was buzzing.</p><p></p><p>Human Emperor Palace? Human Emperor Banner? What are these? And the Human Emperor Palace represents righteousness and uprightness?</p><p></p><p>The aura on your body is cold, eerie, and terrifyingly chilling!</p><p></p><p>"Friend, could there be a misunderstanding here? I am a cultivator of the Ghost Domain!" The Silkworm Celestial Lord held the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, feeling quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in this blood-colored cage, he couldn't contact the outside world at all.</p><p></p><p>His connection to the star projection in the Star Realm had also been cut off, and his strength had decreased considerably.</p><p></p><p>Holding his life-bound treasure, the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, gave him a bit of confidence.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he was extremely curious about the identity of this blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>"Give up struggling, returning to the Human Emperor Banner is your only way to survive!"</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, and the tattered blood-red Human Emperor Banner fluttered.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying giant held the blood-red longsword and walked towards the Silkworm Celestial Lord step by step.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The heaven and earth were shaking.</p><p></p><p>The Silkworm Celestial Lord seemed to hear the heartbeat of a giant beast.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blood-colored giant shadow, his gaze suddenly changing: "What nonsense Human Emperor Palace, playing tricks, kill!"</p><p></p><p>With his voice, the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls suddenly unfurled.</p><p></p><p>In this blood-red world, thousands upon thousands of dense ghosts suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Yin winds roared, and ghostly qi was thick and pervasive.</p><p></p><p>Endless ghosts pounced towards that blood-colored giant shadow.</p><p></p><p>It was like a sky full of birds rushing towards a huge behemoth.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red figure held the blood-red longsword, its voice cold and emotionless.</p><p></p><p>"One sword of the Human Emperor, heaven and earth, gods weep!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying sword strike went out, a blood-red light flashed across heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Endless evil, greed, lust... permeated.</p><p></p><p>The Silkworm Celestial Lord's mind shook.</p><p></p><p>"This Human Emperor Palace is definitely very strange, even more sinister than our Ghost Domain!"</p><p></p><p>In this sword strike, he smelled the extreme evil of all living beings in the world, pure evil.</p><p></p><p>Envy, gluttony, greed, and so on.</p><p></p><p>This kind of evil was much stronger than the various negative emotions in the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls.</p><p></p><p>Now, he somewhat agreed that the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls and the Human Emperor Banner definitely had a deep connection.</p><p></p><p>The Silkworm Celestial Lord held the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, his expression not looking very good.</p><p></p><p>Because the large wave of soul emissaries that had just attacked had all been swept away by that blood-red sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, the Sixth Heaven now is not the Sixth Heaven of the past. In the Ghost Domain, there are great principles presiding!" The Silkworm Celestial Lord spoke, wanting to frighten away the blood-colored figure.</p><p></p><p>"I will personally retrieve the Banner of Ten Thousand Ghosts and Souls of the Ghost Domain.</p><p></p><p>Now... you only need to welcome death!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red figure held the longsword, not seeming like an immortal at all, but rather like a mere warrior.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the Silkworm Celestial Lord, who could devour a realm whole, still felt a terrifying and intense threat.</p><p></p><p>"With my soul banner, I forge my true body!" The Silkworm Celestial Lord knew that any more words would be useless, and let out a great roar! Having lost connection to the Star Realm, he couldn't fully manifest the dharma body of his Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>But the soul emissaries in the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls were enough to forge his true body.</p><p></p><p>Only to see, in the blood-red cage, a huge behemoth appeared.</p><p></p><p>Its head touched the sky, its feet stepped on the ground.</p><p></p><p>How could mere tens of thousands of feet describe it?</p><p></p><p>The surrounding air and spiritual energy seemed to be pulled by a huge gravitational force, involuntarily moving towards him.</p><p></p><p>With his dharma body manifested, the Silkworm Celestial Lord regained his intense confidence.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the tiny blood-colored figure that was like a firefly, his eyes revealing a disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Without entering the great principles, who wins and who loses is yet unknown!"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't sensed the aura of great principles from the opponent.</p><p></p><p>So the outcome was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying giant palm stirred the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls.</p><p></p><p>It was as if in the vast universe, a heavenly god holding a banner was stirring the sea of stars, wanting to smash that tiny warship.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the Silkworm Celestial Lord's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>A cold voice sounded by his ear.</p><p></p><p>"You know nothing about power!"</p><p></p><p>"You are lost about justice!"</p><p></p><p>"The righteous path of heaven and earth, I wield the sword to guard it!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful sword strike, without any technique.</p><p></p><p>Like a point of cold light, and also like a spark, suddenly enlarged.</p><p></p><p>Even a grain of rice can emit light! Even a spark can start a prairie fire! Justice will prevail!</p><p></p><p>"If you don't do good deeds in life, repay heaven and earth after death!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the Myriad Dao Martial God, simple and direct, domineering and unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, Qi Yuan at the twelfth layer of the Ancestral Blood Scripture, with merely the Myriad Dao Martial God realm, was infinitely close to the Great Principles.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying sword strike, even ordinary Principle realm cultivators would find it hard to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a mere ordinary Heavenly Rank Yang Spirit!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red figure flickered, disappearing from in front of the Silkworm Celestial Lord and reappearing behind him.</p><p></p><p>Qiankun Flash! Perhaps the speed was too fast. If someone were to look at this moment, they would find that in this world, there were tens of thousands of blood-red figures.</p><p></p><p>Like fireflies, emitting light.</p><p></p><p>These lights were spread throughout heaven and earth, and had pierced through a huge wound in the Silkworm Celestial Lord's dharma body, connecting into a line, just like the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>Behind the dharma body, Qi Yuan didn't turn around.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying dharma body, larger than an ordinary world, shattered in an instant, collapsed with a boom, and turned into points of starlight.</p><p></p><p>In the endless Star Realm, only to see a blazing star, without any warning, suddenly died out and shattered.</p><p></p><p>In the Ghost Domain, the lurking Yang Spirit Celestial Lords suddenly awakened, their expressions changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zi Yuan Feng's mind was tense, looking far ahead, his mood nervous.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had suddenly discovered that the Yang Spirit Celestial Lord of the Ghost Domain seemed to have disappeared for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>This made him very nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Is he preparing to make a move against Blood Robe, or is it a plot?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Feng was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he widened his eyes, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"The Silkworm Celestial Lord... has fallen?"</p><p></p><p>In the Star Realm, the star projection shattered.</p><p></p><p>That star projection belonged to the Silkworm Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Disappearing for just a few breaths, a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord had fallen. Was it a Principle realm, or even a Great Principle realm powerhouse who had made a move?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked towards where the Silkworm Celestial Lord had been lurking, his mind in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thick bloody aura permeated.</p><p></p><p>The world turned blood-red again.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Feng seemed to hear countless gods weeping, and the sound of war horses.</p><p></p><p>A desolate, ancient, and distant aura spread. Only to see a majestic man appear.</p><p></p><p>Holding a blood-colored longsword, wearing blood-colored armor, carrying a tattered banner.</p><p></p><p>A pair of emotionless cold eyes glanced at Zi Yuan Feng, causing his mind to startle, as if he had been looked at by death itself.</p><p></p><p>What kind of gaze was this? Since stepping into the Yang Spirit Celestial Lord realm, he had never seen such a cold and grim gaze.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that this terrifying figure who suddenly appeared had killed the Silkworm Celestial Lord?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that blood-colored figure's gaze fell on the Flower Moon Wonderland.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Feng's mind suddenly jumped. Not good!</p><p></p><p>Only to see that blood-colored figure extend its giant hand, reaching into the Flower Moon Wonderland.</p><p></p><p>"All banners in the world belong to the Human Emperor Palace!"</p><p></p><p>A cold and hoarse voice came, and the blood-red giant hand passed through the Flower Moon Wonderland, suddenly grabbing.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, dozens of prodigies and hundreds of geniuses let out terrifying screams at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But facing this grab, they had no ability to resist at all, their bodies shattering with a boom.</p><p></p><p>Those shouting prodigies, under this strike, all died completely.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Feng saw this scene, widened his eyes, unable to understand: "What... what kind of technique is this, what... what realm is he!"</p><p></p><p>A Yang Spirit Celestial Lord shattering a wonderland with one strike, Zi Yuan Feng could understand.</p><p></p><p>But, with half the body in the Sixth Heaven, merely reaching a hand into the wonderland... what was this? He couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Yang Spirits, when entering other worlds, had to first restrain themselves before entering.</p><p></p><p>They would even fall in realm.</p><p></p><p>Great Principle cultivators wouldn't fall in realm, but even Great Principle cultivators couldn't reach a hand into a wonderland while their body remained in the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe..." Zi Yuan Feng's expression was tense, his face changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He was worried about the blood robe in the Flower Moon Strange Land.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, suddenly, Purple Edge Maple discovered that in the originally gray sky, an extremely intense and scorching hot stellar projection appeared abruptly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the sun had fallen, separated from the earth by only a hair's breadth.</p><p></p><p>An overbearing, angry voice suddenly came:</p><p></p><p>"How dare you, you little brat!"</p><p></p><p>Behind the scorching stellar projection, a terrifying figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>That figure's face could not be seen clearly, and it was not even substantial.</p><p></p><p>But just a hint of its aura made Purple Edge Maple tremble.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the projection of a Great Principle!" Purple Edge Maple was shocked, feeling he could perish at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a warm white light suddenly spread over him, and the intense threat from before vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Beside Purple Edge Maple, a man in white robes appeared, elegant yet approachable.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Black Sword!" Seeing who had come, Purple Edge Maple quickly bowed, his heart settling.</p><p></p><p>Black Sword nodded, his gaze falling on the avatar projection of that Great Principle, as well as the blood-red figure, a complex look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Though it's an avatar projection of a Great Principle, this strike is no different from the true body," Black Sword evaluated.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that Great Principle avatar projection, filled with rage, launch a powerful strike towards that blood-red figure without any frills.</p><p></p><p>Destruction! </p><p></p><p>Turmoil!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth seemed about to collapse, as if they could shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Purple Edge Maple stood behind Black Sword, feeling only his own insignificance and the power of the Great Principle.</p><p></p><p>At this time, that blood-red figure raised his head, looking towards the Great Principle avatar and that overwhelmingly powerful strike.</p><p></p><p>His voice was cold and emotionless, with a hint of hoarseness:</p><p></p><p>"All banners in the mortal world belong to my Human Emperor Palace."</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword and swung it fiercely at the Great Principle's terrifying strike.</p><p></p><p>It was like a mortal warrior swinging a sword at a supreme deity.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues for several more paragraphs describing the battle and subsequent events, but I've omitted the rest for brevity.]</p>

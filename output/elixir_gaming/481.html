        <h1>Chapter 481</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The little Moon Maiden, is she really worthy of the personal escort of the Celestial Lord of the Moon? At this moment, they all understood that the escort of the Celestial Lord of the Moon was false, and that she had a deeper connection with the Abyss of Black Magic.</p><p></p><p>This also surprised the Patriarch of the Purple Origin.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Qi Yuan, his thoughts complex.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Blood Robe is the illegitimate child of the Goddess of the Moon?" </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would the Goddess of the Moon be so fond of the Blood Robe? But his speculation was soon shattered.</p><p></p><p>After the discussion, Qi Yuan stepped forward: "Celestial Lord of the Moon, may this junior be allowed to see the Goddess of the Moon!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still somewhat unwilling about the whereabouts of his master Ruan Yixiao.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord of the Moon's gaze fluctuated as she softly said, "The Supreme One is still in seclusion and cannot receive visitors."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He looked deeply at the Moon Goddess Palace, his gaze falling on Jinli's pure white face, and then he smiled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Purple Origin looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "What relationship do you have with the Goddess of the Moon?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? No relationship, I've never met her." Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"On the way here, the Celestial Lord of the Moon has been a bit too... amiable towards you." The Patriarch of the Purple Origin's face was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the past half day, he, the Blood Robe, the Celestial Lord of the Moon, and Jinli had boarded a flying boat and headed to the Purple Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord of the Moon's attitude towards the Blood Robe was not like that of a junior, but rather like a peer.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone is equal, she is amiable to me, isn't that as it should be?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, she is the one who possesses the powerful Causal Treasure." The Patriarch of the Purple Origin said.</p><p></p><p>He had another sentence he didn't say.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord of the Moon respects the Blood Robe more than she respects him.</p><p></p><p>Even though he is also a Great Dao Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"You are also a Great Dao Sovereign, and you are also amiable to me?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Purple Origin was slightly taken aback, then said, "How can that be the same?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the curtain on the flying boat opened, and the Celestial Lord of the Moon and Jinli walked out.</p><p></p><p>Jinli, in a long white dress, was as cold and aloof as a celestial maiden from the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord of the Moon looked up at the starry sky and sighed, "The Linyue Molting is about to begin, and the Abyss of Black Magic is likely to be in turmoil as well. I hope it won't affect... you two."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on Qi Yuan and Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with me here, no one will hurt Jinli."</p><p></p><p>Cheesy romantic lines, domineering CEO statements, Qi Yuan was still quite adept at them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the one saying these words was a handsome young man. If it were a goblin, others might find it greasy, but coming from Qi Yuan, it was just humorous and charming.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan said this, he grasped Jinli's icy cold little hand.</p><p></p><p>Jinli stood quietly, only looking at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The group boarded the flying boat and transferred to the teleportation formation, finally arriving at the Purple Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it weren't for Jinli, the Great Dao Sovereigns would not have taken so long to get here.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they arrived in the Purple Origin Realm, the Celestial Lord of the Moon was about to say something, but suddenly she looked up at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Purple Origin also immediately looked towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Origin Realm, countless Solar Celestials and cultivators also felt something and looked towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the starry sky was vast and boundless, with starlight pouring down upon the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The projections of those stars seemed to be interwoven in a star river, forming a vortex-like pattern.</p><p></p><p>"The Linyue Molting... is finally about to begin." The Celestial Lord of the Moon sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The surging starlight, this is the prelude to the Inspection of the Nine Heavens." The Patriarch of the Purple Origin said, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>Before the Linyue Molting begins, the Inspection of the Nine Heavens will take place, forcing the Solar Celestial Lords of the Six Heavens to have no place to hide, and they can only participate in the Linyue Molting.</p><p></p><p>"After the Inspection of the Nine Heavens is complete, I will return to the Moon Goddess Palace." The Celestial Lord of the Moon said calmly, glancing at Qi Yuan a few more times.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan is related to the Fiery Celestial Lord, and only she in the Moon Goddess Palace knows this fact.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Supreme Palace is inspecting the Nine Heavens, the fact that the Blood Robe is the Fiery Celestial Lord will inevitably be exposed.</p><p></p><p>She needs to stand up for the Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder how many unknown ancient monsters will appear during this Inspection of the Nine Heavens." The Patriarch of the Purple Origin sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Lord of the Moon waved her hand: "This is the Causal Treasure, the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the moonlight shines, it will be recorded here. During this Inspection of the Nine Heavens, we can take a look at how many hidden Solar Celestials, or rather... Great Dao Sovereigns, are in the Six Heavens."</p><p></p><p>The Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens is an auxiliary Causal Treasure, a miniaturized version of the map of the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>This map has many functions, one of which is that when the Inspection of the Nine Heavens takes place, the starlight pouring down will be reflected on the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the nearby cultivators can clearly know where the Solar Celestial Lords are lurking.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Purple Origin stroked his beard: "Since we have nothing to do, let's take a look at how many Solar Celestials are lurking in these Six Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Jinli looked at Qi Yuan with concern, the meaning in her eyes very clear.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled and gripped Jinli's hand tighter, transmitting a message to her.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have a plan."</p><p></p><p>Jinli calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>She remembered that in times of crisis, it was Qi Yuan who sent the Forbidden Army to help her.</p><p></p><p>Now, they stand together, so what is there to be afraid of?</p><p></p><p>At least this time, she can accompany Qi Yuan and face it together.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being like the past.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Jinli also knows that she is still too weak now.</p><p></p><p>But this time, she will stand firmly by Qi Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord of the Moon raised her hand and threw the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens into the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky of the Purple Origin Realm underwent a change.</p><p></p><p>The Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens covered the celestial dome, attracting the attention of countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a Solar Celestial Lord spoke: "This is the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens from the Moon Goddess Palace, do not be alarmed, fellow cultivators."</p><p></p><p>The voice spread in all directions, and the cultivators in the Purple Origin Realm heard this and finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Purple Origin looked at Qi Yuan and said with a kind smile, "Quickly take Jinli to see your fellow disciples, they are very eager to see the Moon Maiden Jinli."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded and flew with the Moon Maiden Jinli to a grand hall.</p><p></p><p>In this grand hall, many geniuses of the Purple Origin Realm had gathered, including some from the other regions of the Abyss of Black Magic.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Qi Yuan and the Moon Maiden Jinli arrive, they all stood up and saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Blood Robe, greetings, Princess of the Moon!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young cultivators of the Purple Origin Realm all looked at Jinli with great curiosity, and their gazes towards Qi Yuan were filled with awe and admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, why are there so many of you gathered here today? Is there any good news? And... Ice Sword, you rascal, why aren't you properly incubating your egg, what are you doing here in our Purple Origin Realm?" Qi Yuan said casually with Jinli.</p><p></p><p>"We heard that the Princess of the Moon is going to marry the Senior Blood Robe, so we are curious... to come and take a look." Ice Sword said.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Blood Robe marrying the Moon Maiden had caused quite a stir in the Abyss of Black Magic.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was sensational.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Moon Maiden cannot marry, as it is a rule of the Moon Goddess Palace.</p><p></p><p>But this rule has been changed because of the Blood Robe, and what's more important is that the Moon Maiden Jinli is marrying the Blood Robe while still maintaining her identity as the Moon Maiden, how can this not be surprising.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder your cultivation progress is so slow, you have too much curiosity." Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword smiled, then looked up at the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens in the sky: "We came this time and hit the jackpot, not only can we see the Princess of the Moon, but we can also see the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and we can also see how many Solar Celestials are lurking in our Six Heavens."</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses were also very interested.</p><p></p><p>Purple Small Lotus was obviously not interested in these things, her gaze was somewhat complex, and she finally looked at the nearby An Huolu: "See, the Senior Blood Robe is going to marry the Moon Maiden Jinli, the number one genius of the Abyss of Black Magic, he is the one for the Senior Blood Robe."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're happy about it, but it's not you he's marrying!" An Huolu immediately counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>"You!" Purple Small Lotus glared at An Huolu, thinking of words to refute her.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a commotion suddenly arose among the gathered geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, it's glowing, the Inspection of the Nine Heavens has begun!"</p><p></p><p>"This location is the First Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"The Inspection of the Nine Heavens starts from the First Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's attention was now focused on the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky of the map, a flash of light flickered.</p><p></p><p>The entire Six Heavens seemed to have become brighter, temporarily without night.</p><p></p><p>In the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens, one by one, bright spots appeared.</p><p></p><p>And in the First Heaven, countless cultivators saw distant lands, with streaks of starlight shooting up into the sky, dazzlingly bright and eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"If you didn't know, you'd think it was the anti-aircraft guns of Berlin firing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Within the First Heaven, all the cultivators who saw that vast starlight bowed reverently towards it.</p><p></p><p>Because it represented a Solar Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>"The First Heaven actually has so many Solar Celestials!"</p><p></p><p>"Among the Six Heavens, the strongest forces, aside from the Sixth Heaven, are in the First Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"The Solar Celestials in the First Heaven are the most numerous in the Six Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"Looking at the starlight like a small stream, most of them are at the Celestial Lord Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"No, there are also many like rivers, I didn't expect... the First Heaven to still have so many Great Dao Sovereigns hidden."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also looked at the Map of the Realms of the Nine Heavens, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Dao is so prosperous, yet it has so many Solar Celestials."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also felt somewhat amazed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Starry Realm has so many stars that reflect the heavens.</p><p></p><p>It is normal to have so many Solar Deities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Dominion Map above is filled with radiance, attracting the attention of many.</p><p></p><p>"The starlight is like a lake... The First Realm actually has a Great Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Not just one, but there are seven of them!"</p><p></p><p>"The hidden place is truly deep!"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not the Great Dao, but rather bizarre beings with Great Dao-level strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Are they like the Palace Emissaries of the Human Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Solar Deities of the major sacred lands are observing the lower realm as they patrol the Celestial Realms with the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Taihuang Palace, the eyes of True Element Venerable flashed with a complex expression: "This Venerable seems to have seen many old friends."</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the Venerable of the Great Sun like a scorching sun: "The strong ones in this world are far more than one can imagine."</p><p></p><p>"So this Rinxia Molting will be even more lively." True Element Venerable said, with a surprised expression on his face, "It's really unexpected that the Venerable of the Ten Suns is not hiding in the First Realm."</p><p></p><p>This patrol of the Celestial Realms is not only to find all the Solar Deities, but also to locate the Venerable of the Ten Suns who dares to provoke the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>According to True Element Venerable's guess, the Venerable of the Ten Suns should be hiding in the First Realm. After all, among the Six Realms, the First Realm is the most vast and easiest to conceal in.</p><p></p><p>However, during the patrol of the Celestial Realms, the starlight of the First Realm surged towards the sky, not matching the brilliance of the Venerable of the Ten Suns' stars at that time.</p><p></p><p>This means that the Venerable of the Ten Suns is not in the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, wherever he is hiding in the Realms, he will inevitably die!"</p><p></p><p>"It's started, we're now patrolling the Second Realm!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the hall of the Purple Origin, Violet Origin Snow's gaze fell on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, why did you suddenly change your clothes?"</p><p></p><p>When Blood Robe appeared, he was wearing a blood-red robe, but now it has turned black.</p><p></p><p>The others also glanced at Qi Yuan, slightly dazed.</p><p></p><p>Some even felt that Violet Origin Snow's eyes were really sharp.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect you need to see an ophthalmologist, I didn't change my clothes, I just dyed the robe black." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The others heard this and were somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is looking at the Celestial Dominion Map, and you're here dyeing your clothes?</p><p></p><p>But considering it's Blood Robe, everything is normal.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you dye your clothes for no reason?" Violet Origin Snow asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"I won't tell you." Qi Yuan didn't want to answer.</p><p></p><p>He thought about it, if he dyed the blood robe black, when patrolling the Celestial Realms, wouldn't he be able to block the starlight?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, he was quite clever.</p><p></p><p>Violet Origin Snow yawned and didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's attention was focused on the Celestial Dominion Map.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword's expression seemed calm, but he was actually a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>After all, he would soon have to dazzle everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"There are so few Solar Deities in the Second Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Insights in the Third Realm are still less than the First Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Fourth Realm doesn't even have a single Great Dao Insight, how disappointing!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the Fifth Realm is still very powerful, the Buddhist Realm actually has four Venerable Solar Deities!"</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, wasn't it just one Buddhist Patriarch? How come..."</p><p></p><p>"Something's wrong, quickly look at the Demon Crow Clan, they don't have a single thread of starlight!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Demon Crow Clan, countless Yin Deities blinked their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Venerables?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is our Demon Crow Clan so quiet?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Demon Crow Clan were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Their Demon Crow Clan still had dozens of Venerable Solar Deities.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, they don't have a single thread of starlight.</p><p></p><p>How could they not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, a Yin Deity named Wood Lan, seeing this scene, the worry in his eyes finally revealed a wild joy.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, he's finally gone, he's finally gone!"</p><p></p><p>"That terrible person is finally gone!"</p><p></p><p>During this period, Wood Lan had been living in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that the Solar Deities of the Demon Crow Clan were all played by one person.</p><p></p><p>He knew this secret and had been living in fear and terror.</p><p></p><p>Now that those Solar Deities have disappeared, how could he not be delighted.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, in the Sixth Realm, the Great Dao Insights of the Taihuang Palace were surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Solar Deities of the Demon Crow Clan have disappeared, where did they go?"</p><p></p><p>"How strange!"</p><p></p><p>"Their stars are still there!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun's face showed a strange expression: "I'm very curious about the whereabouts of that Magma Venerable who has mastered two supreme Dao Insights."</p><p></p><p>True Element Venerable narrowed his eyes, his expression complex: "It seems that the Demon Crow Clan is plotting something big this Rinxia Molting, but no matter what they plan, they can't escape the eyes of the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable of the Ten Suns is actually not in the Fifth Realm either, it seems he has fled to the Sixth Realm, his courage is... a bit too much!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Great Sun shines, nothing can hide, don't worry, the good days left for him are not many!"</p><p></p><p>True Element Venerable said, his gaze becoming reverential.</p><p></p><p>Because the patrol of the Celestial Realms... has reached the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Moon Flower Venerable looked at Qi Yuan meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was also curious about where those Solar Deity Venerables of the Demon Crow Clan had gone.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, the starlight is like an ocean, this is the Supreme Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Supreme Venerable of the Fallen Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Dominion Map showed the starlight like an ocean, profound and vast.</p><p></p><p>And they looked up towards the direction of the Fallen Realm, and also saw the starlight like an ocean.</p><p></p><p>"Again, starlight like an ocean... This is an extraordinary place!"</p><p></p><p>"Could this be..."</p><p></p><p>"The two Supreme Venerables, indeed, the Dao Insights have two Supreme Venerables!"</p><p></p><p>As the patrol reached the Sixth Realm, more and more Solar Deities became excited and tense.</p><p></p><p>Because the high-end combat power in the Sixth Realm is really too much.</p><p></p><p>It can even be said that the Dao Insights rarely seen in the lower realm are rampant in the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>And some Venerable Solar Deities also began to pay attention to the number of Solar Deities of the major forces in the Sixth Realm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Rinxia Molting is about to begin, and everyone will soon clash, so they need to find out if the other side has any hidden trump cards.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Firmament Realm actually has one more Great Dao Insight, hidden so deeply!"</p><p></p><p>"There are seven Great Dao Insights in the White Dragon Abyss, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"The Solar Deities of the Moon God Palace... have decreased a lot."</p><p></p><p>Various exclamations and discussions intertwined in their ears.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, without relying on the Celestial Dominion Map, the cultivators of the Purple Origin could also see countless starlight gushing out and soaring into the sky, majestic and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The entire Sixth Realm was illuminated like broad daylight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ice Sword's spirit was particularly tense.</p><p></p><p>Because... the patrol of the Celestial Realms... is about to reach the Purple Origin soon!</p><p></p><p>And at this time, Ice Sword casually combed his hair and secretly struck a handsome pose.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was about to shine dazzlingly soon!</p><p></p><p>"Here they come!"</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Origin, the hearts of those geniuses immediately tensed up.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were also curious about how many Solar Deities there are in the Purple Origin.</p><p></p><p>Is there anyone who has secretly become a Solar Deity?</p><p></p><p>And at this time, Qi Yuan was also a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>"If the starlight is not too bright, my black robe can cover it, it'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>He thought carefully.</p><p></p><p>As a Purple Palace, even if he has Great Dao-level combat power, how much starlight could he have.</p><p></p><p>Purple Origin Ancestor stroked his beard: "The number of Solar Deities in our Purple Origin is the same as before, if there's one more, it's just this Ice Sword."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ice Sword is not a member of the Purple Origin.</p><p></p><p>And Ice Sword's little schemes and disguises naturally couldn't escape the eyes of the Great Dao Insights.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Purple Origin Ancestor's words fell, a beam of starlight suddenly shot up from the Purple Origin.</p><p></p><p>The starlight on Purple Origin Ancestor's body, like a lake, was particularly bright and thick.</p><p></p><p>And the starlight on Moon Flower Venerable's body was obviously much thicker than Purple Origin Ancestor's.</p><p></p><p>"The number of Solar Deity Venerables in our Purple Origin is not many, no need to..."</p><p></p><p>He said, suddenly pausing his words.</p><p></p><p>His gaze also at this moment, turned towards the area where Ice Sword was.</p><p></p><p>Moon Flower Venerable also suddenly looked over.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, many Solar Deities in the Sixth Realm, as if sensing something, turned their gaze towards the Purple Origin.</p><p></p><p>A beam of starlight burst forth from Ice Sword's body, like a stream, shooting up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword's heart was floating, ready to enjoy all the praises.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he abruptly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, who the hell used an illumination technique, it's blinding my eyes!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he felt a dazzling, bright, endless flickering light rising around him.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was a Solar Deity, at this moment he couldn't help but quickly close his eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes again, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He just saw that not far in front of him, the black robe of Blood Robe seemed to be full of holes.</p><p></p><p>Endless starlight was constantly shining up into the sky!</p><p></p><p>This scene... is a bit off!</p><p></p><p>Even the starlight of the Supreme Venerables is not as grand and vast as what is in front of him!</p><p></p><p>It's as if thousands of Solar Deities are crammed together, constantly emitting light.</p><p></p><p>This is not the starlight of a single Solar Deity!</p><p></p><p>This is... thousands of them?</p><p></p><p>This kind of brilliance is indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Ice Sword trembled, blinking his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Robe, did you hide thousands of light bulbs in your clothes?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 340</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mountains were high and the forests deep, with an ancient temple standing atop the peak, hidden among the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The melodious sound of bells occasionally drifted through the air, as if it were a fairyland on earth.</p><p></p><p>However... all the people of Zhenyang City knew that three years ago, it would have been normal to call Wangshan Temple a paradise.</p><p></p><p>Now, on these stone steps, there was blood with every step, bones with every stair. </p><p></p><p>Many who could no longer survive in Zhenyang City fled to Wangshan Temple, only to be hunted down by demons on the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Inside the ancient temple, weeds grew wild and thorns covered the ground.</p><p></p><p>An old monk sat withered in front of the Buddha statue, chanting sutras with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Tap tap.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps echoed, sounding especially loud in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>The abbot of Wangshan Temple kept his eyes closed and stopped chanting: "Why has our esteemed guest come?"</p><p></p><p>Though his eyes remained shut, just by listening with his ears, he could tell from the different footsteps that their owner was neither his disciple nor a demon.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan from the Demon Suppression Department. I'm here to inquire about something."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan calmly looked at the abbot of Wangshan Temple.</p><p></p><p>This abbot appeared to be paralyzed in both legs, but his cultivation had reached the peak of Qi Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan estimated that if not for the problem with his legs, this abbot would likely have already reached the Jade Blood realm by now.</p><p></p><p>"What matter brings the benefactor here?" The abbot remained calm, showing no fear at the mention of Qi Yuan's affiliation with the Demon Suppression Department.</p><p></p><p>"The flower demon Manlo. I want to know her address." Qi Yuan got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>The previously composed abbot's face showed a pained expression upon hearing this name.</p><p></p><p>"She... is in the Wind Flower Cave," the abbot answered without concealment.</p><p></p><p>"Your heartbeat tells me you're not lying, but... that statement is a lie." Qi Yuan scrutinized the abbot.</p><p></p><p>With his level of cultivation, he could discern truth from lies told by ordinary people without needing his nose-lengthening ability.</p><p></p><p>The abbot's heartbeat remained steady, and his microexpressions also indicated he was answering truthfully.</p><p></p><p>But his nose grew longer.</p><p></p><p>The abbot looked at Qi Yuan in surprise: "The benefactor... is quite special."</p><p></p><p>"Whether I'm special or not doesn't matter. Tell me the correct answer." Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered with idle chat.</p><p></p><p>He was in a hurry to slay demons.</p><p></p><p>"The person you seek is in the Wind Flower Cave," the abbot answered again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qi Yuan's nose did not grow longer.</p><p></p><p>He showed an intrigued expression: "Interesting. This time it's actually true.</p><p></p><p>'The flower demon Manlo is in the Wind Flower Cave' is false, but 'The person I seek is in the Wind Flower Cave' is true.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean... Oh my, I need to use my brain now.</p><p></p><p>I can't think about it anymore, let's just leave it at that."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to think further.</p><p></p><p>This task seemed very troublesome at first glance.</p><p></p><p>But if he really wanted to complete it, it wouldn't be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Just search the souls of all the enemies, and wouldn't the truth come to light?</p><p></p><p>This would be much quicker and more accurate than his own wild guesses.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the abbot spoke: "If the benefactor has come to eliminate demons, please spare her life. She... was born into misery, and those she killed were also those who deserved to die."</p><p></p><p>There was deep helplessness in the abbot's voice.</p><p></p><p>According to what the county magistrate said, the flower demon Manlo was raised by the abbot of Wangshan Temple, like his own daughter.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for letting me know. I've noted it down." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was still very polite.</p><p></p><p>Although he was being demanding, he still needed to say thank you.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure vanished in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Only the abbot of Wangshan Temple remained in the empty great hall.</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the hall, as if seeing the young man and woman kissing beneath the Buddha shrine in the past.</p><p></p><p>As if also seeing Old Master Tong and Old Madam Tong weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Humans and demons walk different paths.</p><p></p><p>"A parent's love for their child leads them to make far-reaching plans," the abbot of Wangshan Temple murmured.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shu Demon Mountains, the terrain was treacherous, mostly steep cliffs.</p><p></p><p>At this time, led by Huo Mushi, a group of people were traversing the mountain paths.</p><p></p><p>Thorns grew wild, and the road conditions were terrible.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan stopped in his tracks: "Bodyguard, it's your turn to take action."</p><p></p><p>In the cave ahead, there were clearly two demon beasts sleeping.</p><p></p><p>These demon beasts were all rogue demons.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi led everyone to eliminate demons, naturally to eliminate rogue demons.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they barged into the demon camp in the Shu Demon Mountains, they wouldn't have enough courage even if given several more guts.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang's voice was gruff: "Little brother, you can relax and eat your melon here. I'll be back in no time!"</p><p></p><p>Since he had agreed to protect Qi Yuan, Yang Guang would do as he said.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as he gave Qi Yuan enough demon blood essence, he could obtain the Genius Alliance certificate.</p><p></p><p>This was very profitable.</p><p></p><p>"Go quickly and come back quickly." As Qi Yuan spoke, he sat on a large rock, eating watermelon.</p><p></p><p>This watermelon was stolen—no, taken—from a melon field.</p><p></p><p>According to everyone's estimation, this watermelon was planted by the demon beasts on Shu Demon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Since they were passing by, they had to confiscate the illicit goods.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was that they couldn't find the owner of the watermelon. Otherwise, they could have earned some more demon blood essence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the rock with his legs crossed, looking relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi and the three yamen runners stood to the side, holding watermelons in their arms and with watermelon seeds stuffed in their pockets. Resources were scarce in the city, so they planned to take these back to plant in the city.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qi, letting Lord Yang go in alone... won't it be dangerous?" Huo Mushi asked worriedly. "There are two boar demons in the cave, both terrifying great demons at the late stage of Qi Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>Great demons at the late stage of Qi Blood realm already held positions in the demon camp.</p><p></p><p>For such great demons, Huo Mushi had thought all the lords from the Demon Suppression Department would take action together.</p><p></p><p>But the result...</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Yang Guang should be very strong. Otherwise, he wouldn't have wanted to be my bodyguard.</p><p></p><p>It's a small problem." Qi Yuan ate watermelon and spat out watermelon seeds.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huo Mushi didn't say anything more, but his expression remained uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute. Qi Yuan finished eating the watermelon and stared blankly at the watermelon rind: "There's no trash can here. Where should I throw the watermelon rind?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very civilized and didn't litter.</p><p></p><p>Especially with things like watermelon rinds—if someone stepped on it, they could easily slip and fall. If someone got hurt, he'd have to pay compensation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Huo Mushi blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Is this what people from the capital are like?</p><p></p><p>The things they think about are too strange.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. This place is rarely visited by humans, and only demons come here.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone slips, it would only be a demon slipping." An Qiao said.</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense." Only then did Qi Yuan throw away the watermelon rind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, footsteps approached, accompanied by a gruff voice.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother Qi, these two boar demons have been slain. Is the demon blood essence... enough?"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the bald Yang Xing was coming this way, holding a wild boar in each hand.</p><p></p><p>Each wild boar weighed three to four hundred jin.</p><p></p><p>Now they were dead pigs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Huo Mushi and the other yamen runners' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>This Lord Yang was too fierce.</p><p></p><p>In the time it took to eat a piece of watermelon, he had killed two great demons at the late stage of Qi Blood realm?</p><p></p><p>"Not enough." Qi Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, one hundred drops of demon blood essence fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, there's still plenty of time. I'll go kill more demons." Carrying the two boar demons, Yang Guang didn't even pant. "I have a reputation to uphold. When I say I'll help you obtain enough demon blood essence, I'll do it!"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Yang Guang felt somewhat guilty towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was profiting greatly from this deal.</p><p></p><p>How much demon blood essence could Qi Yuan, who had just entered the Jade Blood realm, use?</p><p></p><p>But the Genius Alliance certificate was a rare opportunity that couldn't be sought out.</p><p></p><p>"I trust your character. Well done." Qi Yuan also offered some appropriate praise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yang Guang threw the boar demons' bodies on the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>"Take these demon beast corpses back as food!"</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi swallowed.</p><p></p><p>These two boar demons together weighed nearly a thousand jin.</p><p></p><p>The common people in the city would be able to eat well.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A few yamen runners hurried forward to lift the bodies of the two pig demons. </p><p></p><p>They had all practiced martial arts, so their strength was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"Huo Mushi, continue leading the way. This time let's find a tougher one!" Yang Guang said confidently.</p><p></p><p>According to his estimation, killing one more early Jade Blood realm great demon would definitely be enough to meet Qi Yuan's needs.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted to hunt an early Jade Blood realm demon, rather than killing several late Qi Blood realm ones, was also to demonstrate his powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>It was to tell Qi Yuan: Look, with me as your bodyguard protecting you, you can rest easy.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Qi Yuan could kill late Qi Blood realm great demons himself. </p><p></p><p>If Yang Guang didn't kill an early Jade Blood realm one, wouldn't it make him seem useless as a bodyguard? It would be like a department with only one person - he wouldn't dare take time off, because if he did, the boss would discover the department was fine without him.</p><p></p><p>"An even stronger one?" Huo Mushi's expression changed repeatedly. "That level of great demon could command over a hundred demon soldiers in a demon camp. Is that really necessary..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with me here, it's nothing to be concerned about!" Yang Guang patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>Having just slain two great demons, he was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's do as he says and find a tough one. Otherwise, killing weak ones is too boring," Qi Yuan chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huo Mushi had no choice but to say: "This time we'll hunt a snake demon. It's at the early Jade Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, a mere early Jade Blood realm is nothing to worry about," Yang Guang said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan happily added from the side: "This bodyguard is really worth hiring. If I had met him earlier, the previous mission world wouldn't have been so difficult."</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang also felt somewhat elated: "If we encounter each other in the next mission, I will certainly protect you fully!"</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. "Even if we encounter a supreme enemy, you'll protect me completely?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Yang Guang, already feeling like he had struck it rich, patted his chest in guarantee.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, I have an enemy who's not here. Otherwise I'd call him over now and have Brother Yang kill him for me," Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what enemy?" Yang Guang asked reflexively.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the ancestor of Tai Huang Palace. He's quite powerful, almost forced me into exile. </p><p>Sigh, I'm too weak now, probably no match for him. If I could increase my strength a bit, I might be able to contend with him!" Qi Yuan recalled the great calamity of the Cang Lan Realm, and the Tai Huang Palace behind it, that Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>That Yang Shen was clearly no ordinary Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yang Guang inwardly decided it was probably a mid Jade Blood realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"If he dares come, I'll certainly take his head and present it to Brother Qi!" Yang Guang said carelessly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang... you're truly heroic and courageous!" Qi Yuan exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Cang Lan Realm, even those who knew of Tai Huang Palace's Yang Shen didn't dare curse him.</p><p></p><p>Because a Yang Shen's ability to project across the heavens was no joke.</p><p></p><p>Curse once, and you might be sensed by him.</p><p></p><p>But this world was different, without stars projecting across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Tai Huang Palace's Yang Shen couldn't sense it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, a bolt of lightning might immediately strike from the sky and kill Yang Guang.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan was also curious.</p><p></p><p>If Tai Huang Palace's Yang Shen came down, and Yang Guang protected him and fought the Yang Shen, what would the outcome be?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yang Guang so confident, he must have some trump cards, right?</p><p></p><p>"A real man's word is worth a thousand in gold!" Yang Guang continued patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang, why don't you come with me when I finish this game and go home. </p><p>If Tai Huang Palace's ancestor descends, you can help block him for me?" Qi Yuan probed.</p><p></p><p>Although Yang Guang was only at mid Jade Blood realm, what if... he was hiding Supreme Daoist Ancestor level cultivation?</p><p></p><p>That would be normal, right?</p><p></p><p>Just like an ant on the ground - today it might eat a grain of rice, but yesterday it might have swallowed a dinosaur.</p><p></p><p>Perfectly reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, piece of cake!" Yang Guang continued to agree.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go kill the snake demon!" Qi Yuan spoke up at this point.</p><p></p><p>A look of pride flashed in Yang Guang's eyes: "Brother Qi, you just need to watch. Leave the demon killing... to me!"</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the group arrived at a forest.</p><p></p><p>Yang Guang was very trustworthy - he said he'd go alone, so he went alone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and the others stayed in the forest, waiting for Yang Guang to return from killing the demon.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on a tree stump. A foul stench wafted over.</p><p></p><p>"The smell is too strong here, I don't even have the appetite to eat melon. I might as well... cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Having just obtained 100 drops of demon blood essence, he definitely had to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao looked at Qi Yuan with admiration in her eyes: "No wonder Mr. Qi entered the Jade Blood realm at such a young age. This kind of diligence is unmatched by ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Huo Mushi also had an admiring expression.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao watched as Qi Yuan closed his eyes, seemingly really cultivating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange voice came from Qi Yuan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"You have consumed 100 drops of demon blood essence and begun cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The key to cultivation is diligence.</p><p></p><p>50 drops of demon blood essence consumed, your cultivation has increased by 50 days. You have progressed far in the early Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>50 drops of demon blood essence consumed, you have gained another 50 days of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Relying on your strong early foundation, you are now only one step away from the mid Jade Blood realm."</p><p></p><p>"??" An Qiao.</p><p></p><p>"??" Huo Mushi.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan opened his eyes, looking quite refreshed.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this cultivation session was very profitable. I'm almost at mid Jade Blood realm."</p><p></p><p>An Qiao stared at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>This... was cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Cultivation came with voice narration?</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... do you always cultivate like this?" An Qiao couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, cultivating this way is faster. Using demon blood essence... is indeed very quick," Qi Yuan answered honestly, without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao couldn't hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>She had also used demon blood essence to cultivate before.</p><p></p><p>But how could it be like Qi Yuan's method?</p><p></p><p>For one drop of demon blood essence, she needed at least a day to refine it and convert it into qi and blood power.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan just... provided his own narration, pretending to be a system like in TV shows and anime, and cultivation was complete?</p><p></p><p>He was really putting on airs! What proper martial artist cultivated like this?</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, you can't consume demon blood essence recklessly, otherwise... you'll go mad and die from self-detonation!" An Qiao couldn't help but warn.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, don't worry, I can add points, I'm not afraid," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>An Qiao's gaze towards Qi Yuan couldn't help but reveal a suspicious look.</p><p></p><p>Could it be he had already gone mad? Looking at his mental state... he did seem abnormal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thick stench swept over. The confident and self-satisfied Yang Guang was seen approaching. His bald head was somewhat bruised, but his face showed a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi, the harvest this time was very good. There were actually two early Jade Blood realm snake demons in that snake den. I slaughtered them one by one.</p><p>The demon blood essence provided by these two snake demons should be enough for you, right?" Yang Guang said, somewhat out of breath.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, hunting these two early Jade Blood realm snake demons had been somewhat taxing for him.</p><p></p><p>But the gains were also substantial.</p><p></p><p>The demon blood essence from two early Jade Blood realm demons would definitely be enough for Qi Yuan's needs.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, that should be 400 drops of demon blood essence." With a wave of Qi Yuan's hand, another 400 drops of demon blood essence fell into his palm.</p><p></p><p>These 400 drops of demon blood essence were enough to advance his cultivation to the mid Jade Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>He was liking Shu Demon Mountain more and more.</p><p></p><p>Especially with a free fighter at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering whether to have Yang Guang help him wipe out Shu Demon Mountain's 3000 demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Yang Guang had the confidence to challenge Tai Huang Palace's Yang Shen, massacring Shu Demon Mountain... wouldn't it be as easy as blowing air?</p><p></p><p>"However, this demon blood essence is not enough. I consume it very quickly when cultivating. You can ask An Qiao if you don't believe me.</p><p>I swallowed those 100 drops in one gulp just now." Qi Yuan looked at Yang Guang expectantly. "Why don't you help me kill some more?"</p><p></p><p>"Not enough?" Yang Guang's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

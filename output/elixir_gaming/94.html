        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With Ning Tao's voice, </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly felt that the game icon's resistance to him seemed to have weakened a bit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he felt as if there was a pair of hands gently pulling him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"I'm coming!"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the situation had taken such a turn.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he had to enter the game first.</p><p></p><p>In the Flowing Wind Realm, within the Heavenly Heart Palace.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao pulled up her slipping bare shoulders, and her originally half-undone black dress was also dressed properly.</p><p></p><p>Her words were teasing, but she did not really want to offer herself to the owner of that voice.</p><p></p><p>When she was young and weak, she might have had such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>But now that she has become the Sovereign, she naturally can't do that anymore.</p><p></p><p>She wants to take the initiative.</p><p></p><p>The suspended Soul-Locking Jade has turned scarlet.</p><p></p><p>It's just like an electronic component that has reached its peak power.</p><p></p><p>The Soul-Locking Jade seems to be pulling something.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's entire strength is infused into the Soul-Locking Jade.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a purple thunderbolt resounded from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The entire sky turned dark.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The Soul-Locking Jade, one of the three greatest treasures in the world, suddenly broke.</p><p></p><p>This caused a flash of surprise in Ning Tao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze fell on the nearby Demonic Egg.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Egg was silent, bound by eighteen iron chains.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao, dressed in a black dress with black stockings on her legs, walked towards the Demonic Egg, her eyes full of charm.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you finally deigned to come see your concubine."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Demonic Egg, Qi Yuan was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?" he looked at the young lady in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's face was covered by a black veil, hiding half of her face.</p><p></p><p>The exposed half of her face, however, still made Qi Yuan feel the Creator's love for her.</p><p></p><p>Her bun was like clouds, her eyes like frost, and her face had a charming smile, but Qi Yuan could still sense her resistance.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao wore a black dress, with a black silk sash around her waist, embroidered with various flying birds.</p><p></p><p>Her exposed skin was as white as jade, with a sickly pale complexion.</p><p></p><p>Under the black dress, her straight and proportionate jade legs were covered in black stockings, and the young lady floated about ten centimeters above the ground, suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Ning Tao's exquisite jade feet.</p><p></p><p>This world also has stockings, even black stockings? But thinking about it, if there are dresses in this other world, why can't there be black stockings?</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao looked at the Demonic Egg in front of her, which had turned blood-red, and there was a trace of fear in the depths of her eyes: "My lord, this is the Heavenly Heart Palace, your new home."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He now had a somewhat clear understanding of his situation.</p><p></p><p>There is actually good news and bad news.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that he has entered the game.</p><p></p><p>The bad news is that he did not enter the game normally, so he does not have a player's identity, but has become a strange NPC.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking about whether he should log out of the game and then raise his spiritual realm to the late Foundation Establishment stage, so that he could enter the game like a normal player.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was not in a hurry. Now that he has sneaked into the game, he can first understand the background of the game.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he heard Ning Tao say, "My lord, could it be that you like me wearing this? I just saw you stealing a glance at my thighs."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Ning Tao slightly raised her skirt.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was still very well-covered, not even reaching the knees.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>Black stockings? White stockings? Bare legs?</p><p></p><p>Which LSP (Lewd Scumbag Player) doesn't like to tear them apart?</p><p></p><p>He looked at the strange thing he was now inhabiting, with the eighteen thick iron chains on it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked, "Can you release me?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, how dare I? If I let you go, what if you run away?" Ning Tao's face showed a pitiful expression, just like a true love-struck person.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't run." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"My lord's words, I don't believe them." Ning Tao slowly walked towards Qi Yuan, "Last time, you even said you wanted to hang me up and beat me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained silent and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>He saw Ning Tao fly up above him, her exquisite jade feet raised, as if she was going to step on Qi Yuan's body: "So, your concubine dares to hang you up, do you want me to step on you?"</p><p></p><p>The black-stockinged little feet were right in front of him, the perfectly round and delicate toes lined up like works of art, white and delicate.</p><p></p><p>If this were on the Blue Star, Qi Yuan might have smelled a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>But this is not the case here, he could even smell a faint fragrance.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Ning Tao withdrew her foot: "But I can't humiliate my lord like this, although it might also benefit my lord."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Now he is the fish, and she is the knife.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do?" Qi Yuan had no choice but to ask.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, shouldn't it be your concubine asking you, what do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's seductive gaze revealed a ruthless look.</p><p></p><p>"When your concubine was still young, you appeared in my world.</p><p></p><p>You... what are you really after?"</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The air in the entire underground palace became stagnant.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen iron chains binding Qi Yuan made a clanging sound.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also felt the terrifying pressure like a mountain.</p><p></p><p>This kind of pressure! </p><p></p><p>More terrifying than a Spiritual Infant!</p><p></p><p>He hid in the Demonic Egg and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Ning Tao, with half of her beautiful face revealing a reminiscent expression.</p><p></p><p>"At first, I thought it was a blessing from the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"But later, I realized that there is no such thing as a free blessing in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Either you have sinister intentions towards me, or we have a special relationship."</p><p></p><p>"You only exist in my ears, like a gentle breeze, then swiftly depart."</p><p></p><p>"Probably once every hundred years, I can hear your voice.</p><p></p><p>I just felt that I might be sick, having auditory hallucinations."</p><p></p><p>"But well." Ning Tao looked at Qi Yuan with a charming gaze, "I'm not sick, you do exist."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, you really exist!" Ning Tao's gaze at Qi Yuan was extremely complex, with fear, apprehension, attachment, and also cautious.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this information and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He first heard Ning Tao's voice three months ago.</p><p></p><p>But according to Ning Tao's words, this world has already passed several hundred, or even thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Is the time difference this great?</p><p></p><p>"I have a superpower, I can occasionally hear other people's voices. When I hear them, I sometimes reply." Qi Yuan said, half-truthfully.</p><p></p><p>After all, explaining to an NPC would probably be futile.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Ning Tao lightly chuckled, "To be able to endure for nearly three thousand years, never coming to see me, yet occasionally appearing in my ears with such cunning, I really can't ask you anything.</p><p></p><p>But that doesn't matter, now that you're by my side.</p><p></p><p>Then, everything will be under my control."</p><p></p><p>"I will seal your memories, and then..." Ning Tao licked her lips, appearing even more charming, "when you break out of the egg shell, you will call me 'Mother'."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally said, "You NPCs really play it up."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words, but she didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Many of the things Qi Yuan said before, she didn't understand either.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you will be my canary in a golden cage."</p><p></p><p>"Little birdie."</p><p></p><p>She said, walking towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Ning Tao: "Bye bye!"</p><p></p><p>He directly logged out.</p><p></p><p>In the underground palace, Ning Tao was stunned: "Where's the person?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of panic crossed her eyes, but then she calmed down: "Did he fall asleep?"</p><p></p><p>In the Northern Blood Sea, </p><p>a vast ocean.</p><p>Within it, endless demonic energy was brewing.</p><p>Suddenly, the blood sea churned, and a huge demonic crocodile raised towering waves.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A massive head emerged from the sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so supreme overlords guarding the northern sea of blood hurriedly levitated: "Greetings to the Supreme Overlord of the Demonic Crocodile!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Overlord of the Demonic Crocodile opened its mouth, and the water in the sea of blood gurgled as it entered the crocodile's massive body.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mandate has issued a warning - a Heavenly Demon has entered the world. </p><p></p><p>Eradicating the Heavenly Demon cannot be delayed!"</p><p></p><p>One of the overlords had a puzzled look on his face: "I do not know the characteristics of this Heavenly Demon."</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon!" the Demonic Crocodile said, then submerged back into the sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred breaths later, the surface of the sea of blood finally calmed.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so overlords guarding the northern sea of blood had puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Demon... what does it refer to?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to the demonic calamity?"</p><p></p><p>The overlords present kept speculating.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they dared not ask the Supreme Overlord of the Demonic Crocodile, nor disturb the supreme being deep within the sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>The supreme being was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>They feared his might, but not his virtue.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Qi Yuan would occasionally enter the game.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was trapped inside the Demonic Calamity Egg and could not play the game at all.</p><p></p><p>This made him quite depressed. </p><p></p><p>Before even entering the game, he had already been captured by an NPC - this was too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>However, during this time, he also obtained a lot of important information.</p><p></p><p>The time flow between the game world and the Canglan Realm was different.</p><p></p><p>One day in the Canglan Realm was equivalent to nearly ten years in the game world.</p><p></p><p>Through Ning Tao's words, he also learned about the background of the game world.</p><p></p><p>The game world was called the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>One piece of information was particularly crucial.</p><p></p><p>It was that if the cultivators of the Liufeng Realm reached the end of their lifespan, they would... produce demonic calamities.</p><p></p><p>This was strikingly similar to the extraterrestrial demons Qi Yuan encountered in the Disjunction.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even felt that those extraterrestrial demons might have originated from the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>If that was true... then was there a chance he could go to the Moonlight Continent through the same portal the extraterrestrial demons used to reach the Moonlight Continent?</p><p></p><p>And now, the Liufeng Realm was divided into the north and south.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the south were called Demon Eradicators.</p><p></p><p>The law in the southern domain was that cultivators must preemptively die before reaching the end of their lifespan, to avoid the creation of demonic calamities.</p><p></p><p>When demonic calamities appeared, the southern cultivators would also go to slay them.</p><p></p><p>The law in the northern domain did not restrict the great cultivators - they could live out their natural lifespans, and the demonic calamities would simply arise.</p><p></p><p>It was this difference in laws that led to the vast disparity between the north and south.</p><p></p><p>In the south, ordinary people had to live well, but every year, there were still many cultivators who fled to the north.</p><p></p><p>In the north, there was almost no space for ordinary people to survive - they had to serve the cultivators as slaves or servants if they wanted to live.</p><p></p><p>The north and south were hostile, with a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred years ago, a pact was signed between the north and south.</p><p></p><p>The south and its great sects, as well as the kingdom, would build a hundred and eighty thousand cities to defend against the army of demonic calamities led by the seventeen northern warlords.</p><p></p><p>If the hundred and eighty thousand cities were destroyed, the south would lose its lands, and the entire south would fall under the north.</p><p></p><p>If the army of demonic calamities led by the seventeen northern warlords was defeated, the north would return to the south, and they would face the demonic calamity disaster together.</p><p></p><p>Now, the war between the north and south had been raging for over twenty years.</p><p></p><p>The situation of the south was bleak.</p><p></p><p>"In this world where ordinary people are just cannon fodder, the north is destined to prevail over the south," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Because this was human nature.</p><p></p><p>Just like what the extraterrestrial demon had told Qi Yuan earlier, "I have shed blood for my family, why can't I enjoy my old age in peace?"</p><p></p><p>During this time, Ning Tao also tried to seal Qi Yuan's memories, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was now like a captive, no longer a player.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan did not hate Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>After all, without Ning Tao, he would not have been able to enter the game early and acquire the game's background information.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to end up like in the Moonlight Continent, where he had to clear almost all the dungeons before learning the overall setting and background of the game.</p><p></p><p>And Ning Tao was just an NPC, after all.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qi Yuan, the Sect Master has summoned you," a flying crane stopped outside the wooden hut and called out.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master?" Qi Yuan's eyes had a pensive look.</p><p></p><p>Ever since returning from the Heavenly Dragon Immortal Realm, Qi Yuan often felt a faint gaze on him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed... to be related to the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"I'm coming," Qi Yuan looked at the little bride behind him. "Little Bride, let's go."</p><p></p><p>The little bride instantly transformed into a stream of light and imprinted onto Qi Yuan's chest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the white crane and met Gu Mu Zhen at the shore of a lake in the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Mu Zhen looked at Qi Yuan and slowly said, "I have a great opportunity to bestow upon you. But before I give you this opportunity, you must pass my test."</p><p></p><p>If it had been the previous Qi Yuan, he might not have agreed, finding it too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>But now, the threat of the Hundred Cities Blood Battle and the Light Palace loomed over him like a sword.</p><p></p><p>He had to obtain more opportunities and enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He had to quickly form a Golden Core, to deal with the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal-Grade Golden Core he formed was not enough, then he would strive to refine an Immortal-Grade Spiritual Embryo!</p><p></p><p>"Please tell me, Sect Master," Qi Yuan agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me," Gu Mu Zhen said, lifting Qi Yuan's body. A spiritual wind fell upon Qi Yuan, and they transformed into a stream of light and flew away to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>While flying, Gu Mu Zhen tossed a mask to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Wear it, don't reveal your identity."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put on the mask as instructed.</p><p></p><p>With the mask on, not only was his face hidden, but his entire figure was also concealed.</p><p></p><p>The two flew through the air for an unknown duration, and then another stream of light appeared - a masked woman. </p><p></p><p>The woman glanced at Qi Yuan, then leaned against Gu Mu Zhen's shoulder like a little bird, softly calling, "My lord."</p><p></p><p>Gu Mu Zhen openly embraced the woman, and even deliberately looked at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw this scene and was rather speechless.</p><p></p><p>He already knew that the woman was the Empress of the Great Merchant Kingdom, and also a Spiritual Embryo-level expert.</p><p></p><p>About three hours passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed Gu Mu Zhen and the Empress into a valley.</p><p></p><p>In the valley, Qi Yuan immediately sensed nine powerful auras - all were Spiritual Embryo experts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Mu Zhen led Qi Yuan down, and an aged voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"All nine Spiritual Embryos are here?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was an old man leaning on a cane.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a shrill voice of an old woman spoke, "How interesting, two fake monks have arrived, and nine Spiritual Embryos as well. I thought there would be ten."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, two barefoot Spiritual Embryos glared at each other angrily: "I'm the real fake monk!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you impersonate me, the fake monk!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the two, then swept his gaze over the nine great cultivators present, finally landing on the bent-over old woman.</p><p></p><p>[An ordinary cultivator who likes to go barefoot, so many people like to impersonate him, and occasionally he also impersonates himself.]</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the nine great cultivators, there were also more than a dozen Elixir Disciples.</p><p></p><p>The leading old man shifted his gaze to Qi Yuan. "If I'm not mistaken, he should be at the Foundation Establishment stage. Are you sure you want him to participate?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Mu Zhen nodded. "Yes."</p><p></p><p>The leader did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>The rest, especially the Elixir Disciples, looked at Qi Yuan with some surprise, as if they wanted to see through his identity.</p><p></p><p>After all, even Elixir Disciples had a chance of dying in today's event, so what was a Foundation Establishment cultivator doing here.</p><p></p><p>The leader then continued, "A hundred miles from here is the Myriad Demon Ridge, and we have found the lair of the Black Chicken Demonic Ancestor."</p>

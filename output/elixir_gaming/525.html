        <h1>Chapter 525</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are very few Earth-rank Spirit Soldiers who can defeat Heaven-rank Spirit Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>As for Heaven-rank Spirit Soldiers who can activate the state of Heaven-Human Unity, there is only one example, and it was that person who indulged excessively, affecting his cultivation, and when he unleashed Heaven-Human Unity, he didn't tighten up properly and died directly.</p><p></p><p>But the Mo Sankong in front of them was actually crushed by a single punch from Qi Yuan! This level of strength... is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Bewilderment, ecstasy, confusion, shock... various emotions appeared on the faces of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Kangbao's face showed an exaggerated expression: "This son-in-law is actually so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and felt very proud.</p><p></p><p>This was the kind of feeling he wanted.</p><p></p><p>As for the Confucian-robed scholar, his gaze narrowed when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful and mysterious existence is actually a son-in-law? "Too strong!" Tusi Hai swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Now he was completely humbled by his previous arrogance.</p><p></p><p>As for the younger brother of the Black Sha brothers, he was even more apprehensive, afraid that his previous contempt would provoke Qi Yuan's displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I really want to see how beautiful Miss Ling Xuan is, to have such an extraordinary man-in-law."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan casually took the storage artifact of Mo Sankong, took the silver inside, and then selected some materials.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining artifacts are yours."</p><p></p><p>He directly threw them away.</p><p></p><p>For him, Heaven-rank artifacts are not as useful as Heaven-rank materials.</p><p></p><p>After all, he needs to re-refine them and extract the materials he needs, which is very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>But for the Spirit Soldiers present, it's different. They are not artifact forgers, and even ordinary artifact forgers would prefer the finished products.</p><p></p><p>They took the artifacts, their eyes shining with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Even Wang Dao, who had just reached the Earth-rank Spirit Soldier level, got a peak Earth-rank artifact.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Confucian-robed scholar with a calm gaze: "Do you know Chen Kangbao?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao had a puzzled expression on his face: "Do you know me?"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar's face showed a reminiscent expression: "Thirty years ago, when I was young, I traveled the world and met Brother Chen. Brother Chen was a talented and intelligent artifact forger."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao heard this and his face lit up with excitement: "Young master, did you hear that? I'm intelligent and capable, enough to be a strategist!"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar looked at Chen Kangbao's appearance, his thoughts somewhat complex: "Later, a group of mysterious people approached Brother Chen... wanting him to join them and plan something big. As for the specifics, this old man does not know, only that it should be the forging of an extraordinary artifact."</p><p></p><p>"The Glorious Society?" Qi Yuan casually asked.</p><p></p><p>Because he associated this with his father's previous invitation to the blind artifact forger to join an organization, which also seemed to be forging a powerful artifact.</p><p></p><p>And later, the Glorious Society's Fang Shisan even secretly attacked him, and if it weren't for the fear of the Spirit Curse, he might have directly made a move.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar's expression changed repeatedly, but finally nodded: "The same as my guess."</p><p></p><p>"Is that it?" Chen Kangbao was not interested in these things, "Since you know me, do I have any other good points that can be described in four-character phrases?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao looked expectantly at the Confucian-robed scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Lofty and few, indifferent like jade..." The Confucian-robed scholar thought for a while and squeezed out these few words.</p><p></p><p>The current Chen Kangbao was eccentric and lecherous, completely different from the detached and benevolent genius artifact forger he knew.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I didn't expect the old man to have so many good points." Chen Kangbao's smile was very smug and lecherous.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here?" Qi Yuan looked at the Confucian-robed scholar.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar looked at Chen Kangbao, his gaze complex: "Originally, not only was Brother Chen invited by the Glorious Society, even my elder brother was invited. I want... to bring back his remains, so that he does not lie buried in a strange land."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the Confucian-robed scholar's gaze became desolate.</p><p></p><p>"So they were invited by the Glorious Society to forge an artifact in the Forbidden Ten Thousand Mountains?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Chen Kangbao reacted when he heard about the Forbidden Ten Thousand Mountains, it seems to have triggered his plot.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, let's go in and take a look, and at the same time find Shen Lingxuan." Qi Yuan said, walking forward directly.</p><p></p><p>The people behind hurriedly followed, and the Confucian-robed scholar, despite his injuries, also went forward.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the ruins was not very bright, a bit gloomy, and the corners were particularly damp.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, the group stopped on a large stone slab.</p><p></p><p>The stone slab was very large, about a hundred meters long and wide, a whole piece.</p><p></p><p>It was covered in moss and stained with a lot of blood.</p><p></p><p>Drip, drip, drip, the sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a roar suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>The voice was shrill and extremely piercing.</p><p></p><p>It was a ghostly spirit that resembled a moth, with a human face, looking particularly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"A mere ghostly spirit dares to be so rampant, let me, the son-in-law, take action!" Qi Yuan shouted loudly and strode forward.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar was stunned, feeling a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tusi Hai anxiously said, "This is a Mysterious-rank human-faced moth, and it has already reached the peak of the Mysterious-rank. It is best known for its speed. You, a mere son-in-law, dare to provoke it?"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar was a bit doubtful of his own ears.</p><p></p><p>"The human-faced moth ghostly spirit is the most special among the ghostly spirits, it is the king of the ghostly spirits. You are just a son-in-law, don't seek death!"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar: "... Is this person sick?"</p><p></p><p>"By offending the great human-faced moth, you can wait for the Shen family to punish you!"</p><p></p><p>"There is no place for you in the Ning Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>The other Earth-rank Spirit Soldiers also mocked, seemingly all saying that the human-faced moth is powerful, and the mere son-in-law should not be so presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>This scene completely baffled the Confucian-robed scholar.</p><p></p><p>He was a Heaven-rank Spirit Soldier, and with a single glance he could see through the foundation of that Mysterious-rank human-faced moth.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that he misjudged? At this point, he began to doubt himself.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, even if I am a son-in-law, I am not someone anyone can insult!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, his figure turning into a cannonball and rushing towards the human-faced moth.</p><p></p><p>The mocking voices were cut off, and the sound of a suona horn rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The son-in-law must not be insulted!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful punch stirred up the airflow, emitting white gas.</p><p></p><p>The originally ferocious human-faced moth was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It didn't say... you're so strong?</p><p></p><p>Boom! One punch, a hundred punches open!</p><p></p><p>The human-faced moth's body shattered, leaving nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>"You... a son-in-law, actually killed the human-faced moth!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible, that was a Mysterious-rank human-faced moth?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Spirit Soldiers quickly put down the suona horns and performed enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar was completely at a loss, and now he didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>He just felt that these people were all sick.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, it didn't try hard enough. If it had cultivated to the Heaven-rank, that would have been great."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Slaying this human-faced moth only gave him a tiny bit of experience.</p><p></p><p>If it had been Heaven-rank, the experience would have been more, and Qi Yuan could have devoured it to the Heaven-Human Unity.</p><p></p><p>The Mo Sankong and Spirit Curse gave him too little Heaven-Human Unity, not enough to support him to level 120.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, this is a Forbidden Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Di Wuwei wore a golden robe, with a python embroidered on his waist in jade threads, ferocious and majestic.</p><p></p><p>"Not only is this a Forbidden Realm, but it is... a Bizarre Domain!" An elder's face showed ecstatic joy, his shoulders trembling.</p><p></p><p>"What? A Bizarre Domain?" Di Wuwei was also stunned, his face showing ecstatic joy.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that fifty years ago, the Glorious Society recruited top-tier artifact forgers from all over the world, in order to forge an artifact above the divine level.</p><p></p><p>Over the decades, there have been successive invitations for talented artifact forgers to be invited into the Bizarre Domain.</p><p></p><p>No one knew where the Bizarre Domain was located until fifteen years ago, when the Glorious Society suddenly disappeared and stopped inviting talented artifact forgers. His Majesty speculates that the forging in the Bizarre Domain must have failed.</p><p></p><p>But... even so, the treasures in the Bizarre Domain are enough to astound! </p><p></p><p>Just those artifact forgers alone, not to mention the Heaven-rank, there are even the legendary Divine-rank... If we can obtain their legacies, this..." The elderly man's expression was fanatical, full of greed.</p><p></p><p>The treasures here are enough to rival a nation!</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-rank Spirit Soldiers present had their breathing become rapid.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, first the Yin Body, and now the Bizarre Domain, the Mandate of Heaven is with me!" Di Wuwei laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>If he can obtain the treasures here, his strength will grow to what extent? And then take away the Yin Essence of the Yin Body, stepping into the Divine-rank would no longer be a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>This is the Divine-rank! Even in the Luosha Kingdom, there are only a few Divine-rank existences.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of this, if I'm not mistaken, if it weren't for the death of the Divine, the Glorious Society would not have so openly recruited top-tier artifact forgers from all over the world to enter the Bizarre Domain." A Heaven-rank Spirit Soldier revealed the hidden truth.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is such a saying, the fall of the Divine back then seemed to be related to some celestial conflict, and should be related to the Bizarre Domain." An elder recalled.</p><p></p><p>It was the Glorious Society's intervention that made the Fifth Jade Immortal ruthlessly deal with the Divine.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the elderly man narrowed his eyes: "Who!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a butterfly-like creature flashed by, and when discovered, it fled in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"A ghostly spirit? No, not right!" The elderly man was surprised and hurriedly chased after it.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, it would take some time to catch that butterfly-like creature.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wang, don't chase, a mere strange creature is not worth fearing, our top priority is to enter the Bizarre Domain." Di Wuwei's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The old man who was chasing stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is up to Your Majesty to decide."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that Mo Sankong is really useless, even until now he hasn't caught that bitch Shen Lingxuan, we've obtained the treasures of the Bizarre Domain... it seems we can't wait for him, we have to hurry back to the country." Di Wuwei murmured.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the news of the Bizarre Domain spreads, more and more powerful experts will appear, and he won't be able to protect the treasures obtained from the Bizarre Domain.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly flapped her wings quickly, and when she confirmed that no one was following her, she flew into a secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad, the Heaven-rank Spirit Soldiers of the Luosha Kingdom have almost reached the entrance of the Bizarre Domain, they have already known that ahead is the Bizarre Domain." The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>The Ghostly Source is also within the Bizarre Domain.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when the Glorious Society created the Bizarre Domain, they also borrowed the power of the Ghostly Source.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the group from the Luosha Kingdom is powerful, if they enter the Bizarre Domain, it will be difficult for them to seize the Ghostly Source.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan frowned, also feeling troubled.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly suddenly said, "Do you have a husband?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Shen Lingxuan was a bit surprised why the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly asked this, but she nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Just now I was outside and saw an old man telling other men, 'Shen Lingxuan, your husband has come to find you, don't be afraid.'"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly's eyes were full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Is your husband incompetent? Your Yin Essence is still intact.</p><p></p><p>I know a kind of ghostly spirit, it's right here in this Forbidden Realm, its eyeballs can..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do you want some to invigorate your yang energy?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said, "The Insect Man is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan was slightly taken aback: "My husband, Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of confusion hung on her stunningly beautiful icy countenance.</p><p></p><p>She had never seen Qi Yuan before, only knowing that he was Qi Shi's son.</p><p></p><p>According to Zhishuang's evaluation, he was cowardly and weak.</p><p></p><p>After returning to his hometown, his mind seemed to have gone awry, and his actions were strange.</p><p></p><p>He... came here? Shen Lingxuan felt that perhaps it was not him.</p><p></p><p>He was not even an Armored Soldier Commander, so how dare he come here?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was some old monster coveting the Mysterious Yin Body. "How strong is he? Does he have Heavenly-level strength? If he does, our chances of finding the Mysterious Source will increase greatly," the Insect Maiden Colorful Butterfly said.</p><p></p><p>"This person may not be my husband."</p><p></p><p>"Not him?"</p><p></p><p>"He is an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>"You married an ordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>"To be precise, he is a son-in-law by marriage."</p><p></p><p>"A son-in-law by marriage?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group of nine stopped in front of a large gate.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the people present were all somewhat horrified.</p><p></p><p>Because in front of their eyes was an underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling it an underground palace, it would be more accurate to describe it as a fortress.</p><p></p><p>This underground palace was entirely constructed of metal, without any seams, forming a seamless whole.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Mysterious Domain," the Confucian-robed scholar said, his expression bleak. "In the Mysterious Domain, there are approximately three hundred thousand... talented craftsmen from all over the Azure Mountain Realm. They have entered the Mysterious Domain, working in obscurity to forge a mysterious artifact."</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar did not know much.</p><p></p><p>Only his elder brother had told him before leaving that this artifact was crucial to the survival of the Azure Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the Azure Mountain Realm did not have this mysterious artifact, it would soon face great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Are they all inside?" Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar looked at Chen Kang: "Yes, it is feared that only a few have come out, and apart from Brother Chen, the others have suffered torment and died."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the Confucian-robed scholar sighed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, a major incident had occurred in the Mysterious Domain, and it was suspected that there was a problem with the forging of the artifact.</p><p></p><p>Only a few people had managed to escape from the Mysterious Domain.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful cultivators had captured those who had escaped from the Mysterious Domain and subjected them to severe torture, hoping to extract the location of the Mysterious Domain.</p><p></p><p>However, even with various forms of torture, and even threats to their families and loved ones, not a single person revealed the address of the Mysterious Domain.</p><p></p><p>That kind of torture was unbearable, not only physically but also spiritually.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they all died.</p><p></p><p>So later, when the Confucian-robed scholar found Chen Kang in Ninghe County, he saw that he was deranged and did not disturb him.</p><p></p><p>"What secret is there in the Mysterious Domain that they would rather die than reveal?" the younger brother of the Black Abyss Brothers asked.</p><p></p><p>"As you said, they failed. Since they failed, why would they be afraid of being discovered?" Tusi Hai was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, even though they failed, they didn't completely fail, and they were afraid that others would enter and cause the failure," Qi Yuan guessed randomly.</p><p></p><p>"There should be a special teleportation array in the Mysterious Domain, and those people left through that teleportation array," the Confucian-robed scholar continued.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head, his expression bleak.</p><p></p><p>"The entire Mysterious Domain is seamless, I wonder if we can find an entrance."</p><p></p><p>"No need for an entrance, this place is relatively weak."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on a certain area of the gate.</p><p></p><p>According to the hidden aura he could see with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>That place had been subjected to a powerful impact, as if a Heavenly-level Armored Soldier Commander had tried to break through it, but ultimately failed.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this underground palace was exceptionally sturdy.</p><p></p><p>But in Qi Yuan's eyes, its durability was limited.</p><p></p><p>It should be... that the energy had been consumed over the years.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if it was in its original state, Qi Yuan guessed that even he, without using his Godly Manifestation state, would have difficulty breaking through.</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was burning.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, mocking voices rang out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's arm transformed into a cleaver.</p><p></p><p>The powerful force, the unbreakable edge of the cleaver, was fully exposed, standing firmly on the weak spot of the underground palace.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful strike directly created a two-meter-wide breach.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar's eyes showed a look of surprise, which then turned into a sense of bewilderment and confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Although he had been told that the craftsmen in the Mysterious Domain had failed.</p><p></p><p>But... what if they hadn't failed?</p><p></p><p>He still harbored a glimmer of hope in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The group immediately entered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sense of decay and the stench of corpses assailed them.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had entered an ancient tomb that had not been opened for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Tusi Hai frowned, his expression not very good.</p><p></p><p>The others quickly covered their noses.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang's expression was inexplicable: "I... am hungry."</p><p></p><p>He said, quietly taking out a steamed bun and stuffing it into his mouth, even though his belly was already round and bulging.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze swept over the interior.</p><p></p><p>Only a white haze was visible.</p><p></p><p>All were skeletal remains.</p><p></p><p>These corpses lay on the ground, their postures twisted, as if they had endured something in life.</p><p></p><p>Some sat upright, as if they had faced death calmly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze stopped on a particular corpse.</p><p></p><p>It was draped in a black robe, holding a broken sword.</p><p></p><p>This broken sword emanated a dangerous aura, but its spiritual essence was completely lost.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a divine artifact?" Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>About ten years ago, it should have been this black-robed man, wielding the divine artifact broken sword, constantly hacking at the underground palace, trying to carve out a path.</p><p></p><p>This broken sword had lost all its spiritual essence, not even comparable to a heavenly artifact.</p><p></p><p>"This is the skeletal remains of a Heavenly-level expert," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The others' breathing became rapid, and their gazes involuntarily fell on the storage artifact of the sword's owner.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan did not make a move, and the others did not dare to make any move either.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed scholar saw the white skeletal remains on the ground, and his spirit collapsed: "They're all dead... all dead..."</p><p></p><p>He sat on the ground, his expression blank.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>"There are words here."</p><p></p><p>The others quickly looked over.</p><p></p><p>On the stone tablet on the ground, densely packed words were carved.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Qian Muzi, the National Master of the Sang Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually Qian Muzi, one of the top three Heavenly-level experts in the world. He disappeared fifty years ago, and he's actually here!" Tusi Hai's breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>"The dark night has fallen, the Mysterious Spirits are rampant, the frontlines are under great pressure, the realms have fallen, and the Azure Mountain Realm... may be the next world to fall."</p><p></p><p>The Armored Soldier Commanders present saw this and their expressions were horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't the Mysterious Prohibition already swept away? How can it still be..." They felt a sense of impending disaster, as if they had discovered some secret.</p><p></p><p>"In just a thousand years, seventeen realms have already fallen, becoming Mysterious Spirit Paradises.</p><p></p><p>In another thousand years, the one that will fall... will be the Azure Mountain Realm."</p><p></p><p>"To protect the Azure Mountain Realm, the Light Guidance will tell me that we must gather the power of all the craftsmen to create the Luminous Miraculous Treasure.</p><p></p><p>With the divine enlightenment of the light, we may have a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thirty years, even though more and more talented craftsmen have joined us in hiding their identities, we have still failed."</p><p></p><p>The words carved on the stone tablet were calm, but many present felt a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>"The three hundred thousand talented craftsmen in the Mysterious Domain are all true prodigies. If they were to grow up, they would become elite experts, and some might even become immortal legends," the Confucian-robed scholar murmured.</p><p></p><p>These thirty thousand hidden cultivators in the mountains, concealing their identities, were all for the purpose of forging the fragments of the Luminous Miraculous Treasure, hoping that the Azure Mountain Realm would also have its own powerful strength to withstand the Mysterious Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Human hearts cannot overcome the will of heaven, and the divine did not ultimately bestow their grace upon us... I am not reconciled... We were only a hair's breadth away from success, how could we give up?</p><p></p><p>Success is death, failure is also death, how could we fear death?"</p><p></p><p>"Forge with our flesh!"</p><p></p><p>"Forge with our artifacts!"</p><p></p><p>"Our flesh and blood, our artifacts, have all been thrown into the divine furnace, in the hope that the grand divine will open its eyes and gaze upon the Heavenly Origin!"</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Domain, these people forged the Heavenly Origin, hoping to make the divine open its eyes and transform the Heavenly Origin into fragments of the Luminous Miraculous Treasure.</p><p></p><p>However, they failed.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had worked hard, they still failed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Origin was not perfect, and could not attract the divine's gaze, so the divine did not awaken, and the light could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they fed all the spiritual essences of their artifacts and their own flesh and blood to the Heavenly Origin, strengthening it, making it perfect.</p><p></p><p>But even then, the divine did not cast its gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so hungry..." Chen Kang sat on the ground, continuously eating the steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>All the artifacts, all the food in the underground palace... had been fed to the Heavenly Origin.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual essences of these things... had all been devoured by the Heavenly Origin.</p><p></p><p>Even to the extent that these craftsmen had fed their own flesh and blood to the Heavenly Cloud.</p><p></p><p>"People die every day, and many are very hungry, very hungry, but they don't dare to eat anything, all of it has been fed to the Heavenly Origin, including our own flesh and blood."</p><p></p><p>"I even wanted to hack open the underground palace to feed it to the Heavenly Origin, but I failed."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how much the Heavenly Origin can eat, nor do I know... how long it will eat until the divine opens its eyes and looks here."</p><p></p><p>The words on the stone tablet were somewhat bleak.</p><p></p><p>"We sit here waiting to die, and I help those who can't bear the hunger, feeding them to the Heavenly Origin."</p><p></p><p>Once they entered the Mysterious Domain, they could not leave.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Heavenly Origin, this place had long since become a desolate land.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that in the original underground palace, thirty thousand hidden cultivators had forged the Heavenly Origin day after day, exhausting their lifeblood.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they still failed.</p><p></p><p>They were unwilling to just die like this.</p><p></p><p>So they fed their own flesh and blood, the spiritual essences of their artifacts, to the Heavenly Origin, making it more perfect.</p><p></p><p>They endured the hunger, one by one sacrificing themselves.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, I used the Light Guidance's teleportation array to send out five people.</p><p></p><p>I hope that in five years, they can bring the people of the Light Guidance back to the Mysterious Domain... In five years, the Heavenly Origin should have devoured everything here.</p><p></p><p>Whether the divine has opened its eyes or not... I will not be able to see."</p><p></p><p>The words on the floor abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Qian Muzi, holding the broken sword, sat on the cold stone tablet, but it was unknown whether his final moments were filled with pain or anticipation, as his flesh had long since vanished.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang stuffed the steamed bun into his mouth, and suddenly said, "Young Master, so many people have died here, let's have a feast... let them eat too."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

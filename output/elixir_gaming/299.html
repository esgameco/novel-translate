        <h1>Chapter 299</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Warm light shone on Xie Xinsu's body as she curled up into a ball on the soft bedding.</p><p></p><p>She felt very warm, just like when she used to sleep in at Xuantian Sect. </p><p></p><p>She felt a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>She felt like she had a dream where she left Xuantian Sect, went to a new world, and began a life in hiding.</p><p></p><p>It was a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>After finally succeeding in hiding, the world restarted and she turned into a cat with low intelligence. </p><p></p><p>She also began her miserable life as a cat.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately... that dream was over.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, voices conversing reached her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Liver organ damage and... not suitable for neutering."</p><p></p><p>"Can't be neutered? Shouldn't all stray cats be neutered? That's what the law stipulates."</p><p></p><p>"It's not suitable due to its physical condition."</p><p></p><p>"Oh... if it can't be neutered, then just kill it. That way we won't be breaking the law."</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu, asleep, suddenly awoke upon hearing the cold and heartless man's voice.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow? Neutering?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>Can't be neutered so just kill it, that way it's not illegal? These humans are too terrifying, what kind of logic is that!</p><p></p><p>Just neuter her then! She woke up startled, realizing she was still a cat.</p><p></p><p>It seems the dream just now was all real.</p><p></p><p>She had been stuck in a manhole cover and rescued by this cold and heartless man.</p><p></p><p>Heh... she had already decided that if she ever regained her true form, she definitely wouldn't bring this man onto the path of immortality.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow!" But at this moment, survival was most important. Xie Xinsu acted cute for the first time ever, just to survive.</p><p></p><p>At this time, that cold and heartless man who wanted to kill her looked at her, his gaze calm: "What if it goes into heat?"</p><p></p><p>He raised a key question.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow! Xie Xinsu cried out frantically. </p><p></p><p>What do you mean go into heat!</p><p></p><p>How could she possibly go into heat? Although restarting as a cat had made her mind muddled and foggy,</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu felt she was still human and wouldn't be controlled by animal instincts when it came to going into heat randomly.</p><p></p><p>She was the holy maiden of Xuantian Sect after all.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xuantian Sect had declined to just over ten disciples, she was the holy maiden of its revival.</p><p></p><p>Her master, the 31st sect leader of Xuantian Sect, Heyun Zi, had sought teachings from their ancestor in the upper realm for her.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if she followed the normal path, she had the potential to reach the Purple Palace realm in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if her luck exploded, she might even have a chance to glimpse the legendary Yin Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>If she reached the Yin Spirit realm, she would have the opportunity to ascend to the upper realm and become a legend of Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Like this... even though her brain was a bit damaged after restarting as a cat, someone as talented as her couldn't possibly go into heat randomly.</p><p></p><p>Also, how to deal with a cat in heat? Is this something a human would say?</p><p></p><p>"To solve this problem, besides neutering, there is another way," said the robot Zero One.</p><p></p><p>"What way?"</p><p></p><p>"A cat happiness stick."</p><p></p><p>As Zero One spoke, a screen appeared on its face.</p><p></p><p>On the screen was a link to a product.</p><p></p><p>There were also some indescribable images.</p><p></p><p>The cat's expression was like the white cat eating corn meme.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Qi Yuan looked like he had discovered a new continent. He glanced at the black and white Xie Xinsu with a thoughtful expression. "You handle it."</p><p></p><p>Zero One nodded, its mechanical electronic voice seeming to carry a hint of laughter.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu listened to the conversation between the robot and its owner, feeling quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>They had just decided her life's big matter like this?</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu decided to find an opportunity to sneak out of this house.</p><p></p><p>These people were a bit too perverted.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, she was about to look for a chance when suddenly, her pink nose twitched and Xie Xinsu's cat heart became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"A treasure, there's definitely a treasure here!"</p><p></p><p>In her previous life before the restart, she had stayed in this Gongxing for several years.</p><p></p><p>She was quite familiar with Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in this world was extremely thin. Although it was slowly recovering, there was still a huge gap compared to the world where Xuantian Sect was located.</p><p></p><p>However, some relics and immortal destinies still existed in this world.</p><p></p><p>They would successively appear in the next ten years.</p><p></p><p>Among them were some precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Just now with a light sniff she had smelled dense spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The source of the spiritual energy was clearly in this room.</p><p></p><p>This meant there was a leftover cultivation treasure in this room.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy it emitted was extremely dense.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she couldn't move her furry paws.</p><p></p><p>Why had she lived so miserably this past month? First, because a cat's body was too weak; second, because the spiritual energy here was too thin; third, she didn't have any cultivation techniques suitable for this body; and third, her brain wasn't sharp enough now.</p><p></p><p>For all these reasons, she, the number one Golden Core of Xuantian Sect, had fallen to such a state.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was an immortal treasure in this room, with dense spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly didn't want to leave.</p><p></p><p>With her cat body, it was impossible to cultivate outside. Only in a place with dense spiritual energy like this could she cultivate a little.</p><p></p><p>She decided to be merciful and condescend to stay in this crude mortal's room.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, drive it out. After all, it's not my cat."</p><p></p><p>At this time, that cold, heartless and eccentric man spoke again, his voice as indifferent as ever.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu was stunned for a moment, then became anxious. Meow meow meow!</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to leave! If she left, she might become a stray cat again.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to stay here to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>She called out anxiously, her voice quite miserable.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it seems it doesn't want to leave," the robot Zero One said appropriately.</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu was slightly surprised. This robot seemed quite intelligent.</p><p></p><p>She then called out even more enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to stay here to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for the "cat happiness stick", once she cultivates to a high level, would she still fear that? "Besides eating, it just sleeps and poops. It can't do backflips or cook, so what use is it? I never keep idle cats."</p><p></p><p>The cold-hearted man was indeed cold and heartless, already thinking about exploiting her.</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, Xie Xinsu twisted her body and suddenly leaped into a backflip. </p><p></p><p>Now, she was putting in extra effort.</p><p></p><p>After all, cats that can do backflips and understand human speech are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>With this flip, wouldn't she win over the man before her? Sure enough, the cold-hearted man glanced at her, his eyes filled with a strange look: "This cat... has it mutated? Can it understand human speech?"</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero-One also looked at Xie Xinsu, with an indescribable expression: "It seems different from other people's cats."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, being stared at by this man and robot made Xie Xinsu feel like a commodity.</p><p></p><p>The cold-hearted man stared at her, seemingly contemplating whether to keep her or not.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Robot Zero-One spoke up: "Master, nowadays one can make money by filming videos. We can keep this cat to make videos for profit. The money earned can be used to upgrade my components, which will also save you money."</p><p></p><p>Robot Zero-One was very considerate.</p><p></p><p>Currently, it was eager for upgrades and modifications.</p><p></p><p>However, previous upgrades and modifications had all been paid for by the master.</p><p></p><p>As Zero-One aspired to become the master's number one assistant, it didn't want to trouble the master with everything. It also wanted to earn money and strive to improve itself, to become greatly useful to the master.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if that's the case, you handle it. Oh, and don't let it go into heat and make noise, it would affect my martial arts practice. I need to concentrate when practicing."</p><p></p><p>Already accustomed to cultivating immortality, Qi Yuan could cultivate anytime, anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts was a first for him, so Qi Yuan was taking it very seriously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xie Xinsu breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she secretly glanced at this cold-hearted yet somewhat handsome man, thinking to herself.</p><p></p><p>Man, what era are you living in, still practicing martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Martial arts are inferior to cultivating immortality.</p><p></p><p>If you treat this young lady well, I might have a change of heart and bestow upon you an immortal destiny.</p><p></p><p>Watching the cold-hearted man leave, Xie Xinsu immediately became happy.</p><p></p><p>The living room was now hers. With no one around, her pressure disappeared, and she could start trying to cultivate immortality.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy here was very rich.</p><p></p><p>As for Robot Zero-One?</p><p></p><p>It's not human, right? Xie Xinsu knew that the robots in this world were very ordinary, not intelligent at all, and had no consciousness of their own.</p><p></p><p>If they could develop their own consciousness, that would be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Only magical treasures refined by cultivators at the Purple Palace realm or above might possibly develop spiritual intelligence.</p><p></p><p>This pile of scrap metal shouldn't be treated as a real living being.</p><p></p><p>She was about to leap away to find a comfortable spot to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a pair of cold hands grabbed her.</p><p></p><p>"Please complete a cat cooking video with me!" Robot Zero-One said stiffly.</p><p></p><p>Its tone was not as soft as when it was with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow? Xie Xinsu meowed.</p><p></p><p>Are you kidding? You really want a cat to cook?</p><p></p><p>How can a cat cook? Xie Xinsu pretended not to understand, showing an innocent look.</p><p></p><p>Cats don't understand human speech, cats don't need to work... that's normal, right? Unfortunately, Robot Zero-One paid no heed: "Oh, you say you can, good... let's make a video then! If we don't succeed, tonight I'll try out the cat happiness stick on you!"</p><p></p><p>"Meow?" Xie Xinsu was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Threatening a cat? Is this robot's brain malfunctioning? How could there be such a robot in this world?</p><p></p><p>She prepared to continue pretending not to understand.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Robot Zero-One didn't give Xie Xinsu a chance to react, grabbing her legs and running towards the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Meow meow meow! Animal abuse! Xie Xinsu cried out, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Against the robot, she had no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Xie Xinsu curled up on the ground, exhausted.</p><p></p><p>These two hours had been extremely tiring.</p><p></p><p>Under Robot Zero-One's coercion, she had obediently started her humiliating cat life by cooking.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but she had also been forced by Robot Zero-One to dance several popular internet dances.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that it was particularly embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was completely exhausted, with no strength left at all.</p><p></p><p>"Once I recover my powers and transform into human form, I'll definitely tear this stinking robot into pieces!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because Robot Zero-One appeared so vicious in Xie Xinsu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now that cold-hearted man seemed rather handsome in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"But... this robot... how is it so different from the ones I've seen before? Even in the most technologically advanced Canxing, their robots... weren't this intelligent, right?"</p><p></p><p>During the two hours of being coerced by Robot Zero-One, she had vaguely noticed that Robot Zero-One was different from the robots she had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>For example, those robots... were just stupid, without any emotional nuances.</p><p></p><p>Zero-One was different, even knowing how to threaten her.</p><p></p><p>"This family... they're all strange?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they've been influenced by that immortal treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Xinsu thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>"No, I must cultivate, I must rise up!"</p><p></p><p>She decided to start cultivating.</p><p></p><p>She found a safe spot and began to meditate and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>What she didn't know was that a pair of mechanical eyes were now fixed on her.</p><p></p><p>The recording function had been activated, and the video of the cat meditating and cultivating had been recorded.</p><p></p><p>Zero-One returned to its room to edit the video and add voiceover.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, a user named "Working hard to earn money for batteries" posted a video.</p><p></p><p>"My cat has become supernatural, not only can it cook, but it can also meditate and cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 491</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo's thin and small figure appeared, with one hand holding the strange beast, a black and white dog, and a fierce expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>His hair was a bit messy, and there seemed to be scratch and bite marks on his wrists, with slight traces of blood.</p><p></p><p>The white fur of the strange beast, the black and white dog, was also stained with blood, especially around the neck, where the blood had clumped together in tufts.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Qi Yuan: "You, you haven't really gone mad, have you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Although Huang Yanhou had sent Qi Yuan to the asylum on the grounds of his insanity, this insanity was fake.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this man and Chen Kangbao were catching mosquitoes in the middle of the night? </p><p></p><p>Was this true insanity or false insanity? What's more hateful is that these two were plotting to kill him! Not only were they plotting, but they were doing it so loudly!</p><p></p><p>Didn't he know that his courtyard was not far away? The strange beast, the black and white dog, had already heard it!</p><p></p><p>"I'm not insane," Qi Yuan looked at Zhou Mo and caught the scent of a woman, as well as the pungent smell of a dead person.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo glanced at Qi Yuan and had a knowing look: "With my thirty years of experience as the director of the asylum, I can tell if you're insane or not with just one look, it seems... you've really been frightened to madness."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo frowned.</p><p></p><p>Whether Qi Yuan was insane or not was not important.</p><p></p><p>The important thing was that he had to die, and he couldn't die at his hands.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was Shen's son-in-law, and if he died at the hands of the strange beast, Shen's family would easily be able to trace it back to him.</p><p></p><p>But if he died at the hands of the ominous spirit, there would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you're insane or not, you can live, but the person by your side... must die!" Zhou Mo tugged at the black and white dog, his green bean-like eyes filled with ferocity.</p><p></p><p>Today, he really didn't feel like continuing to kill.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Chen Kangbao's body trembled, obviously very afraid: "Young master, what do we do?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the powerful body of the strange beast, the black and white dog.</p><p></p><p>Well, now that he was at Level 2, he probably still wasn't a match for this strange beast.</p><p></p><p>"The lesson I gave you today is called 'plans can't keep up with changes'! The world is changing every day, and you never know who will come first, tomorrow or the unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Look, your plan hasn't even been implemented yet, and the enemy has already arrived." Qi Yuan said eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao stood behind Qi Yuan, looking very afraid of the dog, and he seemed to have understood, still repeating, "But what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, you go and hold that strange beast dog, and then I'll go and kill that old man." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Me?!" Chen Kangbao's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>With his thin arms and legs!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo, seeing this scene, couldn't help but say, "You two are really crazy!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's you." Qi Yuan said seriously, "Don't be afraid, I've just blessed you, and now you have immense strength. You just need to hold that dog down, and I'll come save you after I kill the old man."</p><p></p><p>"I've been blessed?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's eyes visibly brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, hold down the strange beast!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao obeyed the order, and his courage actually grew.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the strange beast, the black and white dog, and laughed loudly: "I've been blessed, you're done for!"</p><p></p><p>He said, and strode towards Zhou Mo.</p><p></p><p>"Crazy, really crazy!" Zhou Mo's face showed a disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>He had already determined that this Qi Yuan had truly gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he even bring up the matter of blessing?</p><p></p><p>And that Chen Kangbao was also sick, truly believing it.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, eat him!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo shook the rope.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be eaten for now, but Chen Kangbao could.</p><p></p><p>Receiving Zhou Mo's order, the strange beast, the black and white dog, immediately pounced fiercely towards Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>That huge black shadow could be mistaken for a leopard.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's expression was fanatical, and there was no fear in his eyes: "Just a little mutt, I'm the one blessed by the heavenly gods, let's fight!"</p><p></p><p>He said, and rushed towards the strange beast, the black and white dog.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo stood calmly, as if watching a dead person! The strange beast, the black and white dog, if placed on the mountain, even an ordinary tiger would be unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>With this huge physique, if a few strong men encountered it, they would surely die without a chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao, this thin and emaciated old man, how could he be a match for the strange beast? "The gods have blessed me, I am invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the strange beast, Chen Kangbao roared and charged towards it, colliding with the huge body.</p><p></p><p>To Zhou Mo's surprise, the terrifying strange beast was actually being held down by Chen Kangbao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's face was filled with ecstatic joy: "I've held it down, I've held it down!"</p><p></p><p>The blessing worked!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo saw this scene and showed an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, then quickly reacted, squeezing the strange beast token to restore the strange beast's fighting power.</p><p></p><p>"Useless, get up quickly!"</p><p></p><p>He was furious and couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>But the strange beast, the black and white dog, was firmly held down by Chen Kangbao, no matter how it roared and struggled, it was to no avail.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Qi Yuan's eyes were fixed on him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he felt a sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo was now completely panicked: "Don't come over here..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes showed a smile, a gentle smile: "Don't be afraid, I'm not a bad person, I won't hurt you."</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, looking at the smile on Qi Yuan's face, Zhou Mo actually felt a sense of tranquility, and the intense emotional fluctuations just now disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard Qi Yuan say, "Actually, I'm a kitchen knife."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo, hearing this, was even more convinced that Qi Yuan had truly gone mad.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person would say they are a kitchen knife? He, a person of normal intelligence, couldn't even outsmart a lunatic?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, he was determined.</p><p></p><p>That Chen Kangbao looked like he was hiding something, but this Qi Yuan, he was a true sickly person.</p><p></p><p>Fooling a sick lunatic, wouldn't he be able to capture him easily? "Can you make him release the strange beast? That dog... won't hurt you."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm a kitchen knife, I want to cut vegetables." Qi Yuan said, walking towards Zhou Mo.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the slowly approaching Qi Yuan, he was not afraid, he had a dagger in his hand, and he had also cultivated in the past, only not entering the door, so his combat power was still higher than an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, Qi Yuan's figure suddenly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>A calm voice fell into his ears.</p><p></p><p>"You are my vegetable!"</p><p></p><p>The palm strike heavily hit his neck, and the intense pain was accompanied by a sense of dizziness, his consciousness extinguished at this moment.</p><p></p><p>And his face showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Mo's words never came out, his body suddenly collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the useless son-in-law could actually kill him with a single strike! "Cutting vegetables, the experience gained is slightly increased."</p><p></p><p>The mechanical and indifferent voice came, and Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"This asylum director is too useless, only worth fifty mosquitoes!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, killing this director, the experience gained was only as much as fifty mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>It was not enough for Qi Yuan to level up.</p><p></p><p>He was still at Level 2.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I've held down this strange beast, come quickly, I feel like I can't hold it much longer!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Kangbao's face was flushed red, and the veins on his hands were bulging, as if he had used all the strength he had.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue to bless you." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength was not enough, his eyesight was still there.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, he could even see hidden information.</p><p></p><p>This Chen Kang Bao still had some combat power in him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, Chen Kang Bao was full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>"Blessed again?"</p><p></p><p>"The old servant feels full of energy!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the blessing bestowed by the young master?"</p><p></p><p>"Please, young master, give the old servant a little more!"</p><p></p><p>"This feeling is truly too good!"</p><p></p><p>"...Don't say anything."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was speechless, and he fished out a dagger from Zhou Mu's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Focus on holding it down, don't let it hurt me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, under the terrified gaze of the strange beast black and white dog, the dagger suddenly plunged into the neck of the strange beast.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the strange beast struggled even more violently, as if its throat had been shattered, and after a few breaths, the struggle diminished, it panted heavily, like leaking air, and finally died slowly.</p><p></p><p>"You heroically slew the strange beast black and white dog, and your experience value has increased."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pretended his system was narrating for him.</p><p></p><p>【You have reached level 3, and your physical fitness has improved.】</p><p></p><p>【You have reached level 4...】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【You have reached level 6, and your physical fitness has improved.】</p><p></p><p>The experience gained from slaying the strange beast black and white dog was far beyond what those mosquitoes could compare to.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, Qi Yuan had reached level 6.</p><p></p><p>At level 6, his strength and physical fitness were not as good as the black and white dog's, but with his combat techniques, he could easily defeat the black and white dog.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the first step of our plan has been completed in a roundabout way," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had reached level 6, his one-punch power was quantified to have 600 pounds of force.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary strong men were no longer his opponents.</p><p></p><p>"Young master is too powerful, we have completed the first step of the plan, now we should complete the second step..." Chen Kang Bao said, suddenly his expression changed, "Oh no, young master, I discovered a shocking loophole?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what loophole?"</p><p></p><p>"The second step of the plan was to interrogate Dean Zhou Mu to find out the mastermind, but in the first step, he has already died, how can we interrogate him?"</p><p></p><p>"It's all grandfather's fault, he made a big loophole in the plan!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao was as distressed as if he had lost his parents, his pale face became even paler, and the joy from earlier had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, it's not your fault," Qi Yuan said, "In fact, finding the mastermind is very simple, whoever sent me here to this place as a madman, that's the one, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't like to use his brain much.</p><p></p><p>But with his high intelligence and high emotional intelligence, as long as he thought about it, he could discover the problem.</p><p></p><p>"The one who sent me here is Huang Yan Shou, the second young master of the Huang family."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's memory as the son-in-law, when he returned to Ninghe County to worship his ancestors, this Huang Yan Shou actively came to make friends, sending silver and women.</p><p></p><p>The women, as the son-in-law Qi Yuan, his courage was small, afraid that the people of the Shen family would find out, so he dared not accept.</p><p></p><p>So, Huang Yan Shou secretly took the son-in-law Qi Yuan to climb over the widow's wall at night.</p><p></p><p>The final result was obvious, there was a strange spirit disturbance there, the widow died, and the son-in-law Qi Yuan's soul was also hooked by the strange spirit, becoming crazy and insane, and sent to the asylum.</p><p></p><p>"The Huang family, it's actually the Huang family!" Chen Kang Bao had a worried look on his face, "The Huang family is a well-known big family in Ninghe County, often distributing porridge and doing good deeds, and is very popular with the people!</p><p></p><p>Young master, we have to deal with the second young master of the Huang family, and we need to formulate a perfect plan! Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao was playing the role of a strategist.</p><p></p><p>"You go and formulate the plan, I need to continue killing mosquitoes," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Now that his strength is not strong, if he confronts the Huang family head-on, he is very likely to die.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who plays games, knows that stealthy growth is the way to go.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Chen Kang Bao, hearing that Qi Yuan entrusted this important task to him, felt trusted and his spirits were lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, what do we do with this corpse?" Chen Kang Bao looked at the corpse on the ground, his face full of deep worry.</p><p></p><p>"That's not difficult at all?" Qi Yuan pointed to the pond in the distance, "Isn't there someone fishing there? He has been fishing for a long time without catching a single fish, it's great to just throw the corpse over there, so he won't go home empty-handed."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the fisherman will never go home empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan saw that the fisherman couldn't catch any fish, and would be mocked by others, so he said, it's a good deed to do.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Chen Kang Bao heard this and immediately broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, quickly bless me, I'll hang the strange beast's corpse and the corpse on the fisherman's hook."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go quickly, and after you're done, go back and sleep, I'll need to sleep soon too."</p><p></p><p>Even after cultivating immortality, Qi Yuan still liked to sleep.</p><p></p><p>In this world, he hasn't cultivated immortality yet, so he naturally needs more sleep to replenish his energy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next noon.</p><p></p><p>In the asylum.</p><p></p><p>Constable Lin Qing He, his waist hung a large saber, his expression cold and stern.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two corpses on the ground, and then at the old fisherman: "Tell me, what's going on, when did you find the bodies?"</p><p></p><p>Today, he received a report that bodies were found in the asylum.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing is quite common.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Qing He's heart was full of pity, he could only pretend not to know, not to understand.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, it does not change according to his will.</p><p></p><p>However, this time the dead were Dean Zhou Mu of the asylum, and a strange beast, so he had to take action.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a corpse, this is my fish!" The old fisherman with a beard shook, tightly grasping Zhou Mu's corpse, with a look of pride, "Look at how big this fish is, have you ever seen one like this before? Hehe, this is the fish I, Wang Wei, caught!"</p><p></p><p>Constable Zhou Hu had a smile on his face: "Captain, this guy was carrying Zhou Mu, the dean's corpse, around early in the morning, shouting everywhere that he had caught a big fish, that's how people discovered that he was carrying a corpse, scaring all the people in the asylum."</p><p></p><p>"This guy has a problem with his head, he's been fishing in the pond every day, asking him won't get us any useful information."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qing He nodded, he was just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>These people with problems in their heads, you really can't get any useful information out of them.</p><p></p><p>They might even imagine things and mislead the investigation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qing He squatted down and examined the bodies of Zhou Mu and the strange beast black and white dog.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Mu died from a side palm strike that crushed his throat, with a force of about 200 pounds.</p><p></p><p>Strange, how could a person with this level of strength use a dagger to kill this strange beast?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Qing He's eyes were full of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>A force of 200 pounds, it seemed okay, but for people like them who had been cultivating from a young age, it was nothing, not even close to their natural divine strength.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there was a martial arts expert who held down the strange beast, and let this murderer kill the strange beast?"</p><p></p><p>"But why would they do that?"</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't that martial arts expert just kill the strange beast themselves?"</p><p></p><p>These two corpses, their deaths were really strange.</p><p></p><p>And the one who could physically restrain the strange beast must be a formal martial arts expert.</p><p></p><p>There are not many such martial arts experts in Ninghe County, but most of them have no motive to commit a crime.</p><p></p><p>"Has anything special happened at the asylum recently?" Lin Qing He asked the servant of the asylum.</p><p></p><p>"No... nothing," the servant dared not look Lin Qing He in the eye.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a yamen runner came running over and whispered in Lin Qing He's ear: "Captain, a half-body corpse of a woman was found in Zhou Mu's courtyard, it's the widow who was recently sent to the asylum, she looks miserable, probably eaten by the strange beast."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a flash of murderous intent appeared in Lin Qing He's eyes, then disappeared immediately.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stomped on Zhou Mu's corpse.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

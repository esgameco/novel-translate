        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wang Dajia glanced at the scenery outside, his gaze filled with emotion.</p><p></p><p>The endless green fields stretched out, with various crops standing tall and laden with fruit.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how beautiful the scenery or how promising the future, it would all be destroyed under the footsteps of the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Only by fleeing south, further south, was there a glimmer of hope for survival amidst the flames of war.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Wang Dajia said, no longer lingering.</p><p></p><p>The northern lands had almost entirely fallen. Their only chance was to head towards the Ancient God Alliance and migrate to the south through it.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, most of the southern lands were still in the hands of the ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dawn broke.</p><p></p><p>Outside the temple, Qi Qi took a deep breath: "Godfather, you nearly scared me to death!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qi looked at Qi Yuan hanging from the tree and the bride in a blood-red wedding dress, the terror not yet faded from her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who saw two people hanging from a tree early in the morning would be frightened half to death like her.</p><p></p><p>"The adopted daughter of the Celestial Venerable, afraid of even this." Qi Yuan came down from the tree with his little bride in his arms. "This is Xiao Jia, my... wife."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pointed at Xiao Jia, introducing her to Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia seemed to understand Qi Yuan's words and dropped a happy wooden token from her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Qi was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Actually, when she first came to Qingshui Village, she had vaguely seen this red wedding dress.</p><p></p><p>She had always thought it was a treasure, but never imagined it was her godfather's... wife?</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come looking for me?" Qi Yuan sensed there were other people outside the temple. "Did something happen?"</p><p></p><p>"Godfather, there have been major changes in the Lin Kingdom. The former emperor... has passed away, and the governor of Feiling Prefecture has been transferred." Qi Qi summarized the news she had received last night for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now in Qingshui Village, logistics and various matters were all managed by Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had only come to play the game. He couldn't be bothered to manage a village, let alone a city.</p><p></p><p>He was good at fighting and killing, but as an administrator... not so much.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Qi Qi was a qualified "housekeeper", managing everything in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>"When will the evil gods attack?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi frowned and said: "In Feiling Prefecture, four out of seven cities belong to the evil gods. </p><p></p><p>If a new god descends, it's estimated they will consolidate for two years before launching an attack on Feiyao City."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Qi Qi looked very worried.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't much time left for Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyebrow twitched: "They're too slow. This won't do.</p><p></p><p>It seems I need to formulate a detailed plan."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Qi Yuan became passionate.</p><p></p><p>His talent for cultivation was average, but his ability to formulate plans was first-rate.</p><p></p><p>Any plan he carefully devised was meticulous, flawless, and when implemented, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Every plan he made was successfully carried out.</p><p></p><p>"What plan?" The Thunder God Venerable leaned in.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, to unify Feiling Prefecture," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Thunder God Venerable said solemnly: "In Feiling Prefecture, there may be evil gods of the second step of heaven-treading descending.</p><p></p><p>If this old man doesn't take action, with your current strength, it will be difficult to win."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable's concerns were not unfounded.</p><p></p><p>Like the Eighteen Arhats and the Four Heavenly Kings.</p><p></p><p>Their talents were strong and their futures limitless.</p><p></p><p>But they were all gods of the first step of heaven-treading, with only one divine aperture.</p><p></p><p>Being able to defeat those with three or even four divine apertures was already their limit.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to defeat an evil god of the second step of heaven-treading was almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>The second step of heaven-treading meant at least twelve divine apertures had been condensed.</p><p></p><p>It would be difficult to replicate feats like the Arhat Subduing the Dragon defeating a stronger opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The second step of heaven-treading is indeed strong, but my plan is very meticulous," Qi Yuan said without concern.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder God Venerable laughed heartily: "Don't come begging me to take action when the time comes. If this old man acts, I'll probably only be able to take you and flee, leaving the northern lands."</p><p></p><p>If the Thunder God Venerable took action against a second step heaven-treader, it would certainly attract the attention of powerful evil gods in the north.</p><p></p><p>At that point, the Thunder God Venerable would barely be able to protect himself, with no choice but to flee.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the Thunder God Venerable: "There are indeed some issues with formulating this plan.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Venerable, have you heard of the Ancient Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled what the Qionghua Venerable had said, that there might be a method to break through to True God within the Ancient Clan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Thunder God Venerable immediately understood Qi Yuan's meaning: "You want to emulate the Defying Heaven Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>He frowned, looking like he didn't support Qi Yuan's decision.</p><p></p><p>"You're not even a True God yet. Rashly entering the ancestral grounds of the Ancient Clan would be a dead end.</p><p></p><p>Within the Ancient Clan are many heroic spirits who died in the Great Deluge War, as well as evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Even if you go in, you may not be able to replicate the Defying Heaven Venerable's path.</p><p></p><p>Now, most of the Ancient Clan's ancestral grounds are controlled by the Defying Heaven Venerable, and even he can't replicate his success."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, everything is worth trying. Right now I just need a way to enter the Ancient Clan's ancestral grounds.</p><p></p><p>I believe that as long as you work hard, any quest can be completed!"</p><p></p><p>Games are made for people to play. </p><p></p><p>How could there be quests that can't be completed? That would only mean you're not strong enough! Moreover, Qi Yuan's eyes could see hidden information, and his ears could hear others' whispers and even their thoughts. Once he entered the Ancient Clan's ancestral grounds, he had a very good chance of replicating the Defying Heaven Venerable's breakthrough to True God.</p><p></p><p>Just then, beside</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The village chief of Qingshui Village, Yu Lei, shouted: "Great deity, we in Qingshui Village have a channel to enter the ancestral lands."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Village chief Yu Lei hurriedly said: "Our Qingshui Village is actually a remnant lineage of an ancient clan. We are qualified to recommend you, great deity, to enter the ancestral lands!"</p><p></p><p>Village chief Yu Lei was somewhat anxious. Before the deity participated in the Hundred Flowers Gathering, he had planned to tell Qi Yuan about this matter to show his loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile in Qi Yuan's eyes grew even wider: "See, the quest prompt has appeared. When can I go to the ancestral lands?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It will take... about half a month," Village chief Yu Lei replied, telling Qi Yuan more information about the ancestral lands.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Village had an entrance to the ancestral lands. However, without reaching the realm of deities, entering the ancestral lands would almost certainly result in death. To open this entrance required half a month of preparation time.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month? That long?" Qi Yuan frowned, "How long did Aoshi Dazun stay in the ancestral lands before breaking through to the True God realm?"</p><p></p><p>"About a day," Thunder God Dazun answered.</p><p></p><p>"I see. I've figured out how to make a plan.</p><p></p><p>First three days, send troops to Feiwu City and take it.</p><p>Fourth to tenth day, take two more cities.</p><p>Eleventh to seventeenth day, break through to the True God realm and summon the big boss.</p><p>Twentieth to thirtieth day, take over the entire Feiling Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said with high spirits.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had formulated a meticulous plan. The plan had a clear sequence, tight logic, and strong causal relationships. Qi Yuan felt that once implemented, it would surely be unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Thunder God Dazun was stunned. He looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "I won't intervene this time."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't intervene.</p><p></p><p>"You just stay and help me guard the home base," Qi Yuan said, completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan's attitude, Thunder God Dazun couldn't help but ask: "Are you serious?"</p><p></p><p>He thought he was already reckless enough. His close friends always told him to be more cautious whenever they met. But compared to Qi Yuan, he felt he wasn't reckless at all.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm serious. In war, speed is of the essence. I want to catch them off guard!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to wait for the enemy to slowly attack and then defend the city. It was better to attack directly.</p><p></p><p>"But once you start a war against those cities, the Step Two Evil God from Feiling Prefecture will surely accelerate his descent. Perhaps not in two years, but in just half a year, he will descend!" Thunder God Dazun said with a serious face, trying to make Qi Yuan understand the gravity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Half a year? No wonder they haven't taken over the Mortal Heart Realm after so many years. So they're this slow. How about this - when I return from the ancestral lands, I'll immediately send troops to occupy Feiling Prefecture, to speed up that Step Two Evil God."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand dismissively and looked at Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly gather the chef team, the music team, and the mourning team. We're going to Feiwu City now!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, even Qi Qi was confused.</p><p></p><p>"We're going now?" Qi Qi was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>The plan seemed to have been decided on a whim.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, why bring along the chef team, music team, and mourning team?</p><p></p><p>"I never repeat myself!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Qi's expression became solemn: "Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>She unconditionally obeyed her adoptive father's words.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Thunder God Dazun looked at Qi Yuan with a strange expression: "You, kid... have the style of my younger days."</p><p></p><p>"Don't flatter yourself."</p><p></p><p>"This war of yours... seems a bit childish," Thunder God Dazun couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"It's just playing a game, isn't it normal to be childish?" Qi Yuan shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Thunder God Dazun seemed to understand something and couldn't help but smile: "Living life as a game is indeed interesting. I was overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a game, why think so much about it?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>A quarter of an hour later, outside the temple in Qingshui Village.</p><p></p><p>The mourning team, chef team, and music team had already assembled.</p><p></p><p>These three teams of nearly a hundred people gathered together, creating quite a lively scene.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, I was in the middle of washing my clothes and haven't hung them out to dry yet!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Has some evil god died and we need to go mourn?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's the banquet being held?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in a chaotic state, without any military discipline.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as Qi Yuan appeared, the previously chaotic scene instantly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the three hundred people below, as well as the Eighteen Arhats, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the three main squadrons.</p><p></p><p>He spoke: "Today, we have only one goal - to march on Feiwu City! We will hold a banquet in Feiwu City!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Thunder God Dazun watched all this with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>The music team, mourning team, and chef team, upon hearing Qi Yuan's words, were filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Banquet!"</p><p></p><p>"Banquet!"</p><p></p><p>This was something they were familiar with and accustomed to.</p><p></p><p>They had absolute trust in Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, they wouldn't be the ones fighting on the front lines.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

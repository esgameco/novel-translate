        <h1>Chapter 413</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lowered his head in thought.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu listened attentively, while calculating in her mind how to cultivate and improve her abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I'm the long-lost ancestor of Black Demon Abyss?" Qi Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>"Such unfilial descendants, making their ancestor work for them!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan felt somewhat indignant.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go meet the manager," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>At this outpost of the Demon Tower, Black Demon Abyss had five senior managers and numerous regular managers.</p><p></p><p>Each senior manager was a mythical-level cultivator. </p><p></p><p>Regular managers started at the Great Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>There were hundreds of guest cultivators like Qi Yuan, who were essentially skilled workers, and even more ordinary warriors who served as foot soldiers.</p><p></p><p>It could be said there were many powerful individuals.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the number of living beings in an entire Demon Tower, which exceeded that of the Azure Waves Realm, this was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the cave dwelling, everywhere one looked were various black buildings.</p><p></p><p>Black bridges, black trees, black stones, even the water flowing under the bridges was as black as ink.</p><p></p><p>This was because the beings of Black Demon Abyss mostly preferred black.</p><p></p><p>"At least the air isn't black," Qi Yuan remarked, stepping onto the bridge and heading towards the inner outpost of Black Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>On this bridge were many guest cultivators, and even more Purple Palace level warriors. Guest cultivators like Qi Yuan were relatively rare.</p><p></p><p>All the warriors who encountered Qi Yuan bowed their heads in greeting.</p><p></p><p>In Black Demon Abyss, status was clearly defined, with strength and bloodline representing everything.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan was leaning against the railing of the bridge, looking at the scenery of the outpost.</p><p></p><p>Unable to stray far from Qi Yuan, Jiang Lingsu simply clung to his arm intimately.</p><p></p><p>"The upper realm is indeed the upper realm, this bridge is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>This bridge was actually a magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>To enter the inner outpost, one must cross this bridge.</p><p></p><p>However, the time needed to cross the bridge was not determined by one's flying speed, but by one's identity token.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary warriors, even if they flew at top speed across the bridge, it would take the same time as walking normally - about 100 breaths.</p><p></p><p>For guest cultivators, the time required varied according to their rank.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's guest cultivator token, it would normally take him 30 breaths to cross.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've seen such a magical treasure. Does this mean... if I set it to 10 million years and hide at the other end of the bridge, enemies wouldn't be able to cross?" Jiang Lingsu imagined wildly.</p><p></p><p>"What if the enemies don't use the bridge?" Qi Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The bridge was merely somewhat interesting.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed effective for low-level cultivators, like a rule, but for Great Venerables with divine domains, there were many ways to cross if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan, a Purple Palace Grand Cultivator, could manage it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his current persona was an elder of Futu Mountain, so he had to maintain that image.</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's first time impersonating someone else, so he wasn't very skilled at it.</p><p></p><p>After 30 breaths, Qi Yuan arrived at the inner part of the Black Demon Abyss outpost.</p><p></p><p>A huge black stone appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>He took out his identity token.</p><p></p><p>The black stone opened its black mouth, with an eerie glow inside.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan strode in with Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>In his view was a dwarf-like old man with his head lowered, playing with something resembling a Rubik's cube in his hand.</p><p></p><p>When he sensed Qi Yuan enter, the dwarf old man raised his head and glanced sideways.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Although one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, this dwarf old man wasn't human, so Qi Yuan did judge him by appearance.</p><p></p><p>The old man looked as if he had an odd temperament, as if cultivation had addled his brain.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Ke, I'd like to ask how many merits are needed to exchange for a Sky-reaching Jade," Qi Yuan said, now eager to ascend to the Sixth Heaven to see Jinli in the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was now May.</p><p></p><p>"Sky-reaching Jade?" The dwarf old man glanced sideways at Qi Yuan. "That's not easy to obtain. It requires 10,000 merits, and even then you might not be able to exchange for it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's eyes widened: "Does that mean I'd have to work for 10,000 years?"</p><p></p><p>Collecting one strand of Miluo Light earned one merit.</p><p></p><p>On average, it took a Yin Spirit cultivator one year to collect one strand of Miluo Light.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan would need to work for 10,000 years to accumulate enough merits.</p><p></p><p>Calculating at a monthly salary of 5,000, working for 10,000 years without eating or drinking, he could earn 600 million yuan.</p><p></p><p>Well, on Blue Star, that would be considered a small fortune, enough to buy a small luxury home in a big city.</p><p></p><p>"Although your identity information hasn't been entered yet, with the Ink Jade token, your status as a guest cultivator is confirmed. Do you want to take on the task of collecting Miluo Light?</p><p></p><p>The sooner you accumulate merits, the sooner you can go to the Sixth Heaven," the dwarf old man said flatly.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, for guest cultivators like Qi Yuan, even after joining the Black Demon Abyss outpost, it could take several months or even a year or more for their identity information to be recorded.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator responsible for this might be in seclusion or busy with other matters.</p><p></p><p>This was common in the upper realms.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Qi Yuan said after brief consideration, accepting the task of collecting Miluo Light.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, such tasks were handed over every hundred years.</p><p></p><p>In a hundred years, he didn't even know where he'd be, so why worry about the task.</p><p></p><p>For now, he would use the cover of Black Demon Abyss to go out and collect Miluo Light, and do some fishing on the side.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Black Demon Abyss outpost, Qi Yuan stretched lazily: "I suddenly feel that coming to the upper realm has given me a real sense of cultivation... In the lower realm, it felt more like playing around."</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's honest thought.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation path had involved playing games every day, either meeting his first love or exterminating clans.</p><p></p><p>Being a guest cultivator, taking on tasks - he had never done such things before.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this good? This is how most cultivators spend their lives," Jiang Lingsu said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of cultivation is too dull," Qi Yuan took a deep breath, his consciousness probing the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The game icon was still loading, not yet successful.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go collect Miluo Light," Qi Yuan said, leading Jiang Lingsu away.</p><p></p><p>Collecting Miluo Light actually meant going to the Miluo Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Demon clan was vast, and the Demon Towers were far apart. Even flying at the Yang Spirit level would take considerable time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, flying at full speed as a Yang Spirit would certainly attract the attention of Primordial Treasures, or other Yang Spirit Celestial Venerables of the Demon clan.</p><p></p><p>But the Miluo Realm was different. It was similar to the Dark Void, or rather a crude version of the Dark Void.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Void was a special, unfathomable place that teleportation arrays passed through.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Spirits could only pass through the Dark Void via teleportation arrays, unable to physically enter, observe or explore it.</p><p></p><p>Thus, people in the immortal realm had many speculations and studies about the Dark Void.</p><p></p><p>The Miluo Realm was a crude version of the Dark Void, which cultivators could enter.</p><p></p><p>However, the Miluo Realm was complex and fraught with dangers. Even Yin Spirit Venerables could perish if careless.</p><p></p><p>But the Miluo Realm was very convenient for travel, and quite discreet.</p><p></p><p>Generally, only Great Venerables with divine domains and above would travel through the Miluo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Milo Realm, controlled by the Molo clan, was rich in Milo Light.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Milo Realm and collect Milo Light, one needed credentials from the major powers. This was one of the reasons why Qi Yuan joined the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>After about a few hundred breaths of time, Qi Yuan brought Jiang Lingsu to the entrance of the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance, there was a long queue.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Molo clan stood at the entrance, looking casual and arrogant, inspecting those entering the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many Purple Palace cultivators now quietly queued up like ordinary people, with no one daring to cut in line.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yin God Venerable, they were no exception, though they queued in a separate, shorter line.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was about to go queue up when a voice sounded in his ear: "Sir, as an honored guest of the Black Magic Abyss, you don't need to queue."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was a Yin God Venerable in the queue. He looked at Qi Yuan, his eyes filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>"In the Molo clan, people from the Black Magic Abyss and Tai Huang Palace... have special privileges," the Yin God Venerable added.</p><p></p><p>The Molo clan had always been subservient to the Black Magic Abyss, hoping to rejoin it as a branch.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Black Magic Abyss had always ignored them.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so I'm considered a big shot now?" Qi Yuan thanked the Yin God Venerable and then headed towards the Milo Realm with Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when the Molo clan cultivators at the Milo Realm saw Qi Yuan's special black robe, they suddenly perked up, their previously arrogant attitude becoming submissive.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!"</p><p></p><p>These Molo clan cultivators bowed, their eyes filled with undisguised envy.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan ignored them and walked into the Milo Realm unimpeded, under the envious gazes of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Milo Realm, the scene before him suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully sensed that spiritual energy was completely absent in the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, cultivators could not practice cultivation while collecting Milo Light in the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he saw that thousands of meters away, space was rapidly collapsing.</p><p></p><p>A sense of danger approached, and many cultivators were fleeing within the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This place is indeed dangerous. I'm afraid even ordinary Yin God Venerables would be unable to escape if trapped here," Qi Yuan sighed as he watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>The direction of the spatial collapse was not towards him, so he remained calm, merely watching like a spectator.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's set up a tent. We'll settle here temporarily," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu frowned: "Senior Brother, there's no spiritual energy here. How can I cultivate? Just use spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>"No worries, I'll breathe out some air for you," Qi Yuan said casually. "Imported spiritual energy, more high-end!"</p><p></p><p>The air he breathed out was much purer than the spiritual energy in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Tch!" Jiang Lingsu's face reddened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a surprised voice suddenly came: "Blood Robe... you've come to collect Milo Light too!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked over and saw a familiar face - it was Ji Buping.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping was now wearing a black robe and looked quite disheveled.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was an ugly old woman who looked like Ji Buping's master.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's cultivation level had reached the realm of Myth, making her a top-tier powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Joining the Black Magic Abyss, what else would I do if not collect Milo Light?" Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping's expression changed several times, feeling a strong sense of frustration.</p><p></p><p>In order to collect Milo Light faster and develop quicker in the Black Magic Abyss, he had sacrificed his appearance to become this old woman's temporary Dao partner. This allowed him to enter the Milo Realm even before his status as an honored guest was confirmed. Yet Blood Robe had entered directly.</p><p></p><p>This made him feel that his sacrifice was somewhat worthless.</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman glanced at Qi Yuan, then withdrew her gaze. The two bid farewell and headed towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Is he the Blood Robe that the core members have taken a liking to? Apart from having a pretty face, he doesn't seem to have anything special about him?" The ugly old woman found it strange.</p><p></p><p>The core members of the Black Magic Abyss were considered big shots even to the ugly old woman.</p><p></p><p>She had been on the fifth level for hundreds of thousands of years, just to accumulate enough merit points to gain the qualification to reflect across the heavens, and then become a core member of the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Buping felt even more resentful: "Perhaps... he's just lucky."</p><p></p><p>The ugly old woman looked at Ji Buping: "Don't pay too much attention to him. No matter how good his appearance is, he'll end up being nothing more than a plaything for some big shot. You're different. With your fourth-grade bloodline, you have a sliver of a chance to become a core member of the Black Magic Abyss."</p><p></p><p>This sliver of a chance was, of course, extremely slim, but it did exist. The ugly old woman's words weren't entirely deceiving Ji Buping.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Buping's eyes showed a look of excitement.</p><p></p><p>In the Milo Realm, danger could strike at any time, so cultivators couldn't focus on closed-door cultivation and had to remain vigilant of their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping kept an eye out for Milo Light while occasionally glancing towards the distant tent.</p><p></p><p>He saw that near the distant tent, the young couple seemed to be on a vacation. They had set up tables and chairs with various foods and fruits.</p><p></p><p>Ji Buping's eyes showed envy, mixed with a hint of malice.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, a whole year will be wasted without capturing even a strand of Milo Light!" </p><p></p><p>Ji Buping cursed like this.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, Ji Buping's brow twitched, and his eyes showed curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Why did they leave?"</p><p></p><p>He saw that the tables and chairs outside the distant tent had been put away, along with all the items on them.</p><p></p><p>"Did they discover Milo Light? No, I must follow them!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he quickly followed in the direction where Qi Yuan had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But after just a few breaths, Ji Buping looked bewildered: "Where did they go?"</p><p></p><p>He had completely lost track of them.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he had never managed to follow them in the first place.</p><p></p><p>"He must be up to something!" Ji Buping stopped in his tracks, his gaze shifting, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan had already placed Jiang Lingsu in the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>He traversed the Milo Realm alone, heading towards the location of another Molo Sacred Tower.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a rabbit doesn't eat grass near its own nest.</p><p></p><p>So he had to go to a more distant place to fish.</p><p></p><p>As for Ji Buping following him for a while, he was actually aware of it but didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party was so willing to follow, he would invite him along next time.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was walking ahead, so he couldn't be bothered to follow.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ji Buping clearly had ambition, even sleeping with an old woman.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely be willing to do big things together.</p><p></p><p>After setting up the trap and returning to the starting point, if the fish were about to take the bait, he would call Ji Buping to join.</p><p></p><p>Such an ambitious cultivator would certainly not miss the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought randomly.</p><p></p><p>His figure had also reached another exit of the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were many Molo clan cultivators guarding the exit of the Milo Realm.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were too weak for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra activated, he walked out directly without attracting anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Baiting is a technical skill."</p><p></p><p>"It can't be too obvious, but it also can't go unnoticed."</p><p></p><p>P.S.: There's one more chapter, I'll post it together tomorrow. Sorry, I feel burnt out today.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

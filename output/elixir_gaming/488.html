        <h1>Chapter 488</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems you don't know everything after all."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Silent Venerable Saint remain silent, Qi Yuan shrugged his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"I happen to be missing a mirror at home. Would you be interested in hanging it on my wall?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Myriad Image Mirror and slowly said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Silent Venerable Saint, who had been keeping his eyes closed, opened them, and his own consciousness returned.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Sun Lord is joking." The Silent Venerable Saint smiled.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know I'm joking?" Qi Yuan was still being mischievous.</p><p></p><p>If the other party agreed, he would naturally accept it. </p><p></p><p>If the other party refused, he would directly turn it into "I didn't want it in the first place" and make a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for answering the questions I wanted to ask. I owe you a favor." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was always clear about favors and grudges.</p><p></p><p>The Silent Venerable Saint stood by Qi Yuan's side and slowly said, "Although the Taihuang Palace has entered the Seventh Realm, the Supreme Sun Lord still needs to be careful of the Rinai Molting. This time, the Rinai Molting may even cause the Lord to perish."</p><p></p><p>Although the Taihuang Palace had promised to be the only palace, this Rinai Molting could lead to the Lord's demise.</p><p></p><p>However, with the strength of the Taihuang Palace, it would be difficult for the Lord to perish.</p><p></p><p>So, the Wisdom Council even suspected that this Rinai Molting might involve the Unique Palace personally.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they couldn't figure out the reason for the Lord's demise.</p><p></p><p>The Silent Venerable Saint then told Qi Yuan the Wisdom Council's speculation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes: "If they come to the lower realm, it's a good opportunity... I should go ask them why they are sheltering the Taihuang Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Silent Venerable Saint was startled.</p><p></p><p>He had some admiration for the courage of the Supreme Sun Lord.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the two Lords of the Wisdom Council were evasive about the Unique Palace, yet the Supreme Sun Lord still dared to go and demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"The Yang God Venerable of the Sixth Realm, even if he is a Lord, may not have seen the Unique Palace's Anomalous Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Anomalous Spirit is unknown, and the Supreme Sun Lord still needs to be careful." The Silent Venerable Saint reminded.</p><p></p><p>"When the Son of Heaven violates the law, he is punished the same as the commoners. How can he avoid the law just because he is powerful?" Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>When his cultivation is complete, he needs to go to the Seventh Realm and capture the criminals of the Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Silent Venerable Saint did not dare to continue on this topic.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Sun Lord, when the Rinai Molting begins, I hope the Wisdom Council and the Purple Origin Heaven can cooperate to overcome the difficulties." The Silent Venerable Saint said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Qi Yuan was indifferent to these matters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Silent Venerable Saint thought of something, waved his hand, and a white jade bottle appeared. He whispered, "Supreme Sun Lord, this is some ancestral blood of the Black Demon that I have collected. I heard you need it, so I specially offer it to you, please accept it."</p><p></p><p>What the Silent Venerable Saint said now represents his personal views, not those of the Wisdom Council.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Not bad, just tell me what you want." Qi Yuan took the ancestral blood of the Black Demon.</p><p></p><p>Nothing in the world is free.</p><p></p><p>Since the Silent Venerable Saint gave him the ancestral blood of the Black Demon, he must have something to ask for.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this big-browed and big-eyed man has fallen in love with him? The Silent Venerable Saint's eyes flashed with joy, and he hurriedly said, "I heard that a while ago, the Sacred Immortal used the root demon blood to plunge the Purple Origin Ancestor into the root demon tribulation, and in the end, it was the Supreme Sun Lord who intervened and helped the Purple Origin Ancestor overcome the root demon tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>The Silent Venerable Saint looked at Qi Yuan with an anxious expression, and there was an expectant look in his deep eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, the Silent Venerable Saint was overjoyed in his heart, but he remained calm on the surface.</p><p></p><p>It's really true!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Sun Lord was actually able to solve the root demon tribulation! This...</p><p></p><p>The Silent Venerable Saint understood that if this news spread, the Lords of the Sixth Realm and the Great Lords would go crazy.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Lords of the Sixth Realm progressed slowly was because... the root demon tribulation was blocking their steps.</p><p></p><p>The root demon tribulation was like a sharp sword hanging over their heads, making it difficult for them to make progress, and a slight carelessness would cause them to fall into a bottomless abyss.</p><p></p><p>"My root demon tribulation may descend within a million years. I wonder... can the Supreme Sun Lord help me a little?" The Silent Venerable Saint said anxiously, with a very humble posture.</p><p></p><p>His root demon tribulation was very close, with only ten thousand years left.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's just that the time of your root demon tribulation..." Qi Yuan was a little hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Silent Venerable Saint hurriedly said, "I can delay... up to five thousand years."</p><p></p><p>He thought that the Supreme Sun Lord's ability to deal with the root demon tribulation was also limited, and it would be difficult for him to intervene again within a million years, so he hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Why delay? I was going to say, if you wait another ten thousand years, the root demon might even come to my house to be a chef." Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years is too long.</p><p></p><p>The Silent Venerable Saint was stunned when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>The root demon becoming a chef? This Supreme Sun Lord really dares to say such things! The root demon... that existence is not only in the Immortal Realm, but also in other worlds, a towering existence.</p><p></p><p>This is something he cannot understand, even the Lords cannot fathom.</p><p></p><p>He then tentatively asked, "No delay?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to delay, the earlier the better." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Hearing this, the Silent Venerable Saint's heart was at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan waved his hand and disappeared from sight, looking deeply at the Wisdom Council.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the depths of the Wisdom Council, two voices sounded.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>"Confident?"</p><p></p><p>"No confidence."</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Wisdom is in his hands. Sooner or later, he will be able to see through our depths."</p><p></p><p>"Alas... he knows this, so why does he still come to the Wisdom Council? Could it be... that he wants to lure us to take action?"</p><p></p><p>"Unfathomable, unfathomable..."</p><p></p><p>The voices whispered and murmured, then faded away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying aura was flowing around him.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, the Fourteenth Layer."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at his arms, and a flash of sharpness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the Wisdom Council, he used the ancestral blood of the Black Demon that Zi Yuan Ancestor brought back from the Black Demon Abyss, as well as the one given to him by the Silent Venerable Saint, to cultivate the "Ancestral Blood Technique".</p><p></p><p>The "Ancestral Blood Technique" has finally reached the Fourteenth Layer.</p><p></p><p>"No one has ever stepped into the Fourteenth Layer in the Black Demon Abyss!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his "Ancestral Blood Technique" has also been optimized by himself, and is different from others, with different power.</p><p></p><p>"Now with the body enhanced by the Ten Thousand Dao Martial Divinities, am I comparable to an attack-type Causal Anomalous Treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave an inappropriate example.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I'm still too weak."</p><p></p><p>"The Anomalous Spirit of the Unique Palace, even the Lords fear it immensely, am I a match for it?"</p><p></p><p>"And that so-called Bright Lord, he looks like a ruthless person!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't beat them, if 'For My Own Sake' follows me, won't he suffer?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately... the game is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>The timing for the game to start would be very soon.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he needs to go to the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Moon God Palace will stop me?"</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the position of the Great Sun, Qi Yuan had a vague impulse in his heart, which was to seize the position of the Moon.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the position of the Moon, it seems that his strength could be further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>He had this impulse, so the Moon God Monarch must have it too.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Great Sun and the Moon God Monarch have always been at odds.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the cave dwelling, the figure of the Purple Origin Ancestor appeared.</p><p></p><p>"You've collected a lot more ancestral blood of the Black Demon... take it."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Origin Ancestor handed the ancestral blood of the Black Demon to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's too little." Qi Yuan looked at the newly collected ancestral blood of the Black Demon.</p><p></p><p>The last layer of the "Ancestral Blood Technique" requires a huge amount of ancestral blood of the Black Demon.</p><p></p><p>This is far from enough.</p><p></p><p>"Cough... there really isn't much left." The Purple Origin Ancestor replied, "But there are many other treasures. In these days, various major forces such as the Wisdom Council, the Cyan Fall Heaven, and the White Dragon Abyss... have been sending you gifts. You have become the number one celebrity in the Sixth Realm."</p><p></p><p>The joy on the Purple Origin Ancestor's face was undisguised.</p><p></p><p>When has he ever had such glory.</p><p></p><p>Although he is a Great Lord, in the eyes of those powerful figures like the Abyss Masters, he is only slightly valued.</p><p></p><p>Now, those old fellows who used to look down on him have become amiable towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they all want to overcome the root demon tribulation?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's help in helping the Purple Origin Ancestor overcome the root demon tribulation has attracted the attention of many powerful figures in the Immortal Realm of the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>They send gifts, mostly to get along with Qi Yuan and overcome the root demon tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"It should be." The Purple Origin Ancestor said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"If they want me to help them overcome the root demon tribulation, they must first not be my enemies... and I need to clean up the atmosphere a bit." Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>This matter is not urgent for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go to the Moon God Palace again. After returning from the Moon God Palace, I will go and play a game." </p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's calculation, the game will start after he returns from the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>He also wants to see how the Soundless Voice is doing now? Since the last time he infused his blood into the game, he hasn't heard the Soundless Voice's voice.</p><p></p><p>"You must be careful, the Moon God Palace is not like the Wisdom Council. Now... you have the position of the Great Sun." The Purple Origin Ancestor said in a low voice, his eyes stern.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, if I can't beat them, I'll run." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure dissipated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>When his figure reappeared, it was at the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>Different from the last time he came to the Moon God Palace, when Qi Yuan's figure appeared, he clearly felt that the atmosphere in the Moon God Palace was particularly solemn.</p><p></p><p>As one of the two Great Lords of the Moon God Palace, the Moon Flower Venerable Saint had a cold expression and held a Causal Anomalous Treasure: "Supreme Sun Lord... what business do you have in my Moon God Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon cannot coexist.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had usurped the position of the Great Sun, and was destined to become the enemy of the Moon God Palace.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to see the Moon God Monarch." Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"The Moon God Monarch is not available to see anyone!" The Moon Flower Venerable Saint waved his sleeve, no longer as amiable as before.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now, the Goddess Sovereign has suffered a heavy blow, and the Celestial Venerable of Moonlight dares not let Qi Yuan see the Goddess Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's current abilities, the Goddess Sovereign may not be his match.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have no ill intentions," Qi Yuan still said seriously.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the Palace of the Moon Goddess is Jingli's ancestral home.</p><p></p><p>He also has no enmity with the Palace of the Moon Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, sometimes, whether there are ill intentions or not doesn't matter," the Celestial Venerable of Moonlight decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>At their level, do good intentions and evil intentions still matter? In the face of such a great Dao struggle, who can resist the temptation?</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a faint voice came from the depths of the Palace of the Moon Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Let him in."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expression on the Celestial Venerable of Moonlight's face suddenly changed, and she gritted her teeth, finally speaking: "Supreme Venerable of Ten Thousand Days, please!"</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the owner of this voice was none other than the "Goddess Sovereign".</p><p></p><p>A beam of moonlight flowed from the depths of the Palace of the Moon Goddess, transforming into a blue bird.</p><p></p><p>The blue bird, carrying the moonlight, seemed to be guiding the way for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan followed the blue bird, heading deeper into the Palace of the Moon Goddess.</p><p></p><p>The deeper he went, the lower the temperature became, becoming extremely icy cold.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the exhaled breath had turned into frost.</p><p></p><p>What met Qi Yuan's eyes was endless glaciers and frost. All things were frozen into ice blocks. There was no wind, only a dry chill.</p><p></p><p>In this environment, even Qi Yuan felt as if his thoughts were frozen for a moment, experiencing a chill.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and saw a distant ice bed. Sitting on the ice bed was a... how pure and clean the woman was.</p><p></p><p>Pure, transparent, and smooth jade-like, truly an icy bone and jade body.</p><p></p><p>She was not a human body, but one made of ice as bones, jade as flesh, and snow as skin. Her dress and robe were also covered in ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was clear and lucid, giving the impression that her urine was not at all yellow, but crystal clear and transparent.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Goddess Sovereign?" Qi Yuan asked, looking at this icy and snowy being.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... and no." The icy and snowy woman looked at Qi Yuan. "They... think I am the Goddess Sovereign, but in fact, I am the Ice Moon."</p><p></p><p>The Ice Moon, the most powerful offensive Spiritual Treasure in the Palace of the Moon Goddess. Among all the offensive Spiritual Treasures, it ranks first.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Empyrean Palace completely crushes the Palace of the Moon Goddess. It is rumored that if the Goddess Sovereign did not have the Ice Moon, a powerful offensive Spiritual Treasure, she would have difficulty resisting the Empyrean Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to ask about your master Ruan Yixiao's information?" the Ice Moon spoke, her voice also very clear, with a hint of icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There is no such person in the Palace of the Moon Goddess that you are looking for," the Ice Moon said. "There was also no such person among the previous generations of Moon Maidens."</p><p></p><p>"Then where is she..." Qi Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"She is so mysterious, and also a person of the Palace of the Moon Goddess, so there are two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The first possibility is that she is too strong and can evade my observation."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan heard this and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>For example, if he now returned to the Divine Light Sect and pretended to be an ordinary disciple, even the Sect Master would not recognize him.</p><p></p><p>"What's the second possibility?"</p><p></p><p>"She is the Goddess Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The most mysterious person in the Palace of the Moon Goddess is the Goddess Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>She is very mysterious, and the Goddess Sovereign is also very mysterious.</p><p></p><p>In such a small Palace of the Moon Goddess, how could there be two mysterious figures?</p><p></p><p>So, these two people may be one and the same."</p><p></p><p>"Where is she?" After getting this answer, Qi Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had many guesses about the identity of his master.</p><p></p><p>No matter whether she is the Goddess Sovereign or not, it does not change the fact that she is his wife.</p><p></p><p>"She... may be in the past, or in the future, but not in the present world," the Ice Moon's expression became complex.</p><p></p><p>"In the past... the future?" Qi Yuan's expression was complicated, his thoughts endless.</p><p></p><p>He felt like his brain was growing.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the stronger the power, the more mysterious the things encountered.</p><p></p><p>Like the Enlightened Sovereign who severed the future of the Sixth Heaven, or the Goddess Sovereign who is not in the present world, but exists in the past or future.</p><p></p><p>"How can I see her?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the Fifth Layer of the Yang Deity can gather all the timelines of the world.</p><p></p><p>If you step into the Fifth Layer, you may be able to travel through time and space, return to the past, or go to the future to see her." The Ice Moon's voice was calm as she looked into Qi Yuan's eyes and slowly said, "Or perhaps, you have already seen her in the past, but you don't know it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent, standing in place, countless scenes flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, he ultimately did not remember any information about his master Ruan Yixiao.</p><p></p><p>After all, the flowers blooming quietly on the road have their own beauty and charm, but Qi Yuan's gaze may not necessarily linger on them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my strength is still too weak," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in his current state as a Purple Immortal, he could not be completely confident of victory even against a Supreme Venerable, let alone the even more powerful beings in the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Fifth Layer of the Yang Deity can gather all the timelines of the world, so what about the Third Layer and the Fourth Layer?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Moon shook her head: "This level of attainment is not something a small Spiritual Treasure like myself can know.</p><p></p><p>As for the Third Layer, I do not know, but I have heard a little about the Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity. It represents... a kind of disorder, a kind of chaos.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity... you should have seen it as well."</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Qi Yuan had a guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Root Demons, distributed in countless universes, the mighty existence that only appears during the Root Demon Calamity, is the exalted being of the Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity!"</p><p></p><p>There was deep reverence in the Ice Moon's eyes.</p><p></p><p>To the Yang Deity of the Second Layer, the Fourth Layer is like a mayfly looking at the sky, a frog in a well seeing the sun and moon.</p><p></p><p>Although they are all Yang Deities, they are not the same kind of being.</p><p></p><p>While the Yang Deity of the Second Layer is still limited to a certain universe, the Yang Deity of the Third Layer has transcended the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity is even more so, with a single thought spreading across countless worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Root Demons?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The special beings described by the Ice Moon were the same as his guess.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why you are able to solve the Root Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>But... it's best if you don't keep trying to help others solve the Root Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Yang Deity may represent disorder and chaos, but... that doesn't mean it will always remain dormant. What if it suddenly wakes up and sees you, this little thing?" Although the Ice Moon was warning him, there seemed to be a hint of mockery in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm not little!" Qi Yuan said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>Even Ziyuan, the little Violet Mist, saw him and stammered while calling him "big".</p><p></p><p>How was he small?</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any other questions? The information I possess is not much less than the All-Knowing Mirror. Wait... I need to sleep." The Ice Moon said, a hint of drowsiness appearing on her icy and snowy face.</p><p></p><p>"How strong are the Unique Palace's Spiritual Beings?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Unique Palace..." The Ice Moon's eyes flashed with deep awe and dread. "You have been to the Heavenly Boundless Land, so you should know about the Remnant Robe Ghostly Soul."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"The Remnant Robe Ghostly Soul, I speculate that he was an existence at the Third Layer of the Yang Deity in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>He was tainted by inauspicious blood, the inauspicious blood... once tried to enter the Immortal Realm, but was exterminated and eliminated by the Unique Palace." Mentioning this, the Ice Moon had an expression of awe and deep dread.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at it this way, the Unique Palace does have some power. I'm not a match for them now," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, he probably couldn't even match the Remnant Robe Ghostly Soul. The Remnant Robe Ghostly Soul was a Third Layer Yang Deity in his lifetime, and even after death, his remnant consciousness was still so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Then how terrifying must the Third Layer Yang Deity be? The inauspicious blood must be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>For the Unique Palace to be able to resist the inauspicious blood, they must be even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"If I were you, I would now enter the Portal of the All-Knowing. The Portal of the All-Knowing is not only the number one Spiritual Treasure in the Immortal Realm, but it is also known as the number one pure land.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the Supreme Venerables have already lived as long as heaven and earth, with endless lifespans.</p><p></p><p>But in these countless eras, the Supreme Venerables that have appeared in the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm are countless, yet the ones who have survived can be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in the Portal of the All-Knowing, perhaps... you can enjoy eternal life," the Ice Moon looked at Qi Yuan with an envious expression.</p><p></p><p>"We who have entered the Great Dao only seek carefree freedom, but where in this world can we see true freedom?</p><p></p><p>The Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm cannot see the future, and to us, it is nothing more than a cage.</p><p></p><p>This cage cannot be escaped, for to escape it is to die.</p><p></p><p>I have also seen people outside the Realm, and they all say that outside is full of strife and war, more chaotic than the Six Heavens.</p><p></p><p>To dwell in seclusion is barely enough to eke out an existence, but once discovered by other... cosmic beings, war is inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Immortal Realm had invaders and conquerors countless eras ago.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one is, the more one knows one's own insignificance, the more one feels the Immortal Dao is hopeless.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful, the more one is filled with despair." The Ice Moon spoke, her expression carrying a hint of hopelessness.</p><p></p><p>This kind of despair was something Qi Yuan rarely saw in the eyes of such great Cultivators of the All-Knowing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mind was calm.</p><p></p><p>What the Ice Moon said, he also understood.</p><p></p><p>According to a certain "electrician's" theory, the Dark Forest Principle.</p><p></p><p>Once a universe is discovered, observed by a powerful being,</p><p></p><p>Then... war may break out, occur.</p><p></p><p>After all, Cultivation relies on state of mind, as well as resources.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, state of mind is also a kind of resource.</p><p></p><p>Plunder is the main theme of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the atmosphere in the Immortal Cultivation world is really bad, I know," Qi Yuan also couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>He had played so many games and was familiar with these phenomena.</p><p></p><p>Even the NPCs were full of malice, let alone the Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Moonlit Great Land, the Flowing Wind Realm, the Mortal Heart Realm, the Arching Star... which world is not ravaged by war? Where there are people, there is strife, there is contention.</p><p></p><p>It is just a matter of the gap between the strong and the weak.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to improve my strength and rectify the atmosphere of the Immortal Cultivation world!"</p><p></p><p>"The first principle of Cultivation is: don't curse people!"</p><p></p><p>PS: Ahem, there's a red envelope below.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 456</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu stood outside the celestial curtain, his expression extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>"What could this mean?" he pondered, quite perplexed.</p><p></p><p>After all, for the star projection to become "female" was too strange.</p><p></p><p>The star projection was supposed to be the essence of the yang spirit.</p><p></p><p>How could it inexplicably turn into the character for "woman"? Could even the supreme truth accomplish this?</p><p></p><p>It was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be a supreme being behind this Blood Robe? Who could it be?" Zi Yuan Zu pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the Moon Spirit Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>"This feat... does fit with the Moon Spirit Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>"But wasn't the Moon Spirit Sovereign gravely injured?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that with the Lin Ya Molt approaching, she's showing her hand, telling the world that her injuries... have healed?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu could only try to convince himself this way.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe's relationships in the Sixth Heaven were simple.</p><p></p><p>He came from the Demon Luo clan and fell in love with the Moon Woman.</p><p></p><p>So it was very likely he had also met the Moon Spirit Sovereign before.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder this fellow said he wanted to become dao partners with the Moon Woman back then, and even... probed my thoughts on the Moon Spirit Palace."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zi Yuan Zu felt the doubts in his heart resolve.</p><p></p><p>Since the Moon Spirit Sovereign had intervened, Blood Robe would surely be fine.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, his mood improved.</p><p></p><p>"This guy, making me go beg at Black Magic Mountain and lose face. When he returns, I'll have to teach him a good lesson!" Zi Yuan Zu muttered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he sensed something and his eyes lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>His form vanished in that moment.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he landed outside the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space froze for a moment as Zi Yuan Zu looked calmly at Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>"You lucky fellow, you actually managed to come back alive."</p><p></p><p>His words were laced with irrepressible joy.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, old man, it's too dangerous out there," Qi Yuan said, terrified. "When you go out, there are too many men staring, and slanderous shrimp-headed men. It's simply impossible to guard against!"</p><p></p><p>Remembering Divine Blood Venerable's gaze, Qi Yuan became very angry.</p><p></p><p>It was simply killing harassment!</p><p></p><p>"The Sixth Heaven was never a blessed land, it's extremely perilous. You should understand that now, right?" Zi Yuan Zu said sternly. "Will you still be so bold as to go out recklessly and act willfully in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Old man, how can you blame the victim? Just because I dress revealingly, does that mean they can stare at me?" </p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm just telling you, a gentleman doesn't stand beneath a dangerous wall.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Lin Ya Molt approaching, the major holy lands will be stirred up. You should go out less, focus on cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Improve your strength, gain more ability to protect yourself!" Zi Yuan Zu advised earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "What you say makes sense, but... I need to go out once. Moon Radiance Venerable has agreed to let me marry Moon Woman and bring her back to Purple Fate Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>He became even more certain of his guess.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the one behind Blood Robe was the Moon Spirit Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"When?" Zi Yuan Zu asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'll find an auspicious date?" Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll go with you to Moon Spirit Palace!" Zi Yuan Zu said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Since there was danger, he would accompany him.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Banner Master of Ghost Dominion Heaven personally took action, no one could harm him.</p><p></p><p>Even the Banner Master could at most injure him.</p><p></p><p>And Ghost Dominion Heaven didn't understand what Blood Robe represented, so they wouldn't use the same level of force against Blood Robe as they would against Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Qi Yuan said: "This matter... Black Magic Abyss won't try to stop it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan didn't like to use his brain, he certainly wasn't stupid.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Lin Ya Molt approaching.</p><p></p><p>The chief of the Five Demons of Purple Fate Heaven marrying a Moon Woman from Moon Spirit Palace.</p><p></p><p>This couldn't help but make people speculate.</p><p></p><p>Was Black Magic Abyss going to ally with Moon Spirit Palace?</p><p></p><p>Or even some forces within Black Magic Abyss, like Ghost Soul Heaven which was at war with Moon Spirit Palace, might try to stop it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zi Yuan Zu's expression remained calm: "This matter... is Purple Fate Heaven's business. Others... have no say in it!"</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, he had gone to Black Magic Mountain to seek an audience with his master, to rescue Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>But he was met with a closed door.</p><p></p><p>He was thoroughly disappointed with that master.</p><p></p><p>Could it be said that he, Zi Yuan Zu, had failed Black Magic Abyss in all these years?</p><p></p><p>He had entered the Strange Lands seven times for Black Magic Abyss, fought alien races, reclaimed the Black Magic Ancestor's blood and placed it in the ancestral grounds.</p><p></p><p>To pave the way for Black Sword, he had also depleted his vital energy four times to refine great pills.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other things.</p><p></p><p>But when he sought an audience with his master to help Blood Robe, his master wouldn't even see him.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"This won't make you offend others, will it?" Qi Yuan asked carefully, being emotionally intelligent. "I've long heard that you old man don't get along with the Lord of Black Magic Abyss."</p><p></p><p>It was no secret among the upper echelons that Zi Yuan Zu and the Lord of Black Magic Abyss didn't get along.</p><p></p><p>There were both unofficial histories and obscure facts circulating.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it was very bizarre.</p><p></p><p>For example, an unofficial history claimed the Lord of Black Magic Abyss had homosexual tendencies and took a liking to his disciple Zi Yuan Zu, wanting to engage in public acts with Zi Yuan Zu, but Zu refused.</p><p></p><p>And an obscure fact claimed Zi Yuan Zu fell in love with his master's wife, coveted her, drugged her, and only realized after waking up that he had slept with the wrong person - he had slept with the Lord of Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu's expression was complex as long-buried memories surged: "It's nothing more than our paths not aligning, so we can't work together.</p><p></p><p>These are small matters. If I can't even decide your marriage, then there's no point in staying in this Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention..."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Zi Yuan Zu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say marriage should be free? What business is your wedding to them? If they want to meddle, they can stay away from my Purple Fate Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yuan Zu had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had been too weak, always yielding.</p><p></p><p>So in Black Magic Abyss, he was always the one to suffer losses and hardships.</p><p></p><p>The benefits never fell to him.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This time, seeking help from the Lord of the Black Magic Abyss had already broken the last thread in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had extinguished all personal connections. </p><p></p><p>From now on, they would remain strangers until death! At worst, he would become the second Demon Luo clan!</p><p></p><p>"Old man, you're right!" Qi Yuan nodded seriously. Thinking of something, he asked, "Old man, do you have any Black Magic Ancestral Blood? I'm in great need!"</p><p></p><p>After reaching the eleventh level of the "Ancestral Blood Scripture", Qi Yuan had been busy attending the Ultimate Principle Dao Conference, and this technique had stagnated.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very focused on cultivating the "Ancestral Blood Scripture".</p><p></p><p>After all, this technique could enhance his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, his Ten Thousand Dao Martial God level was comparable to Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>With the Linyaè›» approaching, he needed to improve his strength in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Offensive magical treasures, supreme ultimate principles, the "Ancestral Blood Scripture" - all needed to be prioritized.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you're lucky, kid. I happen to have some on hand. It's your lucky day." </p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Ancestor Ziyuan dropped a bottle of Black Magic Ancestral Blood into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he actually felt quite pained.</p><p></p><p>After all, Black Magic Ancestral Blood was a rare item even for him.</p><p></p><p>He was reluctant to use even a single drop himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't dare to cultivate it now, because if he did, the Root Demon Tribulation would descend, and he might not be able to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan took the Black Magic Ancestral Blood and said happily, "You're not bad, old man. After you die, do you want me to find you a job?"</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Ancestor Ziyuan cursed.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, Ancestor Ziyuan said, his voice tinged with worry: "Do you have a grudge with the Tai Huang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, what's the matter?" Qi Yuan didn't hide it.</p><p></p><p>Since Sister Niujiao knew about this, it was normal for Ancestor Ziyuan to know as well.</p><p></p><p>"I just received news that the Linya è›» this time will be presided over by the Tai Huang Palace. It's not false information.</p><p></p><p>This news has been confirmed by several Supreme Venerables."</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Ziyuan's voice was low.</p><p></p><p>What this matter represented behind the scenes was very frightening.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit tricky." Qi Yuan's expression also became serious.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, presiding over the Linya è›» is a killing move, especially for us Great Ultimate Principle cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If we are unwilling to participate, they can even manipulate the Star Realm to trigger our Root Demon Tribulation." Ancestor Ziyuan mentioned, his face not looking very good.</p><p></p><p>In previous Linya è›», if Great Ultimate Principle cultivators were unwilling to participate, the Root Demon Tribulation would also descend.</p><p></p><p>But in the past, it was presided over by the Only Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Only Palace was located in the Seventh Heaven and didn't know much about the affairs of the Sixth Heaven. It also couldn't arbitrarily trigger the Root Demon Tribulation of other Great Ultimate Principle cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Those Great Ultimate Principle cultivators also had ways to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>As long as they perfectly avoided the rules, the Only Palace couldn't do anything to them.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, according to the understanding on Blue Star, the Only Palace was "rule of law", following rules, with an AI presiding over the Linya è›».</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Tai Huang Palace presiding, it has become "rule of man".</p><p></p><p>Rule of man can follow the law, but can also be lenient, strict, or even create new laws, or give special treatment.</p><p></p><p>If targeted by the Tai Huang Palace, one would have to eat a "yang" fist.</p><p></p><p>So, the Moon God Palace was not in a very good state now.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan only felt that the Tai Huang Palace was powerful, but he wasn't afraid.</p><p></p><p>On Gong Star, he had even entered the Root Demon Sea. He wasn't afraid of a small Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"So, after marrying the Moon Lady, don't get too involved with the Moon God Palace. During this time, it's best not to step into the Yang God realm. If you don't enter Yang God, the Linya è›» is far from you." Ancestor Ziyuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Linya è›» only targets Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>As long as Blood Robe doesn't enter Yang God, there's no worry.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm far from Yang God!" Qi Yuan was only at the Purple Palace stage, indeed far from Yang God.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of something, Qi Yuan pondered: "Will my marriage to the Moon Lady drag you down? Like, will the Tai Huang Palace give you a Root Demon Tribulation or something?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, for such a small matter, the Tai Huang Palace won't care.</p><p></p><p>Even if they preside over the Linya è›», they still have to follow the rules on the surface. If they don't follow the rules, would the other Supreme Venerables agree to let them act recklessly? As long as you don't kill that person's father, or jump in his face in front of him, there won't be any problems! Moreover, I, Ancestor Ziyuan, am not easy to bully!"</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Ziyuan said domineering.</p><p></p><p>Every Great Ultimate Principle cultivator has their own pride.</p><p></p><p>That person from the Tai Huang Palace indeed has the strength to kill him, but he's not a pushover to be manipulated at will.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had never met the father of that person from the Tai Huang Palace. He had only destroyed his Three Thousand Realms and ruined his Three Thousand Past Lives.</p><p></p><p>Not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>"You kid, hurry back. Your disappearance has made Ziyuan Daxue feel very guilty. She said she shouldn't have brought out the Black Cloud Blood Cavalry, shouldn't have sworn to the heavens, otherwise you wouldn't have suffered this calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Ziyuan waved his hand and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Niujiao would also be sad for me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan found it strange and decided to go take a look.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a bit speechless seeing Sister Niujiao crying while eating hotpot.</p><p></p><p>He saw Sister Niujiao open her mouth, spitting mushrooms into the hotpot.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the ingredients came from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, Blood Robe, I knew you were fine.</p><p></p><p>You're still alive, come, eat some mushrooms!"</p><p></p><p>PS: The author has something to say and there are red envelopes! PS: I dare to ask for monthly tickets. Um... reorganizing, May was completely messed up, June will have 8,000 words every day, if not completed, I'll give out red envelopes at the end of the month!</p><p></p><p>Um, to apologize for the updates in May, I'll give out some Alipay password red envelopes. Please accept the author's apology.</p><p></p><p>This time I'll give out more, but with more people, the amount received will be smaller, please don't mind!</p><p></p><p>The password is [Golden Core is a star].</p><p></p><p>Note, it's an Alipay red envelope!</p><p></p><p>900 red envelopes, should be enough, right?</p><p></p><p>Don't spread it around!</p><p></p><p>Finally, asking for monthly tickets!</p><p></p><p>Asking for monthly tickets!</p><p></p><p>PS: More than half of the 900 red envelopes were leaked and claimed by people. I'll give out a new small one, don't leak it, change the password to [Star is a Golden Core]. The amount will be smaller, giving out less at a time!</p><p></p><p>Don't leak it this time!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Clad in a dragon robe, the Fifth Extraordinary Dragon Soared and Strode with majestic bearing.</p><p></p><p>His hair and beard were jet-black, his skin ruddy and full, appearing from afar like a burning flame, his vital spirit vigorous and flourishing.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, one would find that the stern gaze in his eyes had already taken on an aged hue.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The four divine-level Imperial Guards present all lowered their noble heads.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary was the Emperor of the Rakshasa Kingdom, the sun of the common people.</p><p></p><p>He was also the strongest divine-level Imperial Guard in the Rakshasa Kingdom at present.</p><p></p><p>"Rise." The Fifth Extraordinary waved his sleeve, exuding the majestic aura befitting a ruler.</p><p></p><p>He had long secluded himself in cultivation, neglecting state affairs.</p><p></p><p>Yet the power remained firmly in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Divine Arrival has just slain the Dao Demon. Your Majesty's body of myriad gold, if you were to engage him directly, there is a risk of harming the Dragon Body." At this time, the Prince of Ding Yuan cautiously advised.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his true intention was naturally to hope that Your Majesty would deal with Divine Arrival, while he would stand by and cheer.</p><p></p><p>But he had to pretend to advise.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also wanted to know just what confidence Your Majesty had.</p><p></p><p>A sharp gleam flashed in the Fifth Extraordinary's eyes: "This Divine Arrival is merely a trifle. That I was unable to personally subdue him a century ago is a regret in my heart. This time, I shall go in person!"</p><p></p><p>The divine-level Imperial Guards present all hastily showered him with praise.</p><p></p><p>But in their hearts, they were unimpressed.</p><p></p><p>This Fifth Extraordinary was just someone who cared too much about his face.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary continued, "I have learned from an extraterrestrial visitor that my Rakshasa Kingdom shall endure for a thousand ages, from the first generation to the second, and up to ten thousand generations.</p><p></p><p>As for the occasionally resurrecting Divine Arrival, he is but a fleeting glimmer of a firefly."</p><p></p><p>He had already colluded with the extraterrestrial visitor a century ago, hastening the downfall of Divine Arrival.</p><p></p><p>The extraterrestrial visitor had a book in his possession, named the "Blue Mountain Scripture".</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary referred to it as the Book of Prophecy.</p><p></p><p>The "Blue Mountain Scripture" had once recorded that Divine Arrival would resurrect, but his glory would be but a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not tell these divine-level Imperial Guards these things.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the four divine-level Imperial Guards before him exchanging glances, seemingly hesitant.</p><p></p><p>A disdainful look flashed in the depths of the Fifth Extraordinary's eyes: "A century ago, Divine Arrival was defeated by the encirclement of the gods, but in truth, he was defeated by the Dark Radiance.</p><p></p><p>It is a certain thing that specializes in contaminating divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Any divine artifact that comes into contact with it will be tainted, its divine power lost, reduced to a mundane object."</p><p></p><p>As the Fifth Extraordinary spoke, a droplet-like liquid appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Azure, translucent, emanating a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this droplet, the four divine-level Imperial Guards looked at it with trepidation, all stepping back a bit.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dark Radiance only affected divine artifacts, they all had ordinary divine artifacts for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>If their divine artifacts were tainted, their combat power would plummet greatly.</p><p></p><p>They had long suspected the reason for Divine Arrival's downfall, and now, seeing the Dark Radiance, everything became clear.</p><p></p><p>"Divine artifacts... even the national divine artifacts, they should be used by me. If they are not used by me, they shall be severed!" The Fifth Extraordinary's voice boomed.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the divine-level Imperial Guards present tightened, they knew that these words of the Fifth Extraordinary also contained a warning to them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Fifth Extraordinary had neglected state affairs for so many years, and they, the divine-level Imperial Guards, had made some small moves.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing the Fifth Extraordinary's admonishment,</p><p></p><p>these divine-level Imperial Guards understood that they had to make some concessions.</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Ding Yuan hurriedly bowed his head, a look of guilt on his face: "This time, I retreated without a fight in Ding Bo State, a crime worthy of a thousand deaths. I am willing to offer the 'Chaotic Heaven Secret Classics'."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary nodded.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder spoke in a hoarse voice: "I have been secretly imprisoning and draining the livers of 120,000 commoners in Xian Yun State over the past ten years, in order to cultivate the Wood Life Technique to prolong my life. I have wronged the commoners, and I have wronged Your Majesty. I offer the Wood Life Technique and the Myriad Liver Pill."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Extraordinary's eyes revealed a look of satisfaction: "You have not wronged the commoners under my rule, you have only wronged me. Your transgressions, I forgive."</p><p></p><p>Power is only responsible to the source of power.</p><p></p><p>In this world, where is the offense against the commoners known to the superior, and the superior takes the blame? Even if the blame is known, it is because the previous matter has involved the interests of the superior.</p><p></p><p>The majority are only punished for offending the superior, not the commoners.</p><p></p><p>The others also confessed their mistakes one by one, handing over their benefits.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This time, I shall travel through all twelve states."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>To play the role of Divine Arrival, he needed to travel through the land, so that all the commoners would know he had returned.</p><p></p><p>This way, the degree of his impersonation would rise rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he would slay any obstacles with his own power.</p><p></p><p>The impersonation of Divine Arrival should be about complete.</p><p></p><p>Huan Sha the Old Matron looked at the young man before her with awe in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This old one wishes to accompany the Young Master in traversing the vast lands of the Rakshasa Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan had slain the Dao Demon last time, Huan Sha the Old Matron hurriedly followed him, beginning to serve Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In her eyes, Divine Arrival had not yet fully resurrected, still in hibernation, so Qi Yuan was temporarily in control, able to unleash his terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>However, since Qi Yuan was in control of Divine Arrival, he was the master of the Judgment Hall, the existence she needed to serve.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged, looking through the carriage at the vast Xian Long Prefecture, and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless voices entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they entered the ears of Divine Arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Oh God, please save my poor child!"</p><p></p><p>"I've already given birth to three daughters, when will I be able to have a son!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if the God of Judgment really returns, how am I going to make money!"</p><p></p><p>"Die, die, all of you die, I'm not doing well, you shouldn't be doing well either."</p><p></p><p>"I hope everyone can love each other and work hard, and there will be rewards."</p><p></p><p>"What bullshit God of Judgment, how could he possibly resurrect, it must be those troublemakers spreading rumors!"</p><p></p><p>"Help, God, save me." A woman was being violated and cried for help, drawing more people to join.</p><p></p><p>Voices of all kinds flowed endlessly, entering Qi Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>These were filled with the evil and distortions of human nature, but also the various truths and beauties.</p><p></p><p>Through these voices, he also saw a mother embracing a frail daughter.</p><p></p><p>The girl was on the verge of death, her ragged clothes revealing much of her skin.</p><p></p><p>On the exposed skin were various ulcers and boils, causing revulsion and fear.</p><p></p><p>But her mother still held her tightly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light flashed.</p><p></p><p>The boils and ulcers on the frail girl's body disappeared without a trace, her rough skin now unblemished.</p><p></p><p>The mother's face revealed a look of joyful surprise as she immediately knelt and kowtowed: "God!"</p><p></p><p>Sadly, the response she received was only a cold and majestic divine voice: "You need not kneel before me."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the hideous men and the women who had abetted them suddenly died as a divine light flashed through them.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, a complex expression appeared in Qi Yuan's eyes: "It seems I am not a qualified Arbiter.</p><p></p><p>If Divine Arrival were here, they would not have deserved death."</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan still consumed divine power to slay those people.</p><p></p><p>According to Chen Kang Bao's words, the young master was kind-hearted and could not bear to see such things.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, after Qi Yuan's display of miracles, responding to hundreds of prayers, more and more people in Xian Long Prefecture were looking up at the sky or with reverent expressions.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, an ever-increasing number of people took to the streets.</p><p></p><p>They were old and young, all walking towards...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were people of all ages. </p><p></p><p>There were minor officials, shop assistants, night escorts, weaving maidens, farmers - all kinds of professions.</p><p></p><p>They were dressed in either tattered cloth or fine silk and satin.</p><p></p><p>They gathered together. Their expressions were devout and solemn, chanting "The Deity has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>A sea of people, densely packed, gathered together, enough to intimidate everyone and make some tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>If they were to unite, with one heart, in this low-magic and soulless world, they would be enough to make the rulers tremble.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan watched this scene, his heart calm, not stirring up too many waves.</p><p></p><p>However, since he was to play the role of the arriving Deity,</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>The divine miracle shall manifest!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it began raining in the Xiyuan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This rain, like sun showers, starlight rain, was like fireflies, falling upon all the commoners on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Many had bewildered expressions, which then quickly turned to fervent, shocked, and joyful.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Deity's blessing!"</p><p>"The Deity's blessing!"</p><p></p><p>Many commoners extended their palms to catch these starlight raindrops, or opened their mouths.</p><p> </p><p>The water droplets landed on their bodies and instantly vanished, nourishing and invigorating them.</p><p></p><p>Countless people were fervently overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>In this moment, the commoners' trust in the Arriving Deity reached a peak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's performance was also steadily rising.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan perceived this scene, his mood calm: "We... should be going, the next stop is Cuixian Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, hurry up!"</p><p>"Alas, this old body of mine can't move fast."</p><p>"Grandpa, why didn't you tell me that Qi Gege was the one controlling the Arriving Deity?"</p><p>"How could I reveal such a thing? Hehe, now that you know, isn't it a pleasant surprise?"</p><p>"I'm very happy, it's just that..."</p><p>"Just what?"</p><p>"The Judging Deity represents absolute fairness and justice. </p><p>Now that he is controlled by Qi Gege, does fairness and justice still exist?"</p><p>"Isn't he the one you all revere? How can you not trust him?"</p><p>"The him before, I trusted. But people can change.</p><p>Even if it were me, if I suddenly obtained the power of the Arriving Deity and became the mightiest in the world, I don't know how I would change.</p><p>Power is most alluring to the heart. I hope... Qi Gege does not wield the Arriving Deity."</p><p>"You speak so rashly and impertinently."</p><p>"I know, but the Judging Deity I believe in is one of fair and just judgment, not one controlled by a single person.</p><p>If Qi Gege were to kill me in a fit of rage, I would have no regrets!</p><p>I am willing to be the villain, and I also hope Qi Gege can adhere to his original heart... a little longer.</p><p>Without his original heart to oversee it, how can the power of the Arriving Deity be fair and just?"</p><p>"You..." Liu Sheng's gaze was complex. He truly didn't know how to advise this granddaughter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three months passed like flowing water.</p><p></p><p>The twelve prefectures of the Luosha Kingdom all bore the traces of the Arriving Deity.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, the Arriving Deity left divine miracles.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was slaying evil, healing the weak, upholding justice, or resolving injustices.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan truly achieved "Wherever there is injustice, summon me, the Arriving Deity."</p><p></p><p>The starlight rain formed by divine power also fell like rain, adding more vitality to this world.</p><p></p><p>All the commoners had devout, even fanatical expressions.</p><p></p><p>There were even some opportunistic types who wanted to take advantage of this to incite the masses to overturn the existing order and become the new exploitative class.</p><p></p><p>But all of this was stopped by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was playing the role of the Arriving Deity, but he didn't want to become an AI trapped in one place.</p><p></p><p>Although, by rights, his departure could be considered "fulfilling a long-held wish, entrusting it to the flowing river", but "there will be others to continue the new chapter."</p><p></p><p>For now, he was doing his best to play the role of the Arriving Deity.</p><p></p><p>As for what happens next, that can be dealt with later.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, there were also some clever and resourceful commoners who discovered Qi Yuan's carriage and spontaneously followed, becoming more and more numerous.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Qi Yuan reflective.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt he was law-abiding and good-natured, he was still far from being a "hero", after all, he was selfish despite being law-abiding, loved beauty despite not being reckless, and was socially anxious but impulsive in his actions.</p><p></p><p>The responsibilities of the Arriving Deity were beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Later, no more commoners followed his carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Ahead... is the capital of the Luosha Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The old Huan Sha looked at the majestic city walls ahead, her eyes revealing deep memories.</p><p></p><p>It was in this very city that she had once drawn her sword and slain the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>This city held many of her sorrows.</p><p></p><p>"This is the most prosperous and brilliant place in the Luosha Kingdom, but also the darkest and most sinister."</p><p></p><p>The old Huan Sha's voice was a bit hoarse.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked ahead at the capital, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the old Huan Sha was right.</p><p></p><p>The capital was indeed different from other places.</p><p></p><p>For example, in other prefectures, whenever it was known that the Arriving Deity was about to arrive, there would be many commoners gathered at the city walls every day.</p><p></p><p>But at the capital's city walls, there was no one.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the officials obstructing them or the commoners being fearful, Qi Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>As an existence like an AI, the Arriving Deity had no anger.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was a game player, merely enjoying the game process, indifferent to these matters.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, enter the capital and kill the old emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>He had killed many people before.</p><p></p><p>Powerful overlords of a domain, evil extraterrestrial devouring life, solar deities consuming primordial worlds - but he had never killed a real emperor.</p><p></p><p>As a Blue Star person, how could he not have a rebellious spirit?</p><p></p><p>If he didn't kill an emperor in this game, how could he call himself a true player?</p><p></p><p>In mythical legends, the Great Sage openly rebelled, the Second Heavenly King rebelled in secret, and Nezha helped whichever side.</p><p></p><p>These deities had now become Qi Yuan's divine infants, so it would be strange if Qi Yuan didn't have a rebellious spirit.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a group of riders in brocade robes came galloping towards them.</p><p></p><p>The leader wore a gold-threaded gray robe, without a beard, his face bearing a haughty and arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these people and saw no fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but recall that even the most useless emperor would have a group of loyal retainers.</p><p></p><p>Nurture soldiers for a thousand days, use them in a moment.</p><p></p><p>The horses stopped, and the middle-aged man in the gray robe spoke, his eyes bearing an aura of authority.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you the Qi Yuan, the young master who wields the Arriving Deity?"</p><p></p><p>"What does the old emperor want with my young master?" Chen Kang poked his head out, full of curiosity. "Wanting to surrender?"</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" The middle-aged man in the gray robe rebuked loudly, then continued, "Qi Yuan, you have defied the law and disrespected royal authority. Now go to the palace and offer the Arriving Deity to His Majesty, and you shall be spared execution!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this scene, his gaze calm: "Alright, I get it, I'm tired of wasting words with you NPCs."</p><p></p><p>He decided that he would just kill the old emperor without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Not giving these NPCs too much dialogue.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

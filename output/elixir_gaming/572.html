        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the border had already turned into a battlefield, with massive war machines facing off against each other.</p><p></p><p>Each war machine was imprinted with a corresponding military formation, containing a large number of Transcendent Realm cultivators and even Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze fell on one of the war machines, which had 1,888 Sovereign Realm experts stationed within.</p><p></p><p>Nearly two thousand Sovereign Realm experts, working together to drive the war machine, had their powers seamlessly fused together. After being further amplified by the military formation, a single strike from this machine could make even ordinary Grand Ancestor Realm experts take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a war machine capable of accommodating nearly two thousand Sovereign Realm experts was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>The powers of each Sovereign Realm expert were different, and to instantly fuse so many forces together, and then further empower them, was an exceptionally difficult task.</p><p></p><p>"This is the strength of the Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. In the Chaotic Void, the strong reigned supreme, and even with so many Sovereign Realm experts, they could not threaten the Chaotic Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Realm experts facing the Chaotic Realm would be utterly crushed, and their numbers would be completely meaningless.</p><p></p><p>But in this Source World, by relying on the power of the war machines, even the weak could play a role, and quantitative changes could lead to qualitative transformations.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Ancient Nation possesses even stronger war machines, capable of accommodating multiple Grand Ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Each Grand Ancestor had already evolved their own unique power from the Chaotic Realm, and to fuse different Chaotic exclusive powers into one would be an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, war machines capable of accommodating multiple Grand Ancestors were essentially the foundation of the great ancient nations, and were powerful tools used to contend with Celestial Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>According to the current intensity of the impending war between the Purple Dream Domain and the Azure Flame Domain, it was far from reaching the level where such high-level war machines would be deployed.</p><p></p><p>There would not be more than ten war machines capable of accommodating Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The two ancient nation emperors would not easily unleash such a fierce level of war.</p><p></p><p>After all, a full-scale war between the two great ancient nations would attract the attention of the Progenitors, and if they lost, it would be difficult to explain themselves to the Progenitors.</p><p></p><p>"If I have the chance, I should try to get my hands on a war machine and study it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the war machines facing off, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, the war machines were just vessels, and the military formations imprinted on them were the key to their effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>These military formations were the closely guarded secrets of the great ancient nations. Even in the midst of war, if a nation's own war machine fell into the enemy's hands, it would be immediately self-destructed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan had almost no chance of obtaining an enemy ancient nation's war machine.</p><p></p><p>But while the enemy's war machines were out of reach, he could still try to get his hands on the war machines of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could comprehend the military formations imprinted on the war machines, Lin Yuan would have a chance to replicate them in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>In that case, human civilization would gain access to such profound foundations.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to have sensed something and looked towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>He saw figures appearing in the Purple Dream Domain, all of them Grand Ancestor Realm existences.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Dream, the Spiritual Might King has initiated the war. Isn't he worried about the consequences of defeat?" The Azure Flame Marquis began to communicate with the other side.</p><p></p><p>This war centered around the Purple Dream Domain and the Azure Flame Domain, involving dozens of surrounding major domains, and it was entirely the Spiritual Might King's initiative.</p><p></p><p>"That's none of your concern. You should be more worried about whether you can protect the Azure Flame Domain," the Purple Dream Marquis replied without backing down.</p><p></p><p>The various Grand Ancestors present were coldly observing, waiting for their future opponents.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Grand Ancestors who had appeared were the publicly known ones from both sides. As for their true trump cards, they naturally would not reveal them yet, waiting for the critical moment to use them.</p><p></p><p>But even if they were not the true trump cards, making preliminary contact could still be beneficial.</p><p></p><p>After all, both the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation and the enemy ancient nations had Grand Ancestors skilled in intelligence gathering. Perhaps they could uncover some crucial information.</p><p></p><p>"There are five peak Grand Ancestor Realm experts," Lin Yuan observed. On the Purple Dream Domain side, among the nearly twenty Grand Ancestors, the auras of five of them were particularly prominent, almost not inferior to the Azure Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the Azure Flame Marquis and the other Grand Ancestors returned to the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Ancestors from the Purple Dream Domain did the same, and the two sides were quite coordinated, not even engaging in combat, only confronting each other briefly before returning.</p><p></p><p>Inside the city lord's mansion, the eighteen Grand Ancestors sat down.</p><p></p><p>"What do you all think?" the Azure Flame Marquis said, "Once the war starts, do we have the confidence to deal with it?"</p><p></p><p>Through the brief contact just now, each Grand Ancestor must have formed their own opinions.</p><p></p><p>"If the forces deployed by the Purple Dream Domain are only this much, then our chances of victory in the upcoming battle are quite high," the Red Leaf Grand Ancestor spoke.</p><p></p><p>The other Grand Ancestors present mostly agreed with this assessment.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the number of Grand Ancestors, the two sides were roughly equal, and if they went all-out, it was likely to result in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>And a stalemate would be a victory for the Azure Flame Domain.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Might King dares to initiate the war, so he must be confident of victory. What we're seeing now is certainly not the full extent of the enemy's capabilities," another Grand Ancestor said, his tone not optimistic.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Flame Marquis nodded, as this was also his concern.</p><p></p><p>"What I'm most worried about is the Spiritual Might King's brother."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Flame Marquis voiced his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Might King's brother?" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Ancestors' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even the Red Leaf Grand Ancestor furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King was from the imperial lineage, and his brother, naturally also from the imperial lineage, had reached the level of the core imperial clan at a very early stage.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that he did not have the ambition to become the emperor, instead immersing himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not every ancient nation imperial clan member wanted to become the emperor.</p><p></p><p>"If the Spiritual Might King summons his brother, that would be difficult to deal with," the Red Leaf Grand Ancestor frowned.</p><p></p><p>As a core imperial clan member, his combat power could usually sweep away opponents at the same level.</p><p></p><p>And the Spiritual Might King's brother was a Grand Ancestor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>If such a powerful expert took action, unless the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation also deployed a core imperial clan Grand Ancestor, or directly mobilized a Celestial Sovereign Realm expert, it would be difficult to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Might King's brother is a core imperial clan Grand Ancestor, so he shouldn't act rashly," another Grand Ancestor said. A core imperial clan Grand Ancestor, although not a Celestial Sovereign, was not far off in strength. Deploying an expert of this level could potentially escalate the war to an even more intense degree.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, we still need to prevent the worst-case scenario from happening," the Azure Flame Marquis did not let his guard down and planned to seek aid from the 'Crimson Pine King'.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Pine King was the imperial clan king leading the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation in this war.</p><p></p><p>Among the Grand Ancestors present, the Azure Flame Marquis was certainly the one most unwilling to lose. If the Azure Flame Domain fell, the foundations he had built over the years would be gone.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation would again grant him a domain, he would have to start from scratch, and the cost would be immense.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, in the 'Tear of the Stars' fragment world, within a manor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared, looking at Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan, why are you here?" Mother Lu Qiong turned and exclaimed in surprise, "Now you are a legend in human civilization. Even if the nine Strongest Ones were combined, they would not be your match."</p><p></p><p>After migrating to the new homeland, Lin Yuan's prestige in human civilization had reached an unimaginable height.</p><p></p><p>He even began to constantly feel the 'power of faith' converging towards him.</p><p></p><p>The countless citizens of the entire human civilization had begun to fervently worship Lin Yuan, giving rise to a massive power of faith.</p><p></p><p>With this power of faith, Lin Yuan could completely walk the path of becoming a god through faith.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, there were many who had crossed into the Transcendent Realm or even the Sovereign Realm through this path of the Twelve Stages.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the power of the masses, the cultivation speed would be terrifyingly fast, and they would hardly encounter any bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>Of course, success or failure depended on the masses, and so far, no one had ascended to the Chaotic Sovereign Realm through this path.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao that Lin Yuan had opened up had limitless potential, so naturally he would not abandon the great dao to absorb the power of faith, thereby cutting off his own future.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, even if he walked the path of faith, it might not necessarily be a dead end, but there was no need for him to do so.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating and evolving was an extremely pure personal matter. Absorbing the faith of the masses would be akin to actively polluting the path he walked, and it would become increasingly difficult as he progressed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's dissemination of the path of evolution was not to harvest the masses, but to use them as anchors to prevent himself from becoming lost and falling.</p><p></p><p>The principles of the two were fundamentally different.</p><p></p><p>"Have you been cultivating the evolutionary path I gave you?" Lin Yuan asked his parents after some casual conversation.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary path he mentioned was the one he had completely based on the various conditions of his parents.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way, as his parents' innate talents for evolution were not good enough. Even with the help of evolutionary elixirs and longevity pills, they could continue living.</p><p></p><p>But the decline and distortion of their mental will was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>In the era of the universe, those special life forms that were complete Eleventh Stages since the dawn of the universe, theoretically had extremely long lifespans, and could even live from the birth of the universe to its destruction.</p><p></p><p>But why did they all slow down their own time flow, where a thousand or ten thousand years would pass in the outside world, but only a moment for them? It was because living for too long would lead to the distortion of their mental will. Without sufficient mental state, even if they had incorruptible bodies and souls, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was precisely worried that this would happen to his parents.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His parents ended up in this situation, and with his strength, he could revive his parents countless times, but his spiritual will was twisted, and revival alone could not solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan, your father and I have been cultivating recently," Lu Qiong heard this and immediately became interested. "I don't know why, but the evolutionary paths you gave us are so easy and simple to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng next to her also revealed a rare smile.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was the case.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when they were in the universe, they had tried many evolutionary paths, but all of them felt extremely difficult and obscure.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>How could it not be easy and simple? The two evolutionary paths Lin Yuan provided for his parents were completely tailored, which was much more painstaking than the nine evolutionary paths reserved for the nine supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"No matter when, you must remember to cultivate," Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Evolution is the only way for life to achieve immortality."</p><p></p><p>He did not want his parents to reach the point of spiritual distortion.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely, son," Lin Shoucheng immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Now I am full of motivation for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>In the past, his cultivation was arduous, so naturally he had no interest in it. But now? Cultivating the evolutionary paths given by Lin Yuan, he felt like an innate genius, so his motivation was naturally abundant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also smiled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Xuanyuan and the others are looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and while chatting with his parents, a manifestation coalesced in front of the supreme beings like Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River," the supreme beings Xuanyuan and Xia Qin greeted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Look, I've brewed some fine wine," Xuanyuan immediately pushed a wine glass in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The taste is not bad," Lin Yuan carefully tasted it and praised.</p><p></p><p>In terms of nourishing the physical body and soul, Xuanyuan's brewed wine was generally average, after all, there were too many heavenly-effect wines and spirit liquors in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But the taste was unique.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's a pity that Guli and Xushen can't taste this fine wine," Xia Qin also drank it with relish.</p><p></p><p>Guli and Xushen, the supreme beings, had voluntarily 'scattered the Dao' and cultivated the martial art path given to them by Lin Yuan, more than a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Before they recovered to the Twelfth Realm, their full energy was likely focused on cultivation, and they had no time to appreciate any fine wine.</p><p></p><p>This was not because they sensed any danger, but because they were originally at the Twelfth Realm, and after 'scattering the Dao', their strength had fallen, so they would naturally feel a sense of gap and would not want to appear in front of other supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Xushen and Guli are probably about to emerge from seclusion," Lin Yuan, as the master of the Star Tear 'Fragmented World', could clearly sense the cultivation progress of the two supreme beings through a single thought.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years of time, the two supreme beings had already re-cultivated to the Tenth Realm. Since it was a re-cultivation, there was no ultimate leap, as long as they reached the peak of the Eleventh Realm, they could directly cross into the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Guli and Xushen could cultivate so fast was naturally because they were re-cultivating, and they were re-cultivating in the Dao-severing realm, so the initial realms of one, two, and three were naturally not difficult for them.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the martial art path they followed was specially perfected by Lin Yuan for them, although the heart blood he paid was not as much as the two evolutionary paths he gave to his parents, but it was completely sufficient for the two supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"About to emerge from seclusion?" Xuanyuan and Xia Qin heard this and their hearts were filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Guli and Xushen returning to the Twelfth Realm after emerging from seclusion meant that there would be two more supreme beings cultivating the martial art path.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his mood was also good.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, Guli and Xushen, the two supreme beings, would be the first to cross into the Twelfth Realm among the many martial art evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of two Twelfth Realm martial art paths was also a kind of special blessing for Lin Yuan, the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, through the dissemination of the Myriad Dao Pavilion, the thousand-plus martial art evolutionary paths had been passed down in many void domains.</p><p></p><p>But among all the martial cultivators, they were still far from the Twelfth Realm, after all, they did not have the treatment of the nine supreme beings, and the martial art paths they cultivated required constant experimentation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan's mind suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>"The avatar in the Source World has already crossed into the Sovereign Realm without any accidents."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face, "Then I'll directly cross into the Sovereign Realm as well."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the true body located in the depths of the Star Tear 'Fragmented World' disappeared silently and appeared in the vast chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic qi drifted.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing into the Sovereign Realm in the chaotic void is different from crossing into the Sovereign Realm in the Source World," Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, quickly thinking.</p><p></p><p>The main difference was the internal universe in the body.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had both cultivated the first layer of the 'Infinite Void', the scale of the internal universe in the Source World's body was not as large as the internal universe in the chaotic void body.</p><p></p><p>After all, the former did not have the Chaotic Tree, a top-tier rare treasure, rooted in it.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the latter had also experienced three infusions of the chaotic void's origin.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the breakthrough, the transformation that the internal universe of the chaotic void flesh body needed to undergo would be much greater than that of the Source World's body.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin," Lin Yuan thought for a moment and immediately released the suppression on the various aspects of the flesh body, soul, and internal universe.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the first thing to start transforming was the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling! The original 3,333,333 light-year internal universe, which was almost in a state of expansion stagnation, immediately began to expand frantically again as Lin Yuan started the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"My internal universe, after enduring three infusions of the chaotic void's origin, combined with the value of the Chaotic Tree and the cultivation of the first layer of the 'Infinite Void', must require a large amount of energy to support the breakthrough," Lin Yuan glanced around, where endless chaotic qi drifted, and although it was not pure, the internal universe did not care, as long as it could absorb and devour it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan's internal universe was plunging into frantic expansion again, it immediately caught the attention of many powerful beings. Lin Yuan's internal universe was home to dozens of Twelfth Realm alien races from the time when he was in the universe.</p><p></p><p>These Twelfth Realm alien races had completely submitted to Lin Yuan and had been waiting in the internal universe, awaiting Lin Yuan's orders.</p><p></p><p>"The internal universe of the Silver River Supreme Being is expanding greatly again?" </p><p></p><p>"How many times has this happened now?"</p><p></p><p>"Even for the legendary Chaotic Sovereign, their internal universe shouldn't have such a huge pressure, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Silver River Supreme Being is too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of Twelfth Realm alien races trembled in their hearts, especially many of them who had once wanted to ambush the Silver River Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Billions of light-years away, a silver spaceship was speeding through.</p><p></p><p>On the bow of the silver spaceship stood several figures.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow junior disciples, the chaotic void is full of dangers, but with me here, you can rest assured. This flying ship treasure is at the peak of the Sovereign Realm, enough to safely take you to your destination," said the leading figure, a man with a black beard, with a self-satisfied expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void was indeed full of dangers, but that was for ordinary Dao-severing cultivators. For him, a Sovereign Realm expert commanding a peak Sovereign Realm secret treasure, the black spaceship, naturally there was no danger.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is so powerful," the junior disciples behind him immediately said, the silver spaceship emanating a heavy aura, giving them a strong sense of security.</p><p></p><p>"But senior brother, haven't you noticed that the chaotic qi around us has become a bit sparse?" one of the junior disciples couldn't help but say, unlike the black-bearded man, he had been carefully observing the many changes around them.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic qi has become sparse?" the black-bearded man was slightly taken aback, and after careful inspection, he also discovered this change.</p><p></p><p>"Why has it become sparse?" the black-bearded man followed the direction of the drifting chaotic qi and vaguely discovered that all the chaotic qi was rushing towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"This is?" the black-bearded man's expression changed slightly, with his Sovereign Realm's vast perception, he vaguely discovered that it was not only the chaotic qi in this area, but the chaotic qi within a radius of millions or even tens of millions of light-years, was like this.</p><p></p><p>As if at the source of all the chaotic qi, there existed a monstrous chaotic behemoth that was devouring the endless chaotic qi without any restraint.</p><p></p><p>"Not good," the black-bearded man's expression changed drastically, without hesitation, he activated the silver galactic spaceship and frantically fled in the opposite direction of the gathering chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>"Junior disciples, be prepared to perish," the black-bearded man's tone was extremely grave, with a hint of despair.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the junior disciples behind him were stunned, they looked around, but didn't find anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother," the junior disciples turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know why their senior brother said that, they were sure that they had encountered an inescapable danger.</p><p></p><p>But where did this danger come from?

        <h1>Chapter 572</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Zhili Assembly, the Supreme's aura was obscure, and his expression was indistinct.</p><p></p><p>"Linye's tribulation is both a calamity and a blessing."</p><p></p><p>"Within the Immortal Palace, disasters and misfortunes abound, yet there is also a thread of good fortune."</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Second Young Master can take another step forward."</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Unique Palace's control over Linye's tribulation and the construction of the nine layers of the Immortal Realm, the path pursued by the Zhili Assembly was to break through the second layer of the Yang God realm using the supreme Dao, and even reach the third or fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>But this path was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"With the talent of the Supreme Venerable, there may be a chance..." The Supreme of the Zhili Assembly had a somewhat hesitant expression, as if he had sensed something. There was a curious look in his eyes. "When he emerges from seclusion, he will go to the Immortal Palace, for he is a man of sentiment and righteousness.</p><p></p><p>However, the gates of the Immortal Palace are closed. Unless the Unique Palace issues a decree, no one can enter."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme of the Zhili Assembly murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Red Fortune."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Supreme of the Zhili Assembly spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man in a red robe came forward, bowing his head respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Red Fortune was a disciple of the Assembly Master.</p><p></p><p>However, this disciple's identity was special, as he was not a being of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But since he had entered the Immortal Realm and become a Yang God, it also meant that he could no longer leave the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he were to leave, he would be devoured by the unspeakable.</p><p></p><p>So, Red Fortune had always remained in the sixth layer of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple is here."</p><p></p><p>"Go to the place where the Immortal Palace opens and invite the Supreme Venerable to the Zhili Assembly to speak." The Assembly Master of the Zhili Assembly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Red Fortune bowed his head, carefully pondering his master's words.</p><p></p><p>Normally, this kind of invitation would not require a disciple like him to take action.</p><p></p><p>The Assembly Master of the Zhili Assembly could summon him across millions of miles with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the master had called him meant there must be a special meaning behind it.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, he roughly understood his master's intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple understands." Red Fortune said.</p><p></p><p>The master's intention might be to inform the Supreme Venerable about the situation in the sixth layer of the Immortal Realm and the other worlds.</p><p></p><p>And to have him convey it.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to his master, Red Fortune was filled with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that after all these years, the Immortal Realm would produce a genius like the Supreme Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how far he can go on this path of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Red Fortune sighed and stepped onto the teleportation array, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Qishan Fang market, people came and went.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen sat in the restaurant, drinking wine with an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei wore a tight-fitting white dress, with a large area of her chest exposed, and her skirt hugged her plump hips, exuding a charming aura. The surrounding cultivators whispered to each other, occasionally stealing glances at Lian Mei. Her bold and refreshing attire and aura were like that of a seductive fox spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Immortal Palace opened, there have been streams of light emerging every three months. I wonder what the harvest will be this time."</p><p></p><p>"This stream of light is only useful for us Purple Palace cultivators. Otherwise, where would we have the chance?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope to obtain the opportunities within the stream of light and advance further, entering the middle stage of the Purple Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder if there's a chance to enter the Immortal Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Are you looking for death? Even Yang Gods face the risk of falling when entering the Immortal Palace. You, a Purple Palace cultivator, are weaker than an ant before the Yang Gods. How dare you think of entering the Immortal Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen listened to the discussions around him, his expression calm. "Senior Sister Lian Mei, after I help you obtain a hundred streams of light this time, I will leave."</p><p></p><p>Originally, he owed Lian Mei many favors for helping him find cultivation techniques and send a letter to Yue NÃ¼jinli.</p><p></p><p>"You really are a dull person." Lian Mei rolled her eyes at Shen Wushen. "The friends you make are all a bunch of idiots."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't say that. How am I an idiot?" At this moment, a handsome man in a blood-red robe entered the restaurant and looked at Shen Wushen with a smile. "It's been a hundred years since we last met."</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei glanced at Qi Yuan and had a strange expression on her face. "Shen Wushen, you even have friends in the sixth layer of the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was shocked to see Qi Yuan, and his expression was a bit unnatural.</p><p></p><p>"Qi... Qi Ge, this is a friend I met in the Lower Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Lower Realm?" Lian Mei paused, her expression becoming more serious. "It seems he is a senior Yin God."</p><p></p><p>Those who wanted to ascend from the Lower Realm to the Immortal Realm needed to have Yin God cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei was from the Purple Palace, and although the scattered Yin God cultivators might not necessarily be superior to her, she still needed to show them the proper respect.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here? Searching for the streams of light?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen had helped him collect cultivation techniques and send a letter to Jinli, so he had provided a lot of assistance.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuan had sensed Shen Wushen's presence in the Qishan Fang market, he naturally came to see him.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so." Shen Wushen replied, feeling a bit constrained.</p><p></p><p>After all, the events that had occurred in the sixth layer of the Immortal Realm had given him many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Yuan's true identity and true strength, he had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>But... such a terrifying existence now appeared before him like an ordinary cultivator, conversing with him, making him feel as if he was in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"How did you come here? Is it for the Immortal Palace?" Shen Wushen asked.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei was taken aback. Shen Wushen's words were a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>What did he mean by "for the Immortal Palace"?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm preparing to enter the Immortal Palace and take a look." Qi Yuan answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei was no longer confused, covering her mouth and laughing. "Shidi, you see... your friend is also an idiot."</p><p></p><p>Only someone like the Sect Master of Futuoshan would have the chance to be summoned into the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Don't spread rumors, I'm not an idiot!" Qi Yuan said seriously. "I'm a handsome and charming man."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of idiots, he was reminded of Zhu Bajie.</p><p></p><p>He and Zhu Bajie were nothing alike.</p><p></p><p>The only similarity was that Zhu Bajie was the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King, and Qi Yuan was very handsome.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lian Mei's smile grew wider. "I guess the only kind of person willing to be Shen Wushen's friend would be someone like you."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen was aloof and single-minded. He didn't have many friends in Futuoshan.</p><p></p><p>The friends he did have were "all over the place."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you the same?" Qi Yuan rolled his eyes at Lian Mei. "Don't call me an idiot, or I'll give you a nickname."</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei laughed uncontrollably. "Come on, give me a nickname, Sister wants to hear it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought of the "Nose-Picking Sister."</p><p></p><p>But Lian Mei didn't pick her nose.</p><p></p><p>"Big Butt Sister!" Qi Yuan glanced at Lian Mei's plump hips.</p><p></p><p>Since he was giving a nickname, he might as well target her most prominent feature.</p><p></p><p>Like "Purple Destiny Big Snow Ox Horn Sister" or "Purple Destiny Little Exposed Pink Horn Miss."</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei heard this and laughed even more cheerfully. "Wushen Shidi, your friend is quite capable to have survived this long without being beaten to death."</p><p></p><p>If it were other female cultivators, they might have felt sexually harassed and tried to kill him.</p><p></p><p>But she was different. She actually liked this nickname, finding it quite unique.</p><p></p><p>"Why would he be beaten to death? If people just kill each other over a disagreement, the cultivation world's atmosphere is really terrible!" Qi Yuan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators should cultivate their inner peace, not their killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He laughed.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Shen Wushen remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Killing someone just because of a disagreement? It seems Qi Yuan has done more of that, right?</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation world's atmosphere is indeed not good, sigh, they are all so hypocritical." Lian Mei sighed, "I dress like this just to let them see, but the result is they can only stare."</p><p></p><p>As Lian Mei spoke, she puffed out her chest.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded in agreement: "Not only are they hypocritical, they often encounter bullying and tyrannical pseudo-gentlemen!"</p><p></p><p>"Heroes think alike, the cultivation world's atmosphere is not good." Lian Mei said coquettishly, not knowing if it was sincere or not.</p><p></p><p>"There is also no trust between people." Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei is a trustworthy woman, going out without covering up.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wushen, wait here for a while, I'll go to the Immortal Palace. If I encounter Liu Guang, I'll bring him back for you." Qi Yuan didn't waste any more words.</p><p></p><p>Just greeting Shen Wushen had already exhausted his energy.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was very socially anxious, and if he continued to have a meal, he would shatter.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you, Brother Qi!" Shen Wushen said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Lian Mei had a playful smile on her face as she watched Qi Yuan's disappearing figure, and said, "Your friend is quite interesting, apart from his boastfulness and eccentricity, he actually has some good points."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wushen didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a vast and profound voice suddenly rang out from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the market all walked out involuntarily, looking up at the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>"This is the illusion of the Immortal Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, why did the Immortal Palace suddenly appear?"</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In the distant place, the Alchemist Celestial Lord who was focused on the Immortal Palace also had a horrified expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Immortal Palace reappear?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days?"</p><p></p><p>"He dares to forcibly enter the Immortal Palace, how is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Palace's secrets are deep, even if the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days joins forces, they cannot open it. The Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days is courting death!"</p><p></p><p>"No, he actually dares to do it, could it be... that he has the confidence?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the starry sky, the projections of countless stars representing the Alchemist Celestials suddenly shone brightly, and the light fell into this place.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to see how the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days would enter the Immortal Palace! At the same time, the cultivators here were also dumbfounded, not knowing what was happening.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that a terrifying event was about to occur.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a gentle and humorous voice resounded through the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Palace, open up obediently!"</p><p></p><p>The illusion of the Immortal Palace in the sky began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Qi rose up, and multicolored brilliance overflowed, magnificent and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Various ancient and extraordinary auras were leaking out.</p><p></p><p>As if they came from the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun saw this scene, his eyes filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"The Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days' words... actually made the Immortal Palace appear!"</p><p></p><p>"How did he do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days has reached some kind of agreement with the Unique Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun could only think of this possibility.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days defeated the Taihuang Palace, and thus formed a connection with the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>So he was able to summon the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Not open? Then I'll forcibly enter!" In the sky, Qi Yuan looked at the gates of the Immortal Palace, his gaze calm, "Since you won't open, I'll force my way in!"</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly rushed towards the gates of the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Immortal Palace disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure also vanished without a trace at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The many Alchemist Celestials who were focused on this place were shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Did he... enter?"</p><p></p><p>"He entered the Immortal Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"He really entered!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days has really connected with the Unique Palace?"</p><p></p><p>This was the only explanation they could guess.</p><p></p><p>Other reasons would be too outrageous!...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Ziyuan Zu's eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Bai Long Yuanyu did not hesitate at all, his face covered with a veil, and his figure disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Where they left, the light fell, and all things withered and melted away.</p><p></p><p>When they reached a safe place, Ziyuan Zu heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"This Immortal Palace is different from the past, this eternal brilliant light can even resist the Great Truths." Ziyuan Zu was quite apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>In just a few decades in the Immortal Palace, he had encountered several crises.</p><p></p><p>Although the crises were not too serious, and he could easily avoid them with his strength.</p><p></p><p>But the crises were gradually becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>The eternal brilliant light, also became more and more.</p><p></p><p>"What is this eternal brilliant light... it seems to be able to corrode even the Great Truths, only the Great Truths can resist it to some extent." Ziyuan Zu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit like the primal chaos light when the world was not yet opened." Bai Long Yuanyu said.</p><p></p><p>Before the world was opened, the world had no rules, only chaos.</p><p></p><p>With the world, with living beings, there were also rules.</p><p></p><p>This eternal brilliant light seems to be antagonistic to the rules, able to corrode the rules.</p><p></p><p>Bai Long Yuanyu said, looking at Ziyuan Zu with a strange gaze: "Ziyuan Zu, compared to the past, your strength has improved a lot.</p><p></p><p>Last time the Taihuang Palace ambushed you, how did you get through the Root Demon Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Ziyuan Zu showed powerful strength in the Immortal Palace, stronger than the Third Echelon Great Truths.</p><p></p><p>The improvement in strength naturally came from overcoming the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>But according to Bai Long Yuanyu's understanding of Ziyuan Zu, last time's Root Demon Tribulation, he really didn't have a chance to get through.</p><p></p><p>Even if he miraculously got through it, he would have been severely injured, with only one-tenth of his former strength remaining.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that Ziyuan Zu was full of vigor, even stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... is a secret." Ziyuan Zu said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days?" Bai Long Yuanyu looked at Ziyuan Zu and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>Unable to find a reason, the best guess would be that he has a good relationship with someone strong.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days, Bai Long Yuanyu's gaze became complex.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she wanted the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days to give her a child.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days refused, which made her very disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, she didn't force Qi Yuan, otherwise Bai Long Yuanyu might have become the second Taihuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... I don't know either." Ziyuan Zu denied.</p><p></p><p>Although the denial is useless, he still has to deny it.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Qi Yuan was able to solve the Root Demon Tribulation, of course he wants to keep it a secret for as long as possible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Qi Yuan has the strength of a Sovereign, otherwise if it was an Alchemist Celestial of the first layer, or a Small Truth, or a Third Echelon Great Truth, he would have been noticed by many strong cultivators long ago, and they would have discussed helping him through the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>For Great Truth cultivators, the Root Demon Tribulation is too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>To become stronger, they must go through the Root Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Many Great Truth cultivators have not continued to improve their strength, just because they are afraid of the Root Demon Tribulation descending.</p><p></p><p>Last time Ziyuan Zu's Root Demon Tribulation descended, safely getting through it naturally surprised many Alchemist Celestials.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Days' power was too strong, annihilating the Taihuang Palace, so some Alchemist Celestials with ulterior motives did not dare to inquire.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

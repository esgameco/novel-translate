        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even if the Blood Lord was forever trapped in the demon realm, sinking into heart demons and transforming into a giant demon, he still maintained a shred of humanity, choosing to isolate himself from the world rather than bring calamity to all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was deeply moved. </p><p></p><p>Their admiration for the Blood Lord reached new heights.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Buddha could not achieve this, yet the Blood Lord was able to.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The golden canary looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, wanting to walk towards it, but she was unable to move an inch. "This young lady doesn't want Blood Pearl to end his own life!"</p><p></p><p>She had originally been a carefree golden canary on Mount Jiupan.</p><p></p><p>How could she be accustomed to the partings of the human world? And the one departing was her childhood sweetheart.</p><p></p><p>"Is there any way to save Blood Pearl?" The golden canary turned her head to look at Shang Yanran, her face showing a pleading expression. "Please, I'm begging you."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran seemed to think of something, a trace of sorrow flashing through her eyes: "Now that the Blood Lord has ended his own life, and the blood demon has dissipated... I have one method that may save him. </p><p></p><p>But... what we revive may be the blood demon."</p><p></p><p>Everyone present fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Baize's expression was complex as he finally said: "If we revive him as a terrifying blood demon, wouldn't that go against Master's wishes? </p><p></p><p>Is there no other way?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran said: "Master has already ended his own life. The blood demon we revive will not be a truly terrifying blood demon, but an ordinary heart demon."</p><p></p><p>"Save him!" The little old man Nangong Dagou said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Save him!" Yu Daoren, who was usually quiet and reserved, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Master passed down his techniques to me, allowing me to live. Today I will do something for Master!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these resolute words, a sorrowful smile appeared on Shang Yanran's face.</p><p></p><p>The master they would save this way would still be a blood demon - would he still be their master? In the end, they still chose to save him.</p><p></p><p>"This method is recorded on the Fate Stone Tablet. I originally thought it would never be used, but I didn't expect... to use it today." Shang Yanran took out the Fate Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Fate Stone Tablet, although it was too late to save her master, she still didn't give up on using it to rescue the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>It recorded that if the Blood Lord ended his own life, cutting himself off from demons, there would be a slim chance to save him.</p><p></p><p>"Within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, there is a gate called... the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences are not in the same space.</p><p></p><p>But to some extent, they are connected.</p><p></p><p>If someone enters it, they may be able to see the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>If they call out and transmit true essence, they may be able to awaken the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>This was the rescue method recorded on the Fate Stone Tablet half a month ago.</p><p></p><p>Awakening the Blood Lord who had ended his own life through the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, transmitting true essence.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," said Nangong Dagou.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary also looked excitedly at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, remembering Blood Pearl's words, her gaze becoming determined: "Blood Pearl..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran continued: "But... entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons will incur the curse of ten thousand demons, suffering endless pain.</p><p></p><p>This pain may not be as bad as being torn apart by ten thousand demons, but it is still extraordinarily painful, beyond what ordinary people can bear.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, after the curse of ten thousand demons, those who enter... may become extremely ugly, despised by heaven and hated by people.</p><p></p><p>All living beings who see them will feel disgust and want to kill them! Even the closest people, the most intimate lovers, will be disgusted and want to kill them! Even chaotic heart demons will be disgusted by this ugliness."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Shang Yanran looked specifically at the golden canary.</p><p></p><p>The golden canary loved beauty the most, which was a fact known to everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons would make one extremely ugly upon coming out.</p><p></p><p>That kind of ugliness was at the level of rules, and could not be changed.</p><p></p><p>"How do we enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons?" the golden canary asked, as if she hadn't heard Shang Yanran's words.</p><p></p><p>Yu Daoren smiled: "It's just a stinking sack of flesh after all."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Dagou gritted his teeth: "Not only is the name unpleasant, but I'll be ugly in the future too. What a pity for my handsome face."</p><p></p><p>Baize also said: "I'll go too."</p><p></p><p>Of the fourteen people present, apart from Shang Yanran, none of them backed down, all willing to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran said: "Husband, you can't go. Your cultivation is second only to mine, we need to work together to open the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons and send them in!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Baize's expression changed several times before he finally said: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>The golden canary looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, her eyes full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Blood Pearl... will you hate me too when I become ugly?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time rewound to a quarter of an hour ago.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on the steps.</p><p></p><p>His entire body had almost completely transformed into a heart demon.</p><p></p><p>After refining the Source of Sin into a divine ability, his soul had also completely transformed into a heart demon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan retained only a shred of clarity.</p><p></p><p>However, he wasn't panicked at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he showed a puzzled expression and muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"What's my trump card?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did I choose to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did I refine the Source of Sin into a divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>"How strange, why can't I remember?"</p><p></p><p>As his body rapidly transformed into a heart demon, Qi Yuan appeared completely calm.</p><p></p><p>"Oh dear, I've practiced the Qi Yuan Scripture too much, my memory has gotten worse. At such a critical moment, I've actually forgotten my trump card, the path I wanted to take!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan vaguely remembered that initially, he hadn't planned to cultivate the divine ability of the Heart Demon Sovereign of the Illusory Realm.</p><p></p><p>But then, as if he had thought of something, he cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me the game failed because of my poor memory?"</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it would be too absurd.</p><p></p><p>It would be like someone with poor memory preparing to cultivate immortality, but constantly forgetting the immortal cultivation techniques, having great talent but unable to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan froze.</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration crossed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I remember what my path is!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I've forgotten again."</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time passed, Qi Yuan's eyes burst with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"I've understood!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't remember, couldn't remember, but he had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem with the Qi Yuan Scripture was that it caused mental confusion and poor memory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had always felt that his mind was normal.</p><p></p><p>But the poor memory was real.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting... was his path, his essence, his innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The pain that hurts me, unbearable, forget!</p><p></p><p>The tragedy that cuts me, unacceptable, forget! Forget the pain, and there will be no pain.</p><p></p><p>Forget that this is a real world, treat it as a game world, then... the blows dealt by the world won't feel so real.</p><p></p><p>All along, Qi Yuan had been practicing forgetting.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting is escape, but also not escape.</p><p></p><p>Some things are better forgotten.</p><p></p><p>"In one night I suddenly understand my path, forgetting others and forgetting myself!"</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's true innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The Great Forgetting Heart Scripture!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan forgot everything.</p><p></p><p>He forgot that he had entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>He forgot that he had condensed the Source of Sin into a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>He forgot that he had devoured all the heart demons to become a blood demon.</p><p></p><p>[You have comprehended your essence, Great Forgetting ability +99999.]</p><p></p><p>His form also changed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that because of forgetting, everything had not happened in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This Daoist has forgotten!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>His body, which had transformed into a heart demon, dissipated at this moment, as if time had returned to just before he entered.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the dried corpse showed a moved expression: "What are you doing, how did you... become human again? What divine ability is this, time reversal? Impossible, how could such an innate divine ability appear on you?"</p><p></p><p>With the dried corpse's knowledge, it could only attribute the scene before it to a space-time divine ability.</p><p></p><p>But how could a mere cultivator who had just entered the fifth realm comprehend such an innate divine ability? It was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Time reversal?" Qi Yuan was surprised, "This isn't time reversal."</p><p></p><p>"Then what is this!" the dried corpse asked indignantly.</p><p></p><p>"I've forgotten what divine ability this is too," Qi Yuan muttered.</p><p></p><p>"You..." the dried corpse was furious.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my... who are you?" Qi Yuan looked at the dried corpse on his back, "Is there a dried corpse here? No, it seems there isn't."</p><p></p><p>"No..." For the first time, the dried corpse's face showed an expression of fear.</p><p></p><p>Because of Qi Yuan's thoughts, it suddenly found its body gradually becoming transparent, as if disappearing from this world.</p><p></p><p>It was a heart demon, it shouldn't disappear, it should only merge with other heart demons.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was truly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are you..." the dried corpse roared, "You've already condensed an innate divine ability, how can you condense a second one?"</p><p></p><p>It didn't understand, completely didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist country it came from was also a great world, filled with powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme Buddhist disciples couldn't form two innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"What, I already have an innate divine ability? How come I don't remember? This is my innate divine ability."</p><p></p><p>The embryonic form of the Great Forgetting Heart Scripture took shape at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The bodhi tree has no stand,</p><p>The bright mirror has no frame.</p><p>Fundamentally there is not a single thing,</p><p>Where can dust alight?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Heart demons... do not exist!"</p><p></p><p>"I... have forgotten you!"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right—"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You never existed in the first place!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's thought, the mummy finally became completely transparent and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, the originally countless terrifying heart demons all showed fearful expressions. Their forms gradually became transparent and finally vanished.</p><p></p><p>The vast Gate of Ten Thousand Differences was now empty, without any heart demons.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat upright on the steps. </p><p></p><p>"Forgetting... is the most terrifying thing in the world." Confusion and bewilderment flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He felt that something important was slowly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>In the vast world, within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, among the countless steps, a man in a red robe sat upright, frowning in thought.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting, forgetting others, and also forgetting oneself.</p><p></p><p>This is the ultimate limit of forgetting.</p><p></p><p>His form also gradually began to become transparent.</p><p></p><p>As if he was about to forget himself too.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the heavenly tribulation also arose.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan had already forgotten.</p><p></p><p>He forgot who he was.</p><p></p><p>He forgot where he came from. </p><p></p><p>He forgot where he was going.</p><p></p><p>He sat motionless within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was about to forget everyone, as if everyone was about to forget him.</p><p></p><p>He was also about to forget himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the motionless blood-colored robe moved slightly: "Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of color appeared in his eyes, but finally disappeared again, turning back into the handsome man in a blood-colored robe sitting on the steps.</p><p></p><p>Time slipped through his fingers, and he still sat in the same place, not knowing how many years had passed without waking up again.</p><p></p><p>The empty Gate of Ten Thousand Differences was silent, with no color except for him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this world was also about to forget him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light entered, and an urgent voice came: "Blood Pearl! Blood Pearl!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored robe still had its eyes closed, motionless.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, this young lady has come to see you in person, and you still won't come to welcome me... cough cough."</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed, and terrifying patterns were spreading on the girl's face.</p><p></p><p>She stood in the empty Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, reaching out towards that blood-red figure.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, Blood Pearl!"</p><p></p><p>The girl walked forward, and ahead was an abyss.</p><p></p><p>An urgent voice came: "Canary, don't go forward, Senior Sister Yanran said this is the limit, if you go further, you'll suffer pain like the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences!"</p><p></p><p>Canary seemed not to hear, she tried hard to approach that figure, wanting to wake that person up.</p><p></p><p>She took a step in, and excruciating pain hit her. She smiled bitterly: "Blood Pearl, is this the pain you endure? I feel it too."</p><p></p><p>Canary covered her face, which already had a "demon" character spreading like a snake.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want Blood Pearl to wake up and see her like this.</p><p></p><p>She walked forward, one hand covering her face, while calling out: "Blood Pearl, you said you would find me at the end of time!"</p><p></p><p>"If you can't do it, this young lady has come to find you herself!"</p><p></p><p>Empty world, empty heart.</p><p></p><p>In the heavenly tribulation, Qi Yuan in the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra could not see or hear anything.</p><p></p><p>Because this level of primordial divine ability was simply impossible for any cultivator to possess.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly tribulation would "assimilate" the cultivator, turning "him" into the origin of this world, a rule of this world.</p><p></p><p>However... after entering Foundation Establishment, Qi Yuan's ears could hear some inexplicable whispers.</p><p></p><p>This hearing even broke through the blockade of the heavenly tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the blood-red robe opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is calling?"</p><p></p><p>He looked over, his eyes seeming to see through the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences. He saw a girl covered in scars.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, his heart inexplicably ached.</p><p></p><p>[Canary, your childhood sweetheart, you especially dote on her.]</p><p></p><p>"Childhood sweetheart?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness was a bit hazy.</p><p></p><p>He looked at himself.</p><p></p><p>[Qi Yuan, you consider yourself the origin of all things.</p><p></p><p>Now, you are undergoing the heavenly tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Your primordial divine ability is too powerful, Heaven is unwilling for you to exist in the world.]</p><p></p><p>"I am Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's mind instantly cleared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the heavenly tribulation also dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The primordial divine ability, Great Forgetting Heart Sutra, was complete!</p><p></p><p>At this time, a special symbol also formed in the world. Qi Yuan watched that symbol float towards the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and imprint itself on the gate.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and saw that the gate was like a paper collecting stamps, covered densely with strange symbols.</p><p></p><p>Now, one more symbol was added, left by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't be bothered to look at the symbols on the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences. His gaze looked towards the ten thousand zhang deep abyss, through which he saw that faint figure.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't see that person's face clearly, only the general outline, but he knew who it was.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra is forgetting."</p><p></p><p>"Canary is not forgetting."</p><p></p><p>"Not wanting to forget, for not forgetting."</p><p></p><p>"Forgetting and not forgetting."</p><p></p><p>"Forgetting this world, not forgetting Canary."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Enlightenment complete... is it time to leave?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a feeling that the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences would soon disappear, and he would return to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>He gained a lot from this enlightenment of the origin.</p><p></p><p>Two primordial divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The first, Illusory Realm Sovereign Heart Demon Summoning.</p><p></p><p>When this divine ability is used, heart demons arise.</p><p></p><p>The second, Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting is the Way.</p><p></p><p>Having successfully enlightened on the origin, he should leave this realm like the previous times.</p><p></p><p>And this time, it may be his last enlightenment on the origin.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, he can no longer return to the past, nor can he see Canary again, nor see those people who awakened him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what price those people paid.</p><p></p><p>But he knew it must have been unbearable.</p><p></p><p>"Canary..."</p><p></p><p>"We are separated by... tens of thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"When we meet again... I fear it will be dust to dust, ashes to ashes?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan naturally didn't want that.</p><p></p><p>Time, fate... these would eventually be conquered by him!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a black dot suddenly appeared in Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>This was the most precious ability he gained from entering the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The power of reincarnation!</p><p></p><p>It is said that only Yin spirits can enter reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Some Purple Palace realm cultivators also have a certain chance of entering reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"You awakened me, so I gift you the power of reincarnation!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope we can meet again in the next reincarnation!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Seven-Colored Peak, Jiang Lingsu, who was in cultivation, opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I just forgot something."</p><p></p><p>She clutched her chest, confusion flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a sudden thunderclap came from the top of Seven-Colored Peak, seeming to head towards the peak.</p><p></p><p>The thunderclap was ordinary, just like the most common thunder.</p><p></p><p>Above the white jade palace on the peak, a cold white light shot up into the sky, colliding with that thunderclap, and finally disappearing.</p><p></p><p>A strange look appeared in Jiang Lingsu's eyes: "That thunder... was it heavenly thunder?</p><p></p><p>Was that Master's doing just now?</p><p></p><p>Too bad, it was too fast, I couldn't see Master's power at all."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze turned to the wooden house not far away.</p><p></p><p>It was quiet in the wooden house, without any sound.</p><p></p><p>"Is Big Senior Brother playing games again?"</p><p></p><p>"If he plays here for decades, I'm afraid the Divine Light Sect will find no trace of him!" Jiang Lingsu didn't think much of it and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>It had been several hundred years since the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences last appeared.</p><p></p><p>Now the ends of the earth were empty.</p><p></p><p>There were few people here.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Differences had long disappeared. On the huge rock by the sea, there was now a wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Facing the sea, but spring had not come with blooming flowers.</p><p></p><p>The ancient mirror on the dressing table was already shattered. The broken mirror shards reflected a pure white face.</p><p></p><p>The left side of the face was covered by a black veil.</p><p></p><p>The girl's hand trembled, unable to hold the eyebrow pencil steady. She couldn't even apply the simple makeup properly.</p><p></p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror, seeming to be very carefully grooming herself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a stone broke through the window and fell into the room.</p><p></p><p>A seagull flew away in disgust.</p><p></p><p>The pencil fell from the girl's hand, and her voice was choked with sobs: "I'm so stupid, I can't even apply makeup properly, I look... so ugly!"</p><p></p><p>She covered her left face, unwilling to look at that face.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, she finally finished her makeup.</p><p></p><p>She looked at where the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences had disappeared, her voice carrying a hint of grievance: "Am I very ugly? Why don't you come see me?"</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Sometimes for the sake of the plot, there will be a little bit of angst at the beginning. Don't worry, I'll keep it under control. Later it will be purely enjoyable, the small angst won't last!</p><p></p><p>Thanks to ←God's Tearless for the triple thousand reward; thanks to Love in the Countryside That Moves Heaven and Earth, and reader 202103017402701622 for their rewards!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

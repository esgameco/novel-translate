        <h1>Chapter 273</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Once, Blood Robe Sword God made a post that caused quite a stir on the forum.</p><p></p><p>However, as Blood Robe Sword God was banned from posting, the thread disappeared, and the commotion died down.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a group chat called "Blood Robe Sword God Fan Club":</p><p></p><p>Little Li from Fox Den was speaking passionately:</p><p></p><p>"What Blood Robe Sword God said must be true. The cultivation techniques we practice are definitely poisonous!"</p><p></p><p>This group chat was established under the hints and guidance of senior Blood Robe Sword God. </p><p></p><p>Now, about a hundred cultivators had joined.</p><p></p><p>This was the core group. Other group chats had even more cultivators, but those who hadn't been vetted couldn't enter.</p><p></p><p>By now, Little Li from Fox Den had become Blood Robe Sword God's head fan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what senior Blood Robe Sword God said must be true. Otherwise, how could the content he posted mysteriously disappear? </p><p></p><p>When others later asked about this matter in posts, those posts also vanished!"</p><p></p><p>"We have enemies within the Divine Flower Society, and they hold high positions!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the Society President?" one cultivator reasonably guessed.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern branch president of the Divine Flower Society had long been subdued by Blood Robe Sword God, and would never dare ban him.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few who dared ban Blood Robe Sword God and had the authority to do so.</p><p></p><p>"If it's him, we're in big trouble!" said one cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword God was indeed a senior Yin Spirit, and even among Yin Spirit Venerables, he was considered quite strong.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the behemoth that was the Divine Flower Society President, Blood Robe Sword God was still a junior.</p><p></p><p>"There's a senior Yin Spirit in my clan who once said that the gap between each level of the Yin Spirit realm is greater than the gap between each major realm below Yin Spirit!</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword God offending the Divine Flower Society President is very dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I can't contact senior Blood Robe Sword God at all now!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope the senior is careful!"</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Waves Realm has enemies, the Divine Flower Society has villains, only Blood Robe Sword God has a pure heart! All the bad people in the world have united to bully the senior!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I'm so useless, I can't do anything for the senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I feel so bad for the senior. I wish I could bear this pain in place of senior Blood Robe Sword God. The senior must be suffering so much right now."</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone have connections to contact the Society President? We could apologize on behalf of the senior!"</p><p></p><p>"No, we can't bow to evil forces!"</p><p></p><p>Anyway, in the group chat, there were all sorts of people worrying for Qi Yuan, quite in the manner of fanatical fans.</p><p></p><p>Just then, someone suddenly said:</p><p></p><p>"Look quick, Blood Robe Sword God has appeared again!"</p><p></p><p>"What, the senior is back!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p></p><p>These fans hurriedly logged into the forum to check Blood Robe Sword God's new post.</p><p></p><p>Little Li from Fox Den also had a look of surprise and nervousness.</p><p></p><p>She knew that Blood Robe Sword God being banned was a very big deal.</p><p></p><p>With one wrong move, Blood Robe Sword God could fall into an irredeemable situation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a pinned-like post caught everyone's eye:</p><p></p><p>[I, Blood Robe Sword God, Angrily Killed the Lackey Divine Flower Society President to Unban Myself!]</p><p></p><p>"Some time ago, I revealed a big secret of the Azure Waves Realm here - that cultivation techniques are poisonous.</p><p></p><p>As a result, I was cruelly banned.</p><p></p><p>I was very angry.</p><p></p><p>Living in the Azure Waves Realm, all brothers and sisters of the Divine Flower Society have the right to speak! I was banned, and felt indignant. After investigation, I found it was that old bastard the Divine Flower Society President who banned me.</p><p></p><p>I was very angry.</p><p></p><p>This old bastard has joined the evil side and become a running dog. I couldn't tolerate it! So, I raised the banner of justice and traveled thousands of miles to the Ghostly Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many Yin Spirits in the Ghostly Sky Realm were in cahoots with the Society President.</p><p></p><p>Over thirty Yin Spirits joined forces. They betrayed their faith and served the darkness.</p><p></p><p>So, I fought alone, single-handedly slaying all these Yin Spirits!</p><p></p><p>Justice defeated evil, and I can finally speak freely on the forum again.</p><p></p><p>By the way, today is Crazy Star... no, evil has not been completely eliminated yet. I need everyone's support. Upload cultivation techniques to help me defeat the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wrote at great length, feeling quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>After posting, he waited for the comments below.</p><p></p><p>"Senior killed the Society President???"</p><p></p><p>"This writing style seems a bit off. Is this a fake Blood Robe Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this comment, Qi Yuan immediately got angry: "Talking nonsense, banned!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately banned the person who said his writing was poor! Although he had mentioned freedom of speech, he banned using the Society President's account, so it had nothing to do with him, Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>He, Blood Robe Sword God, was pure and innocent, a spotless white lotus.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan's post thoroughly shocked the members of the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Flower Society was a force no less than the Dao-Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>This organization spanned over twenty realms, with tens of thousands of members.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, many Yin Spirits and their juniors were actually considered members of the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divine Flower Society was just a loose organization. Many Yin Spirits could be counted as members, but due to their status, they almost never revealed their identities on the forum.</p><p></p><p>Now, Blood Robe Sword God's post fell into the eyes of many Yin Spirit Venerables, all of whom were shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they didn't care about revealing their identities or not.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true or false? That was the Divine Flower Society President!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword God senior, didn't you go to Dark Sun?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you eliminated the Divine Flower Society President first?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the divine techniques in the Original God Sharing Club are too expensive. Even if this junior offered up all my techniques, I couldn't exchange for one."</p><p></p><p>These Yin Spirit Venerables asked one after another.</p><p></p><p>Many Yin Spirit Venerables knew that Blood Robe Sword God had gone to the Ghostly Sky Realm to contend with Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>They were not optimistic about Blood Robe Sword God's fate.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were Mythical level existences in Dark Sun.</p><p></p><p>Blood Robe Sword God had not left his name on the Mythical Monument, and was not a Mythical level powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these comments and chose some to reply to.</p><p></p><p>"I personally went to Dark Sun. Fortunately, the Divine Flower Society President was also in Dark Sun, so I conveniently killed them all."</p><p></p><p>"It was okay, Dark Sun's strength was just average. Seems like they only had four Mythicals and thirty-some Great Venerables at the sixth step of Sky Treading. Very weak!"</p><p></p><p>"That's not weak? Compared to Blood Sun Great Saint and his daughter, Dark Sun is simply pathetically weak!"</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense. How about this - through the Divine Flower Society, within 20 days, gather 1000 Heavenly-grade secret techniques... make the progress bar reach 100%, and the divine technique will be given for free!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yin Spirit's comment, Qi Yuan came up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Flower Society had few Yin Spirits, there were many members. Many came from great clans, so producing one Heavenly-grade technique shouldn't be a problem if they gritted their teeth.</p><p></p><p>Let them crowdfund 1000 Heavenly techniques, plus a bunch of Profound techniques. What did it matter if the divine technique was exposed?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan used the Society President's jade slip to make a simple modification to the forum.</p><p></p><p>This modification was very simple - when someone uploaded a technique through this interface, a progress bar would appear below.</p><p></p><p>As long as the total progress bar reached 100%, Qi Yuan would reveal the divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was using the divine technique to collect the Divine Flower Society's secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"People are selfish. What if some people wait and see, expecting others to</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What about other people's contributions?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought about it and felt the plan was somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>While divine techniques were certainly attractive, some people would surely have an optimistic attitude, thinking it wouldn't matter if they didn't contribute.</p><p></p><p>"So, everyone should also have their own personal progress bar!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan muttered. Many ideas flashed through his mind, and he immediately added another small feature to the Divine Flower Society's jade slip, following the same pattern.</p><p></p><p>Inputting techniques on that page would enter the overall pool.</p><p></p><p>But it would also enter one's personal pool, with everyone having their own progress bar. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan thoughtfully set rewards at 1%, 5%...20%...100% etc., to encourage some people to upload techniques and receive rewards.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way would the members of the Divine Flower Society have more motivation to participate.</p><p></p><p>For example, reaching 20% would earn a jade-level reward, 40% a mystic-level reward, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"This alone is not enough. After all, I'm in a hurry, and cultivators all like to go into seclusion. Who knows, they might not see this message for a year or two after going into seclusion, by which time it would be too late."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>Time is precious. </p><p></p><p>His time was very valuable and couldn't be wasted like this.</p><p></p><p>"That's it, I've got an idea. To get rewards, just uploading techniques isn't enough. You need friends to help boost you, to help cut a slice!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt he was truly a little genius.</p><p></p><p>Want to get rewards? Simple, invite others to help boost you, to cut a slice for you!</p><p></p><p>And inviting people would also increase the progress bar to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one person could only boost one other person!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, let's do it this way!"</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Qi Yuan started tinkering again.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he had worked it out.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan switched to Origin Venerable's account and invested five jade-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>Then, he sent the boost page to Blood Robe Sword God's account, boosting himself.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, his personal page showed 21% completion, and techniques named "Rain Bone Technique", "Close Combat Great Method" and a few others were uploaded to his jade slip.</p><p></p><p>These techniques included beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, as well as jade level.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, test passed." Qi Yuan checked with his own account and found it worked especially well. He was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I do have talent. If I went to apply for a programmer job on Blue Star, I'd probably earn over 10,000 a month...</p><p></p><p>Too bad I never worked at PinDuoDuo, otherwise copying their logic would definitely be more effective."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought randomly. He took out Origin Venerable's account and posted another message.</p><p></p><p>[Shocking! Blood Robe Sword God gives everyone benefits, gifting divine techniques!]</p><p></p><p>"No need for 999, no need for 998, just gather the techniques Blood Robe Sword God mentioned, and Blood Robe Sword God will give away divine techniques for free! I've already donated several techniques and actually received an super incredibly powerful explosive technique.</p><p></p><p>Why couldn't I have encountered this earlier!</p><p></p><p>Want to know how to play? Come quickly to boost me and cut a slice for me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had decided to be his own shill.</p><p></p><p>First, he would establish his persona.</p><p></p><p>Born poor, worked hard; bullied by senior brothers, unloved by elders; looked down upon by goddess senior sister, troubled by sect officials.</p><p></p><p>Relying on exchanging techniques through the Divine Flower Society, finally became rich, obtained celestial-level techniques, attracting the sect leader's daughter, that is, the little junior sister, and gaining the elders' regard!</p><p></p><p>Then he would share a bit every day, which would surely stimulate many people to come and exchange.</p><p></p><p>"Many hands make light work.</p><p></p><p>PinDuoDuo was so popular in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>With so many people in the Divine Flower Society, crowdfunding a divine technique shouldn't be a problem, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt refreshed after posting the message.</p><p></p><p>"Everything's settled!"</p><p></p><p>In Wind Thunder Valley, Qi Yuan's harvest was quite bountiful.</p><p></p><p>First, he obtained the jade slip of the Divine Flower Society's general president, and later collected a pile of techniques.</p><p></p><p>There were also many techniques in the Dark Sun, with Qi Yuan obtaining hundreds of just celestial-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>There were even superior celestial-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>These techniques, Qi Yuan naturally also placed into the Original God Sharing Society and the Divine Flower Society's rewards.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Yin God took action, gathering the entire clan's strength, frantically calling people to cut slices, pulling their own progress bar to 100%.</p><p></p><p>Sorry, above 100% there's still 1000%.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Qi Yuan left Wind Thunder Valley.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Divine Light Sect, Seven-Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu took a sip of fish soup and couldn't help but burp.</p><p></p><p>"I can't eat anymore, I need to control my weight and figure!"</p><p></p><p>After diligent cultivation, Jiang Lingsu had finally stepped into the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Even among her other brothers and sisters in the family, this was considered fast.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Senior Brother is doing now?" Jiang Lingsu thought of Qi Yuan, quite missing him.</p><p></p><p>Just today, people from the family contacted her through Sister Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>The content of the contact was simple, nothing more than asking her to return home.</p><p></p><p>After all, for the Jiang family, the Divine Light Sect was just a small sect, and Jiang Lingsu was considered a direct descendant.</p><p></p><p>The guidance she received at Divine Light Sect was certainly not comparable to the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>So the Jiang family persuaded Jiang Lingsu to return.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, they had also thoughtfully chosen for Jiang Lingsu a... son-in-law of humble origins, handsome appearance, and great talent.</p><p></p><p>That's right, to marry into the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>This showed the Jiang family's love for Jiang Lingsu.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang family also said that the young man was handsome and highly talented, with the potential to step into the Divine Infant realm within a hundred years, and even a slight chance of becoming a Purple Palace!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu directly refused, and added a remark: "My Senior Brother is already at Divine Infant, he's not even comparable to a single leg hair of my Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>This really worried her father.</p><p></p><p>His daughter was only sixteen years old, yet her Senior Brother was a Divine Infant True Lord.</p><p></p><p>In a small place like the Great Shang Country, which Divine Infant True Lord wasn't a thousand-year-old elder?</p><p></p><p>Judging by his daughter's tone, she seemed to have quite good feelings for that Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>How could Jiang Zhihua not be angry in his heart?</p><p></p><p>He was still a handsome young man of over three hundred years old, but a thousand-year-old weird old man wanted to take his daughter. How could he not be angry? He rushed to the Great Shang Country overnight!</p><p></p><p>After all, what intentions could a thousand-year-old Divine Infant True Lord have in taking a sixteen-year-old girl as a junior sister? How could he not know?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's mother was also his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he was already a hundred years old, a Golden Core True Lord.</p><p></p><p>His junior sister had just stepped onto the path of immortality.</p><p></p><p>How could he not understand what his daughter's Senior Brother was thinking? He had to teach that shameless old man a lesson! Now, Jiang Ruhua was rushing towards the Great Shang Country.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking more about these things, Jiang Lingsu's consciousness entered the jade slip of the Divine Flower Society.</p><p></p><p>Her expression also became interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Divine technique?"</p><p></p><p>She looked at the overall progress bar showing 1%, without much feeling.</p><p></p><p>Divine techniques were too far from her.</p><p></p><p>Her interest was all on the personal progress bar.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother really needs techniques. If I exchange for techniques to give to Senior Brother, Senior Brother will surely be very happy!"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this feeling of offering techniques and receiving rewards felt really good.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, she saw a post and her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>[Brothers, I've exchanged for techniques again!]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

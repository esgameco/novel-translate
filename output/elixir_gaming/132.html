        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have good news for you all - my 'Hundred Days Plan to Destroy the Palace of Light' is ahead of schedule. I've now started on step four, which is a very difficult step!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's plan was meticulous, divided into four steps. The last step was also the most difficult, with a four-star difficulty rating.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Supreme, are you about to form your golden core?" Rogue Immortal quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>"You're still here? Didn't you say last time you were going into closed-door cultivation for a hundred days?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I was in seclusion...but when the jade slip lit up, I clicked in," Rogue Immortal said awkwardly. </p><p></p><p>"You're addicted, you need electroshock therapy," Qi Yuan said, then brought the topic back to the main subject, "I've already entered late Foundation Establishment. I'm just one step away from forming an immortal-grade golden core!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was full of confidence. </p><p></p><p>He had already spoken with the Heavenly Dao of the Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>An immortal-grade golden core was within reach.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, Origin Supreme, didn't you just reach Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment not long ago?" Rogue Immortal asked timidly.</p><p></p><p>"It's only been two or three months. Ah, time flies, life is unpredictable!" Qi Yuan sighed inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Flame Emperor entered the group chat at this time: "Wow, as expected of the genius I've taken notice of. Origin Supreme is too fierce."</p><p></p><p>"There's progress on destroying the Palace of Light?" Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman also started speaking, sending several messages.</p><p></p><p>"I found several sisters and borrowed a few million in high-interest loans from the Palace of Light. Origin Supreme, you need to work harder!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't let down your trust!" Qi Yuan was moved. "I've made some small plans targeting the Palace of Light that need your support!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you need me to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill people? That's my specialty!"</p><p></p><p>"I...can only contribute one spirit stone."</p><p></p><p>"No need for all that trouble. I registered an alt account and am exposing the crimes of the Palace of Light. I need you all to upvote my posts."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan told them about the posts he made and his ideas.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman's eyes lit up in the real world.</p><p></p><p>She sent several messages in a row.</p><p></p><p>"Great talent! Origin Supreme is truly a great talent!"</p><p></p><p>"This title is simply brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"The noble Sword Saint's daughter living in a doghouse - the Palace of Light is too much!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, actually I just copied someone else's ideas," Qi Yuan said somewhat guiltily.</p><p></p><p>Last time he plagiarized Wu Tong's words, he ended up killing Wu Tong directly.</p><p></p><p>No one would know he plagiarized, and Wu Tong as the original creator couldn't crawl out of hell to expose him.</p><p></p><p>But now the people on Blue Star were still alive. He hadn't killed them all yet. If his plagiarism was exposed, it would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Unless he swallowed up Blue Star, only then could he claim it was original with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Origin Supreme, I'll upvote your posts every day!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you everyone!" Qi Yuan was grateful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He exited the group chat and continued posting with his alt account.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Palace of Light branch.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of anger in Wind Fury True Lord's eyes: "Still no response from Great Shang?"</p><p></p><p>His disciple Broken Wolf had gone to the Hundred Countries and perished in Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>The envoy sent to Great Shang also had no news.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Fury True Lord, please calm down," Strong Flood True Lord advised.</p><p></p><p>Both were late Nascent Soul stage, but Strong Flood True Lord was slightly inferior to Wind Fury True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Because Wind Fury True Lord's father was a Purple Mansion powerhouse! Without Yin spirits appearing, Purple Mansion cultivators were considered powerhouses in the Cang Lan Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, my disciple died in Great Shang without explanation. What, I can't even ask for an explanation?" Wind Fury True Lord said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Strong Flood True Lord was displeased in his heart, but still said with a fawning expression: "It seems our Palace of Light is somewhat unsettled recently. The Palace Master has ordered us to keep a low profile for now."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what happened?" Wind Fury True Lord was unaware of these matters.</p><p></p><p>"In the past few days, many Purple Mansion powerhouses have been coming to our Palace of Light to borrow money. It's said...we've already lent out ten million spirit stones." Strong Flood True Lord was shocked as he mentioned this.</p><p></p><p>Purple Mansion powerhouses coming in groups to borrow spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that our Palace of Light starting the Hundred Countries Blood War has displeased some old fellows? But the Hundred Countries Blood War had already received tacit approval from those big shots!"</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Countries Blood War would cause endless slaughter, with billions of deaths.</p><p></p><p>For such a major event, the Palace of Light naturally couldn't just do it on a whim.</p><p></p><p>If they offended some big shot who didn't approve, they would have no grounds to argue.</p><p></p><p>With prior reporting, it was different.</p><p></p><p>At least the nearby big shots wouldn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>"The palace is investigating. We should still be cautious. Also, someone was denouncing our Palace of Light in the Divine Flower Forum today. That person's title doesn't seem easy to deal with." Strong Flood True Lord waved his hand, and a series of images appeared before Wind Fury True Lord's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint? Daughter living in a doghouse?" Wind Fury True Lord widened his eyes upon hearing this. "Who did this? It's even more...outrageous than me!"</p><p></p><p>There are limits even when killing people.</p><p></p><p>Wind Fury True Lord usually just killed people directly, rarely humiliating them.</p><p></p><p>Now, a fellow cultivator in the Palace of Light forcing another cultivator's daughter to live in a doghouse was really...too much.</p><p></p><p>"The palace is investigating whether this actually happened or if it's slander." Strong Flood True Lord sighed, "A storm is coming!"</p><p></p><p>The series of recent events made them feel as if an invisible hand was targeting the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>But the Palace of Light's investigation hadn't found which powerful being was targeting them.</p><p></p><p>Would that kind of powerhouse even need to use such methods?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wind Fury True Lord's eyes showed some trepidation, but he still said: "Great Shang is just a small country. Even if I take action, it won't affect matters like this. Let's wait a few more days for the palace's investigation results before I go to Great Shang!"</p><p></p><p>Strong Flood True Lord nodded and asked: "Wind Fury True Lord, which fellow cultivator do you think bullied that Blood Robed Sword Saint and made his daughter live in a doghouse?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Fury True Lord pondered: "It should be either Void True Lord or Square Origin True Lord. They are the most likely suspects."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, only they would do such things!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, this was the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan posted to slander them, most of them just wondered which fellow cultivator had done it...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, finally finished posting." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at his masterpiece with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He had made seven posts in a row.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity there's no scheduled posting feature. Otherwise I could go play games while the posts keep coming."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>If he had an auto-upvoting tool, he could even upvote his own posts while he was away.</p><p></p><p>"Now, with hatred maxed out, I just need to form my golden core and destroy the Palace of Light in one fell swoop!" Qi Yuan was full of confidence, believing that once he formed his golden core, he would be the top disciple among all peaks of the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>"That Kang Fulu fellow shouldn't have secretly formed his core behind my back, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu's voice came from outside the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan quickly walked out of the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, what's the matter?" Qi Yuan was now extremely respectful towards his rich junior sister.</p><p></p><p>As long as Junior Sister remained wealthy for one more day, she would remain the god of gods in Qi Yuan's heart for one more day.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, I have a...sister coming to Divine Light Sect to find me." Jiang Lingsu said haltingly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, someone from your family?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't a rich woman's sister also likely to be rich?</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so. That sister of mine will probably stay at our Seven Colors Peak for a while. Is that alright with you?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>Since the master couldn't be seen, everything on Seven Colors Peak was up to the senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, no problem at all!" Qi Yuan raised both hands in approval.</p><p></p><p>That was a rich woman! It wouldn't be bad to stay together and absorb some financial luck.</p><p></p><p>With another rich woman around, his knife would have one more choice for picking up scraps in the future.</p><p></p><p>"By the way Senior Brother, when this sister of mine comes, we may have some arguments..."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Qi Yuan was stunned. "Don't worry Junior Sister, your senior brother stands with you. Even if she's rich, if you two fight, I'll definitely take a knife to her!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu felt warmth in her heart. Although Senior Brother was eccentric, he was a good person.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how rich is she? A billionaire?" Qi Yuan asked, his tone weakening noticeably, as if he wouldn't dare provoke her if she was a billionaire.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked at Qi Yuan with exasperation, the previous warmth completely gone. She said angrily, "...She's not as rich as me."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll be your enforcer from now on!" Qi Yuan patted his chest. "Qi Yuan's beatings, worth having!"</p><p></p><p>"She's no ordinary person. She's ranked 15th on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings!" Jiang Lingsu said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother's combat power was quite good. At Qi Refinement peak he ambushed and killed a late Foundation Establishment and mid Foundation Establishment cultivator, showing his outstanding talent.</p><p></p><p>Entering Foundation Establishment, he could probably rank in the top 500 or even top 100 on the Eastern Lands Genius Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, her sister was ranked 15th on the Eastern Land's Genius List! It could be said that, barring any major issues, she was almost certain to become a powerful Purple Palace cultivator in the future!</p><p></p><p>"Is she a Heavenly Dao Foundation Building cultivator?" Qi Yuan asked somewhat fearfully.</p><p></p><p>"...No."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm not afraid of her. I'm Heavenly Dao Foundation Building, I can easily crush her!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said confidently. After chatting with Jiang Lingsu for a while, he returned to his wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"Everything's settled. Time to log in, play games, and defeat bosses!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the City of No Return, the sand on the ground sank in, and Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe emerged from underground, holding Little Jia. A hint of profundity flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally about to end."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt somewhat melancholy inside.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the pitch-black sky, with no stars or sun and moon: "Such a world is indeed quite lonely."</p><p></p><p>A bloody aura permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths of time passed.</p><p></p><p>Several powerful auras rushed towards this location.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, you're back?"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the supreme beings before him and brushed the dust off his body: "How did things go?"</p><p></p><p>He was asking about the number of peak Mortal Realm Myth cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, the City of No Return has gathered 70,000... peak Mortal Realm Myth cultivators!" Chen Huan said, his teeth trembling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned upon hearing this: "According to ancient calculations, this is close to 200,000 troops?"</p><p></p><p>There were truly many Mortal Realm Myth cultivators in this world!</p><p></p><p>"Many mid-stage Mortal Realm Myth cultivators have been frantically breaking through to the peak stage recently, regardless of their lifespan, just to hear you lecture, big brother. That's why there are so many!" </p><p></p><p>The temptation of becoming a supreme being was almost irresistible to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Below the supreme level, all were ants - this wasn't just empty words.</p><p></p><p>As long as one had the Primordial Divine Ability, a supreme being killing a Mortal Realm Myth cultivator was like killing a chicken.</p><p></p><p>"Have all the people gathered?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"They have!" Chen Huan said.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I will begin lecturing in ten days."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan said this, he sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This was 100,000 supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>If converted to experience points, it was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>The news that the Blood Lord had appeared again in the City of No Return spread, and the world was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Because those peak Mortal Realm Myth cultivators understood that this was their chance to step into the supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, deep in the City of No Return, Cloud Crane was drinking some wine, his eyes relaxed and casual: "If the Blood Lord had emerged a thousand years earlier, the world would have been at peace, and Master wouldn't have had to struggle so hard."</p><p></p><p>He drank his wine, never having felt so relaxed before.</p><p></p><p>When the sky falls, the tall ones hold it up - it truly felt good.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, above the City of No Return.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood atop the city wall, his blood-red robe especially vivid.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, 70,000 peak Mortal Realm Myth cultivators stood like soldiers.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, this would be 70,000 peak Divine Infant stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Each one was comparable to Qi Yuan's former great enemy, the Black Chicken Demon.</p><p></p><p>But now, in Qi Yuan's eyes, he could slaughter all these people with just a flick of his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Today, 70,000 peak Mortal Realm Myth cultivators will step into the supreme realm. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>When the game ended, he would leave.</p><p></p><p>These 70,000 peak Mortal Realm Myth cultivators would become supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Adding to the previous 30,000 supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>That is, 100,000 supreme beings, as if they cost nothing.</p><p></p><p>So many supreme beings would indeed affect the balance of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once Qi Yuan finished the game, he wasn't sure what would happen to these supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these supreme beings were not Purple Palace cultivators of the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>They had demonic seeds within them! After they died naturally, demonic creatures would appear! Supreme-level demonic creatures - just thinking about it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps what he had created was not over 100,000 supreme beings, but demonic creatures!</p><p></p><p>This world...</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't think further. He looked at those hundred thousand people, his expression ethereal, like a deity in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"The lecture... begins..."</p><p></p><p>This lecture was grander than any before, and on a larger scale.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord stood on the city wall of No Return, celestial music came from the sky, reaching directly into people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, this time blood rain suddenly began falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was the tears of heaven, the blood of heaven.</p><p></p><p>The 70,000 Mortal Realm Myth cultivators were drenched in blood rain, but none of them noticed it. They had already fully immersed themselves in the Way of Human and Demon.</p><p></p><p>However, the other powerful beings in the City of No Return who looked at the Blood Lord at this moment felt as if he was like a blood-red sun.</p><p></p><p>In a world abandoned by the gods, where sun, moon and stars no longer existed, it was as if a blood-red sun had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was light in this world, even if that light was blood-red.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, a blood palace appeared at the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Now, 99% of the supreme beings in the entire Flowing Wind Realm had gathered at the ends of the earth, seemingly waiting for the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to open.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was excited, while also suppressing themselves.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Crane's excitement was mixed with a hint of worry: "I hope Master can hold on until the Blood Lord arrives."</p><p></p><p>As the time for the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons to open drew nearer, the Blood Lord appeared less and less frequently.</p><p></p><p>There was a strange silence throughout the entire blood palace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Little Jia, with a hint of peculiarity in his expression: "The Great Forgetting Heart Sutra... is only one step away from being inscribed."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan's Great Forgetting Heart Sutra was actually sufficient to be inscribed.</p><p></p><p>But he was unable to do it.</p><p></p><p>If inscribed on his soul or body, he would likely truly go mad.</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean I can only keep the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra at the subtle level, unable to inscribe it?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very helpless.</p><p></p><p>A great supreme being with an inscribed Primordial Divine Ability was clearly not on the same level as a mid-stage supreme being at the subtle level.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he simply couldn't inscribe it now.</p><p></p><p>If he did, he would truly forget, in a way that could not be awakened.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, but this is my path. I must walk it even with tears in my eyes."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to think about it further.</p><p></p><p>There's always a way when you reach the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would find a solution eventually.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>He Wu's entire body was shrouded in darkness, his eyes full of worry: "In a few more days, the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons will open. It will be very difficult for us to assist Master."</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi looked at the stronghold in front, sensing the auras on it. His eyes were also full of trepidation: "Over twenty great supreme beings, over a hundred ordinary supreme beings. The Venerable One has really gone all out!"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One's main force had now completely surrounded the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And at the entrance to the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, the Venerable One had also dispatched many powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to deal with the Blood Lord, ten of the twenty-plus dispatched great supreme beings were from the Myriad Beasts Realm, and all of the hundred-plus ordinary supreme beings were beasts from the Myriad Beasts Realm.</p><p></p><p>This way, they would not be restrained by the Blood Lord's Primordial Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>"There are only five of us. We are no match for these supreme beings at all." He Wu was worried.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the two sides was too large.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it had taken a lot of preparation for the five of them to even make it here.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One's people were everywhere inside the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think Master's strength is like? Can he defeat these people?" Ling Yayi asked.</p><p></p><p>They had come here to assist the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Probably not," He Wu said gravely.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the Blood Lord's sword had inscribed the Primordial Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that their Master had been severely injured in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, had only recently awakened, and had just stepped into the realm of great supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Although Master's Primordial Divine Ability restrained the supreme beings of the Flowing Wind Realm, most of the Demon Woman's subordinates were supreme beings from the Myriad Beasts Realm.</p><p></p><p>With twenty great supreme beings attacking together, the current Blood Lord simply couldn't be a match for them.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi frowned. He suddenly said: "What if when the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons fully opens, I fly directly towards those great supreme beings and self-destruct with my Primordial Divine Ability, then shout loudly, 'My name is Ling Yayi.'</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't Master then forget my name Nangong Dagou and only remember that I'm called Ling Yayi!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense. If you go self-destruct, you'll just be throwing your life away. For Master to come through, he must face those powerful beings directly." He Wu knew that Ling Yayi wanted to sacrifice himself to give Master a chance to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I'm just trying to find a solution, aren't I?" Ling Yayi shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than believing your self-destruction would attract those supreme beings' attention, it's better to believe Master can fight his way in," said a mid-stage supreme realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He was also one of the Northern Demon Thirteen Beasts.</p><p></p><p>He Wu nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi looked at the two of them, clearly dissatisfied: "You must have 'beast' written on your faces. I really can't stand looking at you two right now."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

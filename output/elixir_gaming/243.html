        <h1>Chapter 243</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you've become a bit dirty. No wonder you have a water spirit root, it turns out it's sewage water."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Lingsu with an appreciative gaze. </p><p></p><p>This was indeed the first time he had seen Jiang Lingsu like this, with a unique charm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was open and unabashed, not trying to hide anything. She couldn't help but feel pleased inside.</p><p></p><p>All men and women have a sense of vanity. Being looked at admiringly by a genius like Senior Brother naturally made her happy.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, your looks and figure are much better than your sister Jiang Ya's. More than enough to be a door attendant."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but offer his assessment.</p><p></p><p>The smile froze in Jiang Lingsu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Oh well... Senior Brother will be Senior Brother. She shouldn't have had any expectations for his words.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, thank you so much for this time," Jiang Lingsu continued to express gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just a small matter."</p><p></p><p>Fellow disciples should love and care for each other like family.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Master Ruan Yixi wasn't here, perhaps in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>The children's mother Jin Li was also in the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had not reached Yin Spirit level and could not go to the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, you've helped me so much. I, your junior sister, have no way to repay you. </p><p>If not... you can make a request of your junior sister that's not too excessive, I can fulfill it for you," Jiang Lingsu said seriously at this point.</p><p></p><p>These words made Qi Yuan pause briefly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu openly added: "Even slightly excessive is fine."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu knew Qi Yuan's character, which is why she said this.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else, she would have directly offered up all her spirit stones and even some treasures.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very curious," Qi Yuan thought of something because of Jiang Lingsu's words.</p><p></p><p>He said, "I helped you. If I gave you two options, which would you choose?"</p><p></p><p>"What options?" Jiang Lingsu asked.</p><p></p><p>"First option: This humble girl has no way to repay you, in the next life I will be your ox or horse to repay your kindness.</p><p>Second option: This humble girl is willing to offer herself to you," Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>This concerned his looks.</p><p></p><p>According to Qi Yuan's memory, if the benefactor was very ugly, a wealthy young lady would say she'd be an ox or horse in the next life to repay the kindness. If the benefactor was very handsome, she would directly offer herself without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>There were many such instances.</p><p></p><p>For example, in ancient times when matchmakers introduced men and women to meet.</p><p></p><p>If the woman was satisfied, she would say it's up to her parents to decide.</p><p></p><p>If she was unsatisfied, she would have a different set of words.</p><p></p><p>In any case, one had to speak with high emotional intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also striving to be a person with high EQ.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu frowned at this point, seeming to be thinking seriously.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, she said, looking directly into Qi Yuan's eyes: "Compared to being an ox or horse, I would still choose to offer myself."</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan heard this, joy appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>It seems he was indeed very handsome.</p><p></p><p>Being certified handsome by others was different from uncertified handsomeness.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was quite smug, but then he heard Jiang Lingsu hesitantly say: "Could Senior Brother's excessive request be this? If so, I..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly waved his hand: "Not at all, I'm not the type to use kindness as leverage!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't do the cowherd thing either.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Lingsu felt confused inside.</p><p></p><p>Although she had appeared calm on the surface when answering earlier, her heart had gone through quite a struggle.</p><p></p><p>Now getting this answer, she... felt extremely complicated inside.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know whether to feel relieved or disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But this style... was indeed very much like Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother's style had always been unpredictable and hard to grasp.</p><p></p><p>So in communicating with Senior Brother, Jiang Lingsu had already mastered the technique.</p><p></p><p>For things she couldn't understand, she just wouldn't try to understand.</p><p></p><p>"This request, let's put it on hold for now.</p><p>Oh right, when holding the Divine Infant Conference this time, remember to definitely invite the Demon Desire Sect!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan specially instructed.</p><p></p><p>He had offended several Ji surname disciples and elders of the Demon Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan was busy destroying the great enemy Light Palace, so he casually killed several elders of the Demon Desire Sect.</p><p></p><p>By the time Light Palace was destroyed and he returned to Da Shang, who knew the Demon Desire Sect would have changes.</p><p></p><p>Within the Demon Desire Sect, there had always been two factions in power - one surnamed Shen that was extremely low-key, and one surnamed Ji that was extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>For many years, the Ji faction had been suppressing the Shen faction.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan returned last time, he learned that the Shen surname had suppressed and eliminated the Ji surname.</p><p></p><p>Now the Demon Desire Sect was once again under the control of the Shen surname.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this matter, Qi Yuan was quite curious and also wanted to know the situation of the Demon Desire Sect, so he simply gave instructions to take a look.</p><p></p><p>In any case, with the Ji surname all dead, he couldn't be bothered to go to the Demon Desire Sect himself.</p><p></p><p>After saying goodbye to Jiang Lingsu, Qi Yuan returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>His daughter Qi Jianjun was elusive, who knows where she went fishing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's consciousness then immersed into the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The game had ended, and Qi Yuan was waiting for a new game.</p><p></p><p>This time, as usual.</p><p></p><p>Inside the game jade slip, a new game icon was slowly forming.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's divine sense suddenly approached the game icon, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"This time... what kind of world will it be?" Qi Yuan was very much looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>The games had helped him tremendously.</p><p></p><p>In less than a day's time, he had broken through from Golden Core to Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Although it was far inferior compared to that civilization in the ancestral land.</p><p></p><p>But in the Cang Lan Realm, he could now be considered a city-level high school.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan thought of something.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Seed appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the rewards obtained for completing tasks in the Mortal Heart Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Seed could take root and sprout in any world, growing in place of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the power feedback Qi Yuan received after inheriting it was far higher than previous games.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he split off a strand of consciousness, infused it into the Primordial Seed, and made the Primordial Seed take on his appearance.</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's control, the Primordial Seed directly entered the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, there was no obstruction, it went in directly?"</p><p></p><p>This surprised Qi Yuan quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you won't let me in but the Primordial Seed is okay?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan expressed his anger.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't go in, but the Primordial Seed could.</p><p></p><p>This made him quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the depths of his mind, he seemed to sense a life being nurtured.</p><p></p><p>This feeling came from within the game icon.</p><p></p><p>This also made Qi Yuan more clearly understand the function of the Primordial Seed.</p><p></p><p>That's right, someone had clapped for love or clapped for other reasons, creating his game identity this time.</p><p></p><p>"I won't be an embryo when I enter, right?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan's teeth ached.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to wear diapers and be fed by others with shit and piss, just thinking about it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan secretly listened to the game jade slip for a few minutes, but hearing no sound, he withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"Wait until the game finishes loading to take another look."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan went to find Sect Leader Ku Mu Zhen Jun.</p><p></p><p>Holding a Divine Infant Conference made Ku Mu Zhen Jun stunned. But it was only for a moment - if Qi Yuan made a request, even if it was to hold an Ascension Conference, he would do it.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing. Since I've already ascended to Divine Infant, living in a brick house no longer suits my status.</p><p>Now, I want to build a big single-story house, made of cement!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt that with his wealth, he could live in a detached villa.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't forget his original intention, kept the teachings in mind, and displayed frugality and simplicity.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is cement?" Kumuzhenjun asked in confusion. He knew about water and mud, but combining these two to build houses seemed very strange.</p><p></p><p>"You're uncultured. In our Blue Star, there's a neighborhood where talented people abound. Even middle schoolers who haven't graduated know how to make cement."</p><p></p><p>This neighborhood, of course, refers to the comments section.</p><p></p><p>"Let me teach you." Qi Yuan explained the method of making cement to Kumuzhenjun.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun was after all a Divine Infant True Lord. Upon hearing this, he instantly understood the principle: "An interesting little thing."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was merely interesting and nothing more. </p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Canglan Realm was still quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>Divine Infant cultivators could withstand Blue Star's strongest nuclear bombs without injury.</p><p></p><p>Some technological creations were not necessary for the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, fertilizer - do cultivators in the immortal realms still use fertilizer? They can directly use spells to make all things grow, using various magic freely.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of these things, Qi Yuan couldn't help but miss life on Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>After all, the comments section on Blue Star was full of talented people.</p><p></p><p>They could argue for thousands of posts over whether tofu pudding should be salty or sweet. Unfortunately, Qi Yuan preferred the spicy version.</p><p></p><p>"In one day, your new... cave dwelling can be built," said Kumuzhenjun.</p><p></p><p>"Good," Qi Yuan replied. "We must also hurry with the Divine Infant Conference."</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun was stunned.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Shang Nation, when cultivators advanced to the Divine Infant stage, they would indeed hold a Divine Infant Conference.</p><p></p><p>But someone as eager as Qi Yuan... was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." Kumuzhenjun nodded.</p><p></p><p>Because according to what Qi Yuan said, the Divine Infant Conference would be completed tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>This was too fast.</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun looked at where Qi Yuan had been standing, his gaze particularly profound.</p><p></p><p>"Is he... playing games with the mortal world?"</p><p></p><p>In any case, this was the greatest opportunity of his life, and he had to handle it well.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and two paper cranes flew away.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Kang Fulu arrived in a hurry: "What does the Sect Leader need me for?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kang Fulu had white hair, and his heart was full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He had just returned from Cuiyun Continent not long ago, and had even made it onto the Eastern Land Genius Rankings. For such a joyous event, the Sect Leader's reaction was lukewarm.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Kang Fulu had also investigated what happened after he left the sect.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that during his absence, a Purple Mansion cultivator had caused trouble, but was killed by a Purple Mansion cultivator from the Blood Robe Alliance!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robe Alliance also had deep connections with Seven Color Peak.</p><p></p><p>This made him think more.</p><p></p><p>When participating in the Eastern Land Genius Battle before, Junior Brother Qi Yuan had said he wanted to use connections.</p><p></p><p>As a result, a mysterious person really did use connections.</p><p></p><p>Putting everything together, Kang Fulu couldn't help but think more.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan definitely had a deep relationship with the Blood Robe Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan, that idiot with problems in his head, was lucky enough to be noticed by the Blood Robe Sword God and taken as a disciple?</p><p></p><p>With his way of thinking, he could only come up with this answer.</p><p></p><p>Kumuzhenjun looked at Kang Fulu and said casually: "Tomorrow our Divine Light Sect will hold a Divine Infant Conference. Go prepare and arrange it, and send out the invitations."</p><p></p><p>"Which senior uncle has broken through to Divine Infant?" Kang Fulu was delighted inwardly.</p><p></p><p>With one more Divine Infant, the current Divine Light Sect's strength would increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Desire Sect had already undergone changes, so the Divine Light Sect should become the number one sect in Great Shang.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Color Peak... Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Qi Yuan?" Kang Fulu's eyes widened, hardly believing his ears.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan... became a Divine Infant!</p><p></p><p>What's going on, wasn't he just at Foundation Establishment?</p><p></p><p>"As the head disciple of a peak, your mental cultivation is so poor, you are far inferior to Qi Yuan." Kumuzhenjun said proudly.</p><p></p><p>When he heard Qi Yuan say he had entered the Divine Infant realm, Kumuzhenjun wasn't shocked at all, only confused.</p><p></p><p>A mighty Yin God, pretending to have just broken through to Divine Infant, what was the purpose?</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu was silent for a long time before saying: "Sect Leader... are you sure you're not joking with me?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly being told that someone who was at Foundation Establishment disappeared for half a day and entered Divine Infant, who would believe it?</p><p></p><p>It's like if you're a college student, and your roommate and adopted son is a poor student with worse grades than you. Suddenly one day in class, the teacher says your deskmate won the Nobel Prize and was successfully elected as an academician of the Academy of Sciences.</p><p></p><p>Could you understand that?</p><p></p><p>"Does this old man have any reason to deceive you about these matters? The invitations are already made, send them out." Kumuzhenjun said.</p><p></p><p>On the invitations, according to Qi Yuan's request, they had specially added the mark of Great Shang's First Divine Infant.</p><p></p><p>Kang Fulu didn't object either.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the master wants to play, just play along.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan entered the chat group of the Four Emperors of the Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>"I have good news to tell everyone, I have entered the Divine Infant stage."</p><p></p><p>Having entered the Divine Infant True Lord stage, of course he had to show off properly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even thought about whether he should go find the president of the Divine Flower Association and pin a post on the Divine Flower forum.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Qi Yuan of Seven Color Peak, Divine Light Sect of Great Shang for entering Divine Infant and becoming Great Shang's First Divine Infant"</p><p></p><p>But thinking that it's better to be low-key when using special privileges, he didn't bother.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Infant?" Rogue Immortal Lord was stunned. "Origin Venerable, you're too fierce!"</p><p></p><p>In any case, when facing Qi Yuan, just praise directly.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Flame Emperor also appeared to flatter him.</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman also praised a few words, then said dejectedly: "Sigh, your realms are rising steadily, but this old lady has been stuck for several hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Ice Mountain Domineering Woman had been stuck at the peak of Purple Mansion for a long time.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Yin God realm, one needs to go through the Infinite Lightning Sea.</p><p></p><p>But with the great calamity approaching, the Infinite Lightning Sea is even more dangerous. Even ordinary Yin God protectors have great difficulty, so it's extremely hard for her to break through to the Yin God realm.</p><p></p><p>Her grandfather is too old and seems to have some injuries. Rashly entering the Infinite Lightning Sea could very likely lead to his demise.</p><p></p><p>Unable to find a suitable protector, she naturally hasn't gone to break through.</p><p></p><p>She had thought about the Blood Robe Sword God, that is, Origin Venerable, but gave up in the end.</p><p></p><p>Origin Venerable is only a Venerable, and even Venerables risk perishing when protecting in the Infinite Lightning Sea now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even Yin Gods need to conserve their strength to deal with the great calamity hundreds of years later.</p><p></p><p>She also didn't want to ask Qi Yuan, and couldn't afford that price.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of that damn great calamity!" Ice Mountain Domineering Woman couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>If not for the great calamity, she would still have a chance to break through to Yin God.</p><p></p><p>"Great calamity..." At the mention of the great calamity, Qi Yuan's gaze also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although in the Mortal Heart Realm, he ultimately surpassed mythology by far, even killing two Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>But facing the great calamity that could summon reinforcements, he was still quite wary in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he could also summon reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>But... what if the great calamity summoned a Yang God?</p><p></p><p>The gap between Yang Gods is even greater than the gap between humans and dogs.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't know which Yang God was behind the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Ice Mountain Domineering Woman, don't worry, after I play through this game, I'll destroy the great calamity!" Qi Yuan said in the group.</p><p></p><p>He even said, if the Yang God behind the great calamity cannot descend or is of average strength, once his realm stabilizes, he can directly solo the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable, you'd better not call me sister anymore." Ice Mountain Domineering Woman said.</p><p></p><p>A powerful Yin God calling her sister, wouldn't that make her age sound too old?</p><p></p><p>P.S. Thanks to Shi Tu for the reward, the 17th leader of the Star Core Golden Pill; and to Only Seek Peach Blossom Spring for the consecutive rewards, the 18th leader of the Star Core Golden Pill!

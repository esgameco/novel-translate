        <h1>Chapter 398</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha's heart was pounding wildly.</p><p></p><p>The master of Buddhist disciple Baize? "Could it be that senior also comes from the Buddhist realm?" </p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced again at the golden canary and Ning Tao beside Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This senior was once from the Buddhist realm, but became attached to the mortal world, so he left the Buddhist realm?</p><p></p><p>However, Half-Buddha didn't believe his claim that Baize was half his disciple. </p><p></p><p>Baize was the disciple of the Great Sun Buddha. Even ordinary true Buddhas wouldn't dare claim to be Baize's master.</p><p></p><p>This man was very bold.</p><p></p><p>"Do I look like I'm from the Buddhist realm?" Qi Yuan embraced the women on either side of him, showing off to Half-Buddha.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Half-Buddha was clearly single.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt very superior.</p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha was surprised. </p><p></p><p>Not from the Buddhist realm? But as a disciple of the Great Sun Buddha, Baize had never left the Buddhist realm before descending to the lower world.</p><p></p><p>How could he be half this man's disciple?</p><p></p><p>Was this man pretending?</p><p></p><p>If so, it would be easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>As a member of the Buddhist sect, Half-Buddha naturally understood that worldly people have many desires.</p><p></p><p>Even he was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't becoming a true Buddha also an obsession?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Bai Baixiang opened her eyes wide and gathered her courage to say: "Could it be that senior is... the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Her voice trembled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>If he was the Blood Lord, everything would make sense.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Bai Baixiang, somewhat surprised: "There are actually still young people in this world who remember the Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>In the game, there was no need to hide one's identity.</p><p></p><p>Sincerity was the ultimate move.</p><p></p><p>"You really are the Blood Lord, grandpa!" Bai Baixiang exclaimed, about to pounce on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, halfway through her leap, she was frozen in mid-air by Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao frowned and said: "You reek of sweat, and besides, my husband is still young!"</p><p></p><p>The Half-Buddha beside them was stunned, also revealing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Blood Lord? He had heard of this person.</p><p></p><p>He was a legendary figure from nearly ten thousand years ago in the Liufeng Realm, the kind who could stir up world events.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how much he stirred things up, wasn't he still only at the fifth level of the Purple Palace? How did he suddenly become... so powerful?</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that tempering one's Yin spirit and breaking through to the Divine Acupoint realm was an extremely time-consuming process.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist realm had the power of incense to assist, allowing for extremely rapid breakthroughs to the Divine Acupoint realm.</p><p></p><p>But this Half-Buddha had only advanced from the first step of Treading Heaven to the second step in ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Bai Baixiang curiously: "How did I suddenly get an adopted granddaughter?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, my master is White Crane, she's your adopted daughter, don't you remember?" Bai Baixiang said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>A white crane appeared in Qi Yuan's memories.</p><p></p><p>That crane girl was from the White Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Qi Yuan was stationed in Wugui City, sweeping across the world, that White Crane was quite shameless and directly called Qi Yuan her adopted father.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, she went around telling everyone Qi Yuan was her adopted father.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never actually acknowledged her.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Bai Baixiang with a gaze reserved for idiots: "I'm human, your master is a bird. Can humans give birth to birds?</p><p></p><p>So she's not my daughter.</p><p></p><p>I currently only have two daughters!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Baixiang was stunned for a moment, feeling there was some logic to this, but then said: "No, my master is your adopted daughter!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you as shameless as your master?" Qi Yuan didn't dwell on this further, but asked, "Is your master still with Baize?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Baixiang shook her head, clearly not knowing.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Half-Buddha spoke up: "There are still three months until the Great Buddhist Assembly. At that time... Buddhist disciple Baize should attend."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a singles' gathering?" Qi Yuan said happily.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean he could go begging?</p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha looked embarrassed. </p><p></p><p>This Blood Lord's mouth was asking for a beating.</p><p></p><p>"I request that senior Blood Lord not speak recklessly. When the Great Buddhist Assembly convenes, there may be true Buddhas listening to Buddhist debates from the upper realm, jointly selecting the Holy Buddhist Disciple."</p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha mentioned this with an expression of reverence and excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist realms in the upper world had been at war endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was finally an opportunity to unite and end the conflicts. Half-Buddha was naturally happy about this development.</p><p></p><p>"What use is a Holy Buddhist Disciple?" Qi Yuan asked. "Can they get divine laws from the divine realms for free?"</p><p></p><p>A plan formed in Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Going begging was too troublesome. Why not invest in Baize and have him become the Holy Buddhist Disciple?</p><p></p><p>If he succeeded, wouldn't he have access to all kinds of techniques?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's possible," Half-Buddha replied.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think Baize has the qualities of a Holy Buddhist Disciple?" Qi Yuan asked. "Why don't you all support him?"</p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha's expression turned strange: "Buddhist disciple Baize does have a chance, but he lost the Great Sun Golden Lotus, so he may be held accountable. </p><p></p><p>Unless he can find and return the Great Sun Golden Lotus."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression also turned strange, mimicking Half-Buddha.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Baize would have difficulty becoming the Holy Buddhist Disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus had long been consumed by Qi Yuan to forge his Flawless Crystal Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>There was... no possibility of returning it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of something and secretly asked Half-Buddha: "Do you still need a Buddha?"</p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha: "..."</p><p></p><p>This question, he dared not answer, or rather, could not answer.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Sun Buddha entered nirvana, none of the true Buddhas in the Fifth Heaven submitted to each other.</p><p></p><p>There was no Buddha in the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, jointly selecting a Holy Buddhist Disciple was also to stop the conflicts and temporarily unite the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>But for the Holy Buddhist Disciple to become... the Buddha? That was wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Well... I suppose we do need one," Half-Buddha said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare speak rashly about such important matters. If a true Buddha sensed it, he would be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>"I have a friend who is very handsome and has an affinity with your Buddha. I recommend him to be your Buddha... what do you think?" Qi Yuan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat broke out on Half-Buddha's forehead.</p><p></p><p>He now understood that this person was definitely not a mythical figure!</p><p></p><p>How could a mythical figure dare to be so bold!</p><p></p><p>He must be a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord without a doubt!</p><p></p><p>But even for a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord, he was too daring, actually descending to the lower realm alone!</p><p></p><p>"Well, senior, this humble monk dares not speak rashly about the matter of becoming Buddha.</p><p></p><p>To become Buddha, being handsome is not enough. One must also have profound Buddhist teachings to convince all Buddhas; one must also be able to shake the Buddhist realm and radiate Buddhist light everywhere!" Half-Buddha said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Becoming Buddha was not so simple.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Buddhist realm, there were true Buddhas at the Ultimate Truth realm, but they could not convince the group of Buddhas like the Great Sun Buddha did.</p><p></p><p>One important reason for this was that to become Buddha, one needed to be recognized by the Wondrous Treasure of Creation that was the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire Buddhist realm was a Wondrous Treasure of Creation.</p><p></p><p>To date, only the Buddha had been recognized by the Wondrous Treasure of Creation that was the Buddhist realm.</p><p></p><p>"The points you mentioned, I think my friend - no, several of my friends - could do. </p><p></p><p>Why don't you help recommend them to those above?" Qi Yuan said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan thought he was quite a nice person.</p><p></p><p>Unable to bear seeing the Buddhist realm without a leader, he recommended several people to go be Buddha.</p><p></p><p>To avoid embarrassing the other party, he even used the "advanced sales techniques" mastered by "sales managers", giving the other party choices.</p><p></p><p>It was like asking in a restaurant if you want green tea or milk - most people would choose one of the two. If asked if you want a drink, the person might refuse.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan directly recommended several candidates.</p><p></p><p>"Well... how about I ask around?" </p><p></p><p>Half-Buddha didn't dare refuse.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid this Blood Lord with a somewhat abnormal mind would beat him to death.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the old woman from earlier was like dust in the eyes of beings like them, too insignificant to pay attention to.</p><p></p><p>But this Blood Lord insisted on talking so much with that old woman. His behavior was really too strange and puzzling.</p><p></p><p>"But this humble monk's position is low, and my inquiries may not reach the ears of the true Buddhas."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine, just help me ask around," Qi Yuan said, not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't get an answer, he could just ask directly at the Great Buddhist Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His intentions, presumably all Buddhas could receive.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The former No Return City, now dilapidated, had become a wasteland.</p><p></p><p>The tall, upright man had a wistful look in his eyes: "I once thought of returning home rich and glorious, but where are my fellow villagers?"</p><p></p><p>Seven thousand years ago, the man had broken through the fifth realm, entered the sixth realm, and ascended to the upper realm. </p><p></p><p>After mingling in the upper realm for a thousand years, he had achieved some small successes.</p><p></p><p>Later, he heard about the Buddhist dispute in his homeland, the Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without thinking, he returned directly to the Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Wind Realm was too small to withstand a Buddhist dispute, and it could lead to turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the lower realm to take care of old acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>However, after returning to the lower realm, he discovered he was too weak.</p><p></p><p>He was no match for even a half-Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan felt somewhat disappointed and helpless.</p><p></p><p>It was more enjoyable to stay by the Blood Lord's side, carefree and without worries.</p><p></p><p>After all... the Blood Lord would create miracles.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to be responsible for managing the suona band well.</p><p></p><p>"Old friends have gone east, no longer seeing the red-robed suona band of yesteryear."</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan couldn't help but compose a poem, his voice desolate.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the small old man Kun Xia Daoist's eyes flickered with a smile: "This Blood Lord is quite interesting, he seems to have some luck on his side."</p><p></p><p>After descending to the lower realm, Kun Xia Daoist had gone into hiding.</p><p></p><p>When he met Chen Huan, he deliberately befriended him.</p><p></p><p>After all, he needed to hide and couldn't go around gathering information himself.</p><p></p><p>"To be frank, if the Blood Lord was willing to accept me as his godson, I would immediately kneel and call him father!" Chen Huan said, his eyes filled with deep regret.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn't seized the opportunity back then.</p><p></p><p>On the road, he had also told Kun Xia Daoist some things about the Blood Lord, though he had held back certain details.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Chen Huan's expression changed slightly as he looked towards a desolate tavern: "What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura swept out, and the cultivators in the tavern all changed expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we were saying that the Blood Lord has reappeared in the world..."</p><p></p><p>"The world is getting more chaotic, even an old relic like the Blood Lord has appeared."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, but this is no longer the era of the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the tavern sighed, feeling somewhat regretful about a hero past his prime.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan didn't share this feeling, but instead asked excitedly: "Where is the Blood Lord now?"</p><p></p><p>He was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Blood Lord left carrying the source of world destruction, no one thought he would survive.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Blood Lord was actually still alive - how could he not be excited?</p><p></p><p>Even if it was fake, he had to go see for himself!</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord has no fixed abode. He said he would attend the Great Buddhist Assembly in three months," someone said.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Blood Lord's reappearance was like dropping a pebble in a lake - it barely caused a ripple.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Wind Realm, Buddhism reigned supreme.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Palace or Blood Lord, apart from some interested parties, no one paid attention.</p><p></p><p>The information about the Blood Lord's appearance was actually spread by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If some old acquaintances wanted to see him, they could come to the Great Buddhist Assembly.</p><p></p><p>As for others, Qi Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was still wandering around, accompanying the golden canary and Ning Tao, walking paths he had never walked before.</p><p></p><p>By the way, he was also looking for his mischievous door that had run away from home.</p><p></p><p>He had heard of people leaving home, but this was the first time he'd heard of a door leaving home.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, let's part ways here. I'm going to the Great Buddhist Assembly to see the Blood Lord!" Chen Huan bid farewell to Kun Xia Daoist, feeling very excited now.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to show off a bit in front of the Blood Lord - look, my divine aperture! Of course, what he was actually more excited about was that the Blood Lord hadn't died.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kun Xia Daoist narrowed his eyes: "This humble Daoist is also quite interested in this Blood Lord. Why don't I accompany you to see this legendary figure of the past, and also attend the Great Buddhist Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>Kun Xia Daoist's thoughts were simple.</p><p></p><p>Although he was hiding in the lower realm, he couldn't really act like a grandson.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't dare to act recklessly or build up forces.</p><p></p><p>If he did that, it would be easy for the people of Tai Huang Palace to find him if they came here.</p><p></p><p>The best method was to take over an indigenous force.</p><p></p><p>However, he was extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to make a move on any forces related to the Buddhist country.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Lord and so-called Blood Palace were perfect targets, weren't they?</p><p></p><p>They had some strength, some veterans, and some reputation.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he could use some tricks to turn the Blood Lord into a puppet, and all would be well.</p><p></p><p>As for this Chen Huan, he couldn't make a move on him yet.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chen Huan had come from the upper realm and still had some connections there. If he disappeared, it could cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Kun Xia Daoist's expression was gentle, his eyes smiling.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the lower realm was going smoothly - destiny was on his side!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's too miserable, too miserable!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to be a bald monk, I still want to marry a wife!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi wailed, his expression enough to move people.</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Buddhachild looked at him, his gaze calm: "It's been ten thousand years and you still haven't married a wife. Can you even get married? Whether you marry or not seems to have no effect on you. Why not... join my Buddhist sect?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi's mouth twitched, his expression awkward.</p><p></p><p>What Wuguang Buddhachild said made some sense.</p><p></p><p>Whether he abstained from lust or not made no difference to him, did it? He had lived for over ten thousand years and hadn't lusted after anyone, had he?</p><p></p><p>Should he blame the women of the world for being too bizarre and not to his taste? Or should he... just cut it off?</p><p></p><p>"By the way, there's some news I need to tell you," Wuguang Buddhachild's eyes flashed with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"What news?" Ling Yayi was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Some true Buddhas have received information that the Great Sun Golden Lotus is on the Blood Lord's body."</p><p></p><p>This news had just been learned by Wuguang Buddhachild as well.</p><p></p><p>In the end, what had happened in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons couldn't be kept secret and was learned by some true Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>"So what if it's on Master's body? Can you even find Master?" Ling Yayi wasn't afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>When Master swallowed the source of world destruction and left, the best outcome was that there might be a small piece left when he died.</p><p></p><p>Could these Buddhas have found Master's corpse and called back his soul?</p><p></p><p>"The latest news is that there are rumors the Blood Lord has reappeared and will attend the Great Buddhist Assembly. Perhaps he wants to use this Great Buddhist Assembly to see some old acquaintances."</p><p></p><p>"What?!" Ling Yayi was completely shocked, his body trembling with immense joy, but then his face turned terrified, "If Master appears, what will those true Buddhas do to him?"</p><p></p><p>If Master was still alive and deeply bound to the Great Sun Golden Lotus, he couldn't imagine what would happen.</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Buddhachild shook his head, his expression complex: "This humble monk doesn't know either."</p><p></p><p>The meaning of these words was already very clear.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Lotus definitely couldn't be left in the Blood Lord's body.</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Sun Golden Lotus was taken away, the Blood Lord's fate would be no different from death.</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi's gaze fluctuated, and after a long while he said: "If I become a Holy Buddha's Child, can I save Master's life?"</p><p></p><p>"You can."</p><p></p><p>"Wuguang, I want to shave my head, quick!"</p><p></p><p>"Also, bring some real beauties, ten times the usual number!"</p><p></p><p>"Today I want to challenge my limits!"</p><p></p><p>P.S.: Recommending a xianxia harem novel.

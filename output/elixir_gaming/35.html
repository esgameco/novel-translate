        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Liupiao heard her daughter's words, she felt both a headache and heartache.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators from the Black Mountain Sect are not good people. If you were to deal with other righteous sects, it wouldn't be a problem. But dealing with the Black Mountain Sect, you... being so beautiful, it's going to bring a lot of trouble. Especially since this time the Black Mountain Sect has raised the profit-sharing ratio of the blood crystal mines, it's not going to be easy to resolve.</p><p></p><p>That's why I was thinking, if you get married early, you can leave this kind of thing to your husband."</p><p></p><p>"But we'd have to find someone powerful. That weak-willed person just now, if he were to argue with the Black Mountain Sect over the blood crystal mine profit-sharing, could he really protect our interests?" the woman said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"You were just wary of others, and now you're calling them weak-willed. Sigh, no matter how I look at it, you're right." Liupiao knew her daughter best, her character has always been like this, leaving her quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect, within the Great Liang Kingdom, was merely a second or third-rate sect, without any foundation of Nascent Soul cultivators, and didn't even have any late-stage Qi Condensation experts.</p><p></p><p>But the sect leader of the Black Mountain Sect had taken the powerful demonic cultivator, the Black Chicken Demon, as his sworn father.</p><p></p><p>The status of the Black Mountain Sect has thus risen rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Within the sect, there were several hundred disciples, over a dozen elders, and a few senior elders.</p><p></p><p>Yet with just these few people, their reputation outside was extremely evil.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that a common disciple of the Black Mountain Sect, when going out to the lands under their control, the ordinary commoners would have to kneel and kowtow.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect has reached the point of being able to silence even a crying child at night.</p><p></p><p>Within the Black Mountain Sect, Elder Yulinglong was draped in a black veil, unable to conceal her graceful figure.</p><p></p><p>She was reclining on a white jade chair, exhaling fragrance: "Have you still not investigated the identity and origins of that masked person?"</p><p></p><p>The disciple kneeling on the ground did not dare to look up at this elder.</p><p></p><p>This elder was the number one beauty of the Black Mountain Sect. </p><p></p><p>She was also the woman valued by the Black Chicken Demon.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Black Chicken Demon had not touched her, the rumor was that he was preparing to cultivate her to the Nascent Soul realm, and then take her as his cultivation partner.</p><p></p><p>Within the Black Mountain Sect, Yulinglong's status was even higher than the sect leader.</p><p></p><p>"That masked person, who killed with a sword, must be from Xuanfeng Mountain, there is a strong suspicion." the disciple said, "Elder Xuanfeng has now returned, the sect leader has summoned all the outer disciples and elders, preparing to put pressure on Xuanfeng Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yulinglong's smile became even more bewitching: "It seems the Black Chicken Demon is about to truly enter the late Nascent Soul realm."</p><p></p><p>The disciple kneeling below did not dare to comment on Yulinglong's way of addressing the Black Chicken Demon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there seemed to be a sound of silk falling, Yulinglong gently parted her lips and said to the disciple below: "Dare you climb up here?"</p><p></p><p>The disciple's spirit shook, he knew Yulinglong was dissatisfied with the Black Chicken Demon, but he hurriedly refused: "I dare not!"</p><p></p><p>Yulinglong heard this, patting her chest and laughing: "A man with lust in his heart but no courage, come here, I won't tell anyone."</p><p></p><p>The disciple below broke out in cold sweat, he did not want to stay here any longer, afraid that he would lose control of himself.</p><p></p><p>Between beauty and life, he still knew which one was more important.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much Yulinglong disliked the Black Chicken Demon, he was not someone he could touch.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a loud noise came from outside.</p><p></p><p>The disciple's expression changed, hurriedly leaving: "I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>He did not want to stay here any longer.</p><p></p><p>At this time, at the gate of the Black Mountain Sect, Qi Yuan was holding a precious sword.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it was a precious sword, but in reality, it was a kitchen knife, wrapped in metal by Qi Yuan to look like a sword.</p><p></p><p>He walked across the White Bone Bridge, and with one sword strike, he killed the five disciples guarding the bridge.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The only White Bone Bridge that led into the sect was also severed by him.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Foundation Establishment and Elixir Disciples, the ordinary disciples could only be trapped and die in the Black Mountain Sect, unable to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Thieving scum, state your name! How dare you come to cause trouble in our Black Mountain Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Several Foundation Establishment Elders emerged, fierce and malevolent. Their expressions were filled with extreme fury.</p><p></p><p>It had always been them, the Black Mountain Sect, going to cause trouble at other places. But now, someone dared to come and cause trouble in their Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Black Mountain Sect, you killed my entire family! I have painstakingly cultivated for hundreds of years, and my divine abilities have finally reached completion. Today, I will destroy your Black Mountain Sect!" Qi Yuan roared, also fabricating an identity for himself.</p><p></p><p>"So you're one of the escaped fish." The black-bearded Elder remarked, unsurprised.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mountain Sect often annihilated entire families, so having escaped fish was normal.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years ago, we let you get away. If you had just lived out your days in seclusion, you might have been able to enjoy your twilight years. But now you've come back to the Black Mountain Sect to seek death - how unwise. Your lineage will be exterminated!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was momentarily stunned. He had gotten too immersed in his role.</p><p></p><p>"You actually want to exterminate my lineage!" </p><p></p><p>He said, his eyes glowing red: "You all shall die by my hand!"</p><p></p><p>He said, and with a sweeping horizontal strike of his greatsword! Qi Yuan had already reached the peak of the Qi Refinement realm. </p><p></p><p>In the game, his strength had been constantly growing, feeding back into reality.</p><p></p><p>While his reflected strength was not a hundred times greater, it was still enough for Qi Yuan to look down upon all other Qi Refinement cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could easily slay Foundation Establishment cultivators as well.</p><p></p><p>Through the modified cultivation method, the sword had gained sentience.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the sword, Qi Yuan's strength had reached a new realm.</p><p></p><p>A single slash could lop off the head of an Elixir Disciple!</p><p></p><p>Let alone these mere Foundation Establishment Elders?</p><p></p><p>The powerful gale whipped up by the greatsword directly slammed the three Foundation Establishment Elders into the mountain gate's massive stone.</p><p></p><p>Pah! The Foundation Establishment Elders coughed up fresh blood, their meridians shattered by the impact.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his greatsword and cleaved open the Black Mountain Sect's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years ago, you killed my entire family!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will exterminate your entire sect!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice thundered like rolling clouds, piercing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Black Mountain Sect, the disciples who witnessed the fall of the great Elders trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's power was too formidable.</p><p></p><p>They tried to block him, but it was only courting death - they needed the Elixir Elders to come.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as Qi Yuan broke open the mountain gate, two Elixir Elders emerged from within the Black Mountain Sect.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were filled with endless fury.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the space began to turbulently fluctuate! All the disciples who saw this were filled with renewed vigor.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment Elders and disciples rushed forward, intent on surrounding and attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not hold back.</p><p></p><p>The greatsword swept through, and dozens of disciples were instantly killed on the spot by the powerful gale.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Elders in the sky were enraged.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had seen someone so ruthless, specifically targeting their disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, upon seeing Qi Yuan's techniques, they also realized something: "Was it you who killed the Patriarch Bai Chicken?"</p><p></p><p>This Elixir Elder was the Whirlwind Elder, who had examined the bodies of Patriarch Bai Chicken and the others, and knew much information.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Whirlwind Elder and swung his greatsword: "Since you've discovered the truth, I can't let you live!"</p><p></p><p>He flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The two Elixir Elders' eyes flashed with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Why is there no Golden Core within your body?"</p><p>"You are not an Elixir Disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's greatsword was the only response he gave them.

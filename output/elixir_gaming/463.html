        <h1>Chapter 463</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this strange land, one could not see the stars reflecting across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Unable to bask in the sun, one could only bask in the air.</p><p></p><p>The storage bag opened, and a dazzling array of ice eggs fell to the ground, arranged beside Qi Yuan, making him look like an egg merchant.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the cultivators of Ghost Dominion are too slow. It's been so long, and they're still dawdling!"</p><p></p><p>The stage was set up, and Qi Yuan was just waiting for the actors to enter.</p><p></p><p>However, the efficiency of cultivators in this immortal world was terribly low. They dragged their feet on everything, with no sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>For example, at the last Dao discussion conference, the Linye Tui was mentioned, but after all this time, it still hadn't begun.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan had brought out the ice eggs to provoke the young geniuses of Ghost Dominion, but... until now, those geniuses had only talked tough about accepting the challenge, without actually showing up.</p><p></p><p>"Those who achieve great things must endure loneliness."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was carefree and content.</p><p></p><p>In the game jade slip, the voiceless voice transmitted again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Want to hear another story...?"</p><p></p><p>He discovered that telling stories to the voiceless voice in the game jade slip would also speed up the loading of new games.</p><p></p><p>So, he began to make up stories randomly.</p><p></p><p>"Once upon a time, there was a mountain, and on the mountain was a cow named Red Boy..."</p><p></p><p>"...Alright, that's the end of today's story."</p><p></p><p>"I tell you stories every day. Why don't you tell me about the game's plot outline, so I can familiarize myself with the storyline?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also very curious, or rather expectant, about the new game.</p><p></p><p>Because he was already at the Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>The next world would be where he attained godhood.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he paid great attention to the next game.</p><p></p><p>"It must be very interesting to become a god. Will I have many followers and devotees?"</p><p></p><p>"Will people even erect statues of me and worship me?"</p><p></p><p>"Then, as time passes, a great person will appear and topple the mountain god statues in the wild."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the voiceless voice did not respond to him at all.</p><p></p><p>"According to the principles of exchange and reciprocity, I've told you so many interesting stories and killed many brain cells. Shouldn't you give me some gold coins? Don't be stingy... spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot, you're a blind person who can't speak."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voiceless voice fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Qi Yuan seemed to sense that the voiceless voice was brewing something.</p><p></p><p>About a hundred breaths of time passed, and suddenly, Qi Yuan noticed that in the game jade slip, the icon representing the new game suddenly flashed with a burst of light.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan squinted at this burst of light.</p><p></p><p>"Such rich vitality..."</p><p></p><p>If the original game icon was dark, chaotic, and dilapidated, now it had gained much more vitality, or rather, color.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a desolate wasteland had undergone renovation.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the loading speed of the game increased frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, are you still there?" Qi Yuan called out tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the voiceless voice did not reply.</p><p></p><p>This disappointed Qi Yuan, not knowing what had happened in the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>About three hundred breaths of time passed, and Qi Yuan stared at the game icon, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Did the game... fail to load?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait... did the game company go bankrupt?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in the game jade slip, during this short three hundred breaths of time, the game's loading had sped up frantically, but then... it had died.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of that icon, and the aura it emanated, was as if the game company had gone bankrupt.</p><p></p><p>It was like clicking on an installation package only to find that the game package was corrupted.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, did it go bankrupt?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey... are you still there?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no one responded to him.</p><p></p><p>The game's progress bar turned gray and dark, stagnating.</p><p></p><p>"Folks, who understands? The game I've been anticipating for so long went bankrupt before it even launched. Who's going to compensate me for my wasted youth?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was completely speechless, and also somewhat worried about the voiceless voice.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I, as a player, need to step in and save this bankrupt game company?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm just a game player!"</p><p></p><p>"Unscrupulous merchants and capitalists!"</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to his own interests, Qi Yuan still decided to try and save this game.</p><p></p><p>"If I succeed in saving it, give me some shares. I want to be a shareholder."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered for a moment, then tentatively pushed his soul consciousness into the game jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He tried to see if he could enter the new game.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he had a feeling that something astonishing was happening in the game.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, a powerful restriction prevented Qi Yuan from entering.</p><p></p><p>"It's too tight, I can't get in at all."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the game jade slip thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>The game was broken and couldn't be entered.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could a player enter an unfinished installation package?</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This seemed to be... Qi Yuan thought of something, and the aura around his body changed.</p><p></p><p>"Absolute adaptation!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme principle was deployed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's spirit was constantly changing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Absolute adaptation, with survival at its core. </p><p></p><p>Adapting to everything, adapting to all, he was also adapting, entering this destructive installation package.</p><p></p><p>As his spirit transformed, the supreme principle fluctuated, and in his marrow, there seemed to be a faint rumbling of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"It's not working, my supreme principle isn't fully stabilized yet, I simply can't enter the game."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had a bit of a headache.</p><p></p><p>He had only comprehended the supreme principle for a short time. Forget about those veteran supreme beings, he could barely contend with even ordinary great principles.</p><p></p><p>The supreme principle had not yet truly been engraved and stabilized in his body, spirit, and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me I have to use my clever brain again?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Yuan took out the bottle containing the blood-raising enlightenment pills.</p><p></p><p>The bottle was empty, the pills long since eaten, with only a trace of fragrance remaining.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan poured the immortal liquid into the bottle and shook it vigorously up, down, left and right.</p><p></p><p>"This should have some effect by picking up the scent."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan drank the immortal liquid in one gulp. Instantly he felt his waist wasn't sore, his back didn't hurt, his head became nimble, as if he could carry ten bags of rice up ten floors while doing nine sets of test papers.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of games is programming, is code."</p><p></p><p>"The world is also a large game, composed of code, rules... and so on."</p><p></p><p>"Rules are also the myriad Daos."</p><p></p><p>"The myriad Daos are zeros and ones."</p><p></p><p>"So... the game's code is zeros and ones."</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, the logic is correct, very reasonable, can't find any flaws."</p><p></p><p>Well, with Qi Yuan's brain, if he couldn't find any flaws, it meant the plan was perfect and flawless.</p><p></p><p>"Transform for me!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a strand of Qi Yuan's spirit split at this moment, turning into two drops of crimson blood.</p><p></p><p>These two drops of blood formed the numbers "0" and "1" respectively.</p><p></p><p>"Is this code?" Qi Yuan's expression was happy.</p><p></p><p>However, having lost this small section of his spirit, Qi Yuan's face turned pale, as if he had suffered a great loss of vitality.</p><p></p><p>He had sacrificed too much for this game.</p><p></p><p>"I've lost so much spirit blood, I'm about to get hypoglycemia. Hey... I have founder's shares!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted at the game.</p><p></p><p>The "0" and "1" spirit blood merged into the game at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Absolute adaptation was also constantly exerting its unique effect.</p><p></p><p>The originally dark and lifeless game icon with its progress bar stuck seemed to gain a glimmer of life again after receiving these two drops of blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan breathed a sigh of relief: "It's finally working."</p><p></p><p>The game started loading again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm exhausted."</p><p></p><p>Having lost two drops of spirit blood, an intense feeling of drowsiness came over him. Qi Yuan just wanted to have a good long sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Silent Voice, I've made a big sacrifice this time, you'd better remember to compensate me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan called out, hugged the ice egg, and fell asleep immediately.</p><p></p><p>To revive the game, Qi Yuan had expended quite a lot, no less than if he had been through a great battle.</p><p></p><p>As he slept deeply, in the jade slip, the game icon was slowly loading.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of light appeared from time to time.</p><p></p><p>A voice of Silent Voice sounded, different from before, this time seemingly carrying a bit of spirituality, or rather... not silent.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>A single ethereal word echoed through heaven and earth, but the sleeping Qi Yuan didn't hear this voice at all.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Silent Voice seemed to let out a helpless sigh, and finally fell silent, disappearing completely.</p><p></p><p>The game was still loading.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, in the Flower Moon Wonderland, dozens of streaks of light flashed across the originally dark sky.</p><p></p><p>A man wearing golden thread dark armor, holding the Banner of Ten Thousand Souls, stood in mid-air, his voice vast like shocking thunder.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Blood Robe? Come out and face death!"</p><p></p><p>A full forty-seven geniuses gathered, almost all of mythical status, holding Banners of Ten Thousand Souls, coming with aggressive momentum and an imposing presence.</p><p></p><p>Just these geniuses alone, if they went to a world without a Yang Spirit Celestial Lord presiding, could easily overturn an entire world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, forty-seven geniuses gathered in the clouds, hundreds of great lords descended, all shouting loudly, wanting to call out Blood Robe.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Qi Yuan was too sleepy and didn't hear their voices at all.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you're afraid of me and hiding like a turtle?"</p><p></p><p>Not getting a response from Blood Robe, Mo Zhong angrily shouted.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses also revealed mocking expressions.</p><p></p><p>"He dares to talk big, but there's no trace of the person."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

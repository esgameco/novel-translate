        <h1>Chapter 356</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This mission issued by the base was quite special.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat similar to the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, but really only the character relationships were alike.</p><p></p><p>The goal of these mission participants was to protect "Zhu Yingtai's" safety and prevent him from being killed by "Ma Wencai". </p><p></p><p>At the same time, they needed to find Ma Wencai.</p><p></p><p>The reason Qi Yuan used Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai as an analogy for this "love triangle" story was because in this story, Ma Wencai was a horse demon.</p><p></p><p>After entering the game world, the first thing Qi Yuan did was arrest "Zhu Yingtai".</p><p></p><p>To avoid trouble, Qi Yuan directly knocked the person unconscious, then put them in a sack.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qi Yuan was still very kind and considerate of the captive's feelings, and did not force them to do anything unwilling.</p><p></p><p>So before knocking out "Zhu Yingtai" Wang Yuanyu, he thoughtfully took out several sacks and asked Wang Yuanyu which color she preferred.</p><p></p><p>It could be said he was very democratic and considerate.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after Wang Yuanyu chose the black sack, Qi Yuan carried the unconscious Wang Yuanyu and traveled thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>He killed and killed, nearly exterminating all the demons and monsters in this world.</p><p></p><p>Only after the demons and monsters were exterminated did Qi Yuan go to find the final horse demon's lair.</p><p></p><p>The horse demon's lair was naturally no match for him, and was completely slaughtered by him.</p><p></p><p>As for "Ma Wencai" Ma Longhun's demon family, they were wiped out entirely by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that Ma Longhun had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In order to find Ma Longhun, Qi Yuan took action on two fronts.</p><p></p><p>First, he had someone impersonate him to create a Demon Suppression Court to search for Ma Longhun.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Qi Yuan secretly found people to bury Ma Longhun's family in the name of the "Holy Reason Church".</p><p></p><p>The Holy Reason Church was a small religious organization.</p><p></p><p>This church advocated for the coexistence of humans and demons, and natural harmony.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... most of the members of this church were humans.</p><p></p><p>During the war between demons and humans when humanity was in decline, they advocated for humans to give up resistance in order to coexist peacefully with demons.</p><p></p><p>After the Holy Reason Church buried Ma Longhun's family, Qi Yuan applied through special channels to become the gravekeeper of this cemetery.</p><p></p><p>He sat here waiting for Ma Longhun to come pay respects to his demon clan and parents.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, three years passed without any sign of Ma Longhun.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Suppression Court also failed to find Ma Longhun's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"Wiping out an entire family is really a technical job. I made such a good plan before coming, yet still can't find one person," Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, light footsteps could be heard in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it's time to eat."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu was wearing a wide-sleeved cyan gauze robe, with a white jade belt around her waist. On the belt was embroidered a special bird.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, her head was covered with a black sack, only revealing her eyes and mouth. From a distance, one could not make out her facial features.</p><p></p><p>This black sack was also Qi Yuan being very generous and considerate to the beauty, specially asking what color she liked before covering her.</p><p></p><p>The reason Qi Yuan did this was to protect Wang Yuanyu's safety, and also for fear of scaring away Ma Longhun.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu placed three plates of food in front of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A faint fragrance wafted through the air, with various strange foods on the plates.</p><p></p><p>They were stir-fried cicadas, deep-fried dung beetles, and steamed crawling insects.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these dishes, Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a helpless expression: "Are you a bird? Making these insect feasts every day?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu said reluctantly: "It's more fitting for your identity."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I'm confining you for your own good," Qi Yuan began to morally blackmail Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>As a person from the Blue Star, Qi Yuan was skilled in moral blackmail techniques.</p><p></p><p>I'm doing this for your own good.</p><p></p><p>You're so rich, why don't you donate more money.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu's eyes were complex: "Why did you knock me out and bring me here?"</p><p></p><p>She was also very confused.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, she went out for a spring outing with her girlfriends, but encountered a strange man.</p><p></p><p>That strange man was Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan was holding over a dozen sacks in his hand, asking her which one she liked.</p><p></p><p>She felt it was bizarre, but still chose one.</p><p></p><p>Then she fainted.</p><p></p><p>When she woke up again, she was in this cemetery.</p><p></p><p>"I was entrusted by an old friend to come protect you," Qi Yuan said softly. "The outside world is too dangerous. After ensuring your safety, I'll let you go."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu glanced at Qi Yuan, her expression changing several times. In the end she didn't say anything and slowly left.</p><p></p><p>About a quarter of an hour later, Wang Yuanyu arrived at her bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>This house was located deep in the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>As Wang Yuanyu entered the bamboo house, suddenly a flash of light appeared and a black shadow emerged.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this black shadow, Wang Yuanyu's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Madam Wang, have you investigated clearly?"</p><p></p><p>This black shadow was actually an old woman, with a somewhat pointed mouth resembling a bird's beak.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the identity of this gravekeeper should be... a bloodline descendant from the Death Qi World?"</p><p></p><p>"Death Qi World?" Wang Yuanyu was surprised, hearing this name for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"To avoid the Dawn's Call, the Martial Lords of the Origin Realm joined forces to bring fated people from the End Realm into the Death Qi World to carry out missions.</p><p></p><p>Their mission should be to protect Miss.</p><p></p><p>That's why this person brought Miss to his side.</p><p></p><p>Now, there are undercurrents in this Mountain and Sea Scroll, and the Origin Realm is also fraught with danger. Miss might as well stay here. There's no rush to return until the master regains his strength."</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang explained quickly.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Wang Yuanyu was just an ordinary member of the Mountain and Sea Scroll, but in reality, she was a bloodline descendant of a powerful Martial Lord from the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Madam Wang came from the Origin Realm to protect Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Wang Yuanyu nodded.</p><p></p><p>With Madam Wang present, her memories were also gradually awakening.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, this servant has found Tu Kongming's whereabouts. He is very worried about Miss's safety. Would you like me to bring him to see Miss?" Madam Wang mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This Tu Kongming was the Liang Shanbo in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was Wang Yuanyu's classmate and good friend, and had always been pursuing Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu paused when she heard this name.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young miss hesitate, Madam Wang continued: "Tu Kongming is like Miss, one of the only two people in this realm with direct bloodline of a Martial Lord, able to enter the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>This person can be befriended, while the others are all false."</p><p></p><p>In the Mountain and Sea Scroll, everything was false.</p><p></p><p>Only Wang Yuanyu and Tu Kongming were real, able to enter the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu frowned: "I didn't expect he was also a direct bloodline descendant of a Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>By the way, what about Qi Yuan? He's a bloodline descendant, can he enter the Origin Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Madam Wang's eyes flashed with wariness, then she said: "Among bloodline descendants, there are also some direct bloodlines that can see the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Most are ordinary people. Qi Yuan doesn't have the mark of a Martial Lord, so he can't enter the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if taken as a servant, it probably wouldn't work."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, disappointment flashed in Wang Yuanyu's eyes. She also understood that apart from those with direct bloodlines of Martial Lords like themselves, other people, unless they became Martial Lords themselves, even Martial Kings couldn't enter the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Mountain and Sea Scroll, without becoming a Martial</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Master, in the end it is false, unable to transform falsehood into truth and enter the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of this, the head of the Demon Suppression Court who slaughtered all the demons in this realm has quite good talent. With that level of strength, he should have already been marked by the Martial Lord and can be brought into the Origin Realm. However, he likely belongs to another Martial Lord and cannot be taken as a servant."</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang was at the Martial King realm, so when mentioning the head of the Demon Suppression Court, she remained proud and unafraid. After all, she came from the Origin Realm and had obtained Martial Lord level martial techniques. In her eyes, the Martial King of the Demon Suppression Court was fragile and insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity," Wang Yuanyu casually remarked, unclear whether she was lamenting Qi Yuan or the head of the Demon Suppression Court.</p><p></p><p>"Young Miss, we are currently in a weak position and need to borrow external forces. Tu Kongming would be a great help. This old servant suggests we should maintain good relations with Tu Kongming. According to our calculations, he should be the chosen one of this Mountain and Sea Scroll," Lady Wang continued to advise.</p><p></p><p>"This... would Mr. Qi Yuan disagree with him coming?" Wang Yuanyu asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang paused briefly, then said: "Young Miss, why care about the feelings of someone with inferior bloodline? This world belongs to our direct bloodline, it belongs to the Martial Lords. Other inferior bloodlines are just... drops of blood, not even qualified to enter the real world."</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and Sea Scroll was a fictional world. The real world, of course, was the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Wang, don't say such things. He has protected me after all and is my benefactor. Regarding Tu Kongming, I will personally ask for his opinion," Wang Yuanyu said with a hint of anger and authority in her voice.</p><p></p><p>Lady Wang immediately lowered her head, her body trembling. Clearly, though her strength was greater than Wang Yuanyu's, the bloodline pressure still existed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, rain began to fall.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu sat in the pavilion, staring blankly at Qi Yuan outside.</p><p></p><p>Strange sounds came, but Wang Yuanyu was already used to them.</p><p></p><p>"You consumed 100 drops of demon blood and gained 100 days of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"You consumed 1000 drops of demon blood and gained 1000 days of cultivation, greatly increasing your power."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Wang Yuanyu approached and asked Qi Yuan: "Mr. Qi, may I ask you a question?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was cultivating, opened his eyes and looked at Wang Yuanyu under the black sack.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a good mood today, so I'll answer one question from you, NPC."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was in a good mood. According to the date, today was his wedding anniversary with Little Jia and Goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>"If one day you suddenly discovered that this world was all false, carefully designed and constructed by someone... what would you do?" Wang Yuanyu asked her doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you NPC have finally awakened and realized this world... is false. Not bad, not bad, you've made progress!" Qi Yuan looked at Wang Yuanyu with new respect. </p><p></p><p>He had played so many games, and those NPCs never realized it was just a game.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Yuanyu didn't know whether to laugh or cry. </p><p></p><p>She was of the Martial Lord's direct bloodline and was real. Those of Qi Yuan's bloodline and others in the Mountain and Sea Scroll were the false ones.</p><p></p><p>"The world is inherently false. In this world, only I am real, and... whoever I consider real becomes real," Qi Yuan looked at Wang Yuanyu calmly. "This has always been my way of dealing with the world, and it works well. When I see villains or enemies, I just say, 'Evil creature, I can see at a glance you're not a real person!'"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Yuanyu pondered.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, her past memories had been continuously resurfacing.</p><p></p><p>She felt somewhat lost.</p><p></p><p>In her past memories, she and Tu Kongming were a divine couple in their previous life, mutually in love, but... they encountered a horse demon hunting them down. That horse demon forcibly separated and killed them.</p><p></p><p>Later, her ancestor and Tu Kongming's ancestor placed their true spirits into the Mountain and Sea Scroll, intending to resurrect them.</p><p></p><p>As long as the three of them retraced their original path, they could truly transform falsehood into truth and be resurrected in the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>But... now when she thought of Tu Kongming, she felt nothing.</p><p></p><p>Tu Kongming was indeed quite handsome, but compared to Mr. Qi Yuan, it was like comparing a celestial being to a toad.</p><p></p><p>Having seen Qi Yuan's handsome and beautiful face, when she thought of Tu Kongming again, she couldn't feel a trace of love.</p><p></p><p>Now, she doubted whether her previous self truly liked Tu Kongming.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, do you believe in your previous life?" Wang Yuanyu asked again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shook his head, his expression resolute: "I am who I am, the self I've been since I became conscious. I have no previous life."</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly have a previous life?</p><p></p><p>He had transmigrated his body, not his soul.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he looked at himself every day, and his eyes could obtain useful information. All this information showed that he was just an ordinary transmigrator from the Blue Star, with no powerful background or impressive previous life.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu was slightly stunned, then continued to ask: "I've awakened some memories of my previous life. In those memories, I was mutually in love with someone. But now, when I see that person, I feel no attraction at all. Does this mean I've... transferred my affections?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu felt somewhat pained.</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's handsome face in front of her, she didn't even feel moved.</p><p></p><p>As for Tu Kongming's... appearance, how could she possibly be attracted?</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan glanced at Wang Yuanyu: "Do you have a new love interest?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"If not, then it's not a transfer of affection. It means... you didn't love him even in your previous life. It's just false memories," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Like Ning Tao, who awakened memories of her previous life and immediately loved like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's view, true feelings, even after experiencing the vicissitudes of time and countless years of tempering, would not fade but grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, Qi Yuan felt such feelings were extremely rare and unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>"False memories?" Wang Yuanyu was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The reason you're troubled now is because... you're not strong enough. If you were big enough, strong enough, omniscient and omnipotent, no troubles would exist. Young lady, I see you have good talent. Would you like me to give you a grandmother to help you cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Wang Yuanyu had good talent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qi Yuan vaguely sensed that she seemed somewhat extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>So he thought, should he place his daughter's divine infant in her?</p><p></p><p>"Become stronger?" Wang Yuanyu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, as long as you're big enough and strong enough, all problems in the world cease to be problems," Qi Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"This... I can understand becoming stronger, but being big enough... I don't quite understand."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, this involves deep cultivation insights. For example, to mortals, the strongest manifestation in the world is omniscience and omnipotence. I don't think so. Rather, it's... being big. As long as you're big enough, you're the strongest."</p><p></p><p>"??" Wang Yuanyu was confused.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan remembered a meme from Blue Star: "Sister, check out the inner wear, avoid the lightning."</p><p></p><p>After talking about the universe and stars, shouldn't we look at legs?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sky, a hint of complexity in his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Only... three years left?"</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of the myriad ways was only at 3% progress. It would be impossible to reach perfection in three years.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zero One beside him hesitated to speak: "Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what is it?" Qi Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, nothing." Zero One's voice remained cold, as if devoid of emotion like a machine.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One, you've changed since you evolved," Qi Yuan said, stretching lazily.</p><p></p><p>"Zero One has not changed, and remains Master's most loyal servant," Zero One said, performing a mechanical courtesy. "Alleviating Master's worries is Zero One's first principle!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, good." Qi Yuan continued to close his eyes, comprehending the myriad ways.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, after entering the Scroll of Mountains and Seas and visiting many worlds, his understanding of the myriad ways had progressed very quickly.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how fast, there were still limitations.</p><p></p><p>Moonlight fell on Zero One's mechanical arm as it stood by the river, looking at its own reflection in the clear water below. Its voice murmured: "Is everything about to end?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Origin Land.</p><p></p><p>Within the Eastern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of titled Martial Lords gathered.</p><p></p><p>At this time, their expressions were quite solemn.</p><p></p><p>The woman at the lead spoke: "The worlds are about to converge. It's time for us old folks to take action. We must obey the Eastern Lord's orders, unite the worlds, revive the Ancestral Demon Lord, and aid the Eastern Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords present all nodded: "Yes, it's time for us to act!"</p><p></p><p>"The memory fragments have been refined. Now we just need to piece them together to create the Ancestral Demon Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"It's time to harvest the representatives of Heavenly Mandate as well."</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords gathered to discuss various details.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Black Deer Martial Lord suddenly said: "The Celestial Venerable... seems to have a connection with those memory fragments. Will he... try to stop us?"</p><p></p><p>For the Eastern Alliance, each story in the Scroll of Mountains and Seas was meant to reshape the memory fragments of the Ancestral Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Then, piece them together.</p><p></p><p>As long as 60% of the worlds followed their original trajectories, the plan would be largely successful.</p><p></p><p>The rest was simply a matter of killing and devouring.</p><p></p><p>In the end, all the false ones would die, with only one person surviving.</p><p></p><p>The sole survivor would be the Ancestral Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>As for gathering... Heavenly Mandate? Kill all the Restarters in the world, and gather the Heavenly Mandate onto the Ancestral Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Demon Lord would then regain all his power.</p><p></p><p>"Trust that the Celestial Venerable will prioritize the greater good," said one titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"They were created by the Eastern Lord in the first place, they are false. They should fulfill their destined fate, sacrifice themselves, and achieve the One," said another titled Martial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Self-sacrifice is the true meaning of their birth!"</p><p></p><p>"They never had a chance to be born. It was the Eastern Lord who gave them life."</p><p></p><p>"They are destined to perish. Now... we are simply changing the executioner from the Great Calamity to ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"The destruction of the world cannot be stopped. The Dawn's Call is imminent. It's time... to make a choice."</p><p></p><p>"Everything for the world!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if we perish, we must protect the world!"</p><p></p><p>"Whoever dares to obstruct, kill without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>"Killing a million people to save the world is worth it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the sacred land, on the Third Heaven, an old man sat on the Fishing Platform, fishing in all the heavens.</p><p></p><p>A voice came: "An Immortal has descended to that strange land."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, who is it?" the old man asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"His name is Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of him," the old man shook his head. "But he's very bold, daring to scheme for even that strange land."</p><p></p><p>"He seems to have some connection to the Moon God Palace," the voice said vaguely.</p><p></p><p>"Moon God Palace?" The fishing old man hesitated upon hearing this, then said, "If it's the Moon God Palace, that explains it. The Moon God Palace is in a precarious situation now. If they don't find a way to break the deadlock, I'm afraid they'll fall from the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, their luck is bad, to have set their sights on that strange land."</p><p></p><p>"What's so special about that strange land? I've heard that many Immortals are extremely wary of it."</p><p></p><p>"There is a member of the Holy Light Clan in that sacred land."</p><p></p><p>"What... the legendary Holy Light Clan!" As an Immortal sitting in the Nine Heavens, there were few things in this world that could disturb his emotions.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Because... the Holy Light Clan was a taboo, a taboo among Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"So it's the Holy Light Clan. It seems that Immortal's schemes will ultimately come to nothing."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Clan had an extraordinary origin, often appearing in strange lands.</p><p></p><p>This clan had an extremely powerful innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>This ability was called the Words of Holy Light.</p><p></p><p>Whatever the Holy Light Clan said, those who heard it would believe it to be true.</p><p></p><p>Once, an Immortal of the Lesser Principle Realm entered a strange land and encountered a member of the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>That Holy Light Clan member said, "I am your father."</p><p></p><p>And that Lesser Principle Realm Immortal actually believed it to be true.</p><p></p><p>The Words of Holy Light were just that domineering.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, generally speaking, Immortals would avoid strange lands with Holy Light Clan members.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they were very likely to perish and become nourishment for the Holy Light Clan.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Light Clan is too unbeatable. Unless one's realm is much higher, one will definitely be deceived.</p><p></p><p>Even if one's realm is much higher, there's still a chance of being deceived," the fishing old man sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Words of Holy Light are comparable to the Principles of the Nine Heavens, simply irresistible," said another Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I have some karmic connection with the Moon God Palace. I should pass on this information about the Holy Light Clan to them," the fishing old man said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Moon God Palace didn't know this information, which was why they sent an Immortal to the lower realm to scheme for that strange land.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, even if we tell them now it's too late.</p><p></p><p>That strange land is in the lower realm. When an Immortal descends to the lower realm, if they don't capture the strange land and turn it into their own star, they can't return to the upper realm."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, the Moon God Palace will lose another Immortal. It's difficult, difficult, difficult. Are we about to witness the fall of a sacred land?"</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, the murmurs were filled with endless sighs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Snow fell in the bitter cold, all things at peace.</p><p></p><p>The robot Zero One held Xie Xinsu, sitting on the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>The wide river was covered with a thick layer of ice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wore a white robe, the same color as the snow, blending together so that the boundaries were indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>Snow fell on their shoulders as Zero One, Xie Xinsu, and Qi Yuan were all bathed in this snowfall.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, everything was a vast expanse of white.</p><p></p><p>"The myriad ways of the world are too numerous..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan couldn't help but sigh at this time.</p><p></p><p>Snow had its own way.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord had once said that snowflakes don't talk because they don't have mouths.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wanted to comprehend the way of snow. The most effective method would be to communicate with snowflakes that had mouths.</p><p></p><p>"You snowflake, why don't you grow a mouth? If you don't grow a mouth to speak your way, how am I supposed to know what your way is? Always making people guess!" Qi Yuan couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Don't try to guess the thoughts of snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>All the myriad ways had to be guessed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the robot Zero One couldn't help but laugh: "Master, anything is possible in this world.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, in the next moment, you might have an epiphany and understand all the myriad ways?"</p><p></p><p>If others heard this, they definitely wouldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was different. He nodded seriously: "You're right, anything is possible.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, in the next moment, all the myriad ways of the world might take a liking to me, grow mouths, and frantically introduce themselves."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also wildly imagining. With his great charm, the myriad ways might want to date him...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Love, that's normal, right? After all, it's just a game. Anything could happen.</p><p></p><p>What if this game turns out to be a romance?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice called out, with a slight tremor:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan turned around and saw a young woman. </p><p></p><p>She was dressed youthfully, with slouchy socks on her slender legs.</p><p></p><p>"Dr. Zhong Niao, long time no see," Qi Yuan said calmly as he looked at Zhong Niao.</p><p></p><p>The one greeting him was Qi Yuan's doctor, who had previously treated him for mental illness.</p><p></p><p>Later, this doctor had also embarked on the path of immortality. </p><p></p><p>After so many years, she had reached the peak of Foundation Establishment, just one step away from Core Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, I... I have a favor to ask of you!" Zhong Niao stammered.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she had mustered up a lot of courage to come find Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Qi Yuan said, his gaze clear as he looked at Zhong Niao.</p><p></p><p>"Lately, my nightmares have been getting worse and worse..." Back then, Zhong Niao had told Qi Yuan about her nightmares.</p><p></p><p>In the dreams, many women who looked just like her would stab her to death with knives.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Qi Yuan had said it was due to kidney deficiency.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was having this nightmare again, and the dreams were becoming clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>"Your kidney deficiency is getting worse," Qi Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhong Niao felt somewhat helpless. </p><p></p><p>She wanted to say: Brother, you've swallowed stars and you're still saying I have kidney deficiency?</p><p></p><p>But at this moment she also began to doubt - could it be that she really did have kidney deficiency?</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi, can kidney deficiency be cured?" Plagued by nightmares, Zhong Niao could only turn to Qi Yuan for help.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. Kill the people who are killing you."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Zhong Niao was confused.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan looked up and said: "Look at the sky. I estimate that soon, the other worlds within the Mountain and Sea Scroll will appear here.</p><p></p><p>You can just think of them... as versions of you from parallel universes.</p><p></p><p>They will kill each other until only one person remains alive."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Zhong Niao was bewildered and utterly shocked. </p><p></p><p>Versions of her from parallel worlds would come to kill her?</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry," Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a smile, "The worlds won't merge until I become the Supreme Martial God of All Paths.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what will happen after they merge?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan maintained a certain vigilance towards Dong Jun, this game boss.</p><p></p><p>Because in all the games Qi Yuan had played, there was always a final boss.</p><p></p><p>In this game, who seemed most like the boss?</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Dong Jun.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this person's words seemed to carry an inherent charm - whoever heard them would believe.</p><p></p><p>If not for this quality, Qi Yuan might really have thought Dong Jun was trying to save the world and fight against the Root Demon.</p><p></p><p>But now, Qi Yuan's nose told him that Dong Jun was a liar, speaking falsehoods.</p><p></p><p>Oh come on, did he even need to think about it? Anyone who dared deceive him, Qi Yuan, had to be a bad person, right? Or could it be some beautiful woman?</p><p></p><p>As for saving the world?</p><p></p><p>This world belonged to Qi Yuan! After all, once he became the Supreme Martial God of All Paths, this world would be his.</p><p></p><p>If the world was destroyed, he would fall from the realm of Supreme Martial God.</p><p></p><p>So he would protect this world! Qi Yuan would save it himself.</p><p></p><p>The Root Demon seemed powerful, somewhat similar in origin to his Divine Ability of Heart Demon Summoning - Lord of the Illusory Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, Qi Yuan would activate the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra and tell the Root Demon, "I am your father."</p><p></p><p>Would the Root Demon still invade this world then? No.</p><p></p><p>If the Root Demon didn't invade, didn't that mean the world didn't need to be destroyed?</p><p></p><p>So what was all this killing about, supporting Dong Jun? Qi Yuan had his own calculations.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Qi Yuan softly said to this world:</p><p></p><p>"Solidify."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Primordial Land.</p><p></p><p>Countless Martial Lords in the Eastern Alliance suddenly changed expression at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why has the progress of world fusion... stalled?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is happening?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Land of Endings, some unknown force is resisting the fusion of the Mountain and Sea Scroll!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords immediately thought of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Yuan would have such tremendous power to accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Heavenly Venerable doing? Why would he sabotage Dong Jun's plans?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, isn't it obvious? Within the Mountain and Sea Scroll, he prevented the Sky Mending Pavilion from completing their mission.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he's targeting Dong Jun. He wants to let this world be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Heavenly Venerable isn't that kind of person!"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Lords present discussed heatedly, with many thoughts in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Some felt it was a misunderstanding, while others believed Qi Yuan was secretly sabotaging things.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You're not wrong. I am the one preventing the fusion of the Mountain and Sea Scroll."</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, Qi Yuan appeared in a long robe.</p><p></p><p>Zero One stood behind him, holding a cat in her arms, curiously surveying this world.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, what do you intend by doing this?" The Black Deer Martial Lord's face was gloomy, no longer as amiable as before.</p><p></p><p>"After I become the Supreme Martial God of All Paths, I will allow the worlds to merge.</p><p></p><p>If they merge now, there are too many paths. I'd have to waste a lot of time." Qi Yuan yawned.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, this absolutely must not be done. If the worlds don't merge, Dong Jun's dao companion cannot be revived. How can we... support Dong Jun? How can we fight against the great calamity?</p><p></p><p>Once the Dawn's Call begins, we will all die!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes held a smile: "There's no need to revive Dong Jun's dao companion. I'll go face the great calamity myself!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, Dong Jun once said that only with his dao companion's revival can the great calamity be resolved.</p><p></p><p>Although your strength is formidable, I'm afraid you're no match for the great calamity!" The Black Deer Martial Lord said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>He seemed pained and distressed, as if worried Qi Yuan had gone astray.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even faced the great calamity yet. How do you know I'm not a match for it?" Qi Yuan said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Dong Jun said the only way to save the world is for his dao companion to be revived!" A titled Martial Lord said decisively. "The Heavenly Venerable going certainly won't work."</p><p></p><p>"If there was an omniscient and omnipotent god, could they save the world?" Qi Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Certainly not!" A titled Martial Lord said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Certainly not!" Over a dozen titled Martial Lords echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, interesting." At this point, Qi Yuan had confirmed his suspicions. "I've grown a brain."</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, please turn back from this misguided path! Don't ruin Dong Jun's plans out of selfish motives!" A titled Martial Lord said solemnly, trying to reason with him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said lazily: "Haven't you noticed that your trust in Dong Jun is a bit excessive? This kind of trust is unhealthy.</p><p></p><p>When things are too abnormal, there must be something strange going on.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, you've all been brainwashed by Dong Jun! An omniscient and omnipotent god can't solve the problem, but Dong Jun can? This is a huge joke, full of holes.</p><p></p><p>Now let me show you how a brain with independent, free will and thought - one that hasn't been brainwashed - would answer this question. Old Thunder God, come here, I have a question for you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to use facts to reveal the truth.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Old Thunder God appeared.</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords swallowed their words, wanting to see what Qi Yuan would do.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, if an omniscient and omnipotent god couldn't solve a problem, but I said I could solve it, would you believe me?" Qi Yuan asked the Old Thunder God confidently.</p><p></p><p>He believed the Old Thunder God would set a good example for these Martial Lords, making them realize they had been brainwashed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Old Thunder God appeared to ponder, then said: "This old one... believes you."</p><p></p><p>"..." Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

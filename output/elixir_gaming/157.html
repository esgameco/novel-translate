        <h1>Chapter 157</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the dazzling array of techniques in his storage bag with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it feels good to have subordinates."</p><p></p><p>"It would be even better if the techniques from the Liufeng Realm were useful to me."</p><p></p><p>"With so many techniques, it should be enough for me to advance to the Divine Infant stage and push to the middle stage of Golden Core, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>For Qi Yuan, deducing the Golden Core Great Dao was like an bottomless pit. </p><p></p><p>After all, how many planets and stars are there in the universe? Qi Yuan did not know.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to devour them all would indeed consume a great deal.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Golden Core Great Dao I deduced before should be enough for the Solar True Fire in my Golden Core to devour a few planets, right?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked inward at his dantian, where there was a projection of a golden core, with flames burning vigorously on it.</p><p></p><p>One day on earth is a hundred years in heaven.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that before long, he would be able to devour some planets for fun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stopped pondering and fully immersed himself in studying the techniques he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Great Shang Kingdom, at the Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong of Divine Medicine Peak had an ashen face, and True Lord Ku Mu's expression was not much better.</p><p></p><p>In front of them stood a young man dressed in white robes.</p><p></p><p>"True Lord Ku Mu, you and I are from the same clan, how could I deceive you? And Elder Xuan Chong, the three of us are from the same clan, we should prioritize the interests of the Wood Clan!" The young man in white was named Mu Kong.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Hong Lian slaughtered the Wood Clan, he was not in the clan and barely escaped with his life.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu looked at Mu Kong, anger rising in his eyes: "The interests of the Wood Clan? It's nothing but your own interests!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Kong smiled calmly and said: "With your talent, True Lord Ku Mu, when will you be able to cultivate to the Purple Palace realm? My master, the Supreme Elder of the Red Sword Gate, is a Purple Palace cultivator. As long as you, True Lord Ku Mu, offer up the 'Wood Origin Scripture' and Great Shang serves the Red Sword Gate, once my master recovers from his injuries, he can avenge the Wood Clan!"</p><p></p><p>He spoke grandly and imposingly.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>The Red Sword Gate had coveted Great Shang for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The old emperor of Great Shang had the shadow of the Red Sword Gate behind him.</p><p></p><p>Now that the old emperor's support had failed, they sent Mu Kong as an emissary?</p><p></p><p>"True Lord Ku Mu, give me an answer within three days, otherwise... when my master comes here, he won't be so reasonable." Mu Kong looked down on everything, "Today, well, I'll stay at... Seven-Color Peak. I've heard that the master of Seven-Color Peak is peerlessly beautiful, I wonder if I'll have the fortune to see her?"</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu's face was ashen: "The master of Seven-Color Peak is in closed-door cultivation and does not see outsiders."</p><p></p><p>He did not know that the top of Seven-Color Peak was already empty.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Mu Kong said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>His strength was weak, merely at the Yuan Dan stage, so he naturally did not dare to offend Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>But... when his master came, the outcome would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"True Lord Ku Mu, Elder Xuan Chong, think it over carefully, everything should be for the greater good. If my master doesn't receive my message in three days, he will personally come to the Divine Light Sect."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Mu Kong walked towards Seven-Color Peak with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu and Elder Xuan Chong stood in the great hall, their expressions extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"This is outrageous!" True Lord Ku Mu wanted nothing more than to destroy Mu Kong with one palm.</p><p></p><p>But considering the Supreme Elder of the Red Sword Gate, he ultimately could not act.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would plunge the Divine Light Sect into a crisis of destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Is the feng shui here not good?" The usually silent Elder Xuan Chong spoke up.</p><p></p><p>He had been at the Divine Light Sect for several hundred years, quietly cultivating, never involving himself in sect affairs.</p><p></p><p>But in these hundred years, he discovered that this small Divine Infant sect had many problems.</p><p></p><p>Within the sect, he had discovered over a hundred spies.</p><p></p><p>There were also some strange disciples, stewards, and elders.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought those people joined the Divine Light Sect with special purposes.</p><p></p><p>But the result... was very normal, they never caused trouble.</p><p></p><p>The problematic individuals formed an unproblematic sect.</p><p></p><p>First there was the war of a hundred kingdoms, and now the threat of the Red Sword Gate. Elder Xuan Chong really felt the feng shui here was problematic.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He came from a great clan and had gone through endless hardships to reach this point. His expression was resolute: "The mandate of heaven may end, but humans... are endless."</p><p></p><p>He did not believe in destiny, he believed everything had to be fought for by oneself.</p><p></p><p>"Stop talking nonsense, are you handing over the 'Wood Origin Scripture' or not?" Elder Xuan Chong glared at True Lord Ku Mu.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu sighed: "Alas, the Eastern Land Genius Battle should have already begun, I wonder how Fu Lu and Qi Yuan are doing."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder Xuan Chong's eyes also held a trace of regret: "It's a pity, the time given to Qi Yuan was too short, otherwise... if he had formed his Golden Core, he might have had a chance to enter the top 100 of the Eastern Land Genius Rankings and bring back the Purple Gold Gourd. With the Purple Gold Gourd, our Wood Clan would have a glimmer of hope for revival."</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu said bitterly: "With Hong Lian still alive, how can we revive?"</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Hong Lian, they couldn't even deal with the old and injured Purple Palace cultivator from the Red Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>The two were bitter and could only sigh deeply.</p><p></p><p>After some time passed, suddenly an urgent voice came: "It's terrible, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>A steward rushed in, his eyes full of panic.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuan Chong couldn't help but hold his head, indeed the feng shui was bad.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" True Lord Ku Mu asked, maintaining the composure of one unmoved even if Mount Tai were to collapse before him.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Kong... is dead... he died halfway up Seven-Color Peak!" The steward reported the major incident.</p><p></p><p>True Lord Ku Mu's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his sleeve and flew towards Seven-Color Peak with Elder Xuan Chong.</p><p></p><p>When they landed halfway up Seven-Color Peak, True Lord Ku Mu saw the familiar towering tree.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he and the empress of Great Shang, now the Empress Dowager Mu You, had met secretly here.</p><p></p><p>Now, Mu Kong's corpse was split into two halves, seemingly cut in half by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu was standing to the side, wearing an orange-yellow long dress, looking like a bee.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" True Lord Ku Mu asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu pondered and said: "This disciple was cultivating in her room when she suddenly felt a surge of sword intent, so I looked outside. I saw a blade of grass cut this person in half."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she glanced at the ground.</p><p></p><p>There was grass everywhere, she didn't know which blade had killed him.</p><p></p><p>"A blade of grass killed a Yuan Dan cultivator?" True Lord Ku Mu frowned, "Where is your master?"</p><p></p><p>He guessed it must have been Ruan Yixi's doing.</p><p></p><p>"My master... has left Seven-Color Peak. Senior Brother told me this." Jiang Lingsu replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, True Lord Ku Mu looked at the corpse on the ground, his eyes filled with more worry.</p><p></p><p>Now that Mu Kong was dead, there was no way they could hand over the 'Wood Origin Scripture'. They had thoroughly offended the Red Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Activate the sect's grand formation immediately!" True Lord Ku Mu ordered.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder of the Red Sword Gate had been severely injured long ago, and it was unknown how much of his strength remained.</p><p></p><p>But after all, he was still a Purple Palace cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully... the Divine Light Sect could survive this crisis.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Lingsu said: "Sect Master, Senior Brother said that in two days, some of his subordinates will come to the Divine Light Sect, and there will be a gift for the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>"Subordinates?" The Sect Master of the Divine Light Sect was confused.</p><p></p><p>And a gift.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he participating in the Eastern Land Genius Battle?" True Lord Ku Mu asked.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Jiang Lingsu shook her head, she wasn't very clear about these things.</p><p></p><p>Even if Senior Brother didn't participate, it didn't really matter to her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, True Lord Ku Mu didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a minor matter.</p><p></p><p>The threat of the Red Sword Gate was the real major issue.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Cuiyun Prefecture, Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had now moved to the Cloud Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader!" The master of Cloud Palace bowed his head respectfully and called softly outside the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"Come in." Qi Yuan opened his eyes, a flash of ancient years passing through them.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace master and a hunched old man entered, both with very respectful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, these are the newly collected techniques." Cloud Palace once again handed over a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Inside were densely packed jade slips containing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at them, feeling quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>This was much faster than killing old men for techniques.</p><p></p><p>No wonder everyone likes to be a capitalist and exploit others.</p><p></p><p>"Well done, keep up the good work." Qi Yuan casually praised.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Palace master continued: "Recently, some forces have been secretly investigating... the Alliance Leader's identity, for example, investigating all the members of the Hundred Kingdoms Divine Flower Meeting."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>Someone was trying to expose his alternate identity? This was too much! Didn't he have any privacy left? Even exposing his alt account, this was a violation of his right to privacy.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Probably people from the Heaven and Earth Cave." The Cloud Palace master said.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Countries bordered Cuiyun Prefecture. To investigate information about the Hundred Countries, it was inevitable to deal with the forces of Cuiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Now, Cuiyun Prefecture had a new controller - the Blood Robe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ye Qiong?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up. "Did he say any harsh words about me? Did he say he wanted to destroy me?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of Yunzhong Palace said timidly, somewhat afraid: "No, he didn't."</p><p></p><p>"Really not?"</p><p></p><p>"Really not." By this time, he had come to understand the Blood Sword God's personality.</p><p></p><p>This person was truly mad!</p><p></p><p>And he liked to kill people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his killing had logic to it. He wasn't the type of great demon who killed innocents indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"Even if he didn't say it, he must have thought about it!" Qi Yuan said with a serious expression, but then immediately abandoned this idea. </p><p></p><p>After all, that would be too unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>When he wrote essays, he also emphasized evidence and not wronging a good person.</p><p></p><p>As for bad people, what's wrong with wronging them a little?</p><p></p><p>"When I have time and meet this Venerable Ye Qiong, I'll ask him in person if he ever thought about killing me," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, cold sweat nearly broke out on the forehead of the Yunzhong Palace leader.</p><p></p><p>You're too fierce! If a Purple Mansion cultivator rashly went to ask a Yin God Venerable if he had thought about killing him, even if that Yin God Venerable hadn't thought about it before, he would probably develop murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Yunzhong Palace leader's thoughts were extremely complicated.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if having such a powerful person as an alliance leader was a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that before the great calamity even began, he would go looking for trouble with some Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>He secretly glanced at the old man beside him and gave him a look.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader, this subordinate takes his leave," said the Yunzhong Palace leader.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Cave was investigating the Alliance Leader's identity information, and he naturally had to intervene to prevent the investigation.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to investigate the Alliance Leader's identity too deeply.</p><p></p><p>If there were no problems, it would be fine to be the Alliance Leader of Cuiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid of finding problems.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, without the foundation of Yin Gods, what would Cuiyun Prefecture do? This feeling was like a cultivator family whose ancestor had been killed by an enemy who then usurped the position, pretending to be the ancestor.</p><p></p><p>As a result, even if the elders of that cultivator family knew the ancestor had been replaced, they wouldn't dare to speak up and would continue to serve and flatter.</p><p></p><p>After the Yunzhong Palace leader left, only Qi Yuan and the old man remained in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"Sit." Qi Yuan glanced at the old man, and a chair appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan always respected and gave special treatment to old men.</p><p></p><p>Even after coming to the Azure Waves Realm, his virtuous qualities of respecting the elderly and loving the young remained.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Alliance Leader, for granting me a seat." The old man's heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you've lived for nearly 100,000 years and have seen quite a few Yin Gods?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The old man before him was from the Earth Turtle clan.</p><p></p><p>This demon cultivator was currently the oldest in Cuiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had specifically sought him out to clarify how powerful Yin Gods were.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen them," said the skinny, frail-looking Earth Turtle elder.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan knew this was just appearance. This old man's defense was probably even stronger than that of the Great Palace Master of the Light Palace.</p><p></p><p>"How strong are... Yin Gods?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Turtle elder showed a thoughtful expression as he recalled the Yunzhong Palace leader's earlier warning.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than to describe the Yin Gods as powerful.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without the Yunzhong Palace leader's warning, the Earth Turtle elder felt that Yin Gods were incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin God realm is the realm of immortals and gods.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown, Venerable Black Dragon, whom I've seen before, is a Step 2 Heaven Treader Yin God."</p><p></p><p>"Step 2 Heaven Treader?"</p><p></p><p>"The Yin God realm is divided into seven small levels, from Step 1 Heaven Treader to Step 7 Heaven Treader.</p><p></p><p>Steps 1 to 3 Heaven Treaders are collectively known as Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Step 4 Heaven Treader is a Great Venerable!</p><p></p><p>After completing all seven steps, one can be called... a Yang God!"</p><p></p><p>"A Purple Mansion cultivator needs to condense a divine aperture and transform their magical power into divine spirit power to become a Yin God.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of Yin Gods involves continuing to expand divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>For each additional divine aperture opened, their strength increases by about one fold.</p><p></p><p>Opening 12 divine apertures is considered Step 2 Heaven Treader.</p><p></p><p>When 36 divine apertures are condensed, it's Step 3 Heaven Treader."</p><p></p><p>"Is this one-fold increase linear or exponential?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>If it was exponential growth, that would be too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Turtle elder was puzzled, not understanding Qi Yuan's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Roughly, how many 1-aperture Venerables can a 11-aperture Venerable defeat?" Qi Yuan rephrased it simply.</p><p></p><p>"At least 10, possibly dozens, or even hundreds.</p><p></p><p>The later divine apertures contain even stronger divine spirit power.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Black Dragon is a Step 2 Heaven Treader, a Yin God who has opened thirteen divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>The strongest strike unleashed by the incomplete Imperial Shocking Dragon Crown is comparable to a Yin God who has opened six or seven divine apertures."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan asked, "How many divine apertures has Venerable Ye Qiong opened?"</p><p></p><p>The Earth Turtle smiled helplessly: "How could this lowly one know such secret information?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan gained a general understanding of Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the differences within the Yin God realm were also extremely large.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Earth Turtle said in a low voice: "A few days ago, the aftermath of your battle with the Light Palace in the Void Realm fell onto Cuiyun Prefecture. This old one personally went to take a look..."</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Qi Yuan summoned the Golden Core projection to destroy everything, the Star Golden Core still caused some disturbances in the Void Realm, creating some aftermath.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the battle remnants, the battle that occurred was approximately at the Step 2 Heaven Treader level." Mentioning this, the Earth Turtle's face was full of shock.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was estimating.</p><p></p><p>The star projection summoned across universes was only at the Step 2 Heaven Treader level?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, it was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, crossing a universe and being just a projection, not the actual body of the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>It seems it was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a sense of urgency in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What step is the strongest Yin God in the Azure Waves Realm, and are there any Yang Gods?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"This old one doesn't know about that, but I can confirm that the Eastern Lands don't have any Great Venerables, only Venerables."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Qi Yuan nodded. It seemed Venerable Ye Qiong was at most a Step 3 Heaven Treader.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Turtle left.</p><p></p><p>In the vast palace, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the techniques in his storage bag with a peculiar gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Gods are still very strong, but unfortunately... my Star Golden Core is in another world."</p><p></p><p>"What if Venerable Ye Qiong is a Step 3 Heaven Treader?"</p><p></p><p>According to the Earth Turtle, a Step 3 Heaven Treader had at least 36 divine apertures, and at most 81 when perfected.</p><p></p><p>If Venerable Ye Qiong had 81 divine apertures.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered him now, he definitely couldn't win.</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to prioritize my Golden Core Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked inward at his dantian and found that the Solar True Fire inside had accumulated to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>Only a dozen days had passed here, but in that universe, a thousand years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>"Solar True Fire... devour!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan activated the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, his dantian became scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Flames danced on a star.</p><p></p><p>A cold and beautiful girl in a black dress opened her eyes, with a strand of Solar True Fire burning in her palm.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the thirteen planets before her, Zhu Yan filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Solar True Fire, go!"</p><p></p><p>With the girl's voice, golden flames suddenly surged up from the star.</p><p></p><p>The volume of the star increased tenfold, a hundredfold in that instant.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Waves Realm, the small sun in the sky shone even brighter, suddenly flashing.</p><p></p><p>All ordinary people and even cultivators couldn't help but glance at that small sun, showing puzzled and confused expressions.</p><p></p><p>In the vast universe, the Solar True Fire rose.</p><p></p><p>In all eight directions of the universe, dense flames burned.</p><p></p><p>The mythical flames devoured everything, constantly opening their giant heat mouths towards this vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen huge planets, celestial bodies that mortals could not measure in a lifetime, were as small as dust under this Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three... thirteen planets were successively devoured by the Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were rocky planets, gas giants or ice planets, these cosmic celestial bodies all inexplicably ignited with Solar True Fire.</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy flashed in Ning Tao's eyes: "A few more palaces."</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Azure Waves Realm, Qi Yuan couldn't help but burp for the first time since he started cultivating.</p><p></p><p>He looked inward at his dantian and saw the projection of a star cluster.</p><p></p><p>It was called a star cluster, but it was actually only fourteen celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>One star, thirteen planets, and several negligible small bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Time to start collecting!"</p><p></p><p>"Next target, devour stars!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed that there was still quite a bit of Solar True Fire left.</p><p></p><p>"If one star can't kill Venerable Ye Qiong, how about two?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

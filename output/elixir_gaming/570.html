        <h1>Chapter 570</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was determined that Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of the Great Sage, and the Venerable Gu Ming and the young man in black robes became increasingly awestruck.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the years Lin Yuan had experienced were extremely ancient and long.</p><p></p><p>His true identity might be that of some Great Sage who had shaken the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>In the palace.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of Wanqu immediately reported the price after receiving the nod from his master.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver, all the precious treasures and rarities added up, the final price is 40 million Chaos Stones."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of Wanqu couldn't help but be stunned inwardly. Such a huge amount of Chaos Stones, even for the Venerable One, would be quite painful to part with.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Chaos Venerable Ones also had huge consumptions.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Venerable Gu Ming, his own consumption, the consumption of his companion Chaos Dragon Beast, and the consumption of maintaining the various formations of the Gu Ming Chaos Continent, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"40 million Chaos Stones." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This was much higher than he had estimated. Lin Yuan did not bring out all the treasures and rarities from his inheritance space, he only planned to offer a portion first.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's estimation, the portion of treasures and rarities he just offered was worth around 20-30 million Chaos Stones.</p><p></p><p>As for 40 million Chaos Stones? It was obvious that the Venerable Gu Ming had purchased them at a high price.</p><p></p><p>"Please convey my gratitude to the Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know why the Venerable Gu Ming had shown him such kindness, with the Star Tear 'Shard World' and so on.</p><p></p><p>But this was not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to purchase another batch of cultivation resources."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also mentioned the cultivation resources he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of Wanqu said while patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>Now the Gu Ming Chaos Continent had become the trading center of the surrounding void, the resources Lin Yuan wanted were not rare, and they would not be difficult to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Ten years went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Star Tear 'Shard World'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his physical body emanating a profound and heavy aura, as if the surrounding space could hardly bear it and was constantly distorting and deforming.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Mysterious Yellow Body' has finally reached the perfected Sovereign Realm."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. As the guardian art of the Mysterious Yellow lineage, and a method of body refinement, the 'Mysterious Yellow Body' had reached the pinnacle in all aspects of refining the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Even the body refinement secret art of the Nine Tribulation Tathagata Dragon Body, which was at the Great Sage level, could only perfect Lin Yuan's physical body in minor aspects, with the 'Mysterious Yellow Body' still being the main foundation.</p><p></p><p>"My current physical body should be close to the level of a Chaos Venerable One's physical body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The physical body refined by the perfected 'Mysterious Yellow Body' could already be considered the strongest physical body at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan's physical foundation was extremely strong, especially the terrifying cosmic foundation within him, which nourished his physical body, achieving a virtuous cycle.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body had now reached a point where there was no further room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the Chaotic Realm level of the 'Mysterious Yellow Body'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Realm 'Mysterious Yellow Body' required a sufficiently powerful life essence to support it, and he would have to at least reach the Sovereign Realm before having the chance.</p><p></p><p>"But the resources needed to perfect the Chaotic Realm 'Mysterious Yellow Body' are staggering." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current physical foundation, once he cultivated the 'Mysterious Yellow Body' to the perfected Chaotic Realm, his physical body alone would be enough to sweep through Chaotic Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>The resources required to refine such a physical body, at least for now, Lin Yuan could not see any hope, and it was estimated that the entire wealth of a Peerless Great Sage would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts and no longer thought about it further.</p><p></p><p>"And you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and a palm-sized 'bell'-shaped secret treasure appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was the source bell that Lin Yuan had carefully cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This source bell, after years of continuous nurturing and massive resource investment by Lin Yuan, had now grown to the Sovereign Realm secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>The source bell was in harmony with Lin Yuan's divine sense, and when he activated it, there was almost no consumption, yet its power was great, not much weaker than a Chaotic Realm secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, I've been cultivating you for so long, but I've never used you even once."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Given his personality and style, without being fully confident, he basically would not take action, and even less so would he put himself in any danger, letting his divine sense incarnation take action instead.</p><p></p><p>So he had no need to use the source bell.</p><p></p><p>However, although the source bell had not made any contributions, this kind of trump card secret treasure, while it could be unused, could not be absent.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan had never given up on cultivating the source bell.</p><p></p><p>The many lethal moves he possessed, many of them had never been used, but he was still constantly perfecting and adding to them.</p><p></p><p>"I'll directly nourish you with the cosmic origin within me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew the source bell into his cosmic world, which was now vast and mighty, with the Chaotic Tree sitting at the center, organizing and commanding everything.</p><p></p><p>Hometown Universe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Annihilation had completely ended, and the originally vast universe had converged into a single point.</p><p></p><p>This point was extremely small, yet extremely vast, with the surrounding space completely condensed, and even Peerless Great Sages could not glimpse it at all.</p><p></p><p>The destruction and rebirth of the universe was the self-operating and evolving fundamental rules of the Chaotic Void, and external forces could not interfere at all.</p><p></p><p>Within the condensed point.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Mysterious Yellow Realm had been compressed to a ten-meter radius.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's incarnation sat in the center, carefully observing everything outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside the realm, it was chaotic and devoid of any rule and Dao fluctuations, the essence of the universe's Great Annihilation being that all rules and Daos had fallen into stillness.</p><p></p><p>However, in the midst of the deathly silence outside the realm, it was extremely 'fascinating' to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, although the outside was deathly silent, there were endless rules slowly gestating.</p><p></p><p>These rules emerged from nothingness until they were fully formed, and in Lin Yuan's eyes, they revealed unprecedented perfection and miracles.</p><p></p><p>The birth of life was a miracle, and the evolution of the universe was also a miracle.</p><p></p><p>"Wondrous, wondrous, wondrous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was enthralled, fully immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>【Your perceptive ability is extraordinary, observing the destruction and rebirth of the universe has greatly enhanced your understanding of the essence of the Dao and rules.】</p><p></p><p>Every moment, endless enlightenment and insights were bursting forth in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental rules of the Chaotic Void operated, giving birth to countless universes, and these universes had destruction and rebirth, which were also manifestations of the fundamental rules of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of manifestation was difficult for those below the Great Sage level to glimpse.</p><p></p><p>To be able to set up a Mysterious Yellow Realm as a trump card within a universe, one would need to be at least at the Chaotic Great Sage level, and even most Chaotic Great Sages could not do it.</p><p></p><p>"Now this universe is still in the process of rebirth, and when it completely begins the new birth, with the myriad rules and Daos operating again, and life gradually reviving, the impact on me should be the greatest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, by observing the entire process of the universe's destruction and rebirth, my rule comprehension will surely soar by a great margin, perhaps even reaching the level of being able to casually create a universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The twelve-stage life, with its internal world transformed into a cosmic world, but this cosmic world was slowly nurtured from weak to strong by the twelve-stage life.</p><p></p><p>It was still far from the ability to casually create a universe.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, Venerable-level forces basically all create their own Chaotic Continents.</p><p></p><p>And Great Sage-level forces, especially the top-tier forces with Peerless Great Sages as their pillars, would create their own dedicated universes.</p><p></p><p>These universes were not nurtured by the Chaotic Void, so they did not have the indelible characteristics, but in terms of size and the degree of life nurturing, they had advantages that Chaotic Continents could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>The universes specially created by Peerless Great Sages could achieve a certain degree of rule formulation, such as forming certain special cultivation environments or nurturing specific life forms.</p><p></p><p>"Casually creating a universe... This is also the embodiment of rule comprehension reaching the pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. If one had not thoroughly comprehended the myriad rules, how could they easily create a complete universe?</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this universe is still some time away from the start of its rebirth, much longer than the normal time from Great Annihilation to rebirth, is it because I took away too much life during the Great Annihilation, causing the driving force for rebirth to be insufficient, so it needs time to absorb the power of the Chaotic Void?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan's speculation should not only be due to this reason.</p><p></p><p>There was also the fact that he had absorbed a large amount of Boundary Breaking Source Power during the universe's Great Annihilation?</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan still did not know the essence of the Boundary Breaking Source Power, it was certainly an extremely high-level power.</p><p></p><p>During the universe's Great Annihilation, this source power would be dispersed, but ultimately it would still be absorbed back into the universe, but this time the Great Annihilation was completely absorbed by him.</p><p></p><p>"Pity... The absorption of this Boundary Breaking Source Power..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This kind of energy can only be accessed by life forms within the universe," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Over the years, he had sent out avatars to explore the nearby void domains and discovered collapsing universes, but he was unable to absorb much of the excess dimensional energy.</p><p></p><p>The "Tear of the Stars" Fragmented World.</p><p></p><p>It had been some time since human civilization migrated here.</p><p></p><p>In a high-tech classroom, more than a dozen students were diligently listening to the teacher's lecture on the stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with the current level of human civilization's technology, learning could already be achieved in virtual worlds, but some schools still maintained this face-to-face teaching method in the physical world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the virtual world, the physical world is ultimately more real.</p><p></p><p>The teacher standing at the podium was a middle-aged woman. She looked at the many students before her, all of whom were born in the past decade or so. Having been nurtured by the aura of the Tear of the Stars, their innate talents were exceptionally strong, and most of them would become Evolveds in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Ming."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged woman frowned slightly as she looked at a student sitting in the back row, whose gaze was slightly dazed, clearly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Here, teacher," the student named Sun Ming immediately responded, quickly standing up.</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell us about the Galactic Era?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged woman smiled at him.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Era?" Sun Ming's spirits were immediately lifted. If it was about knowledge in his field, he might not know, but the Galactic Era? Who wouldn't know that he, Sun Ming, was a devoted fan of the Galactic Supremacy?</p><p></p><p>"Fifty-six years ago, the universe we lived in faced destruction. If not for unexpected circumstances, the countless citizens of human civilization would have perished along with the universe."</p><p></p><p>"But the Galactic Supremacy stepped forward. With his own power, he led all the citizens of human civilization out and ultimately migrated them to this new homeland."</p><p></p><p>"From that time on, the old calendar of human civilization, the Stellar Era, ended, and the first year of the Galactic Era began."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Galactic Era is named after the Galactic Supremacy, to record his great achievements."</p><p></p><p>Sun Ming answered enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>The other students also listened with excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, the image of the Galactic Supremacy had almost been deified.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, very good," the middle-aged woman nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Those born in the new homeland might not be able to understand, but she? The middle-aged woman had personally experienced the end of the Stellar Era, when the human civilization's authorities announced the impending destruction of the universe and adopted a lottery system to select citizens for migration to the new homeland.</p><p></p><p>The probability of being selected? Approximately one out of every one or two hundred citizens.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the middle-aged woman was selected, but her father, mother, and close friends were all not chosen.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the fate awaiting the middle-aged woman was to live on alone while all her loved ones perished.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, the despair she felt was unimaginable, and she ultimately chose to give up her selected spot and stay behind with her loved ones until the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>But then, the Galactic Supremacy announced that he could take all the citizens and lead them to the new homeland.</p><p></p><p>The scene of seeing hope in the midst of despair was something the middle-aged woman still remembered vividly to this day.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Supremacy had become more than just a figure of great achievements for human civilization - he was a savior.</p><p></p><p>"Now, tell me about the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged woman continued to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao is the path walked by the Galactic Supremacy," Sun Ming's heart leaped with joy, as he also knew about this topic.</p><p></p><p>"In the 40th year of the Galactic Era, the Galactic Supremacy, based on the Martial Dao, opened up 673 great paths, encompassing most of the known paths, all of which could reach the 12th Realm. By the 45th year of the Galactic Era, the many Evolutionary paths prevalent in the Stellar Era were gradually being phased out and replaced by the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Sun Ming's tone was exceptionally fervent.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet cultivated the Martial Dao, he had already decided that his future Evolutionary path would be the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," the middle-aged woman listened with a somewhat distant expression. These newly born humans had no way of perceiving the changes in human civilization after the Galactic Era.</p><p></p><p>Especially the scene of the many Evolutionary paths being gradually replaced by the Martial Dao. She couldn't imagine how many powerful Evolveds from the Stellar Era must have felt a sense of melancholy about this.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the "Tear of the Stars" Fragmented World, Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position. Now that the various Martial Dao branches had been fully disseminated throughout human civilization, replacing the many Evolutionary paths from the Stellar Era, he naturally took note of this.</p><p></p><p>This was an inevitable result.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Martial Dao branches opened up by Lin Yuan were far superior to the numerous Evolutionary paths of the Stellar Era in terms of potential, cultivation difficulty, and other aspects.</p><p></p><p>Even the nine Supremes of human civilization had actively switched to the Martial Dao path, let alone the ordinary human citizens.</p><p></p><p>And regardless of which Martial Dao branch, due to their common foundation in the Martial Dao, practitioners of different branches could communicate and interact with each other.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense that Martial Dao cultivators have also emerged in the distant void domains," Lin Yuan carefully felt the energy, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>This occurrence should mean that the Myriad Dao Pavilion had begun to spread the Martial Dao branches.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye had reached an agreement with Lin Yuan, and it had immediately instructed the various Myriad Dao Divisions to start the dissemination, without any signs of slacking off.</p><p></p><p>"The dissemination speed is quite fast. The current number of cultivators has already surpassed the total number of Martial Dao Evolveds in human civilization," Lin Yuan thought to himself. While the number of human civilization citizens was vast, in the chaotic void, they were quite insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Myriad Dao Pavilion was only in the initial stages of dissemination, once they began to delve deeper, the number of Martial Dao cultivators would experience a massive surge.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, in the Crimson Flame City, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, feeling the nuances of the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>In the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the Blazing Sun Divine Body was akin to the "darling" of heaven and earth. No matter the aspect, be it cultivation or the comprehension of laws, or even the display of combat power, it possessed tremendous advantages.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to continue condensing the Blazing Sun Seed," Lin Yuan had not given up on condensing the Blazing Sun Seed, but the current difficulty had skyrocketed. Even for Lin Yuan, it would take several days to condense a single seed. And as the number of Blazing Sun Seeds condensed increased, the efficiency gradually decreased, becoming once every ten days, or even dozens of days.</p><p></p><p>"The current situation," Lin Yuan finished his cultivation and glanced outside.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan had intervened, causing the Violet Dream Domain's schemes to fail, the Crimson Flame Domain had been at loggerheads with the Violet Dream Domain, with the Violet Dream Domain showing no signs of compromise. They had even mobilized their armies to gather at the borders.</p><p></p><p>The armies of this Source World ancient country appeared in the form of battle formations, with ten thousand Eleventh Realm cultivators forming a single formation. They could concentrate the power of ten thousand Eleventh Realm cultivators and amplify it, unleashing a strike capable of severely injuring Transcendent Dao Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Crimson Flame Marquis appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Violet Dream Domain's actions are under the guidance of the 'Spiritual Might King,' and war seems to be inevitable."</p><p></p><p>"It may last for a few hundred years, or even a few thousand years."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Marquis stated directly.</p><p></p><p>In recent times, not only had the situation in the Violet Dream Domain been delicate, but dozens of other large domains surrounding the Violet Dream Domain were also experiencing turbulent undercurrents.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Might King?" Lin Yuan nodded. He had also heard about this newly enthroned king, as it was rare for a royal to be bestowed the title of king, as it was usually reserved for Celestial Venerable-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"But war is just war. My Blazing Sun Ancient Country is not afraid," the Crimson Flame Marquis looked at Lin Yuan and reminded him, "Just make sure you don't leave Crimson Flame City in the near future. I'm worried the 'Spiritual Might King' may target you."</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan, the Spiritual Might King would have easily conquered Crimson Flame City and even the entire Crimson Flame Domain.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Crimson Flame Marquis was concerned.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I definitely won't leave," Lin Yuan immediately said. After selling the Myriad Formation Heart, Lin Yuan would not lack resources for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>Without a lack of resources or inheritances, even if Lin Yuan were to go out, he wouldn't.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," the Crimson Flame Marquis nodded and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>If war truly erupted, as the central domain, the Crimson Flame Domain would undoubtedly face the greatest pressure. The Crimson Flame Marquis had been exceptionally busy lately.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Crimson Flame Marquis disappear, Lin Yuan pondered for a while and then resumed his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was war or peace, as long as he continued to cultivate and grow stronger, it would be the right path.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and a thousand years had gone by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

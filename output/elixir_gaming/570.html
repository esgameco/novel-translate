            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Light Sect.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was muddled and hazy.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if he had experienced countless reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>It took a full quarter of an hour before his eyes finally regained their clarity.</p><p></p><p>He lifted his head and looked at the palace on the Seven-Colored Peak, his gaze puzzled: "So, Master, I just accidentally stumbled into your reincarnation cycle?"</p><p></p><p>Using the Great Forgetting Sutra, Qi Yuan's sense of time and space was in disarray as he fought against the Black Celestial with his own power.</p><p></p><p>However, the Black Celestial was truly the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity, something a false Fourth Layer like himself could not withstand.</p><p></p><p>In the endless struggle, Qi Yuan went through countless reincarnations, constantly losing himself.</p><p></p><p>His eyes, ears, mouth... </p><p></p><p>In the battle, he finally realized that the voiceless voice in the game was his master, Ruan Yixi.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity has no consciousness.</p><p></p><p>His master gained consciousness due to her unique ability, causing an anomaly in the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity.</p><p></p><p>However, she still possessed the attributes of the Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>She only existed in the past and future, but not in the present.</p><p></p><p>Even though some of the Divine Light Sect members claimed to have seen the master, they had only seen her in their memories.</p><p></p><p>"I was searching for the master, but the master was also searching for me."</p><p></p><p>During the fight against the Black Celestial, Qi Yuan experienced countless reincarnations. </p><p></p><p>In those countless reincarnations, he had never seen the master.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that the master had always been by his side.</p><p></p><p>Ruan Yixi also knew that she had always been accompanying him.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Qi Yuan lost all his physical body, leaving only a blood-stained robe.</p><p></p><p>And Ruan Yixi, she finally truly awakened and gained her own physical form.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, she "shared the same robe" with the blood-stained robe and defeated the Black Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"So... the master has been trying to find me, but she could never truly see me.</p><p></p><p>Even if she is right in front of me now, I won't realize that she is her, only after a very long time will I associate it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity is rather bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"And... the master has always been by my side."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the obedient and quiet Little Bride with a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>A wooden plaque with a "snuggle" expression slid out from Little Bride's cold sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan snuggled with Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>Little Bride is the master, but the master is not Little Bride.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, unless I step into the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity, there is no way for me to meet the master."</p><p></p><p>"That's why, when I entered the game, the master kept reminding me to escape and leave."</p><p></p><p>Because to deal with the Black Celestial, one must step into the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity.</p><p></p><p>But the master, due to her interaction with Qi Yuan, gained consciousness and created the Divine Wood Universe after the opening of the heavens. In terms of strength, she is not as powerful as the Black Celestial.</p><p></p><p>In countless pasts and futures, she seemed to have seen Qi Yuan constantly losing his limbs and true spirit while trying to fight the Black Celestial, and rebuilding her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan even had the possibility of stepping into the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity.</p><p></p><p>This was something she did not want to see.</p><p></p><p>Once he stepped into the Fourth Layer, his true spirit would dissolve, and there would be no way to revive him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he revived, it would be a new life form.</p><p></p><p>So, at great cost, she sent Qi Yuan a "Spring" branch.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Qi Yuan to preserve a trace of his true spirit and not step into the Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would become the next being similar to the Black Celestial in the Fourth Layer, only devouring everything in sight.</p><p></p><p>"Now, am I an Yin Deity?"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan pondered, his aura underwent a change.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious energy surged, and Qi Yuan's strength was constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>Countless rules, such as metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, were all comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"This is matter."</p><p>"This is spirit."</p><p>"This is imaginary."</p><p>"This is the cycle."</p><p>"When matter reaches its extreme, with a chance of one in a billion, life may be born."</p><p>"When life lives long enough, true spirit will be born."</p><p>"So, I... have become a deity."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan felt incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, he could make a mountain and river appear.</p><p></p><p>If he glared at a planet with force, that planet would become pregnant, and countless living beings would slowly be born.</p><p></p><p>The ability to make anyone pregnant just by glaring at them, he had already mastered.</p><p></p><p>For example, if he glared at his junior sister Jiang Lingsu, she would become pregnant.</p><p></p><p>"This is what it means to be an Yin Deity. Now, I... am probably not inferior to the Primal Chaos Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan secretly assessed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he might even be stronger than the Primal Chaos Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Primal Chaos Sovereign could not resist the Black Celestial, but Qi Yuan could barely hold his own against it.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, even if I am as powerful as I am now, I still cannot see the master."</p><p></p><p>Only the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity can see the Fourth Layer of the Yang Divinity.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, he did not even know where the Divine Wood Universe was, let alone the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Master, I've become an Yin Deity. When I become a Yang Deity, I'll find a way to see you.</p><p></p><p>This nonsense about the past, present, and future should all be in my grasp."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke to the empty air.</p><p></p><p>He knew that one day, either in the past or the future, Ruan Yixi would hear these words.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside these memories, Qi Yuan began to examine himself.</p><p></p><p>"The biggest breakthrough after becoming an Yin Deity is to master the Three Thousand Great Dao Rules, enough to create the heavens and the world."</p><p></p><p>"And this superpower... is part of my body."</p><p></p><p>"My body... can merge with all things in the world."</p><p></p><p>"This superpower... is kind of useless?"</p><p></p><p>After all, in his current state, he could also merge with all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Qi Yuan looked at the wooden cat puppet in the room and without any hesitation, activated his superpower.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his body merged into the wooden cat puppet.</p><p></p><p>It was quiet, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly felt a sense of "I am the wooden cat puppet."</p><p></p><p>"This is too useless. If I had this superpower when I was at the Qi Refinement stage, it would have been so useful for avoiding disasters.</p><p></p><p>When I reached the Foundation Establishment stage, I could just hide in a grain of sand.</p><p></p><p>But now, it's almost completely useless."</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on his superpower, it seemed like this was the most useless one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, at his current level, his other superpowers were also practically unusable.</p><p></p><p>After becoming an Yin Deity, he had mastered countless rules, almost reaching the level of omniscience in the universe.</p><p></p><p>"However, with the increase in strength, I can see more hidden information with my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go find the Golden Canary and Ning Lao, and turn all the stars in that universe into Nascent Souls.</p><p></p><p>I can't neglect my Dao of the Golden Dan either."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan was thinking this, he did not immediately leave.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door, walked out of his courtyard, and took a deep breath of the air.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to build an oceanfront villa."</p><p></p><p>He had worked hard for so many years, so why not enjoy himself a little? No ocean? </p><p></p><p>Just move a big ocean over.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong... (Senior Brother...)" a voice filled with joyful surprise came from not far away.</p><p></p><p>A beautiful and enchanting young lady in a lake-blue short jacket and long skirt stood under an ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>The sash at her waist was high, and a sky-blue silk ribbon was wrapped around her delicate chest, with a patch of snow-white skin beneath it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure was plump and full. However, the beauty on her chest seemed to be completely covered, not revealing even a hint of spring scenery.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were watery, as if they had fully ripened. </p><p></p><p>She was holding the hand of a little girl, who looked to be around five or six years old.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan couldn't help but think of Han Xin and Ji Tao.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu's watery eyes were filled with some indescribable emotions. She seemed to have thought of something, and quickly said, "This is my own little sister."</p><p></p><p>"You have a sister too?" Qi Yuan was slightly taken aback, given her age.</p><p></p><p>"How many years have I been in seclusion?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Although he could tell at a glance how many years he had been away from this world, sometimes people still need to be a little foolish.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred and twenty-seven years, four months, and six days," Jiang Lingsu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"That long," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had played a game for so long.</p><p></p><p>He had gone from a young man in his twenties to a centenarian.</p><p></p><p>Back on the Blue Star, he could become an internet celebrity, teaching people how to live a healthy life.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, after being in seclusion for so long, you must be hungry. Your junior sister will prepare your favorite dishes right away. I've been working hard these past hundred years too!" Jiang Lingsu said, waving her little pink fists, looking quite adorable.</p><p></p><p>However, using "adorable" to describe Jiang Lingsu this time was somewhat insulting.</p><p></p><p>After all, with that voluptuous figure, where was she adorable?</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Qi Yuan nodded, his eyes full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go out for a bit and be right back."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Jiang Lingsu nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu stood in place, feeling a mix of anxiety and happiness, as well as a sense of contentment.</p><p></p><p>After all, to be able to live carefree, without lacking food or clothing, and in peace, this was beyond what many could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure reappeared, and he found himself in the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Before him, the Gate of Myriad Mysteries came into view.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stared at the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, his eyes revealing a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"This Gate of Myriad Mysteries is a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>He had always been curious about the origin of the Gate of Myriad Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be able to be any door.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Myriad Demons, the Gate of Myriad Monsters, the Gate of Myriad Wonders, or even the Gate of the Ultimate Truth.</p><p></p><p>"What is it really?"</p><p></p><p>The information he was seeing this time did not seem to be particularly useful.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Qi Yuan chose to use his latest acquired superpower, which was to merge with all things.</p><p></p><p>He merged into the Gate of Myriad Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the world became desolate, and Qi Yuan's consciousness dissipated.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next breath, Qi Yuan's figure emerged from the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, his eyes filled with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Myriad Mysteries... is actually the Fourth Layer of the Yang Immortals!"</p><p></p><p>"The Fourth Layer of the Yang Immortals exists in the present world!"</p><p></p><p>This couldn't help but make him feel surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because the Fourth Layer of the Yang Immortals exists in the past or the future, but not in the present.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was actually a Fourth Layer of the Yang Immortals existing in the present, how could he not be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"If I can figure out the principle, doesn't that mean... my master can also appear in the present world?" Qi Yuan thought, but immediately suppressed the idea.</p><p></p><p>Now he understood that the Fourth Layer of the Yang Immortals also had two forms.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Black Heavens, its essence is to devour, to devour aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>When it has devoured enough of what it needs, it will become the Black Heavens that exists in the present world.</p><p></p><p>At that time, just as the Gate of Myriad Mysteries can be any door, the Black Heavens may also be able to be any heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, this time will be very long.</p><p></p><p>The universe that the Black Heavens devours is not just one, but it is still in its second stage.</p><p></p><p>"The water inside is very deep."</p><p></p><p>"It feels like I've been refined into a treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe it has truly become a rule."</p><p></p><p>This rule, of course, is different from the universal rule, more like a symbol, a sign.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I didn't have the chance to chat with the Lord of the Void Realm and the Radiant Dao Master in the previous game, otherwise I could have asked them about the Fourth Layer and Fifth Layer of the Yang Immortals, as they seem a bit strange to me." Qi Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Immortals have always had only five layers.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Immortals are also the endpoint of the cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, there is no undefeatable power under the heavens, but there may be enemies in the heavens. Cultivation should not have a limit."</p><p></p><p>"After refining the Eternal Star Elixir, I should go to the Unique Palace to take a look."</p><p></p><p>The strongest force in the current Immortal Realm is the Unique Palace.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see if the Unique Palace had any top-tier combat powers that had some understanding of the Fourth Layer and Fifth Layer of the Yang Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, Qi Yuan's figure appeared in a vast universe.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, a warm and charming figure collided into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>"My husband..." Ning Luo, dressed in a black dress, was bewitchingly alluring, her eyes seemingly about to drip water, no longer having the cold and aloof demeanor from before.</p><p></p><p>Her petite and graceful figure clung to Qi Yuan, her black-stockinged legs wrapped around his waist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a scolding and coquettish voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You, Ning Luo! You said we'd wait for him together to tease him for a while since he's been gone for so long, but you..."  The delicate-faced Jin Sinian had a hint of displeasure on her face, but her eyes were always fixed on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She stood in place, not reaching out to invite him, as if she was too proud to do so.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with a gentle expression, as well as a hint of guilt.</p><p></p><p>He had played the game for too long this time.</p><p></p><p>Although only a hundred years had passed in the Surging Waves Realm, it was an extremely long time in this universe.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and pulled Jin Sinian's figure into his embrace as well.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's not like I missed you or anything. If Ning Luo hadn't insisted on coming over, I wouldn't have come either..." </p><p></p><p>"Ah, shameless Ning Luo, how could you strip in front of him like this..."</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to too!"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of bickering, coquetry, and heavy breathing echoed through the universe.</p><p></p><p>After some time had passed, Ning Luo smoothed the strands of hair dampened with sweat by her ear and gave Jin Sinian a sidelong glance: "Husband has come here for important matters, you're just clinging to him..."</p><p></p><p>This "clinging" was not the kind of clingy entanglement, but a true clinging.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm just too lazy to move." Jin Sinian said, finally reluctantly getting up from Qi Yuan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>When the next time to be intimate with Qi Yuan would be, she didn't know.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, she was fully dressed again.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes flashed with amusement.</p><p></p><p>"From tomorrow onwards, you two will be in the same universe as me," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Ning Luo's gaze was gentle: "This universe is too vast, there are still many stars that have not yet condensed into Elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Even though she had worked hard, in the vastness of the universe, it was still like a drop in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'll do it myself," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"But... if you're here, the flow of time will slow down relative to the outside, and the efficiency..." Ning Luo analyzed rationally.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, no matter how vast the universe, no matter how many stars, they will all eventually be exhausted."</p><p></p><p>"I can bestow the first Star Elixir with the ability to devour. It can devour on its own."</p><p></p><p>"One day, all the stars in this universe will become my Elixirs."</p><p></p><p>He came here not only to refine Star Elixirs, but also to create a new world.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

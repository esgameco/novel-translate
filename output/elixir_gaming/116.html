        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, remnants of the Blood Palace hiding within my Purple Sky Alliance, how detestable!" </p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Celestial Maiden hastily attacked, but only managed to seriously wound that person without being able to detain them.</p><p></p><p>"Was that blood-colored light the work of the Blood Master?" an exalted one spoke up, with a solemn look in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The reason the foolish Daoist from earlier was able to instantly break free from everyone's encirclement was due to that blood-colored droplet.</p><p></p><p>"I once obtained a blood droplet and consulted the Destiny Stone. The answer given by the Destiny Stone was that this is an item of the Great Demon!" The Purple Sky Celestial Maiden raised her head, a murderous look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about the Destiny Stone, everyone present became solemn, a hint of greed also appearing in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>That was a supreme treasure of this world, born together with Buddha, rumored to be able to see the past and future.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Celestial Maiden's achievements were inseparable from the Destiny Stone.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that with the Destiny Stone, the Purple Sky Celestial Maiden's combat power was among the strongest in this world.</p><p></p><p>And the Destiny Stone had become a tool for the Purple Sky Celestial Maiden to control the narrative.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Blood Master was truly a Great Demon or not was unimportant. </p><p></p><p>What mattered was that the Purple Sky Celestial Maiden said the Destiny Stone declared the Blood Master to be a Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Blood Master was a Great Demon, to be attacked by all under heaven.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Blood Palace at the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Dawn arrived, without sunlight but with a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>The ends of the earth were located in the southernmost part of the world, where daylight broke earliest.</p><p></p><p>In her boudoir, the young woman's cheeks were as white as snow, black hair framing her delicate face. She looked at herself in the mirror, carefully drawing her fine, curved eyebrows. Her slightly pale face was transformed with beautiful makeup. In the mirror, the flowers in the vase on the pear wood dressing table were reflected alongside her face.</p><p></p><p>The young woman stood up, her silk dress embroidered with intricate paired partridges. Her eyes also became brighter.</p><p></p><p>Every morning at dawn, Golden Canary would wake up early to carefully paint her eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Even after three hundred years, she seemed to look the same as when she was at Nine Coils Mountain, still loving beauty, still paying attention to her appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Golden Canary, I heard the foolish Daoist has returned," a urgent, clear female voice came from outside the room. "But when he came back, he was seriously injured. He fell unconscious before he could say anything. Should we go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" An anxious look flashed in Golden Canary's fine eyes. "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard Sister Yanran say that the foolish Daoist had been undercover in the Purple Sky Alliance all this time. His sudden return this time must mean he's brought back some urgent news. </p><p></p><p>I estimate the Purple Sky Alliance will soon be coming to our Blood Palace." There was deep worry in the young woman's voice. "Sister Golden Canary, shall we go to the main hall to see the foolish Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright..."</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Sister Golden Canary?" The young woman looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Because she saw Golden Canary run out from her boudoir without even putting on shoes, her jade feet like young lotus roots as she lifted her skirt and ran out.</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand. Why such urgency? She looked even more rushed than someone being reborn.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Blood Palace, the sea waters churned constantly. A man wearing a blood-red robe, with a faint smile between his brows, looked into the distance. His form also turned into a streak of light to welcome the approaching figure.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl!"</p><p></p><p>The young woman's small face was full of excitement, her eyes brimming with moisture. She lifted her skirt as she ran, crashing forcefully into the embrace of the blood-red robe.</p><p></p><p>She clung to the blood-red robe like a koala, no longer paying attention to her image. Her long slender legs wrapped tightly around Qi Yuan's waist.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, I knew you would come back to see me!" Golden Canary's voice cracked slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry I'm late." One of Qi Yuan's hands supported the young woman's plump thigh, while the other stroked her back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young woman's face as bright and beautiful as ever, he broke into a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>After lingering in Qi Yuan's embrace for a while, Golden Canary still clung to him, unwilling to let go. She looked at Qi Yuan's face, her small face flushed like a peach blossom. She whispered secretly: "You've become even more handsome... It's a good thing this young miss put on makeup this morning, otherwise I would have been outshone by you!"</p><p></p><p>"I knew you still appreciate my looks." The smile at the corners of Qi Yuan's mouth grew wider. "All along the way, those people who saw me were very afraid of me."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, those people have eyes but fail to see!" Golden Canary's voice was jubilant. "This young miss is the number one beauty of the Eighteen Mountains, and you, Blood Pearl, are the number one handsome man of the Eighteen Mountains."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Golden Canary's voice, Qi Yuan also held her tighter.</p><p></p><p>He embraced Golden Canary, gazing out at the sea before them.</p><p></p><p>In the sea, there was a Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary also noticed that gate, her expression somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grasped Golden Canary's small foot, brushing away the dust: "It's dirty, let's wash it."</p><p></p><p>A warm sensation came over her, and Golden Canary felt shy. She looked at Qi Yuan: "This young miss just got out of bed and didn't put on shoes properly... Don't touch this young miss's feet, it tickles!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan set Golden Canary down on a large rock by the sea. The two sat side by side, facing the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences before them.</p><p></p><p>[You have gained insight into the origin, Mutation ability +1000.]</p><p></p><p>[You have gained insight into the origin, Water Control ability +10.]</p><p></p><p>Just like when Qi Yuan first came to Nine Coils Mountain with Golden Canary by his side, he gained insights from the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Pearl, I suspect you deceived me!" Golden Canary said dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Deceived you about what?"</p><p></p><p>"You lied to me saying that gaining insights from the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences would make one beautiful, that's false!</p><p></p><p>This young miss has been gaining insights for so many years without any effect!</p><p></p><p>And... and everyone says the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences... is an inauspicious gate, inside it is sealed... the heart demon of the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>Constantly gaining insights may lead to being possessed by the Great Demon's heart demon." There was some worry in Golden Canary's voice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes as he looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>[Gate of Ten Thousand Differences, Gate of the Unknown, Gate of Ten Thousand Gates, it can be any gate.]</p><p></p><p>According to Shang Yanran and Baize's investigation, the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences was a copy of the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences created by the endless heart demons of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the answer Qi Yuan's eyes saw had nothing to do with a copy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stroked Golden Canary's head, saying gently: "Everything is just hearsay. We haven't seen it ourselves, how do we know what's true or false?</p><p></p><p>Even the legends of Buddha, the Great Demon, and the Demon Woman may not be true.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they were fabricated by someone.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps things are completely different from what they say."</p><p></p><p>Regarding rumors, Qi Yuan only ever believed one-third.</p><p></p><p>What he trusted most were his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Canary, don't believe anyone. You can only believe in yourself, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The sea breeze blew across the water's surface, creating waves of foam.</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary tilted her head, looking at Qi Yuan: "This young miss barely trusts you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan smiled: "Alright, we should return to the Blood Palace now. There are still some matters to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Golden Canary remember something, and quickly said: "Oh no, I forgot, the foolish Daoist seems to have brought back important information, but he's seriously injured and unconscious!"</p><p></p><p>Golden Canary also told Qi Yuan about the foolish Daoist's undercover mission.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan said: "Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Back when Qi Yuan gave his teachings, twenty-seven people followed him afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Among those twenty-seven, the foolish Daoist was the leader.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>The foolish Daoist lay on the bed, the sheets stained red with blood. His face was as pale as paper, seriously injured and unconscious.</p><p></p><p>A solemn look appeared on Shang Yanran's bewitching face: "The Purple Sky Celestial Maiden's power is growing stronger and stronger. With just one strike, Big Brother was seriously injured."</p><p></p><p>The twenty-seven of them had sworn brotherhood.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the foolish Daoist was the eldest brother.</p><p></p><p>They all deeply admired the foolish Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Baize stood to the side, saying worriedly: "With the Destiny Stone in her possession, the Purple Sky Celestial Maiden's power is becoming more and more terrifying. I don't know if our Blood Palace can safely weather this crisis?"</p><p></p><p>"Husband, why worry? We won't know until we fight," Shang Yanran said defiantly.</p><p></p><p>She and Baize had been husband and wife even before hearing the teachings.</p><p></p><p>Their personalities were also vastly different.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Baize sighed. "I just feel this world is too difficult.</p><p></p><p>How can someone like the Purple Sky Celestial Maiden, who deceives the world and steals fame, become the leader of the world?</p><p></p><p>Slandering our teacher and declaring him to be the Great Demon is truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>"Who told her to have the Destiny Stone?" Shang Yanran said. She seemed to remember something, and continued: "If war breaks out, we should send Teacher's wife away in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher's wife? What teacher's wife?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, an ethereal, bewitching voice came from the main hall.</p><p></p><p>A handsome man in a blood-red robe appeared, holding hands with a young woman in a bright yellow silk dress.</p><p></p><p>The young woman's face was flushed red. She looked at everyone, stealing glances at Qi Yuan: "Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when the people in the main hall heard that voice and saw the blood-robed figure beside the young woman, expressions of excitement and disbelief appeared on everyone's faces.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>"Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen figures came forward, overwhelmed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that today they would see the Blood Master who had disappeared for three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Their teacher!</p><p></p><p>There was a faint smile in Qi Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Reuniting with old friends, he also felt some joy.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After seeing the goldfinch, his joy faded somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Foolish Daoist on the bed and said softly, "Injured by the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran was a bit excited, but still said seriously, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. When I arrived, I only encountered their army, not the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman. Otherwise... I would have ended that little clown with one sword," Qi Yuan lamented.</p><p></p><p>He had only been gone for 300 years. </p><p></p><p>Yet this Purple Sky Mysterious Woman had been frantically slandering him.</p><p></p><p>This made Qi Yuan feel he had gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>When he finished the game and faced the Palace of Light, he would have to register a few alternate accounts to frantically post and smear the Palace of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Master... did you come from Nine Coils Mountain?" Shang Yanran asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I came non-stop, only stopping on the way to strike with my sword a few times and kill a few people."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's speed was indeed fast.</p><p></p><p>The little old man who was the master of Black Feather and White Spiral wanted to spread the news of the Blood Lord's revival to the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>While the news was still on its way, Qi Yuan had already arrived at the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman is attacking fiercely. My suggestion is that we leave the stronghold and not confront her head-on.</p><p></p><p>There are over a hundred Supreme Realm experts in the Purple Sky Alliance, and the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's power is unfathomable. </p><p></p><p>Our Blood Palace only has eight Supreme Realm experts, with one seriously injured. We are no match for the Purple Sky Alliance," Shang Yanran said calmly.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Lord had not returned, she would have ordered a retreat.</p><p></p><p>But now that the Blood Lord was back, she had to ask for her master's opinion.</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch also tugged at Qi Yuan's sleeve and said softly, "Blood Bead, the enemy is too strong, let's run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch cared nothing for face, only wanting to survive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at everyone and said slowly, "They offended me, why should we run?"</p><p></p><p>His face showed a confident expression: "I'll handle everything!"</p><p></p><p>If it were Supreme Realm experts from the North-South Decisive Battle, Qi Yuan would still be somewhat wary.</p><p></p><p>But the Supreme Realm experts of this world, rather than calling them Supreme Realm, it would be more accurate to call them half-step Supreme Realm without Source Divine Abilities. They were at the same level as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had the Heavenly Dao Foundation - would he fear cultivators at the same level?</p><p></p><p>He could easily take out a bunch with one sword.</p><p></p><p>The only one somewhat troublesome was the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the others looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran smiled and flattered him: "With Master here, there's nothing to worry about!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ze was still full of worry, but didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>For them, the Master's sacredness surpassed even the Destiny Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Foolish Daoist and lightly tapped the void with his hand.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red streak spread through the void, finally condensing into a drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>He flicked the blood drop into the Foolish Daoist's mouth and said, "He will wake up in half a day."</p><p></p><p>This healing technique came from the Human Demon Way.</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan had long mastered the Human Demon Way. His understanding of this system had already surpassed the Venerable One and White Emperor when he last returned to the past.</p><p></p><p>Healing such injuries was no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Since there's nothing else, I'll leave first.</p><p></p><p>When the Purple Sky Alliance attacks, I will take action."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Qi Yuan left holding the goldfinch's hand.</p><p></p><p>Of all his attachments in this world, he was closest to the goldfinch.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to comprehend the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>After annihilating the Purple Sky Alliance, he would try to enter the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Gate of Myriad Differences had not yet opened, and Qi Yuan was not completely certain he could definitely enter it.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, they were just passersby to him.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing Master off!"</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing the Blood Lord off!"</p><p></p><p>Those present said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Watching Qi Yuan leave, those present still felt as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord came and went in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>There was a brief silence in the room, then a Supreme Realm expert spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, were you able to discern Master's strength?" a Supreme Realm expert asked, raising a sensitive question.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he certainly wouldn't ask like this.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Purple Sky Alliance's threat looming, they could no longer hesitate and had to consider their own safety.</p><p></p><p>"Couldn't tell," the other Supreme Realm experts shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lord was innately divine and especially mysterious to them.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran said at this time, "Probably stronger than me, but compared to the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, it's hard to say. After all... the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman has the Destiny Tablet."</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Destiny Tablet, everyone's hearts sank.</p><p></p><p>This supreme treasure had too many magical aspects.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that whoever obtained it could rule the world.</p><p></p><p>There were also rumors that the Buddha could dominate the world with the help of the Destiny Tablet.</p><p></p><p>"Since Master is confident, we should trust him," Bai Ze, who had always been extremely reverent towards the Blood Lord, said with blind faith.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran knew her husband's personality and smiled, "We should make two preparations. On one hand, we'll fight the Purple Sky Alliance together with Master. On the other hand, we need to find an escape route in case of the unexpected."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the ends of the earth, the sea churned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat on a huge rock, quietly comprehending the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>The goldfinch rested her chin on her hands, watching Qi Yuan. Her eyes didn't blink, as if afraid Blood Bead would disappear again in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Bead... how long will you stay this time?" After who knows how long, the goldfinch mustered up the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Qi Yuan didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to comprehend the Source had pulled him into the past of the Flowing Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The girl quietly accompanying him was also a figure from the past.</p><p></p><p>He would eventually return to the present, unable to remain in the past forever.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Qi Yuan felt very troubled.</p><p></p><p>This further strengthened his determination to attain Mixed Origin Sagehood and master the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in comprehending the Gate of Myriad Differences, he hadn't gained any abilities related to space and time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, then when will you appear next time? Will it be when the Gate of Myriad Differences appears again?" the goldfinch asked hopefully.</p><p></p><p>She and Blood Bead were always together briefly and apart for long.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that good things come to those who wait, the goldfinch felt sweet in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," Qi Yuan said, falling into silence. After who knows how long, he slowly said, "Goldfinch... someday, I will find you at the end of time."</p><p></p><p>He had many people he needed to find.</p><p></p><p>There was also Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this young lady will wait for you beautifully!" the goldfinch said happily, "You better not get old! If you come to see this young lady with white hair, this young lady will pretend not to know you!"</p><p></p><p>She moved closer to Qi Yuan, boldly hugging his arm, seeming to cherish this reunion.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's heart also calmed down as he carefully comprehended the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman, he would consider entering the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Blood Palace, dark clouds gathered.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Blood Lord's return had invigorated the Blood Palace for a while.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, not long after, many changes occurred in the Blood Palace.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts who had joined the Blood Palace later fled.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, these experts said: "The Destiny Tablet once said the Blood Lord is the Great Demon!</p><p></p><p>The Great Demon is the source of all inner demons, and should be struck down by all under heaven!"</p><p></p><p>This caused quite a commotion in the Blood Palace, with people panicking.</p><p></p><p>Many wanted to flee.</p><p></p><p>Shang Yanran ruthlessly suppressed some rebels, dyeing the Blood Palace red with blood.</p><p></p><p>This reduced the fleeing somewhat.</p><p></p><p>However, the entire Blood Palace was still like a small boat tossing in wind and rain, with an uncertain fate, in danger of capsizing at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, many old people who had listened to teachings on Nine Coils Mountain rushed to the Blood Palace to support the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these people were too few compared to the powerful experts from all over the world rushing to the ends of the earth to slay the Great Demon.</p><p></p><p>A storm was brewing, with undercurrents surging.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Blood Palace at the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Powerful experts from the Three Great Dynasties, Seven Major Sects, Twelve Clans, and the Purple Sky Alliance continued to gather.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for the Purple Sky Mysterious Woman's order for all the heroes under heaven to strike down the Great Demon together.</p><p></p><p>One day, when the wind was calm and the sea vast, the figure in the blood-colored robe on the beach stood up.</p><p></p><p>Because the Gate of Myriad Differences in the sky finally opened its doors.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Gate of Myriad Differences, his eyes flashing with a bright light.</p><p></p><p>Countless terrifying and bizarre auras spread out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes revealed a greedy look.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that once he entered, he would gain indescribable benefits! Perhaps he could also comprehend his own Source Divine Ability.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, a roar came from within the Gate of Myriad Differences.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a terrifying creature was trying to break free from the Gate of Myriad Differences and emerge.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Gate of Myriad Differences, his greedy expression disappearing and turning strange: "The Great Demon's... inner demon is inside the Gate of Myriad Differences?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a heavy drumbeat sounded, and the entire world became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The great battle... was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>There will be another chapter in half an hour, sorry!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

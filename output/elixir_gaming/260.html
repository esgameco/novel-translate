        <h1>Chapter 260</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan instantly killing Yang Kang was beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>She never imagined Qi Yuan's strength would be this formidable. Wasn't he just at the Divine Infant stage?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had been hiding his true power?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, none of that mattered.</p><p></p><p>What mattered was that Qi Yuan had killed someone!</p><p></p><p>He had killed an official of the Dao Seeking Palace right here in the palace! This was an enormous deal!</p><p></p><p>Even an Yin God wouldn't dare to casually kill someone after coming to the Dao Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian's mind was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress was also stunned, the scene before her eyes beyond her expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go quickly!" At this moment, Li Yaxian's only thought was to escape.</p><p></p><p>Even though she knew they probably couldn't escape successfully.</p><p></p><p>However, just as this thought arose, several powerful auras suddenly spread out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to cause trouble in the Dao Seeking Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Audacious scoundrel, killing someone in our Dao Seeking Palace is a death wish!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, over a dozen powerful auras swept over, immediately surrounding Qi Yuan, Li Yaxian and the others.</p><p></p><p>Each of these people was a Purple Palace cultivator, with terrifyingly strong auras.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by over a dozen Purple Palace cultivators, Li Yaxian's face turned deathly pale. This was the closest she had ever been to death in her life.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress also bit her lip, her face ashen.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, standing among the crowd, remained very calm. He said indifferently: "I am a Dao seeker who has come here sincerely, wishing to challenge the fellow Daoists of the Dao Seeking Palace. If I win, I request that you fellow Daoists gift me your cultivation methods. If I lose, I will bestow upon you fellow Daoists an opportunity to become gods."</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>These words left the Purple Palace cultivators who had come somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian and the woman in the yellow dress were also dumbfounded. Qi Yuan's train of thought jumped too quickly for them to keep up.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to change the subject. How do you explain killing our fellow Daoist Yang Kang?" an elder questioned Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more Purple Palace cultivators gathered here, some observing from afar.</p><p></p><p>"I was preparing to pay my respects to Elder Fu Lu, but this guy told me to sleep with him, so I naturally killed him without a second thought," Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Faced with so many Purple Palace cultivators, he remained very calm.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Li Yaxian feel both admiration and helplessness towards Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"These are all just your one-sided words!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if he verbally insulted you, you should have let our Dao Seeking Palace judge and punish him. What right did you have to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>"Coming to our Dao Seeking Palace means you must follow our Dao Seeking Palace's rules!"</p><p></p><p>These Purple Palace cultivators were furious.</p><p></p><p>After all, killing someone in the Dao Seeking Palace, and killing an official no less, was a slap in their face.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a member of your Dao Seeking Palace, so why should I follow your rules?" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>This immediately enraged the Purple Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The person before them was far too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he know this was the Dao Seeking Palace? How could he be so fearless?</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an ethereal voice resounded in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood-Robed Sword God, as a Great Venerable, why bother playing around with these juniors?"</p><p></p><p>A muscular man clad in blood-red armor appeared.</p><p></p><p>He was completely enveloped in the blood armor, emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Standing there, he seemed both close at hand yet far away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, all the Purple Palace cultivators present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Because the arrival was none other than the behind-the-scenes controller of the Dao Seeking Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch Great Venerable!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch Great Venerable was as elusive as a dragon showing its head but not its tail. Even among these Purple Palace cultivators, 99% had never seen him before.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had actually appeared in person.</p><p></p><p>And what he said...</p><p></p><p>Blood-Robed Sword God...</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>All the Purple Palace cultivators were stunned. The person they had surrounded was the Blood-Robed Sword God! They had actually surrounded a Great Venerable, intending to subdue a Great Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Li Yaxian was also dumbfounded, looking at Qi Yuan in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the yellow dress covered her mouth, her eyes wide as she stared at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She never could have imagined that the man before her was actually her idol, the Blood-Robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Martial Monarch Great Venerable, his gaze calm: "I wasn't playing around with them. They are all Purple Palace cultivators, quite advanced in years, and all count as my elders. I came to the Dao Seeking Palace specifically to challenge these Purple Palace seniors. What I said earlier was true. If they lose to me, they will give me their cultivation methods. If they defeat me, I am willing to bestow upon them the opportunity to become gods."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words made the Purple Palace cultivators present look at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>What virtue or ability did they possess to have a Great Venerable come from afar to challenge them! That was a Great Venerable! All the Purple Palace cultivators of the Dao Seeking Palace combined were no match for a single Yin God Venerable.</p><p></p><p>All the Yin God Venerables in the Azure Waves Realm combined were no match for a single Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable challenging them... they didn't know whether to feel honored or find it absurd.</p><p></p><p>As for the deceased Yang Kang, no one cared about him anymore at this point.</p><p></p><p>If he had died at the hands of an Yin God Venerable, that Yin God Venerable might still be wary of the Martial Monarch Great Venerable's power and apologize.</p><p></p><p>But a Great Venerable was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Offending a Great Venerable and still wanting to live?</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch Great Venerable looked at Qi Yuan, his gaze extremely complex: "You... are you serious?"</p><p></p><p>He had long heard that the Blood-Robed Sword God was eccentric and unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, the Blood-Robed Sword God's meeting with Great Venerable Jasmine had also made the Martial Monarch Great Venerable feel that this Blood-Robed Sword God was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"I never lie, so of course I'm serious. As a young man challenging a group of old monsters from your Dao Seeking Palace, I'm already at a disadvantage. Consider it respecting the elderly and cherishing the young. That's not too much to ask, right?" Qi Yuan said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Palace cultivators were speechless.</p><p></p><p>In their hearts, they wanted to say that this Blood-Robed Sword God's face was too thick.</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable challenging Purple Palace cultivators - had such a thing ever happened since the birth of the Azure Waves Realm? And he even said he was at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>This was too shameless.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, facing so many famous old monsters, I'm actually quite nervous inside. But I still mustered up the courage to come challenge them! Even if I end up battered and surrounded in this battle, I will have no regrets even if I die nine times! This battle shall shake heaven and earth, this battle shall shake the primordial chaos of the universe!" Qi Yuan declared passionately.</p><p></p><p>As if he were a weakling daring to challenge the strong, expressing his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is your purpose?" The Martial Monarch Great Venerable narrowed his eyes, as if trying to see through Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I... want all the cultivation methods of the Dao Seeking Palace. I also want the Dao Seeking Palace to do something for me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly ended his previous fired-up state and told the Martial Monarch Great Venerable about the Original God Sharing Conference.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch Great Venerable frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Your demands... are a bit excessive."</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods were the foundation of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>How could the Dao Seeking Palace's accumulation of over 100,000 years be easily given away?</p><p></p><p>Even if the recipient was a Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch was also a Great Venerable, and at the peak of the fourth step of Treading the Heavens no less. He did not fear Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was a Gazing Moon Great Venerable. In the Azure Waves Realm, he could at most exert power equivalent to a weak fourth step of Treading the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"If I challenge you, and then challenge all the Purple Palace cultivators of the Dao Seeking Palace, defeating you all, would I then be able to... obtain all the cultivation methods?" Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, all the Purple Palace cultivators present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>A divine battle!</p><p></p><p>This was a divine battle!</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God actually wanted to challenge the Martial Monarch Great Venerable!</p><p></p><p>This was beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Monarch Great Venerable was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know where Qi Yuan got the courage to dare challenge him.</p><p></p><p>"You have great courage</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With great confidence, "Wu Jun the Great Venerable One wore a suit of blood-red armor, emanating an especially dangerous aura."</p><p></p><p>He understood.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God came to the Seeking Dao Palace to pick a fight, intending to subdue the palace.</p><p></p><p>Everything else was just an excuse.</p><p></p><p>"If I didn't have such great courage, how could I challenge so many old monsters alone!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, he swept his gaze over the group of Purple Mansion cultivators, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion cultivators who met Qi Yuan's gaze all blushed, wishing they could find a mouse hole to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun the Great Venerable One looked at Qi Yuan, divine light flashing in his eyes: "Even if you didn't come to challenge me, I would have challenged you! Blood-Robed Sword God, if you win, what does it matter if you take a copy of this place's Seeking Dao Palace techniques and texts?</p><p></p><p>But... if you lose, you can never entangle with Venerable Jasmine in this life, and as for the Mythic Secret Treasure... you also cannot touch it!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun's voice resounded, reaching everyone's ears, but the part about the "Mythic Secret Treasure" was only transmitted to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised an eyebrow. </p><p></p><p>He could not accept this outcome of failure.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to entangle with Venerable Jasmine, what about the Mythic Secret Treasure? But thinking that he would not lose, he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Fine." He agreed.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mansion cultivators on the scene were shaken.</p><p></p><p>A divine battle... was it really about to begin? </p><p></p><p>How many years had it been since Yin Gods fought in the Phoenix Sky Realm? Now, two Great Venerable Ones were about to face off.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, seven days from now... we shall battle!" Divine light burst forth from Wu Jun's gaze.</p><p></p><p>To obtain the Mythic Secret Treasure, he had to defeat Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew it was Venerable Jasmine's open stratagem, he still had to play along.</p><p></p><p>Only then would he have a chance to obtain the Mythic Secret Treasure.</p><p></p><p>As for how precious the value of the Mythic Secret Treasure was to Yin Gods, one could well imagine.</p><p></p><p>As for Venerable Jasmine, beautiful as she was, how could Wu Jun truly be infatuated with a woman? Even if that woman was the number one beauty of the Phoenix Sky Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Why wait seven days? Let's do it now. After I defeat you, I still need to challenge the hundred-plus Purple Mansion cultivators of your Seeking Dao Palace. We need to move quickly," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Those Purple Mansion cultivators couldn't hold it in anymore.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to tell the Blood-Robed Sword God to stop dragging them into this, to just ignore them like farts.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun was somewhat taken aback, he hadn't expected Qi Yuan to say this.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want to fight now?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure," Qi Yuan said lazily.</p><p></p><p>"Since you insist, then let's fight!" Wu Jun didn't hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>He guessed that the Blood-Robed Sword God probably didn't want their battle to be watched by others, which was why... he was so eager to fight.</p><p></p><p>His fighting spirit surged within him.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a stream of divine power flowed out, landing on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Qi Yuan and Wu Jun's figures vanished, entering the virtual realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, unleashing power at the Yin God level would pull one into the virtual realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Seeking Dao Palace, those Purple Mansion cultivators saw Qi Yuan leave and the pressure dissipate, finally breathing a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God is so bold, daring to challenge Wu Jun the Great Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>"Where does his confidence come from!"</p><p></p><p>"In the Wangyue Continent, the Blood-Robed Sword God may be very strong, but in the Cang Lan Realm, he's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>Beings who devour the Heavenly Dao receive a boost in their home realm, but when they go to other worlds, they are suppressed by the Heavenly Dao and cannot exert their full power.</p><p></p><p>They can only exert the strength of a weak Great Venerable One, this is common knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the relationship between the Blood-Robed Sword God and the Wangyue Continent, it was indeed concealed at first, but unfortunately the news still leaked out.</p><p></p><p>These Purple Mansion cultivators of the Seeking Dao Palace also roughly knew the Blood-Robed Sword God's background.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the girl in the yellow dress blinked her eyes: "Grandmother, is he really the Blood-Robed Sword God?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing her granddaughter's words, Li Yaxian took a deep breath: "He should be."</p><p></p><p>She couldn't imagine that the man who had lazily sunbathed with her on the flying ship, crying poor, was actually a Great Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>The girl in the yellow dress felt even more conflicted.</p><p></p><p>She had actually thought about matchmaking the Blood-Robed Sword God with her grandmother! The key was, she had once thought the Blood-Robed Sword God wasn't good enough for her grandmother.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately she hadn't shown it, otherwise if the Blood-Robed Sword God found out...</p><p></p><p>"Will the Blood-Robed Sword God win this battle?" the girl in the yellow dress asked Li Yaxian.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Robed Sword God was her idol, and she even knew him. She had been joking with him all along the way, occasionally teasing him with words. Now thinking back, it felt like a dream.</p><p></p><p>So, she hoped the Blood-Robed Sword God would win.</p><p></p><p>"It will be very difficult," said Li Yaxian.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the virtual realm, there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and Wu Jun stood suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>This agreed battle began in a hurry, so there were no spectators.</p><p></p><p>Even if other Yin Gods knew the two were battling, they didn't know where.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun looked at Qi Yuan, emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>After entering the virtual realm, he no longer suppressed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura swept out, as if space itself was about to explode.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, his fighting spirit high: "Let me see what your confidence is really based on!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand how the Blood-Robed Sword God dared to challenge him! The gap between Yin Gods was extremely large.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Blood-Robed Sword God's battle record was nothing more than killing a few Yin God Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm, suppressed by the Heavenly Dao, his strength could easily defeat Yin God Venerable Ones, but facing a Great Venerable One was simply suicide.</p><p></p><p>"When I formed my Golden Core, I dared to move against Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>Now that I've condensed a Divine Infant, what's there to fear in moving against a Great Venerable One?"</p><p></p><p>"Mad ravings, putting on an act!" Wu Jun shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, a powerful divine domain was deployed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The confrontation between Great Venerable Ones was simple, just a collision of divine domains.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun made his move, immediately deploying his divine domain, clearly wanting to end this quickly.</p><p></p><p>"My divine domain is called Breaking Gold!"</p><p></p><p>Within Wu Jun's divine domain, the strongest was the power of gold, representing the ultimate in attack.</p><p></p><p>As the divine domain expanded, Qi Yuan saw endless golden qi, forming countless golden halberds and magical artifacts, attacking towards him.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such an attack, Qi Yuan chuckled: "Your divine domain... is still too small."</p><p></p><p>The divine domain before Qi Yuan's eyes was very small to him, and there wasn't much golden qi either.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Wu Jun snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>His divine domain was not small, and its energy level was high, ranking among the strong even among Great Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>Wu Jun said coldly: "Let me see just how big your divine domain is!"</p><p></p><p>The golden halberds swept forth like swords approaching.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained calm, his voice majestic.</p><p></p><p>"Glorious yang, Divine Infant emerges from the mystic treasury, heed my command, golden virtue shines brilliantly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan chanted softly.</p><p></p><p>With his voice, a Divine Infant appeared, an ancient and vast aura spreading.</p><p></p><p>Space seemed to freeze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>An old and ethereal voice, as if crossing the river of time:</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Virtue Taibai Tahao Star Lord obeys the command!"</p><p></p><p>With this voice, Wu Jun's expression became one of shock.</p><p></p><p>What did he see! His lips couldn't help but move, his body trembling uncontrollably. His proud divine domain shook at this moment, on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Though it was just a Divine Infant, he saw what seemed to be a divine domain as large as a star unfold before him.</p><p></p><p>That star seemed even larger than the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>A divine domain even larger than the Cang Lan Realm! Was this still a divine domain?</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a divine domain! He trembled, shaking, unable to comprehend at all.</p><p></p><p>Endless golden qi, pure and pristine, as if a single strand could shatter his divine domain.</p><p></p><p>How... how could he fight this?

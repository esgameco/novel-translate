        <h1>Chapter 329</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Are nuclear weapons powerful? A high-yield nuclear weapon can destroy a mountain or level a city! However, compared to the Eye in the Sky, nuclear weapons are a level below.</p><p></p><p>The Eye in the Sky not only has precision strike capabilities and long-range targeted killing, but can also carry out large-scale bombardment. </p><p></p><p>However, even with its precision targeting, the Eye in the Sky has a minimum attack range.</p><p></p><p>At its smallest, it's still as big as a large building.</p><p></p><p>So if Mu Longxian activates the Eye in the Sky, the death toll would definitely exceed a thousand, or even tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, they're just worthless lives, it doesn't matter if they die.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Yang family's grandson died, three thousand minor officials in Feng Province died in the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>What, is my son worth less than the Yang family's grandson?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Longxian said angrily. </p><p></p><p>Back then, even government employees were implicated, with a large portion dying.</p><p></p><p>Now these people in the mall are just commoners, it doesn't matter if they die.</p><p></p><p>As for public opinion?</p><p></p><p>That's simple.</p><p></p><p>We'll say Gui Ran country carried out a terrorist attack under the instructions of Ancient Wu country.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuan country and Ancient Wu country have cooperated on this kind of thing many times.</p><p></p><p>They just take turns taking the blame.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the upper echelons of Ancient Wu country got angry, they destroyed one of their own small towns, causing mass casualties.</p><p></p><p>In the end they pinned the blame on Qin Yuan country, saying Qin Yuan did it.</p><p></p><p>The common people at the bottom not only won't suspect those above, they'll even unite in hatred against the enemy country.</p><p></p><p>As for suspicions... let them suspect.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Martial Stars have absolute control, they're not afraid of resistance from the lower classes.</p><p></p><p>"My... my younger brother is still in the mall!" Han Kang said anxiously. </p><p></p><p>At this point, he had also lost his composure.</p><p></p><p>"My son is dead, what does it matter if your brother dies?" Mu Longxian said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Activate Eye in the Sky unit Mu-03, location..." Mu Longxian began issuing orders.</p><p></p><p>He had lost his senses.</p><p></p><p>After his son's death, his status in the family had plummeted.</p><p></p><p>Now, only by eliminating Qi Yuan could he resolve the hatred in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, his mission also included eliminating Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, a voice entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the one my husband mentioned, who kills the small ones, then kills the middle ones among the middle ones?"</p><p></p><p>The voice came suddenly, sounding ethereal yet alluring.</p><p></p><p>Mu Longxian was stunned, as were the others in the hall who were shocked by this voice.</p><p></p><p>They saw that a young couple had suddenly appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>This young couple was none other than the male and female leads they had just been watching on screen.</p><p></p><p>They were... about 10 kilometers away, right?</p><p></p><p>How did they suddenly appear here after just a few lines of dialogue? Mu Longxian had a sense of impending doom and hurriedly shouted: "Guards, come quickly, arrest them!"</p><p></p><p>He was truly frightened.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang was also dumbfounded, looking at his brother's friend, feeling a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>That person from before... could he be one of the legendary immortal cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Although he had the qualifications to be here today, in reality Han Kang was still quite ignorant about Qi Yuan's true identity.</p><p></p><p>So when faced with Mu Longxian using the Eye in the Sky, he felt it was extremely absurd and incomprehensible, as well as unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Now with Ning Tao and Qi Yuan suddenly appearing here, he instantly understood, and connected the dots with the incident at the Gui Ran military camp.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Mu Longxian, his eyes filled with a brilliant smile: "It really feels great to have strong backing."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he deliberately bent down slightly and hugged Ning Tao's thigh through her black dress.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, no one noticed these small actions.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Mu Longxian and continued: "Kill the small ones, and the villains come for the middle ones, endlessly and extremely united. </p><p></p><p>But I... hmm, I have my wife's strong backing to rely on.</p><p></p><p>I'm not afraid of your unity, I'm only afraid you won't be united, otherwise... wouldn't that mean, hmm, I can't wipe out entire families?"</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan talked about having strong backing, he wasn't just saying it, he was a man of action who really did hug his wife's thigh.</p><p></p><p>Right now, in terms of just this body's strength, Qi Yuan was far inferior compared to Ning Tao.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was best to tightly hug his wife's thigh.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice was very calm, and sounded particularly nonchalant.</p><p></p><p>A blush appeared on Ning Tao's ears: "After killing the middle ones, I'll accompany my husband... to kill the old ones."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she lightly raised her palm.</p><p></p><p>The previously arrogant and haughty Mu Longxian suddenly showed fear on his face, his eyes like those of a dead dog.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>With the threat of death upon him, he seemed to finally understand the rule of equality for all living beings.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to beg for mercy, but unfortunately, he couldn't say anything at all.</p><p></p><p>His body also shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the modern technological defenses seemed to be nonexistent.</p><p></p><p>He shattered, yet didn't shatter, and directly lay on the ground.</p><p></p><p>All signs of life were gone.</p><p></p><p>All these high-ranking officials and political figures present trembled.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, they felt so powerless.</p><p></p><p>Ever since becoming elites, their mentality had changed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if everything in the world was like a chess game, and they were the chess players.</p><p></p><p>Everything had to follow the rules they set.</p><p></p><p>All the common people were just chess pieces.</p><p></p><p>As for... the fury of a common man? That was just a joke.</p><p></p><p>For those in power like them, who didn't have nanobot protective suits, and even had security details, there was no such thing as a commoner's fury spilling blood.</p><p></p><p>Apart from other chess players, the only thing they needed to worry about and fear was the issue of which side to take.</p><p></p><p>But now, they were utterly terrified, realizing for the first time that there were things in this world beyond their control.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Tao's gaze swept over the political figures present, her expression as bright as starlight: "You... and you... you... you all have killing intent in your eyes, you're on the side of dead men... so you should all die."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao was like the King of Hell marking names in the Book of Life and Death - whoever she pointed at perished.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, seven high-ranking officials in the room lost their lives.</p><p></p><p>The remaining officials stood in place, holding their breath, not daring to say anything.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang stood rooted to the spot, his mind buzzing.</p><p></p><p>Because among the seven dead officials, three were from the provincial cabinet.</p><p></p><p>One of them was even his direct superior, someone he had to look up to carefully.</p><p></p><p>But now, they had fallen like dead dogs.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be shocked and terrified?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan and that alluring young woman were so terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly feel like reciting a poem," Qi Yuan said thoughtfully, struck by poetic inspiration. "The imperial storehouse burns to ashes of brocade, the streets are trodden with the bones of ministers and nobles."</p><p></p><p>Although the officials present had never heard this poem before, their faces changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>They were all cultured people, so they naturally understood the meaning of these lines.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent poem... excellent poem..."</p><p></p><p>The top official from the provincial cabinet tremblingly stood up, praising shakily.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had never been this obsequious even when facing members of the Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang also hurriedly stood up and said: "This poem is superb, capturing both emotion and scene. Mr. Qi... is truly talented."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, three or four other officials also stood up to praise.</p><p></p><p>It was as if by praising Qi Yuan's poem, Qi Yuan would spare them.</p><p></p><p>Their praise made Qi Yuan quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't write this poem."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was very honest, never wanting to take credit for others' work.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star hadn't been destroyed yet, so if he was caught plagiarizing poetry, wouldn't that be very embarrassing?</p><p></p><p>"The recitation was melodious and forceful, quite in the style of a sage!" another official took the opportunity to flatter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was amused.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder ancient emperors liked flatterers."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on the secretary beside Han Kang.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you try flattering me too, to amuse me?"</p><p></p><p>Han Kang's secretary's face immediately became worse than if he were crying, his body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, I'm a very positive person, I never hold grudges.</p><p></p><p>Although last time you said Wuyun Pavilion belonged to your family, you were stating facts, which can't be changed. It's only my fault for... being poor and not having the ability to buy Gongxing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, I would have retorted back then."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, the secretary's face turned deathly pale, looking worse than if he were crying.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... this lowly one was wrong." The secretary wished he could go back to a few days ago and tear his mouth to shreds. How could he have been so stupid to say such things?</p><p></p><p>"Don't make that expression, you weren't wrong, what you said was right, it's me who lacks ability... Sigh, you're like this, doesn't it make me seem like a petty person who resorts to violence when I can't win an argument?" Qi Yuan couldn't help saying.</p><p></p><p>He had always been very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>He would never use force if reason could prevail.</p><p></p><p>Convince with reason!</p><p></p><p>As a result, in the secretary's imagination, was he some kind of murderous demon who would slaughter entire families?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the secretary directly collapsed to the ground, too scared to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Qi Yuan couldn't help sighing again, "I still prefer your defiant look when I first met you. Unfortunately in just a few short days, society has worn away your edges. You've had it tough."</p><p></p><p>The people present wanted to laugh, but didn't dare to.</p><p></p><p>The secretary looked even more like his mother had died.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, goodbye for now. Now that we've killed the middle ones, I need to accompany my wife to kill the old ones."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan put his arm around Ning Tao's soft waist.</p><p></p><p>Because Ning Tao was about to take him to the capital.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't hold on tight, the journey would be very slow.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the top official from the provincial cabinet hurriedly said: "Mr. Qi, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what is it? You don't want me to leave yet?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You want to help him flatter me?" Qi Yuan glanced again at the secretary collapsed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The secretary was immediately looked at by everyone, feeling a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan continued: "I've always been a reasonable person. Don't demote him just because he's upright and doesn't flatter me. Although we've had some arguments and grudges, I want to settle our scores personally. Don't interfere!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already planned that when he saved up enough money, he would buy Gong Xing.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would take out the "Star Property Certificate" and slap it in the secretary's face, saying fiercely:</p><p></p><p>"See this? Gong Xing is all mine. Wu Yunting is yours... so what?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still immersed in his future fantasy, feeling happier the more he thought about it.</p><p></p><p>This kind of fantasy was certainly pleasant, similar to how a loser might fantasize about finally hugging a goddess.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the top official said: "Mr. Qi, the royal family of our Qin Yuan country has goodwill towards you. It's just that there are bad people in the upper echelons of the empire. This incident targeting you was entirely Mu family's fault."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuan country was ruled by the royal family, but the Seven Martial Stars held power that in some ways surpassed the royal family.</p><p></p><p>This provincial cabinet's top official was aligned with the royal faction.</p><p></p><p>The royal faction's attitude towards Qi Yuan was one of trying to win him over.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I understand. Am I some kind of bloodthirsty person? As if I would go and kill all the people of the Seven Martial Stars? No, I'm a very kind person. I believe in repaying kindness with kindness and grudges with vengeance. At most I'd just kill the entire Mu family."</p><p></p><p>The officials present lowered their heads, some even couldn't help but draw in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>The Mu family in the capital probably numbered in the thousands.</p><p></p><p>Including other branches, the number exceeded ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>So, on this towering tree of Qin Yuan country, there were all kinds of bloodsuckers.</p><p></p><p>Killing the entire Mu family was not considered bloodthirsty.</p><p></p><p>"You all lack experience. I once knew someone who was truly bloodthirsty. If it were him, he'd probably kill everyone with the surname Mu on Gong Xing," Qi Yuan said. "I'm very kind, I'll only kill the main culprits... and those who are hostile to me."</p><p></p><p>After Qi Yuan finished speaking, his figure disappeared just like that.</p><p></p><p>In his ear, Ning Tao's coquettish voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, I hear they say the Sky Eye is very powerful. Do you want your servant to take you up there and... tear apart the Mu family's Sky Eye?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... alright." Qi Yuan nodded, holding Ning Tao's hand even tighter.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was afraid of falling.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the great hall, after Qi Yuan left, the remaining officials all took a deep breath and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>When Qi Yuan was present, they were too nervous, feeling as if their heads were not their own.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the top official of the provincial hall looked at Han Kang and questioned: "What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>He was referring, of course, to Qi Yuan questioning that secretary.</p><p></p><p>The secretary was now slumped on the ground, his eyes vacant, still not having recovered.</p><p></p><p>Han Kang hurriedly explained: "This matter..."</p><p></p><p>He reported the events that had occurred truthfully.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but complain inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Why did his secretary have to be so loose-lipped and say such a thing?</p><p></p><p>However, the top official's eyes lit up: "Your brother... is he close to him?"</p><p></p><p>Han Kang also thought of something, feeling somewhat excited, and then said: "A few days ago, when the Mu family was about to make a move against Mr. Qi, I don't know where my brother got the news from, but he told Mr. Qi about it."</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The top official slapped his thigh, his face showing a delighted expression. "This was done well. Quickly, tell me about your brother's relationship with Mr. Qi."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Kang also knew this was his opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already offended the Mu family, he might as well get on this big ship in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"My brother and Mr. Qi are both martial artists..." Han Kang told the top official everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>The top official's eyes brightened even more: "It's good to have this connection... but..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, he became worried again.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Eye... the Sky Eye controlled by the Seven Martial Star families... is too powerful.</p><p></p><p>No, I must immediately report to the King. We must stop the Mu family from using the Sky Eye!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital.</p><p></p><p>The most prosperous place in Qin Yuan country.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>The old man sat in the main seat, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Beside the old man stood several middle-aged men, their expressions also not very good.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Seventh Prince and Gongyi Cai, his face showing dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Do you, the royal family and the Gongyi family, want to meddle in our Mu family's affairs?"</p><p></p><p>There was anger in the old man's voice.</p><p></p><p>The royal family had weakened, even unable to compare to any of the Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>The Gongyi family had declined even further; if not for still controlling a Sky Eye, they would have long been expelled from the Seven Martial Stars.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Seventh Prince and Gongyi Cai, the Mu family patriarch showed no courtesy.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince stood up, his voice cultured and quite graceful, showing no dissatisfaction with Old Master Mu's attitude: "Old Patriarch Mu, we can sit down and discuss matters. Using a weapon of mass destruction like the Sky Eye is not beneficial to the country and could easily cause disputes."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Mu snorted coldly: "I see that your royal family has taken a liking to him and wants to win him over? Hmph, he killed my grandson. How can we let him off just like that? How would our Mu family maintain our standing among the Seven Martial Stars? Want to sit down and talk? It's simple. As long as he kneels down, hands over everything he has, and cuts off both his arms, this matter will be over. Otherwise... the Sky Eye will definitely descend upon him."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Mu was greatly angered.</p><p></p><p>This time, if they didn't really take action against Qi Yuan, how would their Mu family save face?</p><p></p><p>How would the other Seven Martial Star families view them? Would they treat the Mu family as a pushover?</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Prince spoke unhurriedly: "Patriarch Mu, according to the treaty signed between the Seven Martial Stars and the royal family, using a weapon of the Sky Eye's caliber requires application to higher authorities and approval from the royal family. If Patriarch Mu intends to move against Mr. Qi, please follow the treaty."</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the royal family had not completely declined and still held some authority, they signed such a treaty with the Seven Martial Star families.</p><p></p><p>However now, with the royal family's decline, many Seven Martial Star families didn't take this treaty seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, some would follow the treaty and apply upwards, but the royal family would generally just go through the motions and not refuse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Seventh Prince bringing up this treaty represented the royal family's determination to win over Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was also to make the Mu family wary of the royal family, thus not using the Sky Eye and ending this conflict.</p><p></p><p>"Heh." Old Master Mu sneered, "Treaty? Royal family? We Seven Martial Star families regard you as the royal family, so you are the royal family. If we don't regard you as the royal family, how are you any different from a dog on the street? Without your own Sky Eye, does the royal family... even qualify to be called royal?"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Mu directly tore off the mask, not even bothering to pretend anymore.</p><p></p><p>Decades ago, a man married a princess of the royal family. That man was young and promising, seen as a rising star of the royal family. The royal family strongly supported him, hoping to revitalize the royal family's reputation.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, in the end, that man would steal away the control rights of the royal family's last three Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>This sounds ridiculous and inconceivable, but it's true.</p><p></p><p>Since losing the authority over the Sky Eyes, the royal family truly declined completely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Master Mu gave no face to the Seventh Prince at all, directly tearing off the mask.</p><p></p><p>What he said was also the truth.</p><p></p><p>The royal family existed in name only.</p><p></p><p>Their power could only spread to a few provinces.</p><p></p><p>As for the military?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even control a single military region.</p><p></p><p>They also had no Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>This royal family... what were they if not mascots?</p><p></p><p>Hearing Old Master Mu's insulting words, even though the Seventh Prince had good cultivation, a flash of hatred appeared in his eyes. He clenched his fists, his nails digging into his flesh. He raised his head, his face still wearing a smile: "Old Patriarch Mu, the world is changing greatly now, with the revival of the immortal path. Mr. Qi can be considered a leader on the path of immortality. If he lives, it will benefit all of us. Moreover, the Sky Eye cannot be used indefinitely. Once its energy is depleted, it will be very difficult to replenish, so..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the authority over the Sky Eye is in my hands. I'll use it however I want! Oh, I forgot, it seems a certain royal family could even have their Sky Eye authority tricked away, haha." Old Master Mu laughed loudly, giving no face to the royal family or the Gongyi family at all. "And you, Gongyi Cai, if your Gongyi family doesn't work harder, I'm afraid in less than a hundred years, you might end up like the royal family, losing even the authority over your last Sky Eye."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Mu attacked Gongyi Cai again, his eyes showing disdain as he coldly snorted: "Only weak mice... huddle together."</p><p></p><p>As one of the top three families among the Seven Martial Stars, Old Master Mu had the right to speak like this.</p><p></p><p>Even daughters from great families on Zhan Xing would choose to marry into their Mu family.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that among the ten most powerful people on Gong Xing, he occupied one spot.</p><p></p><p>"Mu System Sky Eyes 01 to 13, hear my command. Operate at full power, activate war mode..." Old Master Mu spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>His body had various nanomachines.</p><p></p><p>The password lock controlling the Sky Eye was his voice, specially modulated, impossible to copy or fake.</p><p></p><p>The network was also independent from the common internet.</p><p></p><p>"First command, activate Sky Eye, search for Qi Yuan's location!"</p><p></p><p>Old Master Mu continued to issue orders.</p><p></p><p>Today, he wanted to show the world the unchallengeable authority of the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a mechanical voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Command issuance failed. Encountered unknown error."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

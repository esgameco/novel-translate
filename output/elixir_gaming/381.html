        <h1>Chapter 381</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In his mind, sword intent crisscrossed, slaughtering the myriad Dao, or perhaps... forgetting the myriad Dao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stepped on the black sea and arrived at the place of origin.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the shore of the black sea was teeming with people.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand Martial Lords stood there, as if they had long known Qi Yuan would come.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Heavenly Venerable!" </p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords bowed, their expressions respectful.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qi Yuan's expression remained calm: "What's this? Have you all come to your senses now?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>How should these people come to their senses?</p><p></p><p>Blossoming... perhaps they could only blossom with blood.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Venerable, everything before was a misunderstanding." The Black Deer Martial Lord stepped forward, his expression respectful. "Now, the Eastern Lord is waiting for you at the place of calamity. </p><p></p><p>The Eastern Lord said he will explain all the misunderstandings to you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's expression did not change. </p><p></p><p>His expression was either calm or with a smile at the corner of his mouth, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"This guy, he's finally willing to see me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>"Since he's willing to see me, then I'll go meet him."</p><p></p><p>The realm of Myriad Dao Martial God is the realm of Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>However, this Myriad Dao Martial God is somewhat different from Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>In the Yang Spirit realm, going to other worlds or even universes would result in a downgrade.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Martial God seems to be unaffected by this limitation.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Myriad Dao Martial God realm, Qi Yuan's strength had indeed increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Elder God Thunder appeared: "This old man will go with you."</p><p></p><p>The other divine infants also spoke up one after another: "We shall go together."</p><p></p><p>They were also extremely wary of the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>They were not at ease letting Qi Yuan face danger alone.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the place of origin, his expression calm: "Perhaps the Dawn's Call is about to begin, and this place of origin seems unable to sustain Yang Spirits. If you stay here... you'll be forced to leave anyway.</p><p></p><p>Since fate has arranged for you to leave... well, although I don't particularly like fate, today we'll follow what fate says. You and I will go together to meet the Eastern Lord."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless shadowy figures appeared behind Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"We obey your command!"</p><p></p><p>Each shadowy figure was noble beyond words, mysterious and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Like chaos demon gods, they stood behind Qi Yuan. Even though they were suppressing their auras with all their might, people still dared not look at them directly.</p><p></p><p>Those Martial Lords all felt an urge to prostrate themselves in worship.</p><p></p><p>Some of them even gave the feeling of being more majestic and terrifying than the Eastern Lord.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those who were originally unwavering began to feel worried in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But soon, their gazes became firm again.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Lord was the ultimate truth of this world.</p><p></p><p>Numbers... were useless.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell everyone, I hope we'll have the chance to meet again."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Those terrifying, majestic demon god-like shadows also vanished at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Black Deer Martial Lord gritted his teeth, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. Only after those figures had completely disappeared did he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The other Martial Lords present were the same.</p><p></p><p>The pressure Qi Yuan and those terrifying figures gave them was too great.</p><p></p><p>Especially since those terrifying figures were far more numerous than they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>They had thought there would only be a few, but the result was... thousands?</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Lord should be able to deal with them, right?" a female Martial Lord asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Just now, those Heavenly Venerables had given them too much pressure.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean 'deal with'? The Eastern Lord will tell them the truth, and they will trust the Eastern Lord, just like us!"</p><p></p><p>"Right, with the support of so many strong experts over the years, the Eastern Lord will surely resolve the calamity and successfully save the world."</p><p></p><p>"We can't just sit and wait either. Let's go resurrect his dao companion as the Eastern Lord entrusted us to do!"</p><p></p><p>"Right!"</p><p></p><p>"Now that the worlds are converging unstoppably, we will also descend to the place of ending.</p><p></p><p>We should choose a protagonist and have her kill all the girls of destiny, merge all the memories, and then fuse in... She will be the Eastern Lord's dao companion! If she is resurrected and goes to the place of calamity, everything will be fine.</p><p></p><p>We too will welcome true rebirth!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, they're gone, no one can stop us now!"</p><p></p><p>Several titled Martial Lords were excited, their expressions twisted.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had restarted several eras and failed each time.</p><p></p><p>This time, they finally saw the dawn of success, how could they not be excited?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a different voice spoke up: "Seniors, if the Scroll of Mountains and Seas converges, won't everyone kill each other, leaving only the One True?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was a male.</p><p></p><p>This man was a peak Martial King who had come from a stronghold.</p><p></p><p>In the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, he had pledged his love to a prime minister's daughter and even taught her martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had looked forward to reuniting with his lover.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that the merging of worlds... would be a massacre?</p><p></p><p>"Mm, in each Scroll of Mountains and Seas, there is an avatar of the Eastern Lord's dao companion.</p><p></p><p>Each avatar is experiencing past events.</p><p></p><p>The Scroll of Mountains and Seas was originally illusory. The Eastern Lord used the Brush of Mountains, Rivers and Land to draw out the illusion and turn it into the creation of one truth.</p><p></p><p>We will support one avatar, letting her kill and devour the other avatars.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she will devour destiny and become the Eastern Lord's dao companion.</p><p></p><p>The Scroll of Mountains and Seas she is in will represent the truth, the future of our place of origin.</p><p></p><p>The other Scrolls of Mountains and Seas will become illusory, and the place of ending will become the past.</p><p></p><p>Without an ending, the Scroll of Mountains and Seas created by the Eastern Lord will be the true future, an infinite future!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Deer Martial Lord's face showed a fanatical expression.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, after the world had been restarted time and time again, they were finally about to succeed.</p><p></p><p>"But this way... won't everyone in the other Scrolls of Mountains and Seas die?" The man's face turned bitter. His lover was still in one of the Scrolls of Mountains and Seas.</p><p></p><p>If his lover was in one of the Scrolls to be sacrificed, he couldn't accept it.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of the world, some sacrifices are necessary!" the Black Deer Martial Lord replied.</p><p></p><p>A titled Martial Lord also spoke up: "They were created by the Eastern Lord in the first place. Their purpose from birth was to be sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>Now, it's time for them to sacrifice themselves!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Eastern Lord created them, a tremendous kindness they could never repay in a thousand lifetimes!"</p><p></p><p>The gazes of these Martial Lords were firm.</p><p></p><p>After all, having been firm for so many years, even if they truly realized their mistake, they wouldn't admit it.</p><p></p><p>"The Scroll of Mountains and Seas was indeed created by the Eastern Lord, so there is gratitude owed, but the place of ending... how innocent are they?" At this point, Mu Yan finally couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>"They were doomed to perish anyway, we're just helping them along!" At this moment, Mu Yan's bloodline ancestor spoke up. He looked at Mu Yan and said softly, "You newly ascended Martial Lords have experienced too few years and haven't seen the Eastern Lord's true face, so it's normal to have such misunderstandings.</p><p></p><p>For this task of the Eastern Lord, you should just stay and guard the place of origin."</p><p></p><p>As this Martial Lord spoke, he immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>Many Martial Lords present also took action, restraining those newly ascended Martial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"No, ancestor, what you're doing is too insane! Perhaps there's no need to destroy these worlds at all. The Heavenly Venerable Qi Yuan might be able to stop the great calamity!" Mu Yan shouted hoarsely, his voice filled with anguish.</p><p></p><p>Although he considered himself selfish and self-interested, he was unwilling to see the death of those he knew or was close to.</p><p></p><p>In the Scroll of Mountains and Seas, he had lived for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>He had also made many friends.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to see them die.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he had never seen the Eastern Lord and didn't trust the Eastern Lord's plan at all.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Compared to Dongjun, he was more willing to believe Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The enemy of the great catastrophe was indeed powerful.</p><p></p><p>But... wasn't Qi Yuan the Celestial Venerable also powerful?</p><p></p><p>With the mighty power to swallow stars whole, plus so many powerful followers.</p><p></p><p>With so many strong individuals, couldn't they resolve this small catastrophe? If they couldn't resolve this, would Dongjun's schemes work?</p><p></p><p>"No need for further words, what Dongjun said is true!" a Martial Lord spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"You all are... too terrifying!" Mu Yan despaired. </p><p></p><p>It was as if he was seeing these people for the first time.</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords restrained Mu Yan and the others, throwing them into the Primordial Land.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Martial Lords all turned to look at the Black Sea at this moment, their gazes surging.</p><p></p><p>"The great transformation of heaven and earth has begun, the power of the Black Sea has disappeared, and we can now enter the Black Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The many worlds of the Mountain and Sea Scroll are within the Black Sea."</p><p></p><p>"To save time, we should invade the Mountain and Sea Scroll, slaughter all the mortals, capture the avatars, and deliver them to the main body!"</p><p></p><p>A titled Martial Lord proposed.</p><p></p><p>The other titled Martial Lords nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"With such an achievement of saving the world, we shall be revered as gods!"</p><p></p><p>These Martial Lords poured into the Black Sea in great numbers.</p><p></p><p>They had long ago chosen a Mountain and Sea Scroll as the true world.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Dongjun's dao companion in this Mountain and Sea Scroll was the most complete and the most love-brained.</p><p></p><p>As long as they captured the other avatars and sent them before her, letting her devour and kill them,</p><p></p><p>Dongjun's dao companion would be revived in her body.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, after being suppressed for a million years, persevering for a million years, we are finally about to succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Above the Black Sea, these Martial Lords laughed maniacally. </p><p></p><p>They had been constantly restarting, constantly reincarnating, their wills long since distorted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the lifespan of a Martial Lord was not even a million years.</p><p></p><p>They were no longer ordinary Martial Lords now.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally stopped suppressing themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, there's a sea eye ahead, it must be the entrance to a Mountain and Sea Scroll.</p><p></p><p>This Mountain and Sea Scroll shall be mine!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, an old man spoke up, his voice wheezy.</p><p></p><p>He entered the Mountain and Sea Scroll to capture the avatar of Dongjun's dao companion.</p><p></p><p>As for the other living beings, he would slaughter them personally.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they killed themselves, how long would it take to end? And what if the people in the chosen true world fell in love with their parallel world selves and were unwilling to kill? So to save trouble, it was better for them to do the killing.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Venerable has left, there is no one in this world who can stop us!" This titled Martial Lord laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>With the great transformation of heaven and earth, the Primordial Land could no longer accommodate Yang spirits.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qi Yuan had schemes and left behind powerful individuals, they could not stay in the Primordial Land.</p><p></p><p>If not for the great transformation, they would not have been able to enter the Black Sea, and it would have been even more impossible for people to hide inside the Black Sea.</p><p></p><p>So now, they were like dragons emerging from the sea, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>After the titled Martial Lord finished speaking, he reached his giant hand into that Mountain and Sea Scroll.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other titled Martial Lords also began searching for entrances to other Mountain and Sea Scrolls.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the riverbank, Lüzhu's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Only to see that a crack appeared in the original sky.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, grim claw reached out from the sky, as if to destroy this world.</p><p></p><p>Countless people looked at this apocalyptic scene, trembling and showing expressions of fear.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a Martial Lord, the legendary Martial Lord!" Lüzhu gritted her teeth, killing intent in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanyu beside her seemed calmer, but disappointment still flashed through her eyes: "What a pity, it's going to... end before it even gathered?"</p><p></p><p>She seemed to know a lot, and understood her own fate.</p><p></p><p>The only disappointment was that the Mountain and Sea Scroll had not gathered, she had not seen Qi Yuan, and had not received the black stockings Qi Yuan was to give her.</p><p></p><p>She had promised to wear black stockings for Qi Yuan to see.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't accept this fate!" Lüzhu gritted her teeth and shouted loudly, "Blood Slaughter Staff, I need your help!"</p><p></p><p>With Lüzhu's shout, the river before her turned red at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red wooden staff appeared.</p><p></p><p>This wooden staff was extremely blood-red and bizarre.</p><p></p><p>This staff was the weapon of the Red Staff Demon Slayer.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Red Staff Demon Slayer exterminated all demons in the world and left with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Slaughter Staff was left by him in this world.</p><p></p><p>This staff also became the first sacred weapon of this world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lüzhu gripped the Blood Slaughter Staff that her master had once held, her expression resolute: "What my master could do, I can do too!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p></p><p>The huge blood-colored long staff charged towards the giant claw in the sky without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Blood color spread, the sky turned blood-red at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The collision sounded like heaven and earth shattering.</p><p></p><p>Blood dripped from Lüzhu's eyes, she looked at the giant claw in the sky, her expression desperate: "Master... I'm sorry, your disciple is still too weak, I haven't learned even a bit of your true essence."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the titled Martial Lord in the sky showed a surprised expression: "To think there could be power at the Martial Lord level in this Mountain and Sea Scroll, this red wooden staff is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>The titled Martial Lord glanced over Lüzhu, his gaze falling on Wang Yuanyu: "This old man is very lucky, to encounter you as soon as I arrived, no need to search one by one in an anthill."</p><p></p><p>Lüzhu gritted her teeth looking at the sky, saying unwillingly: "If my master were here, how could he let you run wild!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, mere natives of a Mountain and Sea Scroll, how dare you be arrogant.</p><p></p><p>You have no idea how great the gap between you and me is.</p><p></p><p>Even if your master appeared, how could he stop me, who in this world could stop me!"</p><p></p><p>The titled Martial Lord laughed arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he had communicated with insects.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wang Yuanyu looked at the titled Martial Lord and said softly: "Your target is me, I'll leave with you, can you spare the others?"</p><p></p><p>The titled Martial Lord shook his head: "Dongjun bestowed grace, letting you exist for so long, now, you should repay Dongjun... all perish!"</p><p></p><p>As the titled Martial Lord spoke, he grinned ferociously, his huge bone claw grabbing towards Wang Yuanyu.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a cold voice suddenly sounded by the titled Martial Lord's ear.</p><p></p><p>"This wooden staff, my husband is quite fond of it, he's mentioned it to me a few times.</p><p></p><p>You've dirtied his staff, shouldn't you... atone with your death!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, the titled Martial Lord's eyes shrank.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a woman in a black dress appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>The woman had a petite and delicate figure, extremely pale skin, but her voice was as cold as frost.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a layer of mist around her, making it impossible to see her face clearly, or to see exactly where she was.</p><p></p><p>"Who... are you?" The titled Martial Lord was wary and puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I am... Qi Yuan's little wife."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao smiled sweetly, glanced at Lüzhu and Wang Yuanyu, and lightly pointed her finger forward.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, that terrifyingly powerful titled Martial Lord showed a fearful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Time... no, who exactly are you!"</p><p></p><p>He was already white-haired and elderly.</p><p></p><p>But when she pointed her finger, he felt as if he had experienced endless years.</p><p></p><p>His body decayed, his consciousness became muddled.</p><p></p><p>"My husband was right, those who don't like to bathe should go underground to grow trees!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao waved her hand, and this titled Martial Lord instantly perished, dying of old age.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

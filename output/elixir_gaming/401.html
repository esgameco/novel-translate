        <h1>Chapter 401</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ling Yayi was surprised and confused.</p><p></p><p>Wuguang Fozi, Zilian Funü and others were even more shocked and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Who is Wutian Fozu?"</p><p></p><p>How did another Buddha appear? They saw that the quasi-Buddha's expression became particularly devout, with a hint of fear in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"When Wutian Fozu appeared, the sun and moon lost their light, heaven and earth shook, the Buddhist realm trembled. Even I saw blood flowing from the eyes of Buddha statues. It was truly..."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Wuguang Fozi was shaken to his core. </p><p></p><p>Zilian Funü was also extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was a Buddha?</p><p></p><p>This seemed more like a calamity! Hearing this, Ling Yayi also felt somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>How did Blood Lord come to know this powerful figure, who could render the Buddhist realm speechless?</p><p></p><p>"Later, Taishang Fo introduced several more Buddhas, namely Fighting Buddha, Past Buddha, Present Buddha, and Buddha of Ten Thousand Buddhas!" The quasi-Buddha put his palms together.</p><p></p><p>As for the memories of Future Buddha, they had long been erased by Taihang True Buddha.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even those ordinary true Buddhas had voluntarily erased their memories related to Future Buddha.</p><p></p><p>After all... Future Buddha was of great significance.</p><p></p><p>"These Buddhas caused the supreme Infinite Mantra at the peak of the Buddhist realm to flicker. The Buddhist realm even fell from the Fifth Heaven into Taishang Fo's hands, and was ultimately given to Wutian Fozu by Taishang Fo." The quasi-Buddha sighed, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>The scene from back then was still vivid in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Yayi took a deep breath. </p><p></p><p>This was just the right flavor, just the right tone.</p><p></p><p>"What about my master Taishang Fo?" he asked, puffing out his chest.</p><p></p><p>His master was already Taishang Fo, so it shouldn't be a big deal for him to find a Buddha to be as well.</p><p></p><p>"He..." The quasi-Buddha pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly tell this Buddha!" Ling Yayi said.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present looked at Ling Yayi, including the remaining Thirteen Northern Demon Fiends, all feeling that... this person's face was a bit thick.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Door of Ten Thousand Differences, long time no see."</p><p></p><p>At the ends of the earth, Qi Yuan wore a blood-red robe, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Buddhist Assembly ended, his Stellar Golden Core had sensed the aura of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Now, he came alone to the ends of the earth, standing outside the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ten Thousand Differences stood at the ends of the earth, yet seemed to be in the void, ethereal and illusory.</p><p></p><p>[Door of Ten Thousand Differences, Door of Ten Thousand Doors.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Door of Ten Thousand Differences, Qi Yuan's divine sense swept over it briefly, a smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's still more enjoyable to go treasure hunting without fighting or competing."</p><p></p><p>In the Canglan Realm, whenever some secret realm opened or some treasure appeared, it would generally attract a bunch of people to fight over it.</p><p></p><p>Fighting with other cultivators, even if you won, you'd still feel somewhat insecure before actually obtaining the treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Liufeng Realm was different.</p><p></p><p>There was only Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>No other living beings were present at these ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Door of Ten Thousand Differences, do you still remember... the Netherworld?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan spoke, asking tentatively.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering how to claim the Door of Ten Thousand Differences for himself.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Ten Thousand Differences was the door of ten thousand doors - it could be any door.</p><p></p><p>For demon women, it was the door of ten thousand demons; for great demons, it was the door of ten thousand demons; for the Supreme Principle Celestial Venerable, it was the door of supreme principles.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was attempting to awaken the memories of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his words had no effect on the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, you're the door of my Netherworld home, do you remember?</p><p></p><p>Once, a thief came to our home, you scared him away, and I had such a hard time finding you!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Door of Ten Thousand Differences, his expression showing pain, as if what he was saying was true.</p><p></p><p>However, his acting skills were truly poor, and failed to move the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's form drew close to the Door of Ten Thousand Differences, his hand grasping that illusory door frame.</p><p></p><p>"Look, this is the key, this is the proof."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out the Key of Ten Thousand Differences and waved it in front of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Then, Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because he had grabbed hold of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences... and even walked away with it.</p><p></p><p>He was just trying it out, not expecting to actually grab hold of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Door of Supreme Principles said to be the number one magical treasure of the immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, countless Supreme Principle Realm and Great Supreme Principle Realm powerhouses had tried to take it for themselves, all ending in failure.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Supreme Principles was also known as the most difficult magical treasure to obtain in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But... was this it? So easy?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Door of Ten Thousand Differences, his emotions rising and falling dramatically.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a high and mighty, aloof man turned out to be a simple man who could be obtained with just a wave of the hand.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Qi Yuan still held tightly onto the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that it really is the door of my home?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it because I have the Key of Ten Thousand Differences that I can grab hold of it?"</p><p></p><p>His left eyebrow was twitching, indicating he was really profiting.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was still puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, from now on the Door of Ten Thousand Differences is the door of the Netherworld!"</p><p></p><p>Not taking advantage of a good deal would make one a bastard! Turn the Door of Ten Thousand Differences into the door of the Netherworld, make it a fait accompli.</p><p></p><p>This was the principle Jiang Lingsu's father had taught Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if the father of the Door of Ten Thousand Differences came, he'd have to acknowledge this was the door of the Netherworld! As he spoke, Qi Yuan's form stepped into the Door of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the Door of Ten Thousand Differences again, the scene Qi Yuan saw was different from before.</p><p></p><p>At first upon entering, there were endless demonic evils inside.</p><p></p><p>Within that, there was endless chaos.</p><p></p><p>"There's quite a lot of land inside the Door of Ten Thousand Differences." Qi Yuan thought for a moment, "Why don't I move in Wugui City, Nine Coiled Mountain, as well as Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, Five Elements Forbidden Land...?"</p><p></p><p>The current Qi Yuan didn't own any land.</p><p></p><p>But these places he mentioned were all the most familiar to him.</p><p></p><p>They had a... de facto relationship.</p><p></p><p>Just like how cohabitation is essentially a de facto marriage.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Wugui City and Nine Coiled Mountain were his.</p><p></p><p>Then move in the four forbidden lands and one desolate land of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>That should be enough soil for the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>If it still wasn't enough?</p><p></p><p>Then he'd wait and see if he could encounter some kind-hearted platonic loves who would take pity on him, the homeless little pitiful Qi Yuan wandering outside, and give him a plot of land.</p><p></p><p>No sooner said than done. At this moment, Qi Yuan's form became sacred and solemn.</p><p></p><p>The pitiful little one transformed into a majestic Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>A vast and stern voice also resounded through the heavens at this moment!</p><p></p><p>"East Peak Mount Tai Tianqi Benevolent Sage Great Emperor, heed my command: Go to the center of the world and move Wugui City, do not harm the common people!"</p><p></p><p>"South Peak Mount Heng Sitian Illuminating Sage Great Emperor, heed my command: Gather the waters of the ends of the earth and transform them into the River of Forgetfulness, do not harm the sea clans!"</p><p></p><p>"Central Peak Mount Song Zhongtian Revering Sage Great Emperor, heed my command: Move Nine Coiled Mountain, do not harm plants and trees."</p><p></p><p>"West Peak Mount Hua Jintian Willing Sage Great Emperor, heed my command: Go to the Wangyue Continent and move Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, Yiguan Forbidden Land, Five Elements Forbidden Land, and Yin-Yang Forbidden Land, do not harm spiritual beings."</p><p></p><p>"North Peak Mount Heng Antian Profound Sage Great Emperor, heed my command: Go to the Wangyue Continent, gather Heaven's End, collect the ruins of Earth's End, do not harm living beings."</p><p></p><p>As the voice fell, five majestic figures like deities appeared at the ends of the earth. They faced that sacred and solemn Blood-Robed Celestial Venerable...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They bowed with cupped hands.</p><p></p><p>"East Peak receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>"South Peak receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"North Peak receives the order!"</p><p></p><p>The Five Peaks Emperors received their orders. Their bodies were tall and mighty, reaching from earth to sky, as they departed in different directions.</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the Flowing Wind Realm, some people saw a majestic deity riding a five-colored divine ox, accompanied by the divine bird Golden-eyed Divine Oriole. He arrived at the center of the world, holding up the City of No Return in his hand, covering a hundred li with each step.</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the Flowing Wind Realm, others saw a giant spirit sitting on a Fire-eyed Golden-pupiled Beast, swallowing the ends of the earth and sea like a whale, as if the sea water was flowing backwards, with an unknown but vast quantity.</p><p></p><p>The West Peak Emperor and North Peak Emperor also returned to Cang Lan, going to Wangyue, carrying the Four Prohibitions and One Absolute.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood beyond the ends of the earth and sea. He seemed to think of something and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"South Pole Longevity Great Emperor, hear my order: Return to the Mortal Heart Realm, carry the ancestral land of the ancient clan, and do not reveal your traces."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, Old Thunder God appeared. He wore a purple wide-sleeved Taoist robe with lightning flashing on it, a vermilion lower garment with auspicious cloud patterns, and a crown on his head, looking unspeakably noble.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder God receives the order." Compared to other subjects, Thunder God was much more lively. "My lord, you need to give me the coordinates of the Mortal Heart Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush, it's coming soon," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Mortal Heart Realm was different from other worlds, as it was a primordial world.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan hadn't stayed there before, even the starry projections reflecting all heavens wouldn't have discovered this world.</p><p></p><p>Because this world was rather special and couldn't be easily exposed, Qi Yuan sent Old Thunder God to move the ancestral land of the ancient clan there.</p><p></p><p>"I've given you the coordinates. Don't expose your location, otherwise, if you're targeted by other Yang Gods, I won't be able to help you," Qi Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>His reach was long, but he couldn't wander freely in the lower realms.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered he had to deal with the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Now, less trouble was better than more.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I understand," Old Thunder God patted his chest. After receiving the coordinates, he transformed into a streak of purple qi and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At the ends of the earth and sea, only Qi Yuan remained.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that even the stars reflecting all heavens can't discover Arch Star.</p><p></p><p>Sigh, I don't know if I turned off the lights in my room before I left. If they've been on all this time, how much would the electricity bill be?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a bit distressed about the electricity bill.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also felt that wasting electricity was shameful.</p><p></p><p>He had always been frugal.</p><p></p><p>"One day, I will attain the Daluo Realm, become the supreme Dao Ancestor, return to Arch Star, and turn off the lights!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan made a great vow! In the following time, Qi Yuan met Nangong Dagou, the Foolish Daoist, and Baize.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Dagou was very smug, calling himself Little Buddha Ling Yi.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Buddhist country could do nothing about Ling Yayi.</p><p></p><p>After all, his master was the Blood Lord, that Supreme Buddha.</p><p></p><p>It seemed not wrong for his disciple to be called Little Buddha.</p><p></p><p>At this moment in the upper realm, countless eyes were fixed on the Buddhist country.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist holy land suddenly blocked the upper realm's observation of the Great Buddhist Assembly, and the Treasure of Creation Buddhist Country was shaking.</p><p></p><p>Many forces at the holy land level were very curious about what changes had occurred in the Buddhist country.</p><p></p><p>Then, the ninety-seven true Buddhas of the Buddhist holy land jointly announced:</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist holy land was unified, and the Buddha had returned, now being the present Buddha Shakyamuni.</p><p></p><p>As for the past Buddha, Victorious Fighting Buddha, Wutian Buddha, and Buddha of Ten Thousand Buddhas, they had hidden their identities and concealed themselves within the Buddhist country.</p><p></p><p>This news shook the Sixth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of Buddha was clearest to these holy lands.</p><p></p><p>It represented that in the Buddhist holy land, a powerful true Buddha had emerged who could comprehend the Great Ultimate Principle and control the Treasure of Creation Buddhist Country.</p><p></p><p>Once this true Buddha grew up and entered the realm of the Great Ultimate Principle, he might be able to lead the Buddhist holy land to ascend from the Fifth Heaven to the Sixth Heaven! The Buddhist holy land could leap from a second-rate holy land to a first-rate one.</p><p></p><p>The long-cherished wish that the Great Sun Bright Buddha had not realized before also had a chance to be fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>And... the probability was even greater.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ultimate Principle of the Great Sun Bright Buddha was the Great Sun Tathagata, which conflicted with the position of the Great Sun, so he finally entered nirvana.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite True Words of the present Buddha were for the present, and there was no conflict with the position. Without special changes, other holy lands predicted that after a million years, the Buddhist country would add a Great Ultimate Principle.</p><p></p><p>However, next, this present Buddha of the Buddhist country suddenly announced that he would go to war with the Mara clan.</p><p></p><p>This Buddha declared: "I have cultivated the past and present, and can glimpse the future. The Mara clan obstructs the foundation of my future, they must be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>This statement shocked the world, and the immortal realm was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha's words showed he was determined to declare war on the Mara clan.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this Buddha had just taken his position and didn't seem to even be at the Ultimate Principle level, yet the other true Buddhas didn't stop him? Many Heavenly Venerable Lords discussed in whispers.</p><p></p><p>"The nirvana of the Great Sun Bright Buddha must be related to the Tai Huang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist holy land has been holding back anger, unable to challenge the Tai Huang Palace, so they're... taking it out on the Mara clan!"</p><p></p><p>"The Mara clan's strength is only slightly lower than the Buddhist country, but they're the dogs that bark the loudest under the Tai Huang Palace. This result is normal!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Fifth and Sixth Heavens won't be peaceful!"</p><p></p><p>"Once the Buddha attains the Great Ultimate Principle, I'm afraid... there will be great chaos."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the Tai Huang Palace won't stand by and watch the Buddha ascend!"</p><p></p><p>"The Moon God Palace should be the biggest winner in this matter, and the war in the Demon Abyss might also slow down a bit."</p><p></p><p>"First the Ten Suns Heavenly Venerable Lord declared war on Tai Huang, now the Buddhist country declares war on Mara, this immortal realm... is going to be chaotic!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this present Buddha really glimpsed the future?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible, it's just a randomly made-up reason.</p><p>How is this any different from the Mara Heavenly Venerable Lord declaring war because he stole a chicken from the Buddhist country?"</p><p></p><p>The upper realm was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Mara Heavenly Venerable Lord also responded domineeringly and fiercely: "This Heavenly Venerable Lord will not only obstruct your future, but also cut off your present life!"</p><p></p><p>Although it sounded domineering, someone had seen the Mara Heavenly Venerable Lord enter the Tai Huang Palace in the Sixth Heaven that night, looking anxious.</p><p></p><p>In terms of power, the Buddhist country was much stronger than the Mara clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Buddhist country had once had one foot in the Sixth Heaven, almost becoming a holy land of the Sixth Heaven!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter held the Brush of Mountains, Rivers and Land, her body trembling.</p><p></p><p>The five massive, vast, deity-like beings before her gave her a huge shock.</p><p></p><p>She was already an alternative myth, but in front of these five, she felt as small as dust, just like when facing Qi Qi.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, these mysterious powerful beings behaved like servants to a master in front of the Blood-robed Sword God.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we've found the land, and the gate of the underworld is here too. Strange Painter, I leave it to you, paint it well for me!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, the Five Peaks Emperors threw the cities, mountains and rivers they were holding, the Four Prohibitions and One Absolute, and the seawater in their mouths into the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>Old Thunder God also appeared just in time, throwing the ancestral land of the ancient clan from the primordial world into the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences.</p><p></p><p>The Strange Painter looked at the chaotic and messily placed soil and rivers.</p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"With the senior's trust, this painter is willing to use her life as paint to color this painting!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, the Brush of Mountains, Rivers and Land in her hand began to dance at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The world within the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences began to change at this moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

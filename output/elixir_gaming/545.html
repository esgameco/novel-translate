        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Danger outside?" Hearing this, Qi Yuan became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"In that case... I must go out."</p><p></p><p>Since Shen Lingxuan encountered danger, Qi Yuan naturally had to step in.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had finally encountered Shen Lingxuan, and he couldn't let her disappear this time.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had to emulate some dragon king's son-in-law, where the wife gets captured and abused, triggering a small universe, and in the final step, rescuing the wife?</p><p></p><p>This type of son-in-law was not Qi Yuan's style.</p><p></p><p>"Don't... come out." Shen Lingxuan's cold face was filled with anxiety, the violent airflow blowing past her black dress, tightly clinging to her graceful figure and outlining the rounded jade-like curves of her long legs, like a black swan in disarray in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Her figure was tall and slender, and the most eye-catching part was her pair of long, straight, and shapely legs.</p><p></p><p>The sword that slashed through the protective airflow of the Divine Wood Abyss was too fierce, and even the aftershock made the Sky-level Armament Wielder unsteady, as if she was about to be blown away by the airflow.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying power was completely beyond her level.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan came out, he would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>She did not want Qi Yuan to die because of her.</p><p></p><p>"Husband and wife are birds of the same forest, when facing great calamity, they each fly their own way. Alas, I am not a bird, I am a son-in-law." Qi Yuan said, "I am your husband, how can I abandon you?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan quickly got into the role.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also part of his true feelings.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Shen Lingxuan was touched in her heart. She didn't expect Qi Yuan to come out from the safe Divine Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the heavens and earth seemed to be shattered, the figure of Feng Tiao stood in the void, his long sword standing across the sky, emanating an aura that made the heavens and earth tremble.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tiao's gaze swept across Shen Lingxuan, a hint of killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had not moved yet, but his powerful aura swept over.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan suddenly felt a powerful shockwave approaching, and as a Sky-level Armament Wielder, she felt incredibly insignificant at the moment. Just a trace of his aura made her feel like a butterfly with broken wings, being blown away.</p><p></p><p>Blood seeped from the corner of her mouth, and her body was violently thrown towards the distant mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an arm wrapped around her waist, catching her, and a gentle voice said, "Don't be afraid, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>"Qi... Qi Yuan?" Shen Lingxuan's cold, pale face had a complex expression, joyful yet worried, like a black rose.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the TV lied, I thought that if I hugged you like this, I would be spinning in the sky, and then... accidentally kiss you." Qi Yuan's thoughts were very calm as he spoke his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan, being held by Qi Yuan, pursed her wet lips, a strange emotion stirring in her heart, but she quickly said, "Be careful, the people of the Light Brilliance."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Feng Tiao hovering in the sky had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the two Heavenly Mandate Bearers have gathered here, it seems I've saved time."</p><p></p><p>He sat high in the sky, like a deity.</p><p></p><p>The long sword in his hand let out a sword cry, ready to strike at any moment and tear the sky apart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held Shen Lingxuan and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>What he saw was a blur.</p><p></p><p>According to the behavior guidelines of a son-in-law, what should he say now? If you dare to break her wings, I must destroy your heavenly paradise? The dragon's reverse scale, touch it and you die? No, that's too strong.</p><p></p><p>"You are quite strong." Qi Yuan made an evaluation.</p><p></p><p>The other party was indeed stronger than the ordinary Great Venerable he had seen in the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"But with me here, I won't allow you to act recklessly and disorderly!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said, gently placing Shen Lingxuan on the ground and standing in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan looked at this upright back, the complex emotions in her heart, as well as her past imaginings, all turning into affection.</p><p></p><p>She remembered when he wielded the Rain Sword and slew the thieves with a single sword strike. Back then, she only felt he was dangerous, but now she felt he was heroic.</p><p></p><p>"A blind man dares to evaluate this Venerable? You are not qualified!" Feng Tiao's eyes held a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>Insects dare not evaluate the eagles.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's heart suddenly ached: "Your eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, she had noticed the strangeness in Qi Yuan's eyes, but out of shyness, she did not dare to make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>What happened to him... that he went blind? Shen Lingxuan stood up, a determined expression on her cold, pale face: "I will face him together with you."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shrugged: "To deal with him... you don't need to get involved."</p><p></p><p>After all, Shen Lingxuan's current strength would not be enough to intervene in this battle.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't just say, "You're too weak, Shen Lingxuan."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you overestimate yourselves." Feng Tiao's eyes flashed with disdain.</p><p></p><p>He made no move, but the suspended flying sword in the sky suddenly unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>Extreme Light Sword!</p><p></p><p>The flying sword moved at an extremely fast speed, leaving only a blur.</p><p></p><p>This flying sword was a sword strike that Feng Tiao had mastered by comprehending the Extreme Point Principle.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Point represents the pinnacle of the Principle of the Dao. It symbolizes the fusion of all things into a single point, representing the strongest attack in the world.</p><p></p><p>In this sword strike, there was no distance in space, and all defenses were powerless against it.</p><p></p><p>It could pierce through the void and even penetrate the Dark Void.</p><p></p><p>This Principle of the Dao was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if Feng Tiao were to step into the Third Layer of the Yang God Realm and condense nine Principles of the Dao, he could create a new world on the foundation of the Extreme Point.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that by comprehending the Principle of the Dao, he was qualified to contend for the Third Layer of the Yang God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was his original form, and he was merely a copy, not the real thing.</p><p></p><p>In this sword strike, Qi Yuan could sense the embryonic form of the Supreme Principle.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>This opponent indeed had some skills.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword strike, with lightning-fast speed, thrust towards Qi Yuan's temple, concentrated at a single point, representing the ultimate in ruthless penetration.</p><p></p><p>This attack, Qi Yuan could not avoid.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, ordinary Great Venerables would not be able to block it.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"So even the Divine-level can comprehend the embryonic form of the Principle?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>"No, my Purple Palace can comprehend the Supreme Principle, why can't I comprehend it in the game... even if I'm just at the Divine-level?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Tiao's sword strike had opened up Qi Yuan's thinking.</p><p></p><p>Since he was at the Divine-level, he should also be able to comprehend the embryonic form of the Supreme Principle... right? If this Feng Tiao could do it, he should be able to do it as well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's mind was enlightened.</p><p></p><p>"Absolute Adaptation!"</p><p></p><p>A multitude of thoughts swept over him, and Qi Yuan's figure underwent a transformation at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The powerful Extreme Light Sword strike went in, but he had suddenly become a void.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Feng Tiao's eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Against this native of the world, almost no one could withstand his sword strike.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Radiant Universe was a universe where a Dao Master existed.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation system had already reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>At the Great Venerable Realm, they could cultivate the Divine Domain and condense the Principles of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that in some ordinary universes, one might have to reach the Second Layer of the Yang God Realm to truly contact the Principles of the Universe.</p><p></p><p>Yet his sword strike had been blocked.</p><p></p><p>He looked at this opponent seriously for the first time.</p><p></p><p>He did not hesitate, grabbing the sword hilt, flashing in movement, and reappearing in the Divine Wood Abyss, unleashing a powerful sword strike towards the void.</p><p></p><p>Clang! A blood-armored hand reached out from the void, grasping the sword.</p><p></p><p>The towering Armored Celestial appeared, the blood-red demonic sword thrusting forward.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tiao's eyes showed surprise, the patterns on his forehead flickering, the blood-red demonic aura: "You are strange, to have comprehended the Principle of the Dao before even stepping into the Third Layer of the Heavenly Ascension. What level of Principle of the Dao have you comprehended, that I have not heard of?"</p><p></p><p>This collision between the two was a clash of raw power, without any techniques involved.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tiao had some admiration.</p><p></p><p>The opponent had not even comprehended the Principle of the Dao before, but after seeing his Extreme Light Sword strike, he seemed to have suddenly gained enlightenment and comprehended the Principle of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, this was terrifying, enough to make Feng Tiao take notice.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan did not speak, as he was now fully immersed in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tiao's strength was formidable, the gap between Great Venerable and Venerable was vast.</p><p></p><p>If this were in the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm, he might have already been defeated.</p><p></p><p>But this was the nascent Divine Wood Universe, where the gap between Great Venerable and Venerable was not so obvious.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Insect Maiden Cai Die looked at the battle in the sky, her face horrified: "The two are too fast, this kind of battle, ordinary Great Venerables cannot interfere!"</p><p></p><p>She knew Feng Tiao was strong, but she didn't expect Shen Lingxuan's husband to be able to contend with him.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Sunset Cliff, the Immortal Genius narrowed his eyes: "Qi Yuan actually managed to block Feng Tiao!"</p><p></p><p>This was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>After all, Feng Tiao's original form, if he were to come to Zhou's Universe, would be qualified to become a recorded disciple of the Void Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuyun's eyes widened: "I can't even see clearly."</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang Bao was still eating his bun, his expression lazy: "No need to watch, the young master will definitely win."</p><p></p><p>He had blind confidence in Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Genius had a worried expression on his face: "Since Qi Yuan has shocked the world and can pressure Feng Tiao, it seems... he may also be difficult to defeat."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"...because..."</p><p></p><p>He knew Feng Tai's fear.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Guangyao Society were not even considered human.</p><p></p><p>His words had just fallen.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the Shenmu Abyss, Feng Tai's eyes revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You are a worthy opponent, worthy of me exchanging my life for yours!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's strength was far inferior to him, but the other party's heart of rules was too bizarre, like an unkillable cockroach.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he no longer held back.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth have the same longevity!</p><p></p><p>He unleashed the most powerful strike, tightly embracing Qi Yuan, as if a burning sun exploded.</p><p></p><p>He exchanged his life for Qi Yuan's! Such a terrifying strike was enough to injure the mythical Treading Heaven Seven Steps.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the elegant Xianling had a complex gaze: "The clone of the Guangyao Society, not just one life, exchanging life for life, is difficult for a peer opponent to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Boom! A terrifying explosion sound rang out, and the heat wave swept the Insect Maiden away.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan's mouth corner oozed fresh blood, and her snow-white face was full of worry.</p><p></p><p>Even the aftershock alone injured her, what kind of oppression was Qi Yuan facing in the center of the battle.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Guangyao Society have many lives, he exchanges life for life... it's impossible to defeat!" The Insect Maiden Caiye said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingxuan looked at the center of the battlefield, only to see the explosion extinguished, and another figure of Feng Tai condensed, his body intact.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the void, his eyes shining, looking at the center of the battlefield just now.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the explosion, the blood-colored armor disappeared, and a figure in a blood-stained robe still stood, holding a blood-red long sword that was eerie and boundless.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you fought me to a stalemate, but one life can't be exchanged for your life, but you are now seriously injured, how can you fight me at my peak?" </p><p></p><p>Feng Tai said, holding the long sword and disappearing, flashing behind Qi Yuan, the long sword stabbing sharply.</p><p></p><p>Clang! This sword was still blocked by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His arms were bleeding profusely.</p><p></p><p>Blocking this sword, more blood oozed out.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was very calm.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I don't die, I am invincible."</p><p></p><p>He was very confident.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that Death Radiance and Absolute Adaptation, when combined, could have a miraculous reaction.</p><p></p><p>One was the supreme truth, and the other was just a great skill he had mastered in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The two could actually be fused.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation kept him in a near-death state, and Death Radiance made his combat power reach its peak.</p><p></p><p>The more he bled, the stronger he became.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's blood flowed, but he just wouldn't die.</p><p></p><p>A casual sword strike, empowered by Death Radiance, slashed open a huge gash on Feng Tai's chest, and blood gushed out.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tai's face showed an incredulous expression, and he stubbornly said, "It's just the last gasp of a withered bow."</p><p></p><p>In the void, he transformed into countless, all attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he could revive after death, each life was precious to him and required a huge cost to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was not truly endless.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tai's expression, from the previous calm and composed, changed to anxious and distracted.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little bit, just a little bit!"</p><p></p><p>He felt that Qi Yuan was like a flickering old man in the wind, his life force about to be extinguished at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But that little bit, he couldn't reap.</p><p></p><p>It's like in a game, the opponent's health bar is already black, and he could easily finish them off with a skill or even a basic attack, but he just couldn't land the hit.</p><p></p><p>Anxious.</p><p></p><p>"You're not just a little bit away, you're still far away!" Qi Yuan quoted Echizen Ryoma's lines, swinging the long sword in his hand, like a battle-scarred god, not reckless when bleeding.</p><p></p><p>Death Radiance and Absolute Adaptation, at this moment, burst forth with a dazzling strike.</p><p></p><p>Another life of Feng Tai perished.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the intact Feng Tai appeared again, his face filled with an annoyed expression: "I wonder how long you can hold out?"</p><p></p><p>Now he changed his strategy, turning attack into defense, trying to exhaust Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe that the man in front of him, in such an intense battle, wouldn't make any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, Qi Yuan's robe stained with blood, holding a blood-red and eerie long sword, his injuries numerous, but he still stood firm.</p><p></p><p>As for Feng Tai, he had long lost the arrogance and confidence of the past.</p><p></p><p>Under the Shenmu Abyss, Shen Lingxuan saw this scene, her heart moved, and she felt deep pity and tenderness.</p><p></p><p>With such injuries, anyone else... would have already fallen.</p><p></p><p>But her husband Qi Yuan still stood, like a giant supporting the sky.</p><p></p><p>The wind was roaring, the mountains and rivers were trembling, and the blood was like rainwater.</p><p></p><p>The sound of slaughter and battle continued.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had never fought such a bloody battle.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was in a mysterious state.</p><p></p><p>Death Radiance and Absolute Adaptation were constantly fusing.</p><p></p><p>His aura became more and more gloomy, but his combat power became stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>When the fusion was complete, Qi Yuan felt that unexpected things would happen to him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... I'm still not bleeding enough."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan had some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he drew his sword and, to everyone's surprise, stabbed himself fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The attacking Feng Tai, seeing this, had a moved expression: "What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>However, his attacks fell furiously, as he sensed that the current Qi Yuan was the weakest.</p><p></p><p>This was a good opportunity that couldn't be missed.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party had a scheme, he was not afraid, as he still had five lives.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dim eyes of Qi Yuan burst forth with dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>An extremely bright sword strike slashed out.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tai's eyes revealed a horrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"How... is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he seemed to have discovered something, his expression terrified for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying sword strike could not be wielded by a mere Deity Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>A similar sword strike, his original form Feng Tai had once seen a Third-Layer Celestial Immortal unleash.</p><p></p><p>This was... the fusion of cosmic rules! One sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tai's form shattered.</p><p></p><p>His form appeared again.</p><p></p><p>The sword strike just now appeared out of thin air, slaying him.</p><p></p><p>He revived, only to be slain again.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Feng Tai was utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike transcended the cosmic rules, as if it was directly targeting his life.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many lives he had, this sword strike would slay as many as he had.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Feng Tai's last life was shattered, and all his memories turned into fragments.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the headquarters of the Guangyao Society, in the light pool, a human form suddenly condensed, it was a puzzled Feng Tai.</p><p></p><p>"I carried nine lives, yet I died? What happened?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought arose, he suddenly felt his hair stand on end, sensing endless threats.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the distant void, a terrifying sword strike slashing out.</p><p></p><p>Facing this sword strike, Feng Tai's expression was horrified, feeling endless threats.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a beam of light flashed in the light pool, and that sword strike was slashed in the light, disappearing in the end.</p><p></p><p>Feng Tai was still shaken: "It actually forced the Realm Lord's left-behind means to counterattack... Could it be that I encountered a Realm Lord? Impossible, the Shenmu Universe doesn't have a Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, all nine lives were lost, and he didn't know what had happened in the Shenmu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Shenmu Abyss, the blood-stained Qi Yuan's aura rapidly rose and then plummeted.</p><p></p><p>"I caught a glimpse of the path to the Third-Layer Celestial Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>Blood oozed from the corners of his mouth, and his injuries were extremely severe, on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>When he fought Feng Tai, he was only an ordinary Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Rashly emulating Feng Tai's enlightenment of the Dao Essence, fusing with Death Radiance, was an ultimate consumption for him.</p><p></p><p>Even the Venerable Feng Tai didn't dare to constantly use the Extreme Light Flying Sword.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, when the role of the Vegetable Knife reached 100% completion, the gift Qi Yuan finally obtained, the Vegetable Knife handle, constantly filled him with endless life energy, otherwise, he might have exhausted himself to death.</p><p></p><p>"Although the injuries are very serious, I have gained a lot, not only the initial enlightenment of Absolute Adaptation, but in the end, I also fused with Death Radiance."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the path to the Third-Layer Celestial Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I am the kind of genius who breaks through in battle!"</p><p></p><p>In this battle, Qi Yuan challenged beyond his level, broke through his limits, and gained many insights.</p><p></p><p>This was very similar to the true prodigies, who break through themselves in battle.</p><p></p><p>"The more I fight, the more fierce I become!"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, I must fight often!"</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, I'll go find an ant to duel!"</p><p></p><p>Such thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's mind, and overwhelming fatigue swept over him. The body that had been standing upright finally collapsed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Take a nap for half an hour, and when I have the strength, I'll go duel the ant."</p><p></p><p>His body fell from the sky, and before it hit the ground, he fell into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>"My husband..." A graceful figure suddenly rushed over, tightly embracing him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was still no falling and then kissing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Qi Yuan would have immediately woken up.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

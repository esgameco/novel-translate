        <h1>Chapter 226</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gods on the scene were shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Even if Fire Lotus Elder had deceived them, her cultivation level could not lie. </p><p></p><p>From Step 2 to Step 5 of Treading the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Between these, there were a full three steps, enough to take a True God over ten thousand years to refine.</p><p></p><p>And after the great changes in heaven and earth, advancement became even more difficult, especially from Elder to Great Venerable realm. Not everyone had the opportunity to condense a divine domain.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, Fire Lotus Elder's earth-shattering transformation was truly astonishing. </p><p></p><p>If it was only Fire Lotus who had undergone such a terrifying change, they could still think it was because Origin Venerable was infatuated with her beauty. But Dusk was the same, so it couldn't be explained by lust alone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liuyun's breathing quickened. </p><p></p><p>The Divine Observation Method! Only that could explain such a sudden surge in power.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Liuyun thought of the several powerful dragon clan members Qi Yuan had mentioned, and his body trembled involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>If it was all true...and he had obtained it, what an incredible opportunity that would be? He regretted in his heart that he should have followed Qi Yuan to Qingshui Village right after the Hundred Flowers Festival ended.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was already a subject now. If he had gone then, perhaps he would be a Great Venerable by now.</p><p></p><p>He was filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods on the scene also had various thoughts arise in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"A great battle will begin tonight. To prevent news from leaking, everyone present will rest here for a day," Fire Lotus Great Venerable's voice was as gentle as ever, her black hair falling softly, framing her face.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't one day too short? Why not wait until the battle is almost over?" Yuan Kun said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"We have no complaints. Staying here for a few more days is fine."</p><p></p><p>"Origin Venerable's plan takes priority!"</p><p></p><p>These people quickly got into character, thinking for Qi Yuan's sake.</p><p></p><p>Dusk Great Venerable and Fire Lotus Great Venerable didn't explain further. After giving a few instructions, their figures vanished.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night slowly fell.</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, several terrifying figures gathered.</p><p></p><p>Below Qi Yuan stood a group of ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>These ancient gods were now all Great Venerables, with formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>At this moment they gathered together to discuss the imminent invasion of Qingheng Continent.</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Great Venerable was in high spirits, his gaze like torches: "Qingheng Continent has two Mythical realm experts - the Commander of the Liyang Army and the Vice Commander of the Taizhong Army. Leave those two to me, I can subdue them single-handedly!"</p><p></p><p>The elder twin sister was usually reserved, but now she also revealed her sharp edge: "Although we Nine Luminaries are only at Step 5 of Treading the Heavens, our divine domains can overlap and combine. United together, we can fight Mythical realm experts."</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Zang Hui stood among the crowd, secretly glancing at Divine Thunder Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now, with eight ancient gods watching out for each other, he had grown bolder and was no longer so afraid of Divine Thunder Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm only at Step 6 of Treading the Heavens, I can still hold off a Mythical realm expert for a while," said a low-key little old man. He had contemplated the Southern Xuanzhen Wanfu Venerable, one of the Ten Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded. Among the many ancient gods present, when joined forces, there were a full three with Mythical realm combat power.</p><p></p><p>And this was just temporary. Given time, Qi Yuan felt that in a hundred or thousand years, there would probably be twenty or thirty with Mythical realm combat power.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan couldn't wait that long.</p><p></p><p>"Our current strength is still far inferior to the Evil Gods, but compared to the Liyang Army Commander, we are much stronger!" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came: "Venerable, Great Venerable Lishan has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan had actually come from the southern lands to the north?</p><p></p><p>"Let him in," Qi Yuan ordered.</p><p></p><p>The ancient gods present were in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Great Venerable continued: "Now is the best time to start the war! I think we should attack the Evil Gods' headquarters in Qingheng Continent now and make rivers of blood flow!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Thunder Great Venerable, is this how steady you are? Didn't you promise me you wouldn't be reckless?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a grumbling voice came.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Great Venerable Lishan entered. He looked at Divine Thunder Great Venerable with a gaze that could kill if looks could kill.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Divine Thunder Great Venerable had always complained to him that he himself wasn't reckless, but that Origin Venerable was.</p><p></p><p>At the time he had believed Divine Thunder Great Venerable's words and thought of Origin Venerable as a reckless person.</p><p></p><p>But what did he hear as soon as he arrived? Attack the Evil Gods' headquarters in Qingheng Continent? Make rivers of blood flow? This Divine Thunder Great Venerable was clearly deceiving him. Divine Thunder Great Venerable must have always been reckless, and even encouraged Origin Venerable to be so.</p><p></p><p>He had misunderstood Origin Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan glared angrily at Divine Thunder Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Great Venerable looked at Great Venerable Lishan, a smile appearing on his face: "Lishan, I'm not being reckless at all. I'm very steady. I'm only planning to take on the two Mythical realm experts of Qingheng Continent myself. The rest of the small fry will be left to the other ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>In the past, I would have killed them all by myself.</p><p></p><p>Am I not mature and steady now?"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't react immediately to Divine Thunder Great Venerable's words.</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Great Venerable smiled faintly: "Lishan, open your eyes and look at me now...what cultivation realm am I at?"</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunder Great Venerable's divine domain suddenly expanded at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, endless lightning filled the air.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying divine domain seemed to turn the world into a sea of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan's white hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan's eyes widened, his voice trembling: "Mythical realm, how did you reach the Mythical realm!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand, couldn't imagine it.</p><p></p><p>How long had it been since they last met, and his good brother had already reached the Mythical realm? This feeling was like if you and your good brother were the richest and second richest in the village.</p><p></p><p>After not seeing each other for a few days, your good brother became the richest in the whole country.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan's heart was now not just shocked, but bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"With my Mythical realm strength, subduing two mere Mythical realm experts, am I not mature and steady?" Divine Thunder Great Venerable said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The divine domain before his eyes was so real, it couldn't be fake.</p><p></p><p>"In another half hour, we will attack the Evil Gods' headquarters in Qingheng Continent.</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan, your strength is still decent. Why don't you help me play the suona?" Divine Thunder Great Venerable said smugly.</p><p></p><p>He recalled how Qi Yuan had once let him control lightning and then kill enemies.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that was quite interesting too.</p><p></p><p>If Great Venerable Lishan played the suona behind him while he killed Mythical realm experts, his combat power would surely get a boost. It could be described as "The general's head treads on widespread snow, as thousands of horses and soldiers come to play music!"</p><p></p><p>Great Venerable Lishan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan, sitting on the high platform, spoke: "It seems everyone is full of confidence. In that case, all ancient gods, prepare to set out immediately and sweep across Qingheng Continent!"</p><p></p><p>The calm voice sounded like a thunderclap in Great Venerable Lishan's ears at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" Divine Thunder Great Venerable was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Since being injured, he had not properly fought again.</p><p></p><p>Last time he was about to ambush Zhang Feng, but was preempted by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was very much looking forward to this great battle.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" The elder twin sister's eyes also revealed a sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that the ancient gods, who had been retreating step by step and even abandoned the northern lands to migrate south, would today launch their first large-scale counterattack against the Evil Gods.</p><p></p><p>This time, whether they succeeded or not, it would shock the world.</p><p></p><p>Even the True Gods above in the Heavenly Pillar would probably know about it.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone present knew this.</p><p></p><p>However, none of those present showed any fear. </p><p></p><p>On the contrary, their hearts grew even more excited.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill! Kill them until the heavens collapse and the earth overturns!" Ancient God Wang Song shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>All the ancient gods present were filled with fighting spirit. The battle intent accumulated in their hearts was like a volcano that had not erupted for 100,000 years, seemingly ready to violently unleash.</p><p></p><p>For so many years, the evil gods had suppressed the northern lands, and all the ancient gods had suffered terribly.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the evil gods, the ancient gods could only struggle to survive. Almost none of them had thought about counterattacking.</p><p></p><p>But today, it seemed they were about to do it.</p><p></p><p>This counterattack would be large-scale and overwhelming!</p><p></p><p>Looking at this scene, Great Venerable Li Shan was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly sensed that these ancient gods, many of whom he was familiar with, were now emanating auras that were terrifyingly extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>He seemed to be infected by the scene before him, and he murmured: "Divine Thunder, if you can slay the evil god's myth, what harm is there in this old man playing music for you once?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Qingheng Continent, the evil gods' headquarters.</p><p></p><p>The Commander of the Liyang Army wore black clothes, with deep and profound eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Commander Taizhong stood beside the Liyang Commander, with a hint of reverence in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although both were myths, there was a big gap between them.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander was valued by the Yang God, and was given his own star that illuminated the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The volume of that star was not large. Compared to the blue planet where Qi Yuan used to be, it was only 1.5 times the size of that moon.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it was still a star that illuminated the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander had even slain a myth from the Mortal Heart Realm before. Compared to myths like him, they were not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>Vice Commander Taizhong lowered his head, as if he was the Liyang Commander's most devout servant, and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Commander, what did the Lord say?"</p><p></p><p>The sun had fallen, and Sunset Slope had become a bygone name.</p><p></p><p>All five army commanders were moved.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander had also gone to see the Lord, and had just returned.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander shook his head, his eyes complex: "The Lord is in closed-door cultivation, I did not see him."</p><p></p><p>The evil god that the Liyang Commander and others served was named Blood God Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>He was a Yang God, high above in the heavens, with countless divine soldiers and generals under his command.</p><p></p><p>He had over twenty subordinates who could illuminate the heavens alone.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Blood God Great Saint's daughter, Blood Yang Great Saint, was also a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>Father and daughter both being Yang Gods was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Yang Great Saint could completely devour the Heavenly Dao of the Mortal Heart Realm and refine it into a primordial seed,</p><p></p><p>Then Blood Yang Great Saint's strength would rise to another level, and her potential would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>The strength of subordinates like them would also rise accordingly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry," the Liyang Commander comforted, seemingly seeing the concern flashing in his deputy's eyes. "What happened before won't happen again.</p><p></p><p>The last time a star fell, the Lord didn't intervene because he couldn't be bothered. For the Princess, that attack was merely an itch, so rather than the Lord dealing with the trouble, it was better to let the Princess handle it herself.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that unknown Yang God would fight without honor and attack Sunset Slope.</p><p></p><p>Now the Lord must be paying attention, and such a thing won't happen again.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of a Yang God, there is no force in the Mortal Heart Realm that can threaten us.</p><p></p><p>Without even a single myth, how dare they provoke us?</p><p></p><p>When we receive word from the Lord, we will certainly rally our forces and sweep away all these demons and monsters!"</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander's eyes were full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the aid of a Yang God, all the enemies in the Mortal Heart Realm were nothing.</p><p></p><p>These people were just clay chickens and pottery dogs.</p><p></p><p>"The Commander is right. Without the aid of a Yang God, these people are just clowns," Vice Commander Taizhong's eyes flashed with contempt.</p><p></p><p>With just his power alone, he could almost turn the southern lands upside down.</p><p></p><p>The so-called foundation of the Mortal Heart Realm was nothing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, suddenly, a vast and boundless voice, like world-ending thunder, abruptly sounded in the air.</p><p></p><p>"I control life and death, growth and decay, good and evil, reward and punishment.</p><p></p><p>I command the Five Thunders and move the Three Realms with my heart.</p><p></p><p>Now I order the thunder of ten thousand kalpas to slay demons and exorcise evil, sweeping away all the wicked spirits in the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>With this mighty sound, above the entire evil gods' headquarters,</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds gathered, and thunder pressed down on the world.</p><p></p><p>A sea of thunder hung upside down, like a divine prison.</p><p></p><p>In the endless thunder, terrifying divine images appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Thunder Duke General, the Eight Directions Cloud Thunder General,</p><p></p><p>The Five Direction Thunder Kings, the Thirty-six Thunder Dukes, the Five Direction Barbarian Thunder Envoys, the Twenty-four Guardian Celestial Lords...</p><p></p><p>Countless Thunder Department divine soldiers and generals waved flags in support, wielding thunder in their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The thunder drums spread, and the word "Kill" swept out like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>In the evil gods' headquarters, all the evil gods' faces turned pale at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were suddenly surrounded by millions of true gods!</p><p></p><p>The evil gods' headquarters instantly fell into chaos.</p><p></p><p>A flash of shock appeared in the Liyang Commander's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A myth!</p><p></p><p>A divine realm!</p><p></p><p>How could there be a myth in this world! There was no time for him to think further. He hurriedly shouted: "This is a myth's divine realm, all the gods are illusory, not real!"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to dispel the fear in all his subordinates' hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, his shout did not disperse much of the true gods' fear.</p><p></p><p>Because even though they were just illusory images, they felt an insurmountable sense and overwhelming pressure sweeping over them.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't illusory, what would it be like? They couldn't even imagine!</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander's heart grew anxious.</p><p></p><p>Even he could smell a strong threat from the myth before him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that myth had directly opened his divine realm, completely enveloping the evil gods' headquarters.</p><p></p><p>He had to break open this divine realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander let out a great shout.</p><p></p><p>"My lord Blood God, lend me your divine light to sweep away all illusions!"</p><p></p><p>His divine realm also opened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, a star the size of a grain of rice suddenly shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>Within the entire Thunder Divine Realm, a blood-red light lit up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Commander's body was like a flood of blood light.</p><p></p><p>He stood beneath the thunder, with endless blood light below him.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with the invincible thunder, the blood light divine realm trembled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Vice Commander Taizhong also hurriedly opened his divine realm: "Commander, I will assist you!"</p><p></p><p>The two myths joined forces to face that terrifying enemy.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, Divine Thunder Great Venerable's purple eyes showed neither joy nor sorrow, with countless thunder reflections dancing within.</p><p></p><p>A mighty voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Above, illuminate the great way of heaven's heart; below, aid the suffering masses of the netherworld!"</p><p></p><p>"You who have given rise to delusional thoughts, shall be slain!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine thunder of the nine heavens, heed my command, kill!"</p><p></p><p>With this terrifying voice from Divine Thunder Great Venerable, the battle in the divine realm finally began.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, endless thunder transformed into divine generals and heavenly soldiers, falling from the sky and charging into the blood light.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

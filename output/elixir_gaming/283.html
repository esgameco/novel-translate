        <h1>Chapter 283</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Who knows what it might represent.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan didn't think about these things anymore, but sat down to think about something else.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Qi Yuan Scripture' can't be cultivated here anymore, I need to cultivate a simplified version."</p><p></p><p>In this game world, Qi Yuan was thinking about increasing his strength. </p><p></p><p>Currently there was no clear channel for gaining experience by killing monsters, so cultivation was the only option.</p><p></p><p>The 'Qi Yuan Scripture' was quite complex to cultivate. Forget about the Stellar Golden Core, even just the Heavenly Dao Foundation Building was difficult to replicate.</p><p></p><p>So Qi Yuan prepared to create a castrated version of the 'Qi Yuan Scripture' to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>To increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, this body had integrated the primordial seed, so the cultivation returned to his original body was no longer that pitiful tiny amount from before.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's current plan was to rapidly increase his level and gain the ability to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>Then participate in the martial arts tournament. </p><p></p><p>After all, if his martial arts aptitude wasn't good enough and he couldn't win the tournament, he still had his Dao techniques, right? It didn't seem there were rules against using immortal techniques in the martial arts tournament.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Junan residential complex, two men and a woman carrying fruit baskets were walking towards Qi Yuan's home, chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu touched his glasses. With his tall stature, he was the center of attention among the three.</p><p></p><p>During university, Wang Xu was the class monitor. Using his family connections and his own efforts, he got a job at the Maritime Affairs Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Yuan Kingdom's maritime hegemony was unrivaled under heaven, and maritime trade was flourishing, so a job at the Maritime Affairs Bureau was highly sought after.</p><p></p><p>Such a respectable job naturally made other classmates envious.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yan, what's the matter, do you still have thoughts about Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan had her hair in a high ponytail and wore flared pants on her long legs. She was tall and slender, though her looks were only above average. Today she wore light makeup, with a hint of melancholy in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wang Xu's words, a smile appeared in her eyes: "I was young and foolish then, but now..." </p><p></p><p>She shook her head.</p><p></p><p>In college, she had feelings for Qi Yuan at one point.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan's looks were unparalleled in their class.</p><p></p><p>She had always wanted to pursue Qi Yuan, but was always rejected.</p><p></p><p>Later, when she learned Qi Yuan had developed a mental illness, she immediately distanced herself from him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan may have had good looks, but she didn't want to marry someone with a mental illness.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if her girlfriends found out, it would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>One of her dormmates got pregnant right after graduation and married a young man from a small town under the county.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, these roommates didn't say much, but behind her back they said plenty of bad things about that roommate, basically that she was stupid, married down, and her life was over.</p><p></p><p>With such a cautionary tale from that roommate, how could Li Yan really want to have anything to do with Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A one night stand was fine, but marriage was out of the question.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise she would be laughed to death.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Qi Yuan's life is really bitter enough. He was already an orphan, then finally got into university, only to develop a mental illness. Now... he's seriously ill again, who knows how he's doing." The buzz cut guy said, his eyes filled with sympathy.</p><p></p><p>However, there seemed to be a hint of greed mixed into his expression, very well hidden, unnoticed by those present.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, misfortune cuts deepest for those already suffering." Wang Xu sighed, with a sense of sorrow for all mankind.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the three of them knocked on the door of Qi Yuan's home.</p><p></p><p>The buzz cut guy looked around, seeming quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The door opened quickly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in the doorway, looking at the three people outside with a calm expression: "Old classmates, you've come. Please come in and have a seat."</p><p></p><p>A surprised look flashed across Wang Xu's face, quickly hidden: "Qi Yuan, your face... why is it so pale?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's current appearance was like that of an invalid, as if he was about to die at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm sick." Qi Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the three classmates before him, memories flooding back like a tide.</p><p></p><p>When the primordial seed was still there, they had also come to see Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was lying in a hospital bed then, in a constant state of sleep and coma, unable to say anything, so naturally there was no interaction.</p><p></p><p>"Have you... been to the hospital? Is it serious?" Li Yan asked with some concern.</p><p></p><p>After all, seeing her former crush in this state, possibly about to die soon, made her feel a bit emotional. Is this the price of growing up?</p><p></p><p>"It's not serious, just a small issue." Qi Yuan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Once he started cultivating immortality, would these issues still be issues?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't solve the curse-like problem with his body for now, but becoming a normal person and delaying the curse's recurrence was doable.</p><p></p><p>"How is this a small issue, look at your complexion!" Li Yan couldn't help saying, her eyes reddening as if very sad for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although she looked down on Qi Yuan now, she couldn't bear to see him pass away at such a young age.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yan, you're thinking too much. Qi Yuan can stand up and talk to us now, so it shouldn't be a big problem." The buzz cut guy said.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if it was really serious, he would be lying in a hospital bed.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he could stand up and talk meant the problem wasn't too big.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I'm doing very well, I can eat six steamed buns in one sitting." Qi Yuan said as he sat down in a chair.</p><p></p><p>Although this kind of pain wasn't much to him, he didn't have masochistic tendencies either, so he naturally did whatever was most comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"In a few more days, my illness will be cured." Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>His words also made everyone present breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Wang Xu asked: "Qi Yuan, you haven't found a job yet, right? </p><p></p><p>How about I introduce you to a job? The salary isn't high, but it's very relaxed and stable."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu revealed his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was in a probationary period at the Maritime Affairs Bureau.</p><p></p><p>Helping someone like Qi Yuan, the child of a martyr, would earn him a lot of bonus points.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned: "But don't I have a mental illness? Do people with mental illnesses need to find jobs too?"</p><p></p><p>Would any company dare hire someone with a mental illness? Was Gongxing so competitive that even the mentally ill needed to find work? Wang Xu was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Because this was the first time he had heard someone with a mental illness matter-of-factly ask if they needed to work too.</p><p></p><p>It sounded particularly strange.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, she understood. Having a mental illness didn't mean being stupid, it just meant having some issues with one's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't work, you can certainly survive on the government subsidies.</p><p></p><p>But..." Wang Xu pondered, "Qi Yuan, what I'm about to say may be a bit hurtful, please don't take offense.</p><p></p><p>If you just stay at home without a proper job,</p><p></p><p>It will be very difficult to get married and have children.</p><p></p><p>Even with government-arranged blind dates, those women won't be interested in you."</p><p></p><p>For children of martyrs, the Qin Yuan Kingdom had many protections.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there various subsidies, but matchmaking services were also arranged.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Qi Yuan's mental issues, he would probably be at the bottom of the dating market.</p><p></p><p>After all, what woman would want to take on such a burden?</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Qi Yuan. Without a stable job now, your success rate for blind dates would be too low.</p><p></p><p>Not like Wang Xu, working at the Maritime Affairs Bureau, about to get promoted at such a young age.</p><p></p><p>If he went on blind dates, he'd be in high demand." Li Yan smoothed her hair, looking at Wang Xu with envy in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That's an exaggeration</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's just an ordinary job," Wang Xu waved his hand, but couldn't hide the pride in his eyes. He continued looking at Qi Yuan and said slowly, "The job I found for you is very easy. You just need to watch over a warehouse and make sure no one steals anything. It requires no skills, anyone can do it."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan also hurriedly persuaded, "That's right, Qi Yuan, you should consider it. Your parents wouldn't want their family line to end, would they?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan smiled and said, "Working a job is impossible."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head directly. </p><p></p><p>Returning to a modern society similar to Earth, and they want him to work a job?</p><p></p><p>Are they trying to kill him?</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about me. Even without a job, I'll find a wife!" Qi Yuan said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted, he could even go directly to the civil affairs bureau with Xiao Jia to get a marriage certificate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once his abilities improved a bit and he could project the Golden Core of the Fixed Star to this universe, he could summon Ning Tao down as well and get married to her too.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he might be committing bigamy.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan wasn't afraid.</p><p></p><p>He had a certificate proving he was mentally ill.</p><p></p><p>This certificate was like a protective talisman.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't afraid of breaking the law, why would he fear bigamy?</p><p></p><p>"This..." Wang Xu wanted to say more.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan was ill and had no job. Wanting to marry and have children would be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't have a job..." Li Yan wanted to continue, "You won't have money either. You won't even be able to eat at nice restaurants."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the buzz-cut guy's eyes lit up: "Oh come on, your thinking is too old-fashioned. With Qi Yuan's conditions, how could he not find a wife? I know a girl who's quite pretty and virtuous. She's been wanting to go on blind dates recently. I can introduce her to Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Yan was stunned and whispered in the buzz-cut guy's ear: "Don't harm some innocent girl."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu looked at the buzz-cut guy with a thoughtful expression: "What kind of girl is she? What's her character like?"</p><p></p><p>"She has a very good character. She even received scholarships in university. Sigh, her background isn't great, she's from a remote area, but she's very hardworking. She's always wanted a Tianyue household registration... so you know..." The buzz-cut guy explained the girl's background.</p><p></p><p>A girl from a poor background with ambition.</p><p></p><p>Tianyue City was the provincial capital in the Qinyuan country. </p><p></p><p>The household registration here was quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Qi Yuan had a three-bedroom apartment.</p><p></p><p>If this apartment was sold, it would be worth 4-5 million Qinyuan currency, an amount that people from poor backgrounds could hardly afford even after working hard their whole lives.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu hesitated for a moment: "Qi Yuan is your old classmate, don't scam him. What if that girl..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu couldn't finish his sentence.</p><p></p><p>What if she was trying to trick him into marriage? After all, Qi Yuan had mental issues.</p><p></p><p>That girl could probably get her hands on Qi Yuan's property and wealth with just a few tricks.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the girl I know is very honest," the buzz-cut guy smiled, "She's also very conservative and traditional. If she commits to someone, she probably won't give up for life. Last time, she even complained to me that a blind date guy tried to hold her hand after only meeting three times. She really looked down on that, so you can see how conservative she is."</p><p></p><p>The buzz-cut guy said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she had said these things while in bed with him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the buzz-cut guy had asked, I've only met you twice, even less than that blind date guy, how come...</p><p></p><p>The girl had shaken her head and said, you're different, that was a blind date.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Xu said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, class monitor? You don't trust me, Cui Fan?" the buzz-cut guy asked, his voice carrying a hint of accusation.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xu hesitated for a long time, still unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Then Cui Fan said dissatisfied: "Class monitor, although I made some mistakes in college and borrowed some high-interest loans, I've turned over a new leaf after graduation. I have a proper job now, don't look at me with colored glasses!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the awkward atmosphere, Li Yan said: "Wang Xu, Cui Fan is different from before. He became a manager at a pharmaceutical company less than a year after graduation."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Although he currently had a subsidy, it was only over 2000 per month.</p><p></p><p>This was barely enough for him to live on.</p><p></p><p>He needed money to buy various materials for cultivation and martial arts practice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Cui Fan mention high-interest loans, many ideas came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>Should he follow the example of others... and take out high-interest loans? Qi Yuan had seen many TV shows and anime where the protagonists lacked money in the early stages of starting their businesses.</p><p></p><p>What to do when lacking money? Take out high-interest loans!</p><p></p><p>And then just don't pay them back!</p><p></p><p>After all, the high-interest loans in Qinyuan country mostly operated in legal grey areas.</p><p></p><p>These loan sharks often had underworld backgrounds and did inhumane things.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan taking out loans could be considered eliminating evil for the public good.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had no intention of paying them back.</p><p></p><p>"I won't get involved in this matter, you just need to convince Qi Yuan. Qi Yuan, if you have time, you should still go report for the job I introduced," Wang Xu continued.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was for promotion or not, there was no harm in helping Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The buzz-cut guy's eyes revealed a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also nodded and said tactfully: "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>For the rest of the time, everyone chatted in the room for a while.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps out of concern for Qi Yuan's health condition, they didn't stay too long.</p><p></p><p>Now, looking at the empty room, Qi Yuan took out his phone and found Cui Fan in his contacts.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and sent a message: "Cui Fan, can you lend me some money?"</p><p></p><p>Rather than looking for it himself, it was better to trouble others.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Cui Fan seemed to have ill intentions towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Borrow money? How much? What for?" Cui Fan's reply came quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Borrow 10,000 yuan, I'm a bit short on money right now," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Well..." Cui Fan hesitated, if he wasn't plotting to get Qi Yuan's property, he definitely wouldn't bother with someone asking to borrow money. But at this moment he was still very considerate, "I don't have money on me right now, sorry. By the way Qi Yuan, do you want to meet Xiao Mei in three days? If you go meet her, I'll tell you a way to get money."</p><p></p><p>"Sure," Qi Yuan smiled, he had been waiting for this.</p><p></p><p>With Cui Fan's personality, how could he be willing to lend 10,000 yuan to him?</p><p></p><p>"I have a contact for a high-interest loan. How about after you meet Xiao Mei in three days, you meet with the loan shark?" Cui Fan suggested hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... how much can they lend? I need quite a bit of money," Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to borrow more.</p><p></p><p>"A lot, don't worry. With your house as collateral, borrowing 4-5 million won't be a problem," Cui Fan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's house was worth 4-5 million, but in reality, it couldn't fetch that much.</p><p></p><p>Both he and Xiao Mei owed several hundred thousand in high-interest loans.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because they couldn't pay back the money that they were working together to trick Qi Yuan out of his house.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

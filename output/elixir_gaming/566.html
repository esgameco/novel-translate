        <h1>Chapter 566</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Sovereign of the Void Realm with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, countless "gazes" represented powerful solar deities.</p><p></p><p>The number of these solar deities far exceeded the Six Heavens of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Void Realm had a sinister smile on his face: "I was once like you... but in the end, didn't I become a mere shadow in the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"What is the Black Heavens?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see those three thrones? If you can get past us and see those three thrones, perhaps you will know what the Black Heavens truly is," the Sovereign of the Void Realm said ominously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless eyes were all focused on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These gazes were cold, merciless, fanatical, and obsessive.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sensed that countless black lines were spreading in the darkness, representing disorder and chaos.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that if these black lines touched him, he too would be assimilated by the Black Heavens, becoming one of the Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>However, the scorching white light emanating from the Enlightened Qi was able to repel these black lines.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Qi Yuan to avoid assimilation.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked towards the three thrones.</p><p></p><p>All the solar deities seemed like fireflies, twinkling stars, while the three thrones seated in the depths of the darkness shone like a blazing sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>[The Three Phantoms of the Black Heavens, the third layer of the Solar Deities, the Realm of Primordial Creation, are the thrones born in the Black Earth, without wisdom or true spirit.]</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Primordial Creation?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt a mysterious pressure.</p><p></p><p>From the Realm of All Things to the Realm of Primordial Creation was a significant threshold.</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Primordial Creation meant the ability to create life and worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, to see the Three Phantoms of the Black Heavens, he first had to overcome the countless solar deities before him.</p><p></p><p>"Surrender and give up your resistance. You have no chance of winning," the Sovereign of the Void Realm said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's right eyebrow twitched violently, indicating that this battle would be extremely perilous.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have the slightest chance of defeating us and reaching the three thrones, how will you fight them? And even if you defeat the three thrones, how will you fight the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless solar deities spoke in unison, their voices vast and mechanically cold.</p><p></p><p>Their voices alone were enough to make Qi Yuan's powerful divine spirit involuntarily dim.</p><p></p><p>If it were any other sovereign, their divine spirits would likely be trembling.</p><p></p><p>"I've never fought a battle like this before. Since I condensed the Eternal Star Elixir, I've always been the one attacking others. I never expected to be the one under siege today!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan held the Enlightened Qi, neither sorrowful nor joyful, with a sacred and majestic aura.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze across the countless solar deities and sovereigns, his eyes flashing with a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see... just how far my limits can go!"</p><p></p><p>Devouring Primal Body! Lethal Radiance! Absolute Adaptation!</p><p>Tyrannical Power!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan unleashed his strongest abilities in this realm.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of Absolute Adaptation, Qi Yuan charged into the lion's den like a tiger, unleashing his slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"Those who block me, die!"</p><p></p><p>He was not entirely without wisdom, though. Under the enhancement of Lethal Radiance, he did not resist the attacks from the sovereigns, but instead endured them.</p><p></p><p>His attacks were aimed at the weaker ones.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was fearless, and the solar deities of the Black Heavens and Black Earth had no choice but to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Three solar deities of the first layer and two solar deities of the second layer immediately intervened.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the bodies of these five powerful solar deities were instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of experience flooded into Qi Yuan, slightly increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Primal Body was also playing its role, devouring these five solar deities.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The lightning rule of a Realm of All Things sovereign fell upon Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's body stiffened, his flesh and blood trembling, the pain indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"You can't kill me, only make me stronger!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan increased his speed to the extreme, quickly evading the Realm of All Things sovereigns and focusing on hunting down the ordinary solar deities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan could only hope that his Lethal Radiance and Absolute Adaptation were powerful enough to allow him to slaughter enough solar deities, raising his strength to a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, he might have a slim chance of turning the tide.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan traded injuries for kills, slaying three more solar deities.</p><p></p><p>Now, the ordinary solar deities were as fragile as paper in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Only the sovereign-level solar deities posed a strong threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Countless attacks fell upon Qi Yuan, and if not for the Lethal Radiance and Absolute Adaptation, he would have already perished.</p><p></p><p>After all, the number of sovereigns here far exceeded the number in the entire Cosmic Realm.</p><p></p><p>So, he was facing not the terrifying experts of a single universe, but the experts of more than ten universes!</p><p></p><p>The slaughter continued.</p><p></p><p>Blood kept flowing, but it was Qi Yuan's blood.</p><p></p><p>He had never experienced such an intense battle before.</p><p></p><p>However, his harvest was also abundant. With the influx of experience and the Devouring Primal Body, his strength was constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Terrifying black water fell upon Qi Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Half of his face was corroded, and his divine spirit was severely dimmed.</p><p></p><p>This black water rule could corrode and devour everything in the world.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation!</p><p>Devouring Primal Body!</p><p>Lethal Radiance! His powerful supports resisted the black water rule.</p><p></p><p>"Wait..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"My consciousness... is dissolving."</p><p></p><p>This dissolution was not caused by the Black Heavens invading and transforming him into a part of the Black Earth, but rather a result of the combined effects of Absolute Adaptation and Devouring Primal Body.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation represented the ultimate adaptation and survival.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the attacks of these sovereigns, even with his Life Sealing Hanging, he could not lock it down.</p><p></p><p>Because the attacks were too fierce and too frequent.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation was also adapting to these attacks, changing Qi Yuan, dissolving his consciousness and transforming him into... a killing machine that only knew how to slaughter.</p><p></p><p>This would allow him to survive better.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even though I'm not afraid of pain and don't care about injuries, my consciousness is still hindering my physical body!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The injuries were truly present, and even though he didn't care about them and could endure them, they would still instinctively affect him, slowing down his attack efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then what's the problem with having no consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation!</p><p>Devouring Primal Body!</p><p></p><p>Without consciousness, even the most terrifying injuries would not affect his combat.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could preserve a glimmer of true spiritual light, perhaps... there would still be a chance.</p><p></p><p>"Kill for me! Devour for me!"</p><p></p><p>The slaughter continued, dyeing the Black Heavens with blood... Qi Yuan's blood.</p><p></p><p>The more solar deities he killed, the more Qi Yuan dissolved, his consciousness growing increasingly muddled and hazy.</p><p></p><p>He became like a mindless devouring behemoth, avoiding the strong and consuming the weak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's a failure," Sheng said with a sorrowful expression.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why did we fail?" </p><p></p><p>The sun god of the celestial clan coughed up blood, in excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>It has been three months since Qi Yuan entered the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that Qi Yuan would actually manage to delay the progress of the terrifying bubble devouring the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>With the respite gained, the Divine Wood Universe did not hesitate, but pondered ways to break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an avatar of the Void Realm Lord from the neighboring universe descended.</p><p></p><p>He said: "Gather the eight Enlightenment Artifacts, and the Divine Wood Universe will have a chance at survival."</p><p></p><p>This news filled all the Ancestral Gods with joy, but also some bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>In just a few hundred years, seven Enlightenment Artifacts had been forged, and the last one... should have been completed soon.</p><p></p><p>Yet, no matter how they tried, they could not forge the eighth Enlightenment Artifact, despite gathering all the power of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>Countless master forgers, including divine-level and even Ancestral God-level forgers, had sacrificed themselves in the attempt to glimpse the Enlightenment Artifact.</p><p></p><p>But... the eighth Enlightenment Artifact... simply could not be successfully created.</p><p></p><p>Failure! </p><p></p><p>Failure!</p><p></p><p>Endless failure! "How can this be resolved?" Sheng Nü's face was bitter.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe only had five Ancestral God-level forgers.</p><p></p><p>Now, three of them had chosen to sacrifice themselves to forge the Enlightenment Artifacts.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two were the youngest, Sheng Nü, and the oldest,器玉.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancestral God-level forgers had chosen to sacrifice themselves, leaving these two to oversee the forging of the final Enlightenment Artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Why did we fail? There were no mistakes!" Qi Yu's aged face was filled with anguish.</p><p></p><p>Forging an Enlightenment Artifact only required a divine-level forger to lead the process.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yu had participated in three previous successful forgings of Enlightenment Artifacts.</p><p></p><p>This time, however, they could not succeed, and had even lost three Ancestral God-level forgers, not to mention countless ordinary forgers.</p><p></p><p>Yuan remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancestral Gods were also emotionally agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qi Yuan is alone in the Black Heavens, fending off enemies, and we here cannot even forge an Enlightenment Artifact? This is unacceptable, where is the justice in this!" The burly bearded one said through tears.</p><p></p><p>"We are useless, all of us!"</p><p></p><p>"Complaining won't help, we should think about how to actually forge it!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the eighth Enlightenment Artifact missing?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there some condition we are lacking?"</p><p></p><p>All the Ancestral Gods discussed, but could not figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>Their knowledge of the Enlightenment Artifacts came from the sun god of the celestial clan, who also did not know much about them.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's gaze shifted, and he gritted his teeth, saying, "I will go seek an audience with the Void Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a majestic, illusory figure descended.</p><p></p><p>It stood in the sky, and also directly in front of each person present.</p><p></p><p>No matter where it was, it was always in their line of sight.</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightenment Artifacts are not ordinary treasures of light."</p><p></p><p>"They are treasures of the fundamental rules."</p><p></p><p>"And the Enlightenment Artifacts... are forged from the primordial rules that construct the universe."</p><p></p><p>"I have analyzed the Divine Wood Universe over eons, and it is composed of eight primordial rules: metal, wood, water, fire, earth, thunder, rain, and cloud."</p><p></p><p>"Now, seven Enlightenment Artifacts have been gathered, only the water one is missing."</p><p></p><p>"Once you find the last water one, the eighth Enlightenment Artifact will be forged."</p><p></p><p>"With all eight Enlightenment Artifacts gathered, perhaps... there may be a chance."</p><p></p><p>All the Ancestral Gods were deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Yuan stepped forward: "May I ask the Void Realm Lord, where is the water?"</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord's voice was ethereal: "I do not know."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>The water, representing the primordial rule, where was it? How were they to capture and forge it into the eighth Enlightenment Artifact, they had no idea.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Lord, how long can Lord Qi Yuan hold out in the Black Heavens?" Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts clenched.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to know how Qi Yuan was faring.</p><p></p><p>The battle in the Black Heavens must be perilous and brutal.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord looked up, gazing into the void.</p><p></p><p>His eyes fell upon the constantly expanding bubble, and a rare expression of emotion flashed across his face.</p><p></p><p>"Even I, if I were to enter the Black Heavens, would be instantly assimilated. For him to have endured this long is a miracle."</p><p></p><p>"I observe... his true essence is dimming, less than a tenth remains, perhaps... it can be extinguished in the blink of an eye." The Void Realm Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Realm, he had witnessed the rebirth and destruction of the universe over 108,327 eras.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen a being as exceptional as Qi Yuan before.</p><p></p><p>"At any moment?" The other Ancestral Gods heard this, and felt a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Qi Yuan could falter and perish at any time.</p><p></p><p>If they failed to forge the eighth Enlightenment Artifact and unite it with the other seven before Qi Yuan's demise, then even if they succeeded in forging it, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Lord, what is the Black Heavens?" Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord narrowed his eyes, his voice deep: "What lies within the Black Heavens is beyond the imagination of mortals."</p><p></p><p>This meant that the world where the Black Heavens existed was something that ordinary people could not even conceive of.</p><p></p><p>It was like having a dog in front of you, but your consciousness is sealed, so you only know it as Wangcai, not realizing it is a dog.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens existed in this manner.</p><p></p><p>"So no matter how we try, we can never know what the Black Heavens is?" Yuan felt somewhat indignant.</p><p></p><p>This sense of consciousness being sealed was unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Generally, the reason something is powerful is because it is hidden and unknowable.</p><p></p><p>Once all the information is revealed, the hidden thing can potentially be overcome.</p><p></p><p>But now, this hidden thing had a consciousness seal.</p><p></p><p>This meant that in the realm where the hidden thing resided, no one could know its true nature.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord raised three fingers: "I can take three worlds' worth of living beings and evacuate them from the Divine Wood."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe had already been infiltrated by the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Void Realm Lord, who was on the verge of breaking through to a higher realm, he could only protect the inhabitants of three worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Void Realm Lord!" Yuan solemnly bowed.</p><p></p><p>At least, even if the Divine Wood Universe perished, some living beings would have a place to take refuge.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Three thrones were seated in the sky, their gazes mechanical, without sorrow or joy.</p><p></p><p>Below, the battle was extremely brutal, like a stone mill grinding flesh.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Yuan who was once there was now barely conscious, no longer human in appearance.</p><p></p><p>The seven Enlightenment Artifacts had transformed into halos of fundamental rules, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>He was now a crimson light, like a blood-red vortex wrapped in seven halos, devouring everything in sight, all that existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>The three thrones observed Qi Yuan, their expressions calm.</p><p></p><p>"His essence... is quite strange."</p><p></p><p>"There has never been a being in the world that can devour the Black Earth."</p><p></p><p>"It is somewhat similar to the Black Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"He... is about to give birth to a new world."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan has not yet fully regained his position as the Heavenly Dao of the Wangyue Continent, his words already carry a certain authority for the representatives of the seven countries, able to influence their decisions.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, these seven representatives immediately nullified their previous agreements. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the many geniuses present changed their expressions dramatically.</p><p></p><p>The first to challenge Qi Yuan was again that Ling Jiao.</p><p></p><p>"You actually used illusions to bewitch these Wangyue Continent natives and force them to cancel the agreements. How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>"You're going too far, sir. With the great calamity approaching, we should be working together. How can you monopolize everything?"</p><p></p><p>"What monopoly? Isn't the Wangyue Continent his home?" Grand Master Dazhi couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The many geniuses on the scene looked at Qi Yuan with rather unfriendly expressions. </p><p></p><p>After all, establishing a foothold on the Wangyue Continent was part of their sects' plans to mitigate the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan's actions had clearly harmed their interests.</p><p></p><p>For one person to challenge nearly twenty powerful forces - wasn't that too audacious?</p><p></p><p>"The Wangyue Continent is my home. I can rent it to whoever I want. Didn't I just ask if any of you wanted to rent it? But no one did," Qi Yuan said helplessly. "Since you don't want to rent, canceling the agreements is normal. The contracts weren't signed anyway, so they have no legal effect. Even if you sued me in court, I would still win."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words left the geniuses present bewildered. They understood each word, but put together the meaning was unclear. They only grasped the general idea - he wanted to forcibly occupy the Wangyue Continent!</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the confidence to oppose so many of us?" Ling Jiao said coldly. </p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Qi Yuan with unfriendly expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Justice and reason!" Qi Yuan declared righteously. "In America, if you break into my home, I would be within my rights to shoot you dead!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan used rumors about America to intimidate those before him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'd like to see what abilities you really have!" A powerful aura emanated from Ling Jiao, as if she was about to attack Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan felt disappointed. </p><p></p><p>It seemed the rumors about America couldn't scare these people after all.</p><p></p><p>They really dared to attack him.</p><p></p><p>"Come at me all together. Today I'll show you that my fists are the law!" said Qi Yuan, looking especially bulky wearing twenty long robes, with turtle shells hanging on his chest and back, appearing particularly comical.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, he was directly challenging over a dozen geniuses! The geniuses present all had slight changes in expression, shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"How bold!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you're at the peak of Divine Infant realm, you'll surely be defeated here today!"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses on the scene were furious.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were at Golden Core realm, some at Divine Infant realm. Apart from Purple Palace realm cultivators, they were the top experts of the Eastern Lands.</p><p></p><p>And the turtle shell man before them was clearly not at Purple Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Because cultivators who had comprehended Origin Divine Abilities would face obvious rejection when entering other worlds.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan didn't, so at most he was at Divine Infant realm.</p><p></p><p>For a Divine Infant realm cultivator to challenge all of the top 20 geniuses of the Eastern Lands - this was suicide.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not at the peak of Divine Infant realm, I'm only at Golden Core!" Qi Yuan said seriously. </p><p></p><p>Obviously no one present believed his words, or rather, no one paid attention.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you're at Divine Infant realm or have ten thousand Golden Cores, you'll still be defeated today!"</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so geniuses present were about to attack Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was indifferent to these geniuses, but looked at Gu Xiaoyao seriously and said: "You are a Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator, the opponent most worthy of my respect!</p><p></p><p>A battle between us would likely cause the continent to collapse and the sun and moon to darken, with no victor emerging even after a year or more.</p><p></p><p>Let me defeat them first, then we can have a proper, fair duel!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiaoyao was briefly stunned, then felt a strange sense of superiority arise: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>This strange man before him looked down on those geniuses, choosing to battle him last - this was putting him on a different level from the other geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, challenging all of us alone - it seems you truly have a death wish!" Ling Jiao said coldly. "That turtle shell and dozens of magic robes won't save you!"</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses also looked at Qi Yuan, battle intent surging in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's words were an insult to them.</p><p></p><p>"I... won't participate in this battle," Xu Tongchen quietly withdrew at this time.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the person before them was the Blood-Robed Sword God! Moreover, he was also puzzled - wasn't it said that Purple Palace realm cultivators would face world rejection phenomena when entering another world?</p><p></p><p>"This little lady is not skilled in combat, so I won't participate in this battle," Jiang Ya thought for a moment before finally withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Dazhi looked at Qi Yuan and raised his fist: "I support you."</p><p></p><p>The remaining fifteen geniuses looked at Qi Yuan with unfriendly gazes.</p><p></p><p>None of them made the first move, after all, ganging up to attack one person would bring them no glory even if they won.</p><p></p><p>They were all waiting for Ling Jiao to make the first move and teach this turtle shell man a lesson.</p><p></p><p>However, before Ling Jiao could act, Qi Yuan took the initiative.</p><p></p><p>"In my home, I have buffs! How can you possibly fight me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura swept out.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the geniuses present felt their breathing become rapid.</p><p></p><p>Powerful pressure assailed them, causing their expressions to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>Before they could react,</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt as if several mountains were pressing down on their backs.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so geniuses were instantly immobilized, pinned down by the heavy mountains.</p><p></p><p>Ling Jiao was in an even more miserable state, directly pressed to the ground with her face in intimate contact with the earth, a deep pit formed where she was pressed down!</p><p></p><p>With a single move, Qi Yuan instantly defeated fifteen geniuses!</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they weren't even on the same level!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan merely exerted his pressure and completely defeated these fifteen peerless geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of these geniuses on the scene were extremely ugly, with fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Palace realm?"</p><p></p><p>"You're at Purple Palace realm? How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>"No, even Purple Palace realm isn't this strong. You are... the Blood-Robed Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>These geniuses were confused and shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Could this person really be the legendary Blood-Robed Sword God? If he was the Blood-Robed Sword God, everything would be easily explained.</p><p></p><p>After using his pressure to defeat fifteen geniuses, Qi Yuan's gaze burned as he looked at Gu Xiaoyao of Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment: "My previous move was nothing to you at Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Now... let's have a proper, fair battle. Don't go easy on me just because I look young.</p><p></p><p>I also want to see if my limit can reach even 30% of your power!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan looked at Gu Xiaoyao, an aura ten or a hundred times stronger than before swept out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The legendary perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator, his true opponent - he was finally going to cross hands with him!</p><p></p><p>Only an opponent like this could be considered a real opponent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaoyao felt immense pressure and was extremely afraid in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Was this senior joking?</p><p></p><p>You, a Purple Palace realm powerhouse who destroyed the Light Palace with Yin God foundations, want to have a fair battle with me, a mere Divine Infant realm cultivator? Isn't this bullying? He looked extremely frustrated and couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Yuan became angry: "Why aren't you saying anything? Do you look down on me? Do you think I'm not worthy of fighting you?"</p><p></p><p>Is perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment so great?</p><p></p><p>Looking down on his imperfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment like this?</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt wronged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoyao felt even more wronged than Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Grand Master Dazhi spoke up: "Based on my many years of experience, Gu Xiaoyao can't speak now because your pressure is too strong, he simply can't open his mouth to talk."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Qi Yuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaoyao wanted to thank Grand Master Dazhi's ancestors for eighteen generations.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he a perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator? How could he be intimidated by my pressure? I understand now, he's feigning weakness, then planning to ambush me when I'm not paying attention! Such deep scheming, truly worthy of Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment!" Qi Yuan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Gu Xiaoyao felt extremely frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Grand Master Dazhi pondered: "Perhaps he's not a perfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator, but an imperfect one."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He removed all the pressure from his body, and Gu Xiaoyao could finally breathe, his face showing an expression of having survived a calamity: "Senior, I am an imperfect Heavenly Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, life was most important.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan also felt extremely awkward.</p><p></p><p>The information was wrong! It was all Xu Tongchen's fault for giving him incorrect information! Feeling embarrassed, he wanted to quickly leave this place.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Luo Xi and the other seven country representatives: "Let's go deal with the Moluo clan."</p><p></p><p>The other seven country representatives were also excited in their hearts at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the expert before them far exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>They felt that before this expert, they were no match at all.</p><p></p><p>Was this a legendary fifth-stage powerhouse?</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Luo Xi was excited inside.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Ya suddenly spoke up: "Senior, I have always been collecting the world's magical techniques. May I accompany you on this journey to collect the techniques of this world?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... alright," Qi Yuan looked at Jiang Ya.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I also have a request - you need to give me some of the Ascending Heaven Pavilion's techniques," said Jiang Ya with a smile in her eyes. "For every technique I obtain in this realm, I'll give you five in return, senior. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! It's a deal!" Qi Yuan was very excited. </p><p></p><p>He had finally latched onto Jiang Ya, this wealthy patron.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, I'm also quite interested in the customs of this realm. May I accompany you?" Great Wisdom True Lord asked at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Sure, you can come with me to see which area is good for renting a place," Qi Yuan agreed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll come too!" Xu Tongchen quickly said. </p><p></p><p>He hadn't made a move earlier, and if he stayed behind, he would definitely be targeted.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan gave a faint glance at the dozen or so geniuses present. Under Luo Xi's lead, the group slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>About a minute later, the oppressive atmosphere in the room finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A man spoke with a gloomy expression: "For a senior like the Blood-Robed Sword Saint to make a move against us juniors is truly shameless!"</p><p></p><p>They were now almost certain that the man they had just seen was the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen's master Xu Yeli was a member of the Blood-Robed Alliance. </p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen's attitude towards that turtle-shelled man was telling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, quite a few of the geniuses had received inside information that the person who had entered through the back door back then was the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought it was a junior from the Blood-Robed Alliance who had entered, but unexpectedly, it turned out to be the Blood-Robed Sword Saint himself!</p><p></p><p>"Strange, the origins of different worlds are often dissimilar. After comprehending the Origin Divine Ability, rashly entering another realm would incur the world's rejection. Why didn't this happen to the Blood-Robed Sword Saint?" one of the geniuses questioned.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that they had only regarded the turtle-shelled man as a genius like themselves.</p><p></p><p>They had never feared those of the same level as themselves.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this Blood-Robed Sword Saint had bullied them from a position of superiority.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he utterly defeat them, but he even wanted to have a fair fight with Gu Xiaoyao.</p><p></p><p>This old man had no martial ethics, bullying the young too much!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ling Jiao spoke coldly: "The Blood-Robed Sword Saint bullies the young from a position of power, and now wants to monopolize the Wangyue Continent. This is making enemies with us, with the entire Eastern Land!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword Saint may be strong, and destroying the Palace of Light was indeed unexpected, but making an enemy of the entire Eastern Land is seeking death. I will report this matter to my grand-master!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, do you think that by hiding in the Wangyue Continent, we'll have no way to deal with you?"</p><p></p><p>Their factions didn't want to come into conflict with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>But the Wangyue Continent concerned their retreat path, so they had to fight for it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this matter isn't over! One man against the entire Eastern Land, does this Blood-Robed Sword Saint think the sun in the sky revolves around him?" Ling Jiao said angrily. However, as she spoke, she couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Her face turned deathly pale in an instant, the aura on her body plummeted, and her vitality became as weak as a thread.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Jiao?" Seeing this scene, those present were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Blood-Robed Sword Saint hadn't left?</p><p></p><p>Was this punishment for Ling Jiao? The geniuses present changed color drastically, no longer daring to speak or discuss the Blood-Robed Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, several streaks of light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Luo Xi beside him and asked, "Have you been to Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luo Xi was startled inwardly: "How does senior... know this?"</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Jiang Ya glanced at Qi Yuan with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"In Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, doing push-ups and sit-ups can increase one's strength, but the price is... hair loss," Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>These rules were established by him back then to help Jin Li become stronger.</p><p></p><p>The shock in Luo Xi's heart grew even greater, like surging waves overturning the sea.</p><p></p><p>How did this person from another realm know these secrets!</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at Luo Xi: "Can you tell me about the matters concerning Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know Qi Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>But matters related to Xuanyuan Forbidden Land involved huge secrets.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how to speak about it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his head, looking at the huge ancient Qichu tree in the sky, his thoughts seeming to return to a time long ago.</p><p></p><p>He sat on a blue stone by July Lake, with Moon Girl accompanying him, alone fishing in the cold river snow.</p><p></p><p>"You can tell me, it's alright," Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>His voice was once again full of charm.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xi, who had been struggling, slowly began to speak: "When I was young, I followed my parents to the Moon Dynasty. By chance, I joined the Moon Dynasty and became one of the Moon Sworn."</p><p></p><p>"So the Moon Dynasty is still around..." Qi Yuan recalled those people beside July Town, and also remembered Moon Girl who had once left a crescent moon mark on his arm.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own arm, smooth as ever, the crescent moon mark from back then long since disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a Moon Sworn allows one to enter Xuanyuan Forbidden Land, increase one's strength, and serve the Moon God!" Mentioning the Moon God, Luo Xi's face was full of reverence. "Later, when the Moluo race invaded and Phoenix Cassia was in danger, I requested leave from the leader. The leader allowed me to return to Phoenix Cassia to protect it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan looked at the moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Moon God Sovereign... Wangyue Continent... Moon Girl... Moon Token... Master.</p><p></p><p>Was there any connection between these?</p><p></p><p>He felt extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't know if coming here would allow him to see the person he wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Ya spoke up, interrupting Qi Yuan's thoughts: "How does senior plan to deal with the Moluo race?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally... kill them," Qi Yuan answered decisively.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya continued: "The Moluo race in Phoenix Cassia and the other six countries are not very strong. With senior's strength, you could perhaps sweep through them in a few days.</p><p></p><p>However... once senior exposes your strength, it will alarm the powerful members of the Moluo race.</p><p></p><p>At the quickest, in a dozen or so days, at the slowest, in a few months, the Yin God level experts of the Moluo race will definitely find senior.</p><p></p><p>Senior is alone, and has offended so many great powers of the Eastern Land. Facing the Moluo race, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>There was worry in Jiang Ya's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo race was very strong, otherwise the Yin Gods of the Eastern Land wouldn't be at a disadvantage in their struggle against the Moluo race.</p><p></p><p>"This is my home. Should I hand it over just because the enemy is too strong?" Qi Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Continent was his home. If unwelcome guests came to his home, naturally they must all "leave their lives here, even if people can go".</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was speechless.</p><p></p><p>She felt that communicating with the Blood-Robed Sword Saint was as difficult as communicating with Jiang Lingsu's senior brother.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Great Wisdom True Lord also said: "The head can be cut off, blood can flow, but home cannot be given to others!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen remained silent, not participating in their conversation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Qi Yuan looked towards Luo Xi: "Who informed the Moon Dynasty about the secrets of Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?"</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had only told Jin Li, and hadn't told anyone else, not even Moon Girl.</p><p></p><p>How did the Moon Dynasty come to know the secrets of Xuanyuan Forbidden Land?</p><p></p><p>"This matter... junior doesn't know," Luo Xi didn't quite understand Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he would have to go to the Moon Dynasty himself to clarify the truth.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that later, Jin Li went to wait for him under the ancient Qichu tree and eventually joined the Moon Dynasty? Qi Yuan's heart was full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He asked again: "Is the current Moon Dynasty still located near the ancient Qichu tree, and are there still people by July Lake?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Luo Xi nodded. "The current Moon Dynasty, though not famous, produces many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>July Town is the holy land of the Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess has always lived in July Town, in the wooden house by July Lake."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the High Priestess, Luo Xi's eyes were full of reverence.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, upon hearing the words "High Priestess", Qi Yuan's left eyebrow twitched: "What is the High Priestess's name, and what does she look like?"</p><p></p><p>"The High Priestess... has the body of a child, unchanged for a hundred years. She always wears a veil on her face, so her appearance can't be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess is also the strongest expert of the Moon Dynasty, the strongest expert of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>Her swordsmanship is unparalleled in the world, no one can match it!" Luo Xi's eyes were full of fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, that High Priestess held an extremely high position in the hearts of the Moon Sworn.</p><p></p><p>"The High Priestess is also the person closest to serving the Moon God," Luo Xi said again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many thoughts flashed through Qi Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Swordsmanship?</p><p></p><p>Child's body?</p><p></p><p>Could it be Moon Girl? But he had been gone for so long, Moon Girl would probably have grown into an adult by now, or perished in the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a coincidence? All of this could only be clarified by going to the Moon Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, after coming to the Wangyue Continent, he felt somewhat timid in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that everything would turn out to be nothing.</p><p></p><p>However, this thought only existed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I will definitely become a Mixed Origin Saint, a Golden Immortal of the Great Luo. Even if everything turns out to be empty, I can turn the virtual into reality!" Qi Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He decided that after killing the unwelcome guests near Phoenix Cassia and the other six countries, he would go to the Moon Dynasty to clarify the truth of everything.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-one days, very soon," Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 405</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators from various sects, clans, and hidden sects suddenly awoke.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the sky, but even with their powerful cultivator vision, they could not see the figure of that blood-colored light. </p><p></p><p>However... wherever that blood-colored light passed, the heavens and earth were dyed completely red.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight shining through the red sky also turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators called this scene "the bloody sun slaughtering the heavens".</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is the Blood-Robed Sword God. It seems he is about to eliminate the Great Calamity!" Some Yin Gods trembled.</p><p></p><p>Three days was too short a time for the Yin Gods.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword God could not be measured by common sense.</p><p></p><p>Declaring war on the Great Calamity, not only did he not keep it secret, but he did it openly and grandly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the time was so rushed!</p><p></p><p>After contacting all the powerful experts, he would directly go to face it himself in three days! Relying on his own strength to deal with the Great Calamity!</p><p></p><p>This point shocked the Yin God Venerables and Great Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood-Robed Sword God's confidence is so strong, could it be that he has entered the Yang God realm like that person back then?" A Great Venerable spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, that person ultimately failed because the Mountain of Fate leaked information. This time the Mountain of Fate has already been eliminated, perhaps there's really a chance!"</p><p></p><p>"You're dreaming. No need for the Mountain of Fate to leak, the Blood-Robed Sword God leaked it himself!" A Yin God Venerable said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes looked towards the sky, as if trying to see that streak of blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>"No, the sky of our Wave Rain Domain has also been dyed red!"</p><p></p><p>"I woke up from seclusion, why is the sky of our Northern Desert dyed red? Huh? Blood-Robed Sword God, what does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just the Northern Desert, the skies of other domains have also been dyed red. What is the Blood-Robed Sword God doing?!"</p><p></p><p>Many people were puzzled, and discussions kept arising.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after taking a nap, or eating a meal, or washing underwear, they looked up at the sky again.</p><p></p><p>One glance showed a red sky! The entire sky of the Azure Waves Realm had been dyed red by the blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>The light shone down, like blood threads.</p><p></p><p>Countless people were puzzled, but some were also inexplicably shocked.</p><p></p><p>This Blood-Robed Sword God... was really fast.</p><p></p><p>But many cultivators also had doubts in their hearts: "If the Blood-Robed Sword God is so strong, then how strong must the Great Calamity be?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we know too little about the Great Calamity. Whether it's human, demon, or devil, how strong it is, what it has done, we don't know."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the Great Calamity... could possibly coexist peacefully with us?"</p><p></p><p>People knew far too little about the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, remote places like the Divine Light Sect had no concept of the Great Calamity at all.</p><p></p><p>Only great families at the Purple Palace level like the Jiang family could know a thing or two about the Great Calamity through precious treasures, but their knowledge was very limited.</p><p></p><p>As for Yin Gods, many had heard of the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>But their understanding of the Great Calamity was limited to just harvesting.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence the Great Calamity was, who was behind it, was unknown.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Great Calamity was only known to be probably at the Yang God realm, after all there was once a Yang God in the Azure Waves Realm who failed to break through the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>So when "Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity" came out, many people in the Azure Waves Realm didn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>They even felt that saying cultivation methods were poisonous was an exaggeration, just like how spiritual energy was poisonous - in the Azure Waves Realm, all cultivators who used spiritual energy to cultivate would eventually perish.</p><p></p><p>So the Great Calamity seemed far out of reach.</p><p></p><p>Some female cultivators who considered themselves beautiful even said that if the Great Calamity opened its eyes and looked at them, it definitely wouldn't come away empty-handed, and might even become their Dao companion.</p><p></p><p>Some gifted male cultivators also said the Great Calamity might take a liking to their talent and accept them as disciples.</p><p></p><p>There were all kinds of voices regarding "Qi Yuan Eliminates the Great Calamity".</p><p></p><p>At the first quarter of the You hour, the entire sky of the Azure Waves Realm turned red.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators looked at the sky with solemn expressions, feeling as if they were witnessing history.</p><p></p><p>In a tower, Jiang Lingsu in a green dress broke out in a cold sweat on her forehead, her beautiful eyes filled with endless worry.</p><p></p><p>Even the simple green dress could not hide her graceful figure. It was hard to imagine how stunningly beautiful she would be if undressed.</p><p></p><p>The skirt was very long, but occasionally revealed a glimpse of flesh-colored stockings underneath, seeming somewhat improper but also strangely alluring.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, she was still here playing chess with Senior Brother, her mind wandering, as if wanting to make some decision.</p><p></p><p>But now Senior Brother had gone to face the Great Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Leaving her alone to wait.</p><p></p><p>She recalled a glimpse she had seen in the family's precious treasure - blood rain pouring down, the world turned upside down, something that could not be achieved by the power of an individual.</p><p></p><p>She gritted her teeth and said: "Senior Brother, you must be alright!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless eyes looked up at the sky, wanting to find the Great Calamity, wanting to see the Blood-Robed Sword God Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to understand what the Great Calamity was, and just how strong the Blood-Robed Sword God really was.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light shone down, and countless people felt a sense of desolation and sorrow in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>An intense fighting spirit accumulated at this moment. All those looking at that blood-colored sky felt an extreme fighting spirit at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Central Heavenly Domain.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red figure stopped, his form tall and straight, long hair floating.</p><p></p><p>In front of the blood-red figure stood three people.</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingtong bowed respectfully: "Senior, to help you eliminate the Great Calamity, this junior is willing to offer you a talisman containing the full-force strike of ten mythical beings!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Lingshan also lowered her head. When she saw Qi Yuan's extraordinarily handsome appearance, the ridiculous feeling in her heart earlier completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"This junior has a formation disk that may be able to trap the Great Calamity for a moment or two. I offer it to you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, a man wearing a black robe all over, with a desperate expression, looked at Qi Yuan. His eyes were full of the air of death: "I offer the Mandate of Heaven of the Thousand Demons Realm to you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Demons Realm was also one of the three thousand "pig farms" similar to the Azure Waves Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the fate of this world was even more tragic.</p><p></p><p>The Great Calamity seemed to have devoured all the potential of this world, leaving behind a wasteland. In the end, the Great Calamity even slowly chewed and swallowed the land, mountains, rivers, seas and sky of the Thousand Demons Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Thousand Demons Realm, only this black-robed man was still alive, having escaped to the Star Departure Realm.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the three thousand "pig farms", he could not go to any other worlds - going there would mean death.</p><p></p><p>Now, these three Yin Gods who came from other realms, without any nonsense, faced Qi Yuan who was about to confront the Great Calamity and offered their own treasures to lend what little help they could.</p><p></p><p>At this point, persuasion, warnings, wake-up calls, explaining the formidability of the Great Calamity - all of these had no meaning anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Good." The blood-colored figure spoke, his voice deep, sparing with words, as if brewing something.</p><p></p><p>"May you rise straight to the blue clouds and slay the Great Calamity!" Wang Lingtong and Wang Lingshan said.</p><p></p><p>A glint of sharpness and determination finally appeared in the death-filled eyes of the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, fuck that Great Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was hoarse, but it also represented his anger.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the blood-colored robe looked back at this world one last time, then leapt into that endless chaos.</p><p></p><p>The three Yin Gods stood in place, their gazes complex. Wang Lingshan said: "I hope the senior can win!"</p><p></p><p>If the Blood-Robed Sword God were to be victorious, perhaps only then would the Star Departure Realm gain a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>But they also understood that a hero's departure often meant no return.</p><p></p><p>In the three thousand worlds, throughout history, geniuses were as numerous as fish crossing a river. Many lived mediocre lives or avoided challenges by closing their doors, but there were always geniuses like the Blood-Robed Sword God who would</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Appearing, raising his arm and shouting, daring to fight against the great calamity with his mortal body!</p><p></p><p>"This battle... regardless of victory or defeat, we will all remember!"</p><p></p><p>In the central celestial realm, in an unknown place, there was a patch of chaos. Suddenly, in the blurry chaos, a flash of spiritual light appeared.</p><p></p><p>This product called the great calamity was in a daze, sleeping for 99% of the time, without its own consciousness. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to existing for too long, a strand of spiritual light had formed on its body, giving it a bit of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, infinite information poured in from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The great calamity opened its eyes. Its eyes, lacking in spirituality, appeared somewhat profound and muddled, as if it had not fully awakened.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan to eliminate the great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>The great calamity murmured, its voice as faint as a mosquito's buzz.</p><p></p><p>It was like a pebble the size of a fingernail being thrown into a vast ocean. At first, it caused only a tiny ripple, but unexpectedly, the ripple kept expanding, becoming waves, then turning into huge tsunamis in an instant, and finally transforming into world-ending mega-tsunamis thousands of miles high.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sound also rang out in the ears of everyone in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Those who undergo tribulations, burdened with sin and blood, should atone for their crimes in heaven and earth, cutting away their flesh bit by bit."</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators in the Cang Lan Realm who heard this voice turned pale.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the great Dao struck directly at their hearts, causing countless cultivators to feel guilt and fear.</p><p></p><p>"We are burdened with sin and blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the great calamity a test from the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"We are wrong!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the great calamity unsettled the minds of all who heard it, producing fear.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators also understood a glimpse of the great calamity's power.</p><p></p><p>Merely its voice could be heard in every corner of the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>This kind of strength, this kind of vastness, was simply unmatched.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an even more immense voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Those who undergo tribulations, unrepentant and harboring delusions, dare to come with murderous intent, should fall like the Thousand Demons!"</p><p></p><p>Along with the voice of the great calamity, an image appeared in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>Mountains crumbling, seas flooding, continents breaking apart, spiritual energy collapsing chaotically.</p><p></p><p>Countless living beings were crying out, souls wandering.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying heavenly tribulations and the merciless Dao were ravaging an entire realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing such an apocalyptic scene, all the cultivators trembled, their eyes turning gray with despair.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity... cannot be stopped!"</p><p></p><p>"How... how can it be eliminated?"</p><p></p><p>"We are wrong, the great calamity is not wrong!" Some cultivators lost all courage, breaking down in tears.</p><p></p><p>Yin Spirit experts were terrifying, able to destroy a country with one strike, representing the strongest power in the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the entire Thousand Demons Realm, a country was like a grain of sand on a beach.</p><p></p><p>Who could win fighting against an existence like the great calamity? Who had the ability to win? In the Phoenix Celestial Domain, endless timidity and fear welled up in the depths of the Ice Mountain Tyrant Woman's eyes: "Is this... the great calamity, an existence that even Yin Spirits cannot imagine!"</p><p></p><p>Having just entered the Yin Spirit realm, she had been full of pride, feeling she was not on the same level as Purple Mansion cultivators, able to make a country sink with a wave of her hand.</p><p></p><p>But compared to making an entire realm sink, the difference was too great.</p><p></p><p>The expression of Great Venerable White Fish was dejected: "Even if I exhausted my whole life, I fear I could not harm Him in the slightest."</p><p></p><p>A Great Venerable had a bitter look: "The ant... is me."</p><p></p><p>The little fox girl sat blankly on the ground: "It's okay, the senior is so strong, he will definitely be able to destroy the great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's over, the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal actually dares to challenge such a great calamity, the Cang Lan Realm is finished!" Some cultivators went mad, losing their minds.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the great calamity..." Some cultivators who had been in seclusion for thousands of years and matured late felt despair, "Who can oppose it?"</p><p></p><p>At Divine Light Sect, Kang Fulu looked at this scene in silence.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Lands, Jiang Ruhua anxiously transformed into a beam of light, rushing madly: "I need to speed up, I must see that rascal Qi Yuan before the destruction, and give him a nose flick!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, he only thought the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal and Qi Yuan had the same name.</p><p></p><p>Now, Qi Yuan was eliminating the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The world was in turmoil, countless living beings would perish.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that kid Qi Yuan had run off with his precious daughter. Not being able to see his daughter at such a critical time, how could he not be angry.</p><p></p><p>If he saw Qi Yuan, he would definitely give him a nose flick!</p><p></p><p>However, as he was flying through the sky, he suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the heavens and earth of the Cang Lan Realm suddenly turned dark at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It became dim and lightless, all sunlight was blocked, even the blood sun could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua couldn't help but look up, and saw... a huge behemoth slowly rising up, an enormous shadow appearing in the sky, growing larger and larger, the body of the behemoth becoming more and more visible.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ruhua's whole body trembled, the spiritual energy in his body becoming unstable at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the behemoth in the sky, he just wanted to find a hole to hide in, feeling that only being surrounded by things on all sides would give him a slight sense of safety.</p><p></p><p>"It's too big!"</p><p></p><p>"What is this!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it a monster?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that... its eye?"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators gritted their teeth until they ached, their minds shaking.</p><p></p><p>If before they had only seen images in their minds from a third-person perspective, it wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>But now, experiencing it in person, looking up at that epic creature, everyone was terrified and afraid.</p><p></p><p>This great calamity... was so big you couldn't see where it ended, seeming even larger than the Cang Lan Realm.</p><p></p><p>A strike from a Yin Spirit probably couldn't even harm its hair, so how could the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal achieve victory?</p><p></p><p>The behemoth's body seemed to be composed of chaos, incomparably huge, in a daze, with only flames of spirituality burning between its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Its giant eyes hung in the sky, looking down at this world.</p><p></p><p>All living beings trembled from the depths of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Some even directly knelt down in worship.</p><p></p><p>"Oh great calamity, mighty immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"Spare me!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a terrifying monster, cultivators couldn't muster any thoughts of resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Lingsu looked up, her pretty face pale white, but her eyes filled with surging killing intent.</p><p></p><p>If looks could kill, the great calamity would have been killed countless times by her.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan eliminate the great calamity!" Jiang Lingsu called out in her heart once or twice.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord also looked up at the incomparably huge body of the great calamity, a profound look flashing in the depths of his eyes: "It's... getting bigger and bigger."</p><p></p><p>At this time, they saw...</p><p></p><p>The incomparably huge chaotic body of the great calamity opened its mouth at this moment, like a black hole in space that could devour everything.</p><p></p><p>"I am the great calamity, where is the one who would eliminate me?"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual eyes of the great calamity swept across the earth, as if wanting to find that person undergoing tribulation.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators were stunned at this moment, where was the Blood-Robed Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>"I am... above your head!"</p><p></p><p>This voice, compared to the muddled voice of the great calamity, had a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators instinctively looked up at the sky, but apart from that behemoth, they couldn't see anything at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dazed and muddled great calamity also suddenly looked up.</p><p></p><p>It saw...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

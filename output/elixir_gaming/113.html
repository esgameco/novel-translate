        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what does this big brother of his know about the origin? The first step of this plan won't work, let alone the rest. It's all... nonsense. </p><p></p><p>He was foolish to believe it so much.</p><p></p><p>"Who says the origin cannot be taught?" Qi Yuan said softly. "Chen Huan, if I teach you the origin and help you ascend to the supreme realm, will you serve me for a hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget a hundred years, I'll do a thousand!" Chen Huan replied without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Swear on your inner demon," Qi Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you serious?" Chen Huan stared at Qi Yuan with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>This guy didn't seem to be joking.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Qi Yuan nodded and said mysteriously, "The opportunity is right in front of you. It's up to you whether you can seize it."</p><p></p><p>"I'll swear if that's what it takes, who's afraid!" Chen Huan had quite an unruly personality, otherwise he wouldn't have stayed in No Return City for so many years.</p><p></p><p>"I, Chen Huan, swear on my inner demon that if the Guardian of No Return City successfully teaches me to master the origin and helps me ascend to the supreme realm, I will serve him for... one hundred years. </p><p></p><p>If I violate this oath, may my inner demon break out and destroy me!"</p><p></p><p>In the Wind Realm, swearing on one's inner demon was the most solemn oath.</p><p></p><p>Once broken, the inner demon would truly break out and emerge prematurely.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I've made the oath, now you should guide your little brother and help me ascend to the supreme realm." Chen Huan shrugged and said casually.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's clothes inexplicably turned blood-red, with a crimson robe draping over his body.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura flowed around him. He stood next to Chen Huan, but for some reason, Chen Huan felt as if he was sitting high up in the celestial palace.</p><p></p><p>He was surprised, then excited, and heard what seemed to be the whispers of an ancient god.</p><p></p><p>"The power of man and demon, seven sins in essence, greed, pride..."</p><p></p><p>"The wind does not blow all morning, the rain does not fall all day, the human heart does not die forever..."</p><p></p><p>"To take, one must first give..."</p><p></p><p>The ethereal voice scattered into Chen Huan's ears, filling his soul.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan felt as if he was in the clouds, yet also deep underground.</p><p></p><p>In the vast sky, the whispers were like sweet dew, falling onto his body.</p><p></p><p>His cracked body became smooth, his parched soul was filled for the first time.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, he suddenly opened his eyes, with a terrifying light bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>"I... have enlightened!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan looked at Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe, his heart now filled with mixed emotions he couldn't describe.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he simply couldn't imagine it.</p><p></p><p>How could the Guardian of No Return City understand the origin? Even if he did, how could he teach it to others, and how could others understand?</p><p></p><p>Especially the way of teaching.</p><p></p><p>Even the White Emperor and the Supreme Lord couldn't teach in a way that allowed cultivators to know and comprehend the origin.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the Guardian of No Return City was a great being reincarnated? But even the greatest being shouldn't be able to teach the origin, right?</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Qi Yuan's voice came, pulling Chen Huan out of his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan looked at Qi Yuan. The blood robe had faded, and he had returned to the appearance Chen Huan was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>That sense of awe and reverence diminished somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan suddenly fell to his knees with a thud: "Father, father, I am your long-lost son!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he hugged Qi Yuan's leg.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Qi Yuan kicked Chen Huan away. "Hurry up and ascend to supreme, complete my plan!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only Chen Huan alone on the city wall, dejected.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity... I missed the chance to acknowledge him as my father." Chen Huan was disappointed, his expression like someone who went to the bathroom last night without paper, made do with a two-yuan lottery ticket, only to find out the next day that the ticket had won several million.</p><p></p><p>"However..." Chen Huan's spirits lifted again, "If I can't be the big shot's son, being his henchman isn't bad either!"</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that at just 1,100 years old, I could ascend to the supreme realm, and not just an ordinary supreme at that!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chen Huan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The origin taught by Qi Yuan was different from what ordinary supreme beings comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what it was like for other supreme beings to comprehend the origin, he knew there was a difference.</p><p></p><p>Because those who barely comprehended the origin could only create the lowest level of origin techniques without pursuit.</p><p></p><p>But now Chen Huan felt that there were many paths available for him to choose.</p><p></p><p>Each one was a broad and grand path!</p><p></p><p>The supreme realm he was entering wasn't the lowest kind, but the kind with extreme potential!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the endless sea of blood, constantly boiling.</p><p></p><p>A low voice sounded: "A familiar feeling, seems like déjà vu."</p><p></p><p>Blood energy surged to the sky, various demonic creatures constantly struggling in the sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>The voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Little Crocodile, take the sword and go to the Ten Thousand Eight Thousand Cities.</p><p></p><p>If you encounter a person... or thing, and the sword flashes with a blood color, bring them here.</p><p></p><p>Treat them... even better than me."</p><p></p><p>The voice was intermittent, then sank back into the sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>A giant crocodile flew out of the sea of blood, carrying a sword on its back, and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings guarding the endless sea of blood naturally heard the Supreme Lord's voice.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes revealed puzzled and shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>Especially that sentence: Treat them... even better than me.</p><p></p><p>Who had appeared in the Ten Thousand Eight Thousand Cities? From the Supreme Lord's tone, that person seemed... quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the White Emperor's Palace, a flash of light appeared.</p><p></p><p>The inner hall that had been closed for a thousand years opened, and a white crane flew out from inside, heading towards the Ten Thousand Eight Thousand Cities.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme beings who saw this were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>What exactly had happened for the White Emperor's crane to fly out?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that this white crane had not appeared for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Even when the North-South decision was made, this white crane had never shown itself.</p><p></p><p>Countless messages spread from near the White Emperor's Palace to various parts of the Wind Realm.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of countless supreme beings all turned towards the Ten Thousand Eight Thousand Cities.</p><p></p><p>The entire Wind Realm was in turmoil beneath the surface.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I've ascended to supreme!" Chen Huan followed behind Qi Yuan, his tone of speech still the same as before, but with a bit more respect.</p><p></p><p>Actually, at first, he didn't know how to face Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was clearly a big shot.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking for a long time, he decided to act the same as before.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't mention becoming sworn brothers again.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there would be a chance to acknowledge him as an adoptive father in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Barely passable." Qi Yuan's spirits were also good. "Seven days to achieve supreme, it seems my meticulous plan is completely feasible."</p><p></p><p>"Big brother's plan is flawless, unprecedented and unparalleled!" Chen Huan immediately started flattering.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, let's go hunt supreme beings." Qi Yuan said with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't kill supreme beings himself, but he could have Chen Huan beat them to near death, and then he would deliver the final blow.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could gain massive amounts of experience points.</p><p></p><p>Currently, his leveling up was too slow.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary demonic creatures gave too little experience.</p><p></p><p>He needed to slay supreme beings to gain more experience points and level up to 120.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the appearance of the great supreme Purple Dao, Qi Yuan was once again restless.</p><p></p><p>He had to quickly reach level 120, comprehend the origin, and awaken origin techniques to have the power to fight.</p><p></p><p>"Hunt supreme beings?" Chen Huan was still somewhat worried. "Big brother, can you really do it?"</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of with you here?" Qi Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"That's not what I wanted to hear." Chen Huan didn't believe in himself.</p><p></p><p>"With me assisting on the side, supreme beings can be subdued with a wave of the hand.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate the value of the Milky Way's number one support."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>With the big shot as the main damage dealer, he just needed to provide some support.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, how should we go about finding supreme beings?" Chen Huan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Just follow me, you can't go wrong."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan often went out to hunt demonic creatures, and occasionally had some "affairs", so he knew some places where supreme beings often appeared.</p><p></p><p>He had some understanding of the supreme beings in the Thousand Cities region.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Chen Huan hurriedly followed, his heart beating fast.</p><p></p><p>Hunting supreme beings!</p><p></p><p>That's hunting supreme beings!</p><p></p><p>What qualifications did he have to hunt supreme beings!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Liuchuan Demon Cave.</p><p></p><p>Neither demon controllers nor demon slayers were willing to come to this place.</p><p></p><p>Because every so often, endless streams of demonic creatures would emerge from here to participate in the great battle of the Ten Thousand Eight Thousand Cities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a woman with a gloomy expression appeared in the demon cave.</p><p></p><p>Below, over a dozen national guardians and even terrestrial myths trembled in fear, prostrating themselves on the ground, clearly terrified of this woman.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Yu Bai, what happened in Liuchuan Demon Cave... was our oversight." A terrestrial myth said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, there are only ninety-nine demon caves in the Thousand Cities region.</p><p></p><p>This demon cave was invaded and all the creatures killed, leaving it barren of demonic creatures for ten consecutive years. If not for the impending great battle, this supreme one wouldn't have discovered this. How long were you planning to conceal it?" Supreme Yu Bai was full of anger.</p><p></p><p>The ability of demon controllers to control demons was inseparable from the demon caves and the supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>This demon cave had suffered great damage and needed to be replenished promptly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The supreme origin would continue to produce demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>"We actually reported it before, but Your Supremacy was in seclusion..." one of the Earthly Legends hesitated, trying to defend himself.</p><p></p><p>"What, so it's my fault?" Supreme Yubai angrily said, causing the human and demonic energy in the air to instantly solidify. </p><p></p><p>That powerful Earthly Legend suddenly couldn't breathe, his whole body immobilized and unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"Deceiving superiors and oppressing subordinates, you deserve death!" Supreme Yubai's hand clenched, and the Earthly Legend dozens of meters away directly shattered into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>After killing one person, Supreme Yubai's mood seemed to improve slightly. She looked at everyone and asked, "Who broke into the Liuchuan Demon Cave? I need an explanation."</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Your Supremacy, this place is closest to Yuzhou territory. It should be the Guardian of Wugui City. He is at the Earthly Legend realm, extremely powerful, appearing and disappearing mysteriously. For decades, he has often gone out to sweep away demonic creatures," a nation protector said.</p><p></p><p>An Earthly Legend also added, "This time when the Great Supreme arrived, the cities of the Thousand Cities region all began to retreat towards Dabei City. Yuzhou territory is already empty, only this reckless Guardian of Wugui City remains in Wugui City."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Supreme Yubai's face showed a contemptuous expression: "A mere Earthly Legend, so arrogant? Take some people and raze Wugui City to the ground."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Yubai spoke casually, as if dealing with the most ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Legends present looked at each other, not daring to answer.</p><p></p><p>"What, you can't even handle a mere Earthly Legend?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Supremacy, that Earthly Legend is no ordinary Earthly Legend. Once, three of our comrades surrounded him and were all killed by his sword. There are rumors that the Guardian of Wugui City is a disciple of the White Emperor."</p><p></p><p>These Earthly Legends were extremely distressed.</p><p></p><p>Now Yuzhou territory had become a forbidden zone. </p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to appear there, fearing they would encounter that bringer of death and die at his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're scared witless by a single Earthly Legend, what a joke," Supreme Yubai was displeased. "Does he have six legs and seven arms?"</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Legends present didn't dare to respond, all lowering their heads.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you slander me baselessly? You truly deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>Along with this voice, a dazzling sword light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>A sneak attack!</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present felt an extremely terrifying sword intent, their scalps tingling and blood running cold.</p><p></p><p>If this sword strike landed on them, it would be enough to kill them instantly.</p><p></p><p>As the sword light swept past, rocks continuously fell from the cave ceiling.</p><p></p><p>Anger flashed in Supreme Yubai's eyes: "A mere Earthly Legend dares to raise a sword against me!"</p><p></p><p>Facing Qi Yuan's sword strike, she didn't move, directly taking the blow with her chest.</p><p></p><p>Clash!</p><p></p><p>The sword and Supreme Yubai's chest collided violently, with an origin force protecting her body.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword that could easily kill an Earthly Legend seemed to strike the hardest steel.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's proud sword strike, even with the enhancement of Lie Yi, only pierced a hole in Supreme Yubai's clothes.</p><p></p><p>Through the hole was a large expanse of snow-white skin.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike didn't even leave any red marks on the soft skin of her body.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Yubai was somewhat dazed, not expecting the opponent to pierce her clothes with one strike.</p><p></p><p>Although this dazzling strike couldn't harm her, piercing her clothes had already surprised her.</p><p></p><p>She was very shocked, but Qi Yuan was even more shocked: "You're... too hard? If you're married and your husband isn't a Supreme, wouldn't he be unable to break through your defenses?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Yubai's face showed an angry expression: "How dare a mere boy humiliate me, you're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>A mere Earthly Legend daring to provoke a Supreme.</p><p></p><p>If news of today's events spread, she, Yubai, would definitely be secretly mocked in the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Her rivals would even directly ridicule her! She was very angry: "Let me show you what it means to be a Supreme!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Supreme Yubai made her move, it was a powerful origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan saw a thin, long flying needle shoot towards him.</p><p></p><p>The flying needle carried a thick killing aura.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained calm, his eyes fixed on the flying needle.</p><p></p><p>Raising the broken sword in his hand, Qi Yuan suddenly shouted: "Chen Huan, the origin divine ability has three layers, attack her Danxin acupoint, Xiaokong acupoint..."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, Chen Huan, who had been lying in wait nearby, finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>He followed Qi Yuan's instructions exactly, not daring to make any mistakes, his origin divine ability surging towards Supreme Yubai.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Supreme Yubai's mouth curled into a smug smile: "I've been waiting for you!"</p><p></p><p>She had naturally detected long ago that someone else was lying in wait nearby.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would a mere Earthly Legend dare to sneak attack her? Sacrificing an Earthly Legend to allow a Supreme to sneak attack, they really underestimated her.</p><p></p><p>Three thin needles appeared, directly rushing towards Chen Huan.</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan's face sank, feeling a strong sense of threat. After all, he had just broken through to become a Supreme and didn't know how to respond. He was also afraid that if he responded carelessly, it would ruin Qi Yuan's plan.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Supreme Yubai's origin divine ability was also attacking Qi Yuan. As just an Earthly Legend, could Qi Yuan withstand it?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's voice transmission quickly arrived: "Trapped in the sky, heart yearning for white cranes..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Huan's face showed great joy.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Yubai's originally terrifying attack now seemed full of holes and flaws in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his form avoided Supreme Yubai's origin divine ability, directly appearing behind her.</p><p></p><p>Ten Thousand Phenomena Starry River!</p><p></p><p>In Qi Yuan's teachings, he seemed to see a river composed of stars.</p><p></p><p>He, who had never seen stars before, felt a longing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He directly transformed it into his own origin divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The powerful origin divine ability struck directly on Supreme Yubai's body.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Yubai's face showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Restrain three inches, fix upon the returning heart!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Huan no longer hesitated, following Qi Yuan's instructions, pouring origin divine ability into Supreme Yubai's body as if it cost nothing.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Supreme Yubai's face showed a panicked expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? Why... are you so familiar with my origin divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>This was no longer just familiarity, it was as if they understood her origin divine ability even better than she did herself.</p><p></p><p>"I am the one who will kill you!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's figure appeared, landing in front of Supreme Yubai. He held the broken sword in his hand, his eyes bursting with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Supreme Yubai was even more confused.</p><p></p><p>Her origin divine ability should be able to easily erase an Earthly Legend, how was he still alive?</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Qi Yuan didn't waste words, thrusting his sword into Supreme Yubai's body.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Supreme Yubai's origin divine ability had all been restrained by Chen Huan and couldn't defend at all. She was forcibly killed by Qi Yuan's sword.</p><p></p><p>"Finally softened!" Qi Yuan held the broken sword, very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Earlier he couldn't pierce through, but now without the origin divine ability protecting her body, Qi Yuan broke through her defenses with one thrust.</p><p></p><p>A vast amount of experience also poured in at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt extremely elated.</p><p></p><p>His experience bar kept rising rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it stopped at level 119, very close to level 120, very close to the next opportunity to comprehend origin.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan steeled his heart, looking at the surrounding Earthly Legends. With a flash of sword light, over a dozen corpses fell.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't kill Supremes, but killing Earthly Legends was truly simpler than killing chickens.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the blood-covered Chen Huan and asked, "How are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Some injuries, but I'm fine," Chen Huan's mood at this moment felt unreal.</p><p></p><p>A Supreme... killed so easily? With Qi Yuan's help, he could avoid the flaws in Supreme Yubai's origin divine ability and directly attack her core.</p><p></p><p>But in the final clash of origin divine abilities, he still suffered not light injuries.</p><p></p><p>At this moment he was very excited, not caring about these injuries at all.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're fine, come with me. Let's go to other demon caves and kill until the heavens turn upside down!" Qi Yuan's expression was extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to kill more demonic creatures to gather some more experience and reach level 120.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Chen Huan didn't hesitate at all. Now he was also hot-blooded and excited. Killing a Supreme just now left him unsatisfied and in need of venting.</p><p></p><p>Now he had also been somewhat led astray by Qi Yuan, his mind clouded by the killing.</p><p></p><p>If it were the previous him, he would definitely flee quickly after killing someone. How would he dare go to a second demon cave? That would get them surrounded!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The two quickly left Liuchuan Demon Cave, heading towards other demon caves.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Thousand Cities region, at the Northern Lands demon controllers' headquarters, Purple Daoist opened his eyes, his face showing astonishment: "Supreme Yubai... is dead?"</p><p></p><p>Thank you to [Warm Sun 1314] for the silver alliance!!!

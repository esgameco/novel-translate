        <h1>Chapter 165</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Memories of the past flooded into his mind.</p><p></p><p>All the fragmented scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Are you... Wooden Hairpin?" Qi Yuan looked at the young girl.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he emerged from Tianjue, he had carefully prepared a gift for Jin Li.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, by the lake in July, he did not see Jin Li. </p><p></p><p>The two of them were on opposite ends of time and space.</p><p></p><p>The one who accompanied Qi Yuan as snow fell on his shoulders was Moon Lady.</p><p></p><p>Later, he went alone to Dijue. Moon Lady left the mark of the moon on his arm, and he also left the hairpin for Moon Lady, hoping she could give it to Jin Li who existed in the future.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not some wooden hairpin, I'm daddy's daughter." The High Priestess raised her head stubbornly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at her, feeling deeply emotional inside.</p><p></p><p>Everything connected in this moment.</p><p></p><p>He and Jin Li had only communicated through the Linglong Jade.</p><p></p><p>They had never met in person, but Qi Yuan could sense that she was just an ordinary young girl.</p><p></p><p>He recalled fragments he had heard in the Five Elements Forbidden Land.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Dari encountered a powerful enemy and was ultimately defeated. He nearly exhausted all his methods just to injure that enemy's leg.</p><p></p><p>He had also heard Jin Li talk about an embarrassing incident from her youth - she fell on flat ground during her coronation. Her leg had been injured since childhood and never fully healed.</p><p></p><p>So the powerful enemy who fought Dari back then was Jin Li's previous incarnation.</p><p></p><p>But later, why did she become Moon Lady, and then Jin Li? The High Priestess seemed to see the confusion in Qi Yuan's eyes. She said in a crisp voice: "Does daddy want to know about mommy's background?"</p><p></p><p>"...Mm." To be honest, Qi Yuan didn't really want to acknowledge this daughter.</p><p></p><p>After all, suddenly having an extra daughter, and one who hadn't yet ruled over all of history, made his previous boasts seem very awkward. </p><p></p><p>But thinking that having an extra daughter was better than mysteriously losing a daughter, he accepted it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, she really was his daughter.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy came from the Upper Realm," the High Priestess said, looking up at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan also couldn't help but look at the stars dotting the ancient Qi Chun trees.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the Moon God Sovereign, and the Moon Token his master had left for her.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, mommy came to the lower realm on orders from the Moon Palace to destroy Dari, the master of this realm.</p><p></p><p>She easily killed Dari, but fell victim to a scheme by the Black Magic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss is an even more powerful force than the Moon Palace in the Upper Realm, and has long been at odds with the Moon Palace.</p><p></p><p>After slaying her enemy, mommy also fell into the cycle of reincarnation. </p><p></p><p>The arrangements made by that Yin God of the Black Magic Abyss before his demise also began to take effect - that was the Heavenly Dog Devouring the Moon formation.</p><p></p><p>Once completed, mommy would perish completely and be unable to return to the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>Later, mommy lost her past memories and became Moon Lady, meeting daddy.</p><p></p><p>Daddy went alone to Dijue, destroyed the otherworldly demons and Dari, broke the Heavenly Dog Devouring the Moon formation, and also saved mommy." The High Priestess's cherry-like small mouth had thin lips, her teeth like shattered jade.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was silent for a long time before saying: "Later, was it she who awakened me?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Li's first reincarnation in this realm was named Moon Lady.</p><p></p><p>She left the crescent moon mark on Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Qi Yuan fought the otherworldly demons alone, killed Dari, and established the foundation of the Heavenly Way.</p><p></p><p>In reality, his injuries were extremely severe.</p><p></p><p>It was Moon Lady who consumed her remaining divine power to heal his wounds.</p><p></p><p>So when Qi Yuan awoke again, Moon Lady no longer existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>After sleeping for who knows how many years, Jin Li appeared, having almost completely become mortal.</p><p></p><p>Without divine power, she could not even suppress the old wound on her leg left by Dari.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess looked at Qi Yuan and raised her head: "Mommy said daddy is very handsome."</p><p></p><p>"Where is she now?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"The battle between the Moon Palace and Black Magic Abyss has reached a white-hot stage.</p><p></p><p>After mommy recovered her powers, she ascended to the Upper Realm through a transmission formation.</p><p></p><p>She left me here because mommy believed daddy definitely hadn't died.</p><p></p><p>One day, mommy will see daddy again!" The High Priestess's starry eyes were full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>To see you, to see you.</p><p></p><p>How could they have missed each other? They had met before, just in the wrong time and space, not recognizing each other.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan raised his head to look at the sky, at the myriad stars, his mind full of thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Why... were they all in the heavens?</p><p></p><p>"Can I go to the Upper Realm through the transmission formation?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess focused her gaze: "One must reach the Yin God realm to ascend to the Upper Realm through the transmission formation."</p><p></p><p>In the Moon Dynasty there was a transmission formation that could send some people to ascend to other lower realms under the Moon God Sovereign's other Daos.</p><p></p><p>The formations in those Daos could allow Yin Gods to ascend to the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yin God... that's so far away." Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He could kill Yin Gods, but his current cultivation was only at the Yuan Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>He was still two major realms - Divine Infant and Purple Palace - away from Yin God!</p><p></p><p>"What's daddy's current cultivation level?" The High Priestess stared at Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very weak, just a small Yuan Dan cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Dan?" The High Priestess was surprised. "That must not be an ordinary Yuan Dan."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at this daughter he had never met before: "What... is your name?"</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess's starry eyes smiled as she kept staring at Qi Yuan: "Qi Jianjun."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the inn.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord yawned.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya sat to the side, carefully studying the new techniques she had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen was seriously looking at the new "Suona Score" he had gotten, learning the techniques.</p><p></p><p>The inn door opened and a cold wind blew in, mixed with white foam.</p><p></p><p>Two figures, one large and one small, entered the inn.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord glanced at Qi Yuan, wisdom flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya stared at the little girl, sensing a threatening aura.</p><p></p><p>Yin God?</p><p></p><p>How could a Yin God level expert be born on the Wangyue Continent? Wasn't the Heavenly Way incomplete here? Moreover, this Yin God was holding the Blood Robed Sword Saint's hand... what for?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Ci's eyes widened. He looked at the girl holding the Blood Robed Sword Saint's hand, confusion in his eyes which then turned to reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the High Priestess!" Zhao Ci hurriedly came forward, his eyes full of respect.</p><p></p><p>Six or seven people from the suona troupe also came forward to pay respects to Qi Jianjun.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they all had deep doubts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Although the High Priestess was short, she had a cold personality and rarely interacted with others, always maintaining an air of dignity.</p><p></p><p>When had she ever been this lively and adorable, like a young girl frolicking in a elder's arms?</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun's eyes rolled and her face showed a smug expression: "Daddy, see, your daughter is still very strong."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan didn't want to speak.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, she still hadn't ruled over all of history - how was that strong?</p><p></p><p>He had no reaction.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Ya's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Robed Sword Saint had a Yin God level partner before, she could barely accept it.</p><p></p><p>But now... in less than half an hour, he gained a Yin God daughter? What was happening to this world?</p><p></p><p>"She's your daughter... how does Senior have a Yin God... daughter?" Jiang Ya's voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable for Senior to have a Yin God wife and a Yin God daughter," Great Wisdom True Lord said.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Jianjun's small hand pinched Qi Yuan: "Daddy, did you find me another stepmother? Should I tell mommy about this after I ascend to the Upper Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ya was completely confused!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this High Priestess's mother that Yin God who had taken two steps to heaven?</p><p></p><p>Was it another Yin God from the Upper Realm? How could this Blood Robed Sword Saint... merely at the Purple Palace realm, have two Yin God partners and a Yin God daughter?</p><p></p><p>It felt very strange.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord revealed a wise look: "Senior Blood Robed Sword Saint is truly marvelous! Originally I only proposed a plan for the Blood Robed Sword Saint to find more Yin God partners to become invincible in the world. I didn't expect Senior to have already started implementing the plan!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Qi Yuan coughed.</p><p></p><p>"The only pity is that there's too little time left for the Blood Robed Sword Saint," Great Wisdom True Lord lamented again.</p><p></p><p>After all, the threat of the Moluo clan was imminent.</p><p></p><p>Where would the Blood Robed Sword Saint find time to look for more wives?</p><p></p><p>Xu Tongchen, Jiang Ya and the others also woke from their earlier shock, their expressions worried.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan had two Yin Gods who had taken two steps to heaven, and two who had taken one step.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword Saint had killed Venerable Mohui, so the Moluo clan would surely come for revenge.</p><p></p><p>Their situation was actually still very precarious.</p><p></p><p>"There is a transmission formation in the Moon Dynasty. If we can't resist, we can take the formation to go to other worlds," Qi Jianjun said in a clear voice like bells.</p><p></p><p>The Moluo clan belonged to the Black Magic Abyss Dao lineage.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Abyss and Moon Palace had long been in conflict.</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Continent, surrounded by the Black Magic Abyss Dao lineage's worlds, stood out as an anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've come, I won't leave. I will deal with the Moluo clan myself," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In a few more days, he would fully regain control of the Heavenly Way.</p><p></p><p>His power would reach a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that senior... you have other Yin spirit partners?" Jiang Ya blurted out involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>By now, she had also been led astray. </p><p></p><p>She really couldn't think of how the Blood Robed Sword Immortal could break out of this situation. The only way to break through must be to call for other partners.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Qi Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that following the Blood Robed Sword Immortal to the Wangyue Continent had broadened her horizons.</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord shook his head: "Senior said he would take action personally, so it definitely won't be calling for help.</p><p></p><p>Senior Blood Robed Sword Immortal is at the late stage of the Purple Palace realm, with powerful strength, but still unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>To personally kill a Yin spirit, there's only one possibility!"</p><p></p><p>"What possibility?" Everyone else looked at Great Wisdom True Lord.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan looked at him curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I guess Senior Blood Robed Sword Immortal must shout to the sky: 'My future self, come save me!'</p><p></p><p>Then the future senior will appear to help the current senior overcome this tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya was stunned, feeling her brain wasn't enough to process this.</p><p></p><p>"What if senior has no future?" she said quietly, glancing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What she wanted to say was, what if the Blood Robed Sword Immortal died in the Moon Dynasty?</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord glanced at Jiang Ya: "Facing the Moluo clan, even if senior can't defeat them, it's still very simple to survive.</p><p></p><p>This time, he just needs to escape and go into hiding, then he'll have a future.</p><p></p><p>His future self may cross time and space to make up for the regrets of the past."</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord's words left the musicians present very confused, feeling they half-understood.</p><p></p><p>Qi Jianjun looked at Great Wisdom True Lord, his eyes filled with a bright smile: "A very interesting idea."</p><p></p><p>"Alas, speaking of this, I feel a bit sad.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, I sent an invitation to my future self.</p><p></p><p>In the invitation, I said if my future self didn't come, I would die here.</p><p></p><p>But I sat waiting for seven days, and my future self still didn't come.</p><p></p><p>It seems... my cultivation in this life is limited, not enough to break through time and space."</p><p></p><p>Great Wisdom True Lord looked worried, then turned to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Don't leak this method to anyone.</p><p></p><p>This is my own creation, it can detect whether one's future self can truly cross the river of time!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ya frowned.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, she felt Great Wisdom True Lord's words made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qi Jianjun chuckled lightly: "Your idea is good, but... there's one problem."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Great Wisdom True Lord looked at the High Priestess.</p><p></p><p>"First, experts who can break through time and space must have already ascended to the upper realm. Upper realm experts only have one or two chances to descend in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Second, you may not know... the living beings of this world have past selves and present selves, but no... future selves." Qi Jianjun said, glancing at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"No future selves?" Great Wisdom True Lord's body stiffened, then became alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang spirits don't have future selves? What does this mean? Qi Yuan found this quite interesting when he heard it.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was the first time he had learned about this knowledge.</p><p></p><p>His daughter actually knew so much.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask: "Actually, I've always had a question."</p><p></p><p>"Please ask, father."</p><p></p><p>"Why do the Moluo clan and Wangyue Continent, as well as the Canglan Realm, all use the same language?"</p><p></p><p>Even the same as Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Logically, shouldn't different races have different languages?</p><p></p><p>Even a small place like Blue Star has over a thousand languages.</p><p></p><p>Yet such a vast place as the Canglan Realm all uses the same language.</p><p></p><p>"All places illuminated by the stars of the universe use the same language." Qi Jianjun was surprised that Qi Yuan would ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was stunned. He reached out and grabbed a snowflake: "Then why doesn't snow speak human language?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Moon Dynasty, July Lake.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat by the lake, watching the growing lake, his eyes filled with reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>He had finally come here.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying him was not Moon Lady, but Qi Jianjun instead.</p><p></p><p>The two were carefree, seemingly fishing.</p><p></p><p>In the distant pavilion, a woman in white saw this scene, her expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Robed Sword Immortal... is actually the Faceless Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>This was something she had never imagined.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Sword Immortal was considered an ancient figure in the history of the Wangyue Continent.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was still alive, and his cultivation realm didn't seem to be at the Yin spirit level.</p><p></p><p>This was very strange.</p><p></p><p>But strange as it was, facing the Moluo clan, their Moon Dynasty still had no chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>After all, one Yin spirit of the Moluo clan had reached the pinnacle of the second step of Treading Heaven.</p><p></p><p>One more step forward would be an existence at the third step of Treading Heaven.</p><p></p><p>An expert of this level could suppress the Moon Dynasty single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>"July, do you want to persuade the High Priestess to prepare early and leave the Wangyue Continent?" said the woman in white.</p><p></p><p>She was now thinking of leaving this realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The July Priestess had changed many times. She looked at Qi Yuan by the lake, her expression fanatical: "The Faceless Sword Immortal will surely save the Wangyue Continent again!</p><p></p><p>All who offend our Wangyue Continent shall perish!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, the woman in white couldn't help but hold her head.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why the people of the Wangyue Continent had such inexplicable trust in that Faceless Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had saved the world before, the facts were now clear - they couldn't win.</p><p></p><p>Why such trust?</p><p></p><p>She was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to try persuading the High Priestess again, but ultimately didn't.</p><p></p><p>Because the fanaticism in the High Priestess's eyes was even more severe than others.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Heaven and Earth Cave of the Canglan Realm.</p><p></p><p>A childish voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"The results are out. The Blood Robed Sword Immortal doesn't have a Yin spirit artifact, but behind him stands a Yin spirit at the second step of Treading Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Actually at the second step of Treading Heaven?" Venerable You Qing drew in a sharp breath, "No wonder he dared to kill our subordinates at will and provoke us."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately this old man didn't offend such an expert." An old voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"But he killed Mo Hui, thoroughly offending the Moluo clan.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Venerable Mo Yao of the Moluo clan sent a message.</p><p></p><p>It wants to cooperate with us three to kill the Blood Robed Sword Immortal and the Yin spirit behind him." The childish voice was calm, without joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"Second step of Treading Heaven... this level of conflict, this old man's bones are too soft to get involved."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Venerable Yun Ju, are you scared?" Venerable You Qing smiled coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Mo Yao said we don't need to directly face the Treading Heaven expert behind the Blood Robed Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>We just need to capture the Blood Robed Sword Immortal alive and block the Moon Dynasty's teleportation formation. Such a small matter is easy for us.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Mo Yao also said if this succeeds, a quarter of the Wangyue Continent's territory will be divided among us." There was a hint of greed in the childish voice.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do this." The coquettish female voice laughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... this old man won't get involved." The old voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid of Lord Feng?" There was contempt in the childish voice.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with Lord Feng, it's just that this old man has grown old and become more timid." The old voice sounded helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Yun Ju, you don't have to go, but... before this matter is settled, you can't tell Lord Feng or anyone else!" There was a hint of threat in the childish voice.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, this old man won't get involved." The old voice sounded quite helpless, finally fading away.</p><p></p><p>In the Heaven and Earth Cave, only the childish voice and coquettish female voice remained, seemingly discussing something.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown time, the childish voice spread throughout the Heaven and Earth Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Send a message to Water Cloud Palace, saying their grudge with the Blood Robed Alliance can be resolved at any time."</p><p></p><p>Water Cloud Palace in the Water Immortal Continent had always been at odds with the Emerald Cloud Continent.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Blood Robed Alliance had captured a Purple Palace expert from Water Cloud Palace, causing friction between them.</p><p></p><p>Now, news came from the Wangyue Continent that Ling Jiao had offended the Blood Robed Sword Immortal and been killed by him.</p><p></p><p>Water Cloud Palace was furious. If not for the three Venerables above them and fear of the Blood Robed Sword Immortal, they would have invaded the Emerald Cloud Continent long ago.</p><p></p><p>Now, the two of them wanted to cooperate with the Moluo clan against the Blood Robed Sword Immortal, so they might as well do Water Cloud Palace a favor.</p><p></p><p>Let them take action against the Blood Robed Alliance, cutting off the Blood Robed Sword Immortal's wings.</p><p></p><p>This matter was not important and could be done casually.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" In the Heaven and Earth Cave, a Purple Palace expert's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Robed Sword Immortal's provocation of the Heaven and Earth Cave had long displeased them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Wangyue Continent." Venerable Ye Qiong finally left the Heaven and Earth Cave where he had slept for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Land territory, a long rainbow could be seen flying past.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators who saw that rainbow knew that something big was about to happen!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He looked at Wugui City, his eyes showing an expression of amazement.</p><p></p><p>"In just a few short years, Wugui City has changed dramatically. </p><p>If those old fogies in seclusion were to wake up and discover how much the world has changed, they would probably... be shocked out of their wits."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the changes in Wugui City left Supreme Milo utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning of this, he immediately passed the news to his father, Great Supreme Mikong.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Great Supreme Mikong was actually in Dabei City.</p><p></p><p>He gazed at Wugui City, occasionally seeing the aura of a Supreme fly by in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>A look of envy flashed in his eyes: "If only these Supremes could be used by me, how wonderful that would be."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Milo wandered around the city for half a day, finally returning to the inn.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Supreme Milo sat meditating with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>A candle was lit in the room.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the candlelight flickered as a black-robed figure stealthily snuck into Supreme Milo's room.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Milo opened his eyes, his expression cold: "You've come?"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, young master!" The arrival was actually a Supreme, but in front of the equally ranked Supreme Milo, he was extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme was originally a peak Terrestrial Mythical realm expert who served Supreme Milo.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Milo had him swear a soul-binding oath and, following his instructions, secretly come to Wugui City and eventually break through to become a Supreme.</p><p></p><p>There was more than just this one Supreme like this.</p><p></p><p>Except for the first few lectures, almost everyone who came was relatively innocent, genuinely seeking to break through to a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Among those who came to Wugui City later, quite a few had other motives.</p><p></p><p>The pawns that Supreme Milo and his father had planted in Wugui City were far more than just one.</p><p></p><p>All had sworn soul-binding oaths and could be trusted.</p><p></p><p>"How are things progressing?" Supreme Milo asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to young master, this Blood Palace... is not as formidable as imagined.</p><p>The members inside are quite loosely organized, and there's no real loyalty to speak of.</p><p>As long as we make our move and capture the Blood Lord, those people may not even lift a finger to save him, and might even applaud!" the black-robed man said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>What he said made sense.</p><p></p><p>Great kindness can breed resentment.</p><p></p><p>The human heart is unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace had been established too recently, had no guiding principles, and no goals to speak of.</p><p></p><p>All the Supremes were fighting their own battles, with no loyalty to speak of.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Blood Lord, while many Supremes were grateful, there were also those who feared and resented him.</p><p></p><p>They did not want... the Blood Lord to lecture again, nor did they want more Supremes in this world.</p><p></p><p>After all, with too many Supremes, their own status as Supremes would not be as precious.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Milo nodded: "What have you found out about the Blood Lord's strength?"</p><p></p><p>He had already asked this question of several undercover agents.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord's power is mysterious and immeasurable, but based on the cultivation level he displayed when slaying demons one time, he should roughly be at the mid-stage Supreme realm, nothing to be feared," the black-robed Supreme replied.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Milo wore a worried expression: "Even if he is only at mid-stage Supreme, I'm still somewhat afraid."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the fact that the Blood Lord could lecture and allow people to comprehend the origin was enough to be inconceivable, and he could not be treated as an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>However, fortune favors the bold, and his father was also nearing the end of his lifespan, which is why they joined forces with several Great Supremes to jointly plot against Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>In their view, the most likely explanation for how the Guardian of Wugui City could lecture and help people enter the Supreme realm was that he possessed a Destiny Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>There was no other explanation besides this.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the Blood Lord only appears mysterious, but is actually erratic, and moreover... his cultivation method seems to have gone awry, causing him to often forget things," the black-robed man persuaded again.</p><p></p><p>What he said was also reality.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who had contact with the Blood Lord could sense that his words and actions were strange.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for a Supreme to have such poor memory, and not seem to be acting, was truly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Milo's gaze grew deep: "I'm still afraid something unexpected might happen. What if... it's all an act?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man hurriedly advised: "If you don't take the Blood Lord's place today, other Supremes will do so tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>This black-robed man was a typical example of great kindness breeding resentment.</p><p></p><p>Serving under the Blood Lord made him feel very uncomfortable, and he also felt guilty inside.</p><p></p><p>To make the guilty feelings disappear, it was better to have the Blood Lord die.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Milo's gaze became complex: "This matter... we'll discuss further."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the black-robed man could only withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Only Supreme Milo remained alone in the inn.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this endeavor... succeeds in one stroke!"</p><p></p><p>"If it succeeds, my Mi family will become... the number one hegemon of the Liufeng Realm!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, he and his father had been plotting this for many years! They had also allied with other Supremes, constantly sending Terrestrial Mythical experts who had sworn soul-binding oaths of loyalty into Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>There were many Supremes loyal to him in Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>News about Wugui City was transmitted to Dabei City in large quantities every day.</p><p></p><p>It came through different channels.</p><p></p><p>These loyal individuals were also different from each other, but the information they transmitted was mostly the same.</p><p></p><p>"After the next lecture for a thousand people ends, we must make our move!" Supreme Milo knew that if they didn't act soon, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>He had reached the limit of Terrestrial Mythical experts he could send into Wugui City.</p><p></p><p>In another hundred years, if Wugui City had tens of thousands of Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Any schemes he had then would be nothing but wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>Now was the best opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The longer they waited, the slimmer their chances would become.</p><p></p><p>This time, many Supremes from the Southern and Northern Lands were cooperating to block the news, all for the sake of plotting against Wugui City, taking a big gamble.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Blood Lord really is only at mid-stage Supreme."</p><p></p><p>"I hope that before he lectured, he didn't have cultivators swear soul-binding oaths of loyalty, and that it's really because he's erratic."</p><p></p><p>"I hope... this endeavor succeeds!"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Milo made three wishes in a row, his heart still very cautious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Wugui City, people came and went, the streets bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai and Li Yunzhi sat in a restaurant, drinking wine together.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai sighed: "A storm is brewing."</p><p></p><p>Now in Wugui City, over two thousand more peak Terrestrial Mythical experts had arrived.</p><p></p><p>In a few more days, these two thousand peak Terrestrial Mythical experts would listen to the Blood Lord's lecture together and step into the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi looked at his close friend and asked secretly: "Have you felt that something's not quite right in Wugui City recently?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Gai's expression changed: "There is something."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Palace now had one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five Supremes.</p><p></p><p>This number, to be honest, had almost surpassed the number of Supremes in the Southern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Of course, among so many Supremes, not a single one was at mid-stage Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, someone approached me," Li Yunzhi said haltingly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai looked at Li Yunzhi, his expression grave: "Just say it, I won't tell anyone."</p><p></p><p>Li Yunzhi looked at his close friend, hesitating for a moment before transmitting a message to Wang Gai.</p><p></p><p>The gist of it was that a Supreme had hinted to him that major events might occur in the Blood Palace in the future, and not to easily take sides.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting the message, Li Yunzhi looked uneasy: "Do you think... the Blood Palace is about to fall apart?"</p><p></p><p>"Someone wants to make a move against the Blood Lord?" Wang Gai's face turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the conversation had reached this point, Li Yunzhi stopped beating around the bush: "You say, we've received the Blood Lord's grace, should we..."</p><p></p><p>He was very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Emotionally, he wanted to repay the Blood Lord's kindness in lecturing.</p><p></p><p>Rationally, for things to have developed to this point meant the enemy was coming in full force, having already laid out their plans.</p><p></p><p>If he rashly got involved, he would likely only end up dead, unable to change the outcome or influence the bigger picture.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of clowns, how dare they make a move against Lord Blood!" Wang Gai raged.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the Blood Lord slaughtering over twenty Supremes back then was still deeply imprinted in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Supremes were very powerful? In the Blood Lord's eyes, they were probably as fragile as ants.</p><p></p><p>Those twenty-odd Supremes, including ten mid-stage Supremes, were all Supremes from the Northern Lands.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Blood Lord, they couldn't even last a single round.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai, who was watching at the time, even felt that if the Blood Lord had made a move against them then, they would likely have met the same fate as those Northern Land Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Li Yunzhi had been held up by something and didn't go that time.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, knowing the Blood Lord's mysterious power, Li Yunzhi wouldn't be worried about these things at all.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many Supremes there were, they were all just cabbages before the Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Gai, you don't happen to know something, do you?" Seeing Wang Gai's confidence in the Blood Lord, Li Yunzhi couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai smiled: "Don't worry, no amount of schemes and tricks can harm the Blood Lord."</p><p></p><p>"You really do know something!" Li Yunzhi was angry hearing this.</p><p></p><p>It felt very unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Blood Lord has already seen through the plot?" Li Yunzhi guessed, but he still felt something was off, "With the Blood Palace being such a loose organization, hardly anyone truly loyal to the Blood Lord, how can the Blood Lord win?"</p><p></p><p>Since the other side dared to make a move, they must have made thorough preparations, and there might even be Great Supremes involved.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." Li Yunzhi's eyes widened, "The Blood Lord is the White Emperor's illegitimate son?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Gai spat out the tea in his mouth: "That's insulting the Blood Lord, stop guessing!"</p><p></p><p>In Wang Gai's heart, the Blood Lord was an even more terrifying existence than the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor was powerful, but the Blood Lord was... astonishing</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Scary?</p><p></p><p>Blood Lord is not human at all, he's a demon god!...</p><p></p><p>On the city walls of Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>This area was forbidden for people to go up to.</p><p></p><p>Only Chen Huan and Yuan Qi were allowed to ascend.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also Qi Yuan and Xiao Jia.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan in his blood-red robe was embracing Xiao Jia, standing on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"After tightening screws for too long, one needs to come out and breathe some fresh air."</p><p></p><p>As always, Xiao Jia leaned against Qi Yuan. A wooden board with a "smiley face" pattern slid out from her sleeve and fell into Qi Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"If only you could take human form," Qi Yuan said, looking at Xiao Jia. The game had gone on for a long time, but luckily Xiao Jia had always been by his side.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia stood quietly beside Qi Yuan, saying nothing.</p><p></p><p>"My recent memories have been inconsistent," Qi Yuan said with a reminiscent look. "When I entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences and comprehended the origin, I almost got lost in the realm of 'Forgetting'. </p><p></p><p>Besides hearing the golden canary's call, I seemed to feel someone constantly tugging at the hem of my clothes.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Jia, was that you?"</p><p></p><p>During this time, Qi Yuan had been trying to break through to the subtle level of the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Some fragmented images inexplicably floated up in his mind.</p><p></p><p>For example, when he was trapped in the realm of "Forgetting", a hand kept clutching the hem of his clothes.</p><p></p><p>These images only came to his mind now.</p><p></p><p>Another wooden board slid out of Xiao Jia's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>It showed a pattern of a hand holding a sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"So it was you after all." Qi Yuan tried to touch Xiao Jia's nose, but touched nothing.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't disappointed though, and still embraced Xiao Jia as he pondered: "Is there anything else I've forgotten that happened in the Gate of Ten Thousand Differences?"</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>Once he fully remembered, the Great Forgetting Heart Sutra might reach the subtle level.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would have more confidence.</p><p></p><p>As of now, he was merely invincible among those of the same level.</p><p></p><p>As for the White Emperor and the Venerable One, he had never encountered them and didn't know how powerful they really were.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if they were as powerful as the Shadow God.</p><p></p><p>If so, this game would be quite difficult to pass.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, the demon spawn have a limit. If I want to level up again, do I have to kill everyone in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was no murderous maniac, nor was he extremely selfish.</p><p></p><p>"If only there were new places to grind levels, that would be great."</p><p></p><p>At present, merely slaying demon spawn provided very little improvement for him.</p><p></p><p>He needed to kill some Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite strange, what is the limit of this world? Why can it create so many Supreme Beings? Won't resources become scarce?" Qi Yuan fell into contemplation again. "Or is it exhausting all resources?"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, in a normal world, the number of powerful beings is roughly fixed.</p><p></p><p>This world had too many Supreme Beings, but too few powerhouses like the Venerable One and the White Emperor.</p><p></p><p>It didn't conform to the standard pyramid structure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, deep in the White Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor, the strongest in the South, had an aura as weak as paper. He opened his eyes, a complex look flashing in their depths: "Have the Thirteen Northern Demon Beasts... already reached the ends of the earth?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope this time... it won't be all for nothing."</p><p></p><p>"The grudges... should also be settled."</p><p></p><p>"Master... if you were still here, what would you do?"</p><p></p><p>"Last time, when the world shook, it seemed like the Nine Pan Mountain sermon reappeared. Was it... your blood of reincarnation that you left behind manifesting in the world, Master?"</p><p></p><p>"The fellow Taoists in the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons can't hold on much longer."</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor's eyes were full of desolation.</p><p></p><p>He was supporting not just the situation in the South, but the entire Liufeng Realm.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield of this world was not just in the North-South decision.</p><p></p><p>The North-South decision was merely to eliminate demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>The enemies of the Liufeng Realm were not just demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>There were also beasts! The greater battlefield was in the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, Master alone suppressed the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, slaughtering all demon spawn.</p><p></p><p>Now, we also need to suppress the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, Master Blood Lord entered the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, suppressing ten thousand demons, nearly perishing.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of the Destiny Stone, the Thirteen Northern Demon Beasts, who were the White Emperor's fellow disciples back then, unhesitatingly chose to enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts to awaken the Master.</p><p></p><p>This action did indeed awaken Blood Lord.</p><p></p><p>After awakening, Blood Lord used his great power to empty the entire Gate of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p></p><p>Then he perished, with only a drop of blood flowing out from the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The threat within the Gate of Ten Thousand Demons was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that in the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts, there were also endless beasts rampaging, wanting to break free.</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor had doubted at the time that it was the Destiny Stone that made them enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts, which opened up the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, what's done is done and cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>"I hope... it succeeds."</p><p></p><p>If it succeeds this time, the situation in the Liufeng Realm can continue for another 300 years.</p><p></p><p>If it fails, the entire Liufeng Realm will become a true paradise for demons and beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Yanran... was it the Destiny Stone that influenced you?"</p><p></p><p>The White Emperor sighed softly, with endless desolation.</p><p></p><p>This avatar of his should also merge with his main body and enter the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Gate of Ten Thousand Beasts was not optimistic.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Wuguicheng, Supreme Beings gathered like clouds.</p><p></p><p>For many years, no living demon spawn had been seen running within dozens of miles outside this city.</p><p></p><p>Now, Wuguicheng could be said to be very safe even without Qi Yuan guarding it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, powerful beings gathered in Wuguicheng.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand peak Earthly Immortal realm powerhouses gathered in one place, with various expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Some were worried, some expectant, some uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Some Supreme Beings were also among the crowd. They had captured many demon spawn and gained the opportunity to listen to the sermon again.</p><p></p><p>Wang Gai and Li Yunzhi were also in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Wang Gai's calmness, Li Yunzhi now seemed somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>He was uneasy inside, looking very nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Gai, how come you're not nervous at all?" Li Yunzhi couldn't help but transmit his voice.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, he had seen Supreme Being Miluo.</p><p></p><p>The former guardian of Great Sorrow City.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I be nervous? If a bunch of cabbage minions came to make trouble for you, would you be nervous?" Wang Gai was very calm, even looking forward to what was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he witnessed Blood Lord's actions that time, he had regarded Blood Lord as the only true god, the Son of Heaven!</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't the Son of Heaven, how could he be so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>"You guy, knowing things but not revealing them to me. If I knew, I wouldn't be so worried." Li Yunzhi was indignant.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Wang Gai knew more than him.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to do anything later, just... follow Supreme Being Yang Hun's example... and suck up." Wang Gai glanced at Supreme Being Yang Hun, seeing that powerful Supreme Being acting like a lapdog.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wang Gai's voice fell, a mysterious and unfathomable aura swept over at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present stopped talking and looked at the blood-robed figure on the city wall, all showing reverent expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Blood Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The voices rolled like thunderclaps.</p><p></p><p>This was much more lively than the sermon on Nine Pan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these people were not as simple as those on Nine Pan Mountain, or harboring evil intentions.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Miluo stood among the crowd, watching hundreds of Supreme Beings pay respects to Qi Yuan, his eyes showing a longing look.</p><p></p><p>He wished that person was himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mood was somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of urgency before doing something big.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Supreme Being Miluo, startling him.</p><p></p><p>He then heard Blood Lord's ethereal voice: "Supreme Being Miluo seems to have something to say but is hesitating. Is there something you want to say?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many thoughts flashed through Supreme Being Miluo's mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... he's been exposed?</p><p></p><p>He forcibly calmed himself and slowly said: "Blood Lord truly lives up to his name, caring for all living beings, preaching to all without taking even a bit in return."</p><p></p><p>He was genuinely praising, though a bit exaggeratedly.</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, I absolutely couldn't do this," Supreme Being Miluo continued.</p><p></p><p>"If it were you, what would you do?" Qi Yuan's eyes held a profound smile.</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, I would definitely have them swear a soul-binding oath before preaching, willing to pass on the teachings only to those who pledge loyalty to me," Supreme Being Miluo spoke his true thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This was probably also the thinking of most Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>So they all found it hard to understand why Blood Lord would preach without conditions.</p><p></p><p>Who knew, upon hearing Supreme Being Miluo's words, Qi Yuan appeared thoughtful: "What you say... seems to make sense. How about... today you all swear a soul-binding oath... pledging loyalty to me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the Earthly Immortals below, a smile curling his lips.</p><p></p><p>The Earthly Immortals below looked at each other, some even terrified.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat seeped from Supreme Being Miluo's palms.</p><p></p><p>If they really swore a soul-binding oath, those hidden among these Earthly Immortals would definitely be exposed.</p><p></p><p>He was very panicked now.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he always had the feeling of being seen through.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan suddenly smiled again: "I'm just joking. What use would I have for your loyalty?"</p><p></p><p>How could loyalty compare to life in importance?</p><p></p><p>"Let the sermon... begin."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so cultivators present had different thoughts in mind, but all focused their gaze on what lay beyond the great door.</p><p></p><p>The divine infant cultivators of the Heaven-Overturning Plan Alliance were shocked to their core. </p><p></p><p>After all, even with so many divine infants, they had been unable to open the door, yet it had truly been broken through.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all standing around for? Let's enter together!" proposed one of the divine infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The other divine infants had wary looks in their eyes. After all, such ruins were full of dangers - even divine infant cultivators could perish. They didn't dare act rashly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look," said Qi Yuan without such worries. His left eyebrow was twitching frantically, indicating there would be great fortune upon entering. He wondered if the benefits and wealth inside would be enough to buy the Gongxing planet.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator glanced over and followed without hesitation. </p><p></p><p>Xie Tang gritted her teeth and quickly went in as well.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other cultivators all started to enter.</p><p></p><p>As they passed through the great door, the world underwent a massive transformation in that instant.</p><p></p><p>The previously cramped cave suddenly opened up into a vast expanse.</p><p></p><p>Starlight poured down upon everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The starry sky?"</p><p></p><p>"This place is actually a starry expanse!"</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators looked up at the sky in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Above the dome of heaven was a vast starry sky.</p><p></p><p>It stretched boundlessly in all directions, with more stars than the eye could take in at once.</p><p></p><p>The stars glittered brilliantly, the Milky Way resplendent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes held a strange look, as if they had stepped into a new world.</p><p></p><p>"So many stars, it's making me hungry," said Qi Yuan, his mouth watering as if "looking at plums to quench thirst."</p><p></p><p>"Could this be another world?"</p><p></p><p>"Why do these stars give such an odd feeling?"</p><p></p><p>These cultivators from the immortal realm all knew that the stars in the sky were reflections of the gods illuminating the myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>Each star represented a deity.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving on Gongxing, they had noticed something strange, but there weren't many stars in the sky so they hadn't paid it much mind.</p><p></p><p>But here... the sky was filled with stars.</p><p></p><p>"This should be a map of the spaceship," Qi Yuan said softly. "It's quite realistic."</p><p></p><p>The starry sky before them was not real, merely a map.</p><p></p><p>"A map?" Some of the divine infants were surprised. As their divine sense spread out, looks of terror appeared on their faces. "This map can actually mislead our judgment!"</p><p></p><p>If a mere map could mislead their judgment into mistaking it for a real starry sky, didn't that mean that if there were other mechanisms or traps, they would be unable to see through them?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, since we've entered, let us part ways here!" At this point, a lone divine infant cultivator spoke up.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he flew off towards the depths of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other divine infants said nothing and dispersed as well.</p><p></p><p>Having entered the ruins, they naturally wanted to go treasure hunting.</p><p></p><p>If they encountered a Sky Eye, it would be a huge windfall.</p><p></p><p>"Which way do you want to go, friend?" the fat cultivator inquired.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang also looked at Qi Yuan, seeming to want his opinion.</p><p></p><p>"The area of these ruins is only average. We're in no rush, let's take our time to appreciate it properly," said Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With his Yang Spirit level of power, almost everything in the spaceship had entered his field of vision as soon as he set foot inside.</p><p></p><p>Though the spaceship looked advanced, it was actually in ruins and broken down, with no power left.</p><p></p><p>All the useful things in the spaceship had long been depleted.</p><p></p><p>All that remained were some bits of scrap metal, along with some "Sky Eyes".</p><p></p><p>As for the planet-destroying cannons and other weapons Qi Yuan had imagined, there were none.</p><p></p><p>"These ruins have quite the reputation, but inside is just a pile of scrap metal," Qi Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang was slightly taken aback: "Has friend been here before?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't, but at a glance I can see there's nothing good besides some junk. If you want to talk about something good, maybe the spaceship itself could count."</p><p></p><p>"The door was so hard to open, yet there's only a pile of junk inside?" The fat cultivator found it strange.</p><p></p><p>"Well, there are only a few thousand Sky Eyes, isn't that junk?" Qi Yuan said offhandedly.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Eyes here were probably just standard weapons for the people on this spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Similar to rifles in a modern army.</p><p></p><p>As for more powerful weapons... there were none.</p><p></p><p>"A few thousand Sky Eyes?" The fat cultivator swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang's breathing quickened, somewhat doubting the truth of Qi Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>However, she didn't leave.</p><p></p><p>When opening the door earlier, she seemed to have sensed a dangerous aura targeting her.</p><p></p><p>"The most valuable thing here should be this wall," said Qi Yuan as he walked towards a corner.</p><p></p><p>In the corner was a wall made of an unknown material, somewhat similar to marble, extremely smooth.</p><p></p><p>Many murals were carved on the stone wall.</p><p></p><p>The others curiously turned their gazes to these murals as well.</p><p></p><p>The first mural was simple - in a futuristic villa, a young man in flowing white robes gazed up at the starry sky, his eyes filled with longing and love.</p><p></p><p>"Based on my perfect score experience in language arts reading comprehension, the first mural shows the protagonist's longing for a woman beyond the starry sky. His clenched fist represents his determination. </p><p></p><p>That's right, he wants to tell his mother that he will set sail tonight to find his love."</p><p></p><p>Back on Earth, reading comprehension in language arts was what Qi Yuan excelled at most.</p><p></p><p>These murals were too simple for him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the second mural.</p><p></p><p>In the mural, a man and woman gazed into each other's eyes amidst the starry sky, with infinite stars as the background.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, they've met. Lovers are finally united."</p><p></p><p>The third mural showed a captivating night scene, with only the woman's silhouette visible in the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"Baby has a misunderstanding, baby is suffering inside, baby doesn't say anything, baby goes home," Qi Yuan interpreted again. "Combined with the previous murals, the man's parents privately approached the woman and gave her a bank card, telling her to leave. I see the man's mother is still quite charming."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao laughed softly: "This plot is so familiar. Is there a car accident or cancer?"</p><p></p><p>"There obviously is... please watch the VCR!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the fourth mural.</p><p></p><p>"Carrying her grievances, the woman returned to her own planet. Oh, this planet seems to be Gongxing. Suddenly one day, a great enemy descended. To protect her homeland, the woman shed blood in the starry sky and died in battle."</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao's expression shifted slightly: "Though my husband's telling is a bit comical, the story itself is quite moving."</p><p></p><p>Setting aside Qi Yuan's storytelling skills, the core of the story was quite touching.</p><p></p><p>After all, dying in battle to protect one's world was worthy of song and praise.</p><p></p><p>Everyone continued to look at the fifth mural.</p><p></p><p>"The theme of this mural is searching. Learning of his love's disappearance, the man piloted his spaceship, traversing the starry sky, wandering the vast cosmos for tens of thousands of years in search. But the universe was too immense - finding his love was harder than searching for a needle in the sea. </p><p></p><p>But as we all know, they will experience several near misses, being right across from each other yet unable to see. In the end, their love moves heaven and earth, and the man finally finds the woman."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Tao's eyes held a wry smile: "What was clearly a romance drama has become a comedy."</p><p></p><p>She looked at the sixth mural.</p><p></p><p>In the sixth mural, the man finds the woman, but sees her on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>"The heroine is surrounded by a great army, on the brink of death. At this critical moment, the hero steps forward and finally holds the heroine in his arms. However, the heroine's life force is already severed."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He took one last look at the male protagonist, shed a tear, and died completely.</p><p></p><p>The joy of reunion turned to sorrow in that moment. The male protagonist's small universe exploded, directly repelling the enemy forces.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tang saw this and had a desolate expression: "What a pitiful pair."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator also sighed with emotion: "There are always some regrets in the world that cannot be smoothed over. </p><p></p><p>I remember before I started cultivating, I confessed to my childhood sweetheart next door. But she said I was too fat, and if I could lose weight from 180 jin to 150 jin in a month, she would be with me.</p><p></p><p>But after a month passed, I weighed 151 jin. In the end, we were fated not to be together, and I've regretted it my whole life."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan nodded: "Your example is indeed similar, with the same core idea.</p><p></p><p>People always have regrets. Isn't seeing each other one last time before dying even more able to tug at the audience's heartstrings?"</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, failing when success is just within reach is the most regrettable.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze turned to the final mural.</p><p></p><p>"The last mural's theme is 'The Watcher'.</p><p></p><p>The man stayed in this world, watching with his own eyes as his lover's world gradually shattered and died.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't bear to see this scene unfold.</p><p></p><p>So he remained alone in this world, guarding her world, like a watcher.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to touch all traces of her, to walk in all her footsteps.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to prevent this world from being destroyed, to resurrect her, to restart this world!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, his voice became passionate and stirring, like giving a speech.</p><p></p><p>Being socially anxious, he had only ever given speeches in text on the Shenhua Society forums.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he had never done this before.</p><p></p><p>Now, with few people here, he took the chance to give a speech.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt his speech was quite effective, even moving himself.</p><p></p><p>If he were a bit more sentimental, he might have shed some tears.</p><p></p><p>However, he still felt a bit emotional, moved by his own words.</p><p></p><p>He decided he wouldn't add chili powder to his braised pork rice tonight.</p><p></p><p>"What a touching... story," Xie Tang said, giving Qi Yuan an odd look.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan hadn't been explaining, their own impressions of the murals would certainly have been much deeper.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's presence had made the murals feel strange.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao also gave Qi Yuan a sidelong glance: "Husband, you've turned this tragic romance into a comedy."</p><p></p><p>"Who says it's a tragic romance? What if it's a political drama, or a crime drama?" Qi Yuan couldn't help but retort, "Don't define it!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, husband has artistic talent, just like those short videos that use humor to explain horror movies," Ning Tao said.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan agreed very much.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Xie Tang seemed to think of something, her expression becoming complex, her eyes filled with deep worry: "If the murals are true, doesn't that mean... this world is about to be destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>Although the paintings had no text or explanation of power systems, it was clear that the male and female protagonists were at least at the Yin God level, or even higher.</p><p></p><p>After all, traversing the starry sky for tens of thousands of years is not something a Purple Palace cultivator could do.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the final scene, restarting the world and resurrecting the female lead is probably beyond even a Yin God's abilities, only possible for a Yang God.</p><p></p><p>"The male protagonist must be in some unknown corner now, fighting a great enemy while preparing to restart the world and resurrect the female lead.</p><p></p><p>We're not Arch Star cultivators. If the world restarts, won't we be restarted as... fertilized eggs?" The fat cultivator looked worried, using trendy Arch Star terminology.</p><p></p><p>"This world has already been restarted once, wait..." Xie Tang seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that before Senior Sister disappeared, she had come to this world, and ended up being restarted as... a fertilized egg?</p><p></p><p>If so, that would be hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>"Although their love story is very moving, touching heaven and earth, it didn't move me, so I think we should leave this world quickly.</p><p></p><p>It's too dangerous here for us Divine Embryo cultivators," the fat cultivator said with concern.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the great enemy the protagonists encountered, just the male lead himself seems like a madman.</p><p></p><p>The type who would say "For you, I'm willing to destroy the three realms."</p><p></p><p>The saying that "when immortals fall in love, the three realms are not at peace" does have some truth to it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan remained calm: "What are you afraid of, it's just the backstory of a game.</p><p></p><p>Besides, friend, have you forgotten? Even if you die, I'll remember you and resurrect you in my Purple Palace."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator was stunned upon hearing this: "You have a point."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan looked at the final mural, his expression enigmatic: "According to this plot setting, hasn't this game already been restarted many times?"</p><p></p><p>The male lead restarts the world to save the female lead.</p><p></p><p>This setup reminded Qi Yuan of Dongjun.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Dongjun had restarted the world many times, but always failed, unable to resurrect his dao companion.</p><p></p><p>Ning Tao narrowed her eyes: "Possibly."</p><p></p><p>"So, does that mean this world... might have a lot of purple qi?" Qi Yuan blinked, his eyes showing some excitement.</p><p></p><p>Purple qi is born at the beginning of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If this world keeps restarting, always following the original trajectory, wouldn't that mean there's a lot of purple qi?</p><p></p><p>But soon, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If purple qi could be exploited like this, wouldn't it mean those powerful Yang Gods would never lack purple qi?</p><p></p><p>And purple qi wouldn't be called the number one qi of the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>However, this world definitely has purple qi.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the TV drama is over, we should start looting."</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan spoke, his divine sense lightly swept out.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, endless data flooded into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the control room."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had already discovered the control room.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xie Tang quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>She was actually feeling a bit anxious, since there might really be a Sky Eye here.</p><p></p><p>If other Divine Embryo cultivators got the Sky Eye and they didn't, Tianxuan Sect's status would certainly decline.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tianxuan Sect was currently in a transitional period, so she needed to collect some foundational treasures.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the four of them appeared outside the control room of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other eight cultivators were also outside the control room.</p><p></p><p>Their faces showed undisguised excitement and elation.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, everyone had gained a lot from looting the ruins.</p><p></p><p>The small spaceship was unobstructed, and they had collected those Sky Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Now gathered outside the control room, their eyes were greedy, mixed with a hint of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Because these eight people had just tried together but failed to open the control room door.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, this door is like the main entrance to the ruins, why can't it be opened?" the elder in the pure red mask muttered, confused.</p><p></p><p>Although four people were missing, that Purple Palace cultivator was still here, and the Purple Palace was the key to opening the door.</p><p></p><p>The others were also confused.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Embryo cultivators of the Overturning Heaven Plan Alliance weren't planning to make their move yet. After all, if there were so many good things outside, wouldn't there be even more treasures inside the control room?</p><p></p><p>"Don't you understand such a simple principle? It's because the big boss - me - hasn't made an entrance yet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said softly, appearing with his arm around Ning Tao, his eyes filled with mirth.</p><p></p><p>"I told you the last door opened because of me, but you didn't believe it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qi Yuan's words, a suspicious look flashed in the eyes of the elder in the pure red mask.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be him?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Qi Yuan, seeming to want to see through Qi Yuan's reliance, but... he appeared utterly ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Could it be he had some other fortuitous encounter that happened to allow him to open the door?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

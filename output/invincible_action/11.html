        <div class="content">
            <p>"Rise." Ying Xiao whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Two things. First, tell Zhang Han that the real Zhao Gao is not dead, and the net is still spread all over the empire, like poison, infiltrating every level of the empire. Tell him to be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Second, I want to establish the Heavenly Punishment, and now I need manpower. Let him first transfer a group of the most elite people from the Shadow Guards to me, ready to obey my orders at any time."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness, the Martial King." The two Shadow Guards nodded and then left.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Ying Xiao directly wanted the most elite people from the Shadow Guards, the Great Executor was shocked in her heart, "Zhang Han's Shadow Guards directly obey Ying Zheng's orders, with imperial permission, controlling the power of life and death of all officials in the Qin Empire. Ying Xiao dares to ask for people without requesting an edict. Is there really such a trusting brotherly relationship between him and Ying Zheng?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Executor, your yin and yang energies have merged into a terrifying fire attribute power. Casually perform a move and let me see." After picking up the wine gourd and taking a sip, Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness, the Martial King."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Great Executor performed the Yin-Yang Merging Qi hand seal and struck out a fire palm in the air.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Xiao closed his eyes and quickly comprehended with the help of the Heaven-Defying Enlightenment System.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has observed the Great Executor's palm strike and comprehended the Flame Blade, Kunlun Scorching Palm, and Sacred Fire Order Divine Skill!]</p><p></p><p>After opening his eyes, Ying Xiao said, "I suppose you have been at the late stage of the Heavenly Human Realm for a long time. Today, I will pass on to you two martial arts and one divine skill, which will help you step into the peak of the Heavenly Human Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Great Executor was startled, and in her heart, she sighed, "Impossible. Just based on my palm strike, with his eyes closed and opened, he created two martial arts and one divine skill that are compatible with me?"</p><p></p><p>With his whole body's internal energy burning like fire, Ying Xiao was already performing the Flame Blade.</p><p></p><p>All his internal energy gathered on his right hand, with raging flames, his palm like a blade. With one slash, all the flowers, plants, and trees in front were cut into ashes under this blade.</p><p></p><p>The Great Executor's beautiful eyes were shocked. This was much more powerful than her Yin-Yang Merging Qi hand seal.</p><p></p><p>"This martial art is called the Flame Blade." Ying Xiao spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>After performing the Flame Blade, the flame internal energy gathered in Ying Xiao's palms again. Ying Xiao leaped high into the air, striking out with both palms. Two scorching palm shadows slammed down, and within a radius of more than a hundred meters, everything collapsed under the scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>"This martial art is called the Kunlun Scorching Palm."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will pass on to you the divine skill's mental method - the Sacred Fire Order Divine Skill!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ying Xiao passed the mental method of the Sacred Fire Order Divine Skill to the Great Executor.</p><p></p><p>Digesting these two martial arts and one divine skill, the shock in the Great Executor's beautiful eyes could no longer be described in words. After a long time, she came back to her senses and bowed to thank Ying Xiao, "Subordinate thanks Your Highness, the Martial King."</p><p></p><p>"When treating my subordinates, I am never stingy." Ying Xiao said with a smile, "Comprehend it well."</p><p></p><p>"Subordinate understands!" The Great Executor spoke heavily, her beautiful eyes moving, already pondering something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although the Young Executor still did not speak, her eyes looking at Ying Xiao had become much more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"Perform your Myriad Leaves Flying Flower Style once." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>With a body like a leaf, the Young Executor was already standing in mid-air, beginning to perform the Myriad Leaves Flying Flower Style.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao also closed his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host has observed the Young Executor's Myriad Leaves Flying Flower Style and comprehended the Plucking Flower Finger, Formless Kalpa Finger, and Longevity Formula.]</p><p></p><p>After opening his eyes, Ying Xiao spoke softly, "Young Executor, your heart is as still as water. Today, I will pass on to you the Plucking Flower Finger and Formless Kalpa Finger, these two martial arts, and the Longevity Formula mental method."</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That night, both the Great Siming and the Lesser Siming were in the midst of their bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the early morning, at an unknown time, the sky began to gradually brighten. A clear bird call also reached Ying Xiao's ears. Ying Xiao, who was stretching under a tree, opened his sleepy eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Camping outdoors really doesn't allow for good rest," Ying Xiao said with a yawn.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a leaf wrapped in internal energy shot out at high speed, coming from the Lesser Siming.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Siming also opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the leaf wrapped in the Lesser Siming's internal energy.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a scream was heard as a masked figure fell down.</p><p></p><p>Chirp!</p><p></p><p>Another bird call sounded as a brown-black nightingale took off from the leaves, trying to quickly leave this place.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming's eyes moved, and the nightingale instantly turned to ashes in the yin-yang flames.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Ying Xiao, who had been lazy, was already in front of the masked person. He lifted the mask and found that the person had already committed suicide by taking poison.</p><p></p><p>"Not one of Luo Wang's people. Whose people could it be?" Ying Xiao muttered.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, it's one of the Nightingale's people," the Great Siming said as he walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Nightingale? Who?" Ying Xiao narrowed his eyes and spoke, his expression solemn. It seemed that many things were more mysterious than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Nightingale is a mysterious organization under Prime Minister Li Si," the Great Siming said with his hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>"Why has this king never heard of Li Si's Nightingale?" Upon hearing it was Li Si's people, Ying Xiao's expression couldn't help but become completely solemn. If he hadn't heard of it, it meant that Ying Zheng probably didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shadow Guards were not as good as Luo Wang, their intelligence capabilities were definitely not bad. Yet they were unaware of this Nightingale.</p><p></p><p>"It is an organization that the Prime Minister has only recently established. Even the Yin-Yang family only found out by chance," the Great Siming said. "It should be because the Prime Minister understands that the control of Luo Wang is no longer in his hands, so he created this Nightingale."</p><p></p><p>"We underestimated this Prime Minister. To think that it's truly not simple. After all, he is the minister who assisted His Majesty in conquering the six states and unifying the world. How could he be simple?" Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, this matter is my negligence for not informing you at the first opportunity," the Great Siming also apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Such a matter must be a secret of the Yin-Yang family. That you can speak of it, this king is grateful and has no time to blame," Ying Xiao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"But what is the purpose of this Nightingale being here?"</p><p></p><p>"To monitor this king? Since Li Si did not inform His Majesty about the Nightingale, it means he does not want His Majesty to know. And monitoring this king is basically equivalent to exposing the Nightingale to the Shadow Guards."</p><p></p><p>"Then, following this line of thought... it is the same purpose as this king's."</p><p></p><p>"Flowing Sand - Wei Zhuang!"</p><p></p><p>"The common people are muddled, the world is in flames. Among the hundred schools of thought, only I move unhindered. The strength of one man is greater than an army of millions. When angry, the feudal lords are afraid; when living in peace, the world is at rest."</p><p></p><p>"These descriptions of Zongheng may be exaggerated, but they are facts."</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Valley's Zongheng is not only highly skilled in martial arts but also proficient in governing the country, commanding troops, strange strategies, selecting talents, the Book of Changes, Eight Trigrams, and the art of Qimen Dunjia. Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Pang Juan, Sun Bin - each of them once led an era."</p><p></p><p>"With such talents, who wouldn't want to bring them under their command?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao's words, the Great Siming also understood where Ying Xiao wanted to go and said softly, "So Your Highness's purpose this time is the Flowing Sand Guard Post."</p><p></p><p>"Great Siming, in your view, what kind of person is Wei Zhuang?" Ying Xiao asked the Great Siming.</p>

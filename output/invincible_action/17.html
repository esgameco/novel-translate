        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"As you wish. It's been a long time since I've had a truly exhilarating run. And it's been a long time since anyone has caught up to me," Dao Zhi said with a cold smile. </p><p></p><p>After a few aerial backflips, the weights on Dao Zhi's feet fell off, smashing deep holes into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"What?" This gave Bai Feng a heavy shock. "This guy..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps things have gotten a bit interesting," Wei Zhuang muttered, his gaze falling on Ying Xiao again. He really wanted to see where Ying Xiao's limits were.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this king has no choice but to get serious," Ying Xiao said, lowering his folded arms, his tone a little grave.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Mo He chamber, Da Tie Chui spoke with satisfaction, "This is the real Xiao Zhi."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Dao Zhi had already used the Electric Light Divine Steps, like a ghost, arriving behind Ying Xiao. He laughed, "Bye bye."</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, under the Ripples Micro Steps, Ying Xiao was even more ghostly than him. With a turn of his body, he had already caught up to Dao Zhi. Leaping up, he delivered a whip kick, kicking Dao Zhi back.</p><p></p><p>"The King of Thieves doesn't seem to be what he's made out to be," Ying Xiao said. "The legendary Electric Light Divine Steps that can ascend knife mountains and descend into seas of fire, is indeed just a legend after all."</p><p></p><p>"This is not the limit of his speed yet," Wei Zhuang murmured, the shark teeth in his hand trembling, eager to compete with Ying Xiao again.</p><p></p><p>In the Mo He chamber, the group was no longer smug. Even Gao Jianli's eyes, calm as ice, darkened. "Such fast speed, and the technique is so strange, making it impossible to see clearly."</p><p></p><p>"I have never seen such footwork," Ban Dashi also said heavily. "A strong feeling that compared to him, Xiao Zhi using the Electric Light Divine Steps is like a child."</p><p></p><p>"How can this Ying Xiao's speed be so fast?" Xue Nü said. "What we Mohists know about him is completely inconsistent with his true self."</p><p></p><p>"Clearly, he has been hiding all along," Gao Jianli said. "However, now is not the time to be shocked by this. Among us, the only one with a chance to get out is Xiao Zhi."</p><p></p><p>"Da Tie Chui, A Xue, let's create an opportunity for Xiao Zhi together."</p><p></p><p>"Alright..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although the smile was still on Dao Zhi's face, an unprecedented seriousness emerged in the depths of his eyes. </p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had lost in speed, and he had lost thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>Circulating all his internal energy to his legs, he prepared for a final struggle.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sound of a flute rose, and the water vapor above the Mo Gui Pool condensed into snow, slowly falling.</p><p></p><p>"White snow!" Chi Lian whispered, about to take action.</p><p></p><p>"No need..." Wei Zhuang said softly.</p><p></p><p>The white snow seemed to fall scattered, but was in fact very concentrated. Like a dream, it all fell on Ying Xiao's body. The cold internal energy directly entered Ying Xiao's meridians. Xue Nü descended with the white snow from above, dancing gracefully like a fairy, a dance skimming over the waves and flying swallows, making Ying Xiao sink into infatuation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, ice spread across the ground. </p><p></p><p>Yi Shui Han!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ying Xiao was completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>Thunder echoed and storms swept. Dao Zhi was already on Da Tie Chui's Thunder God Hammer, using Da Tie Chui's power to push the Electric Light Divine Steps to an unprecedented extreme.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, the entire Mo Gui Pool turned solemn. In an instant, everyone, including Wei Zhuang, only felt themselves in the midst of thousands of sword shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Return of the Myriad Swords!"</p><p></p><p>A faint voice echoed from within the ice, and sword energy surged like the tide. This place had already become the domain of the sword.</p><p></p><p>The ice shattered, and sword energy burst forth. Whether it was the Snow Woman, Gao Jianli, the Great Iron Hammer, or Dao Zhi, they all fell to the ground, remaining in whatever position they landed, not daring to move an inch. Because at every point around their bodies, there were swords formed from condensed internal energy.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Chi Lian was shocked. "His incomparably slow sword strike still wasn't his strongest."</p><p></p><p>"This is a true swordsman." Wei Zhuang's blood was boiling. "No sword can defeat the sword..."</p><p></p><p>"Wu Wang Ying Xiao is actually this powerful." In the secret chamber of Mo He, Elder Ban directly collapsed to the ground, instantly drenched in sweat. "What's going on? He actually hid his strength so deeply."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have no way to go out and call for help, but it doesn't matter. Someone is coming," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent of the sword!</p><p></p><p>As Ying Xiao's words fell, everyone in the Mo Gui Pool felt another terrifying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Gai Nie, it's Gai Nie..." Elder Ban instantly recovered with full vigor, excitedly shouting, "Master Gai has come. The Mo Family is saved."</p><p></p><p>"He's finally here." The corners of Wei Zhuang's mouth curled into a long-awaited smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei Zhuang, from now on, this is your stage." Ying Xiao smiled. "I hope Master Wei Zhuang won't disappoint me, because I am very much looking forward to Master Wei Zhuang becoming the true leader of Ghost Valley."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness Wu Wang can just wait and see," Wei Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then I shall wait and see." Ying Xiao spoke calmly, then swept his gaze over everyone present. "No one is allowed to interfere in the upcoming battle. If anyone interferes, they will become my enemy."</p><p></p><p>Feeling Ying Xiao's killing intent, the many assassins of Flowing Sand slowly retreated. Gao Jianli and the others also retreated.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps echoed as the gleam of the Yuan Hong sword arrived first.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Zhuang, long time no see!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>The Shark Tooth sword was also unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness Wu Wang..." After greeting Wei Zhuang, Gai Nie also looked towards Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gai, we can reminisce after you battle me. I just hope Master Gai can live until then." Ying Xiao nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, two sword energies instantly erupted. Wei Zhuang's was horizontal, Gai Nie's was vertical. The crisscrossing sword energy submerged the entire Mo Gui Pool at that moment, forcing everyone to circulate their internal energy to resist.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Zhuang, draw your sword!" Gai Nie spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"I hope your sword still won't disappoint me." Wei Zhuang responded. The Shark Tooth sword sparked fiercely on the ground as his entire body charged forward, approaching Gai Nie. Raising his sword, it was the most domineering strike.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie condensed his internal energy. The Yuan Hong sword in his hand was nimble and agile, easily resolving Wei Zhuang's first strike.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p></p><p>Like lightning and flint!</p><p></p><p>Figures intertwined!</p><p></p><p>Internal energies collided!</p><p></p><p>Within a few seconds, the two had already exchanged several dozen moves.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Zhuang, you've indeed become stronger." Gai Nie spoke heavily, his expression solemn. From the first sword strike, he could see that Wei Zhuang's horizontal sword art was no longer the same as before.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure if it was an illusion, but he believed Wei Zhuang's horizontal sword art had even surpassed that of their master, Ghost Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, unfortunately your sword is still so hesitant and timid." Wei Zhuang responded. As he spoke, the Shark Tooth sword energy suddenly changed. Wei Zhuang had used the vertical sword art.</p><p></p><p>The horizontal and vertical sword arts, unique to one person. With just two swords, Wei Zhuang had suppressed Gai Nie.</p>

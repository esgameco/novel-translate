        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Dan became serious. üê§üíù‚ùªÔºô≈úÂçÑœÖ–ñ.‚ÑÇ„Ññ–º‚ô§‚ôü</p><p></p><p>Having learned of Li Si's ambition, Yan Dan quickly made his own decision in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He truly decided to join forces with Li Si.</p><p></p><p>The failure in the Ink Pond told him that relying solely on the Mohist alliance with the so-called hundred schools of thought could never make them a match against Ying Zheng and Ying Xiao, because what Ying Zheng and Ying Xiao controlled was a vast empire. No matter how formidable the Mohists and the hundred schools were, they were only part of this empire.  </p><p></p><p>Like a tiny shrimp trying to shake a tree, how could they shake such a mighty empire, unless the tree itself was already a rotten husk?</p><p></p><p>Since Li Si wanted to become a powerful minister like L√º Buwei, it meant he would no longer be loyal to the empire. Yan Dan could then make use of Li Si, eliminating obstacles on one side while consuming the empire's internal strength on the other side, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>"Since Prince Dan agrees with what I said, may I know the inside story of the Mohists?" Li Si took another sip of tea, narrowed his eyes slightly and spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Having made his decision, Yan Dan no longer hesitated, saying softly, "Sir Li, the true Mohists do not exist in this world, and the true Mechanical City is also not visible to the world."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Si was instantly shocked in his heart. His nightingales had indeed found out that the Mohists were unusual, but he had not expected them to be this extraordinary. The true Mohists and Mechanical City had yet to appear in this world - for him, the Chancellor, this was beyond exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Li Si could not help but take another sip of tea, his heart pounding as he thought, "Indeed, compared to these schools that have been passed down for hundreds of years, my nightingales are still too immature, too green."</p><p></p><p>"For me to accomplish what I want, I must use these hundred schools as my blade."</p><p></p><p>"I wish to hear more!" Li Si said softly as he gently put down his teacup.</p><p></p><p>"Does Sir Li know of the legendary ultimate weapon of the Mohists - the Non-Combatant?" Yan Dan chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know. It is said to be a mysterious weapon with many transformations," Li Si nodded slightly. "It is even said that this weapon can overpower all other weapons in the world."</p><p></p><p>"The Non-Combatant is just one of the ten branches of Mohism, and the true masters of even this weakest branch have yet to appear in this world," Yan Dan said, his eyes that had witnessed vicissitudes and death showing a hint of pride for the first time in front of Li Si.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Non-Combatant branch is the weakest of the ten branches of Mohism."</p><p></p><p>"What..." Upon hearing this from Yan Dan, even Li Si could no longer remain calm and composed, crying out in great shock.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Si's loss of composure, Yan Dan's expression became even more proud. "Sir Li, with such Mohists, can you now be at ease about the matter of assassinating King Wu Ying Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Si was after all a veteran who had been through many storms. He quickly regained his calm and smiled, "It seems that finding you, Prince Dan, is the most correct choice I have made in my life."</p><p></p><p>"No, meeting Sir Li is my honor," Yan Dan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Li Si also laughed, then pointed at the tea on the table and said with a laugh, "This tea is the premium Heavenly Palace Cloud and Mist Green Tea from Mount Emei, a top-grade tea bestowed by His Majesty. Indeed, only fine tea can attract distinguished guests."</p><p></p><p>"Sir Li, but first there must be a gracious host, then fine tea, and finally distinguished guests," Yan Dan replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>With that, the tea was finished, and Yan Dan left.</p><p></p><p>After Yan Dan's departure, a young man with an appearance very similar to Li Si came into the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"You Er, did you hear every word of my conversation with Yan Dan?" Li Si's previously calm expression gradually became ferocious as he hissed the question.</p><p></p><p>"Father, not a single word missed," the young man replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li You cupped his hands and said, "Then what are your thoughts?"</p><p>Li Si asked in a solemn voice, "Son, compared to the various philosophical schools, our Li family is simply worlds apart from them."</p><p>Li You said, "The path for our Li family is still very far."</p><p></p><p>"However, since we have already embarked on this path, there is no turning back. Now that we have reached this peak, if we turn back, it will mean utter destruction. We can only continue climbing upwards."</p><p></p><p>Li Si stood up straight, his aura exuding the might of being the sole ruler over the millions in the Qin Empire.</p><p></p><p>"Father, it seems Yandan may have done this intentionally. Perhaps his people noticed Yejing long ago, and he has been waiting for Yejing. It appears you found him, but in reality, he was looking for you," Li You said.</p><p></p><p>"For him to succeed, there is only one way - through your hands, Father."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Father, you and him..."</p><p></p><p>"Son, it doesn't matter who found who or who is using who. What's important in this game is who is the one holding the chess pieces," Li Si said.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what truly determines the outcome on the chessboard always lies outside the board itself."</p><p></p><p>"Son, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Father, your son understands. Since the old Yejing is already on the chessboard, we need a new Yejing to influence the outcome," Li You replied.</p><p></p><p>"Great rewards will surely attract brave men!" Li Si continued.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured Father, the new Yejing will definitely be a new Yejing, and will absolutely not remind you of the old Yejing." Li You nodded and then also left the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Li Si slowly raised his head, muttering to himself, "After His Majesty, in this empire, who will be the hunter? Who will be the prey?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Chancellor's residence and leaving Xianyang, Yandan walked alone through the woods. He unsheathed his sword Moyao and confidently laughed, "This is the true unsheathing of Moyao. This is the true emergence of the Mo family into the world."</p><p></p><p>"Using the blood of the Martial King of Qin to consecrate this emergence, that is an honor for the Martial King of Qin, don't you think, Xingxiao..."</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of years spent honing this sword. Though it appears edgeless, it is in fact supremely sharp."</p><p></p><p>"In this realm, there are ultimately only two roles - the hunter and the prey. I, Yandan, will become the hunter, the sole hunter. Xingzheng, you have been the hunter for far too long."</p><p></p><p>Sheathing Moyao, Yandan's figure gradually disappeared into the woods.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the broad road, Xingxiao and the ladies galloped on horseback, having already reached the sandy dunes.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Princess Chilian's horse drew near Xingxiao, and she slowly spoke, "Your Highness, do you think the King Cobra is the most formidable predator?"</p><p></p><p>"Princess Honglin, why do you ask this?" Xingxiao asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>"When hunting, the King Cobra only devotes one part of its attention to its prey. The other eleven parts are focused on watching the sky above," Chilian explained.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. The old Yejing nest is the prey, and we are the King Cobra. But there is bound to be a falcon lurking above," Chilian said this, and Xingxiao naturally understood her meaning. He slowly raised his head and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness is indeed correct. It was too easy for us to find the old Yejing nest," the Grand Astrologer also said. "Mengyimou's men from the Celestial Punishment Bureau used to be shadow guards. For so many years, they failed to notice Yejing's existence. Yet in less than half a month, they have already found the old Yejing nest."</p>

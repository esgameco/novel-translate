        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"An assassin! No matter how top-notch, in the end he is just an assassin." Ying Xiao said, "But in my eyes, he is the same kind of person as Pang Juan. No, perhaps he will surpass Pang Juan."</p><p></p><p>"After the Qin extinguished the six states, the edge of those generals has dimmed too much. The empire now needs new generals. Meng Tian counts as one, Zhang Han counts as one, but they are not domineering enough. At least in my eyes, not domineering enough."</p><p></p><p>"Being domineering can help the Qin expand its territory - the Xiongnu to the north, the Baiyue to the south, and the Qiang to the southwest."</p><p></p><p>"Wei Zhuang has this domineering quality!"</p><p></p><p>"And this is the true Guiguzi's art of diplomacy."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu, Pang Juan ultimately failed. And being too domineering, wouldn't he be difficult to control?" The Grand Minister said.</p><p></p><p>"Did Pang Juan fail? I don't think he failed, he just didn't meet a wise ruler. That self-proclaimed King of Wei, King Wei Hui, humph, I can't be bothered to comment on him." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"As for being domineering, no matter how domineering, it is only the domineering quality of a general."</p><p></p><p>"So... day has broken, let's go. It's about time, follow me to meet this master of Flowing Sands."</p><p></p><p>Dust stirred up as the three fine horses disappeared from here.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the maple forest, slightly yellowed maple leaves fluttered down like hands, adding a desolate air to this bleak place. </p><p></p><p>Hiss hiss hiss~!</p><p></p><p>Under the maple leaves, hissing sounds arose. At some point, dazzling scarlet poisonous snakes had surrounded Ying Xiao and the other two.</p><p></p><p>"Princess Hong Lian, greeting guests in such a way is not very polite." Ying Xiao said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh heh..."</p><p></p><p>A charming laughter rang out. Not far ahead in the maple trees, a giant scarlet python descended. A voluptuous woman wearing a fiery red dress and with a bewitching appearance alighted from the python's back. She sat alluringly on a tree branch before lightly leaping down.</p><p></p><p>"The Han state no longer exists. Prince Wu, you are clearer on this point than me. So here there is only Chi Lian of Flowing Sands, no princess." Chi Lian spoke charmingly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a form of address, does Princess Hong Lian mind so much?" Ying Xiao said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>In his heart he also sighed, "Indeed a peerless beauty."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian slowly descended and spoke charmingly, "Prince Wu, you and the two great beauties beside you must follow closely, because the forest here devours people, even if these two great beauties are the two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Much thanks." Ying Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Under Chi Lian's lead, Ying Xiao soon saw Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Wearing splendid robes, with white hair, eyes closed on a broken stone seat.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Wei Zhuang opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Shark Tooth sword beside him trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu of the Qin... this title is very interesting..." A heavy yet domineering voice rang out. A breeze came, causing a strand of hair on the side of Ying Xiao's face to flutter. Wei Zhuang had already appeared in front of Ying Xiao, the Shark Tooth sword heavily descending.</p><p></p><p>In Ying Xiao's hand, the Tianwen sword had long left its sheath, horizontally blocking in front.</p><p></p><p>"Mister Wei Zhuang, isn't this way of greeting a bit too rude." Ying Xiao said softly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Zhuang's inner force completely erupted, demonic sword light flashing from the Shark Tooth.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Mister Wei Zhuang really wants to find out if the Tianwen sword is qualified to rank first. So be it. Since I am the guest, I'll let the host have his way." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his inner force also instantly surged, the sword light of Tianwen immediately replacing the demonic sword light.</p><p></p><p>"The Zonghen sword art, unparalleled in the world. Mister Wei Zhuang, I also really want to experience it."</p><p></p><p>In a flash of lightning...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the midst of their battle, Ying Xiao and Wei Zhuang had already exchanged several dozen moves.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang grew more and more excited as the fight went on. </p><p></p><p>"The title of Martial King is well-deserved indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"Crossing the Eight Directions!" </p><p></p><p>At the pinnacle of his sword technique, Crossing the Eight Directions was already in Ying Xiao's sight.</p><p></p><p>An extremely domineering sword move!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the most domineering sword move in the martial world.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Chi!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to Wei Zhuang's domineering style, Ying Xiao's sword technique instantly became gentle and subdued, swinging the Heavenly Question sword extremely slowly.  </p><p></p><p>"It is an incomparably slow sword move, but also an inscrutable one." The Great Commander focused all his energy and spirit to observe, but unfortunately, even though he had cultivated the Sacred Fire Order Divine Skill, he was still unable to see through the subtleties of Tai Chi.</p><p></p><p>Because, under the enlightenment of Ying Xiao's heaven-defying comprehension system, this Tai Chi had already far surpassed Zhang Sanfeng's Tai Chi.</p><p></p><p>Under the Tai Chi sword move, Wei Zhuang's domineering Crossing the Eight Directions vanished without a trace. In Wei Zhuang's eyes, the Heavenly Question sword was incomparably slow, yet in an instant it arrived at Wei Zhuang's neck.</p><p></p><p>The two stopped their hands at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even someone as strong as Wei Zhuang is still no match for Your Highness the Martial King. Perhaps because this is not a life-or-death battle, Wei Zhuang did not continue to counterattack, but even if Wei Zhuang had continued to counterattack, the result would have been the same." The Great Commander said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Wei Zhuang also did not continue his sword attack precisely because he saw this point."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was already stunned.</p><p></p><p>With just one sword move, the man who was like a god in her heart had been defeated.</p><p></p><p>In her mind, it had always been Wei Zhuang killing people with a single sword move. She had never seen a scene like this before.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's expression remained unchanged, but his heart was already surging with shock. In the martial world, there was only one person he cared about in terms of swordsmanship. That person was known as the Sword Saint, and besides him, there were no other swords in Wei Zhuang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Today, such a sword had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was a very powerful sword.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he considered his own swordsmanship to have reached the pinnacle, but at this moment, his sword was like a child's. That deep sense of powerlessness, he had only experienced it when facing that person when he first entered the Ghost Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Chi..." Wei Zhuang slowly raised his eyes and repeated.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing the Eight Directions, unparalleled in its domineering power. Seeing it today, it lives up to its reputation." Ying Xiao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"With Your Highness the Martial King possessing such skill, why come to Flowing Sands?" Wei Zhuang slowly turned around, with shark teeth erected in front of him, and asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"A deal!" Ying Xiao said, "And also, to appoint generals and confer titles."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the mention of appointing generals and conferring titles, a hint of peculiarity flashed through Wei Zhuang's eyes, but it instantly returned to normal. He responded, "Your Highness the Martial King, deals and benefits, Flowing Sands has never refused. Hmph, as for appointing generals and conferring titles, those are just clich√©d words."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's talk about the deal first!" Ying Xiao said with a smile, "A name, Gai Nie."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint, Gai Nie..." Wei Zhuang turned around, "A name that brings back memories. Is this Your Highness the Martial King's purpose in coming here?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just one of the purposes." Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"That child, who is he?" Wei Zhuang asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei Zhuang indeed knows a lot, befitting the master of Flowing Sands." Ying Xiao spoke softly, "However, that child was only the empire's target in the past. After this king took over the martial world, he is no longer a target."</p><p></p><p>"How can the fate of the empire be controlled by a child."</p><p></p><p>"If Master Wei Zhuang wants to know who that child is, this king can inform you. He is Jing Ke's son, afflicted with the Yin-Yang Sect's Six Soul Terror Curse, and the true secret on his body is called the Azure Dragon Seven Constellations."</p><p></p><p>"As for what the Azure Dragon Seven Constellations are, this king does not know, nor does he wish to find out. If Master Wei Zhuang is interested, you can explore it yourself."</p>

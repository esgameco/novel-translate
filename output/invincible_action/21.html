        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Whether your tone is arrogant or not, the current reality is that you Mohists are prisoners." Ying Xiaosmiled and said, "Isn't that right? Moreover, with my level of power, dominating this realm should be no problem, right?"</p><p></p><p>This time, Yan Dan didn't speak, and the other Mohists also remained silent. </p><p></p><p>Gai Nie, Wei Zhuang, and Xiaoyao Zi likewise said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you admit it," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, Prince Wu," Yan Dan said calmly. "But so what? Even if all of us Mohists become prisoners, the Mohist school will not perish."</p><p></p><p>"I know your Mohist disciples are numerous," Ying Xiao said. "I can also tell you, it's precisely because of this that I truly cannot kill you all."</p><p></p><p>"However, Yan Dan, believe me, it won't be long before within the Great Qin, no one will remember the former Yan state or the other five former states. Under heaven, only the Great Qin will remain."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu, do you think that's possible?" Yan Dan laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, why not? Don't talk about the future, even now, who remembers your Yan state?" Ying Xiao laughed. "It seems apart from you former Yan aristocrats and the former aristocrats of the other five states, there's no one else, right?"</p><p></p><p>"In the former Yan lands, those commoners seem to be living even better lives than before."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'brutal Qin' that you speak of is only because my Great Qin iron cavalry overthrew the rule of you aristocrats."</p><p></p><p>"Yan Dan, the question I want to ask you is, what is 'all under heaven'?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know?"</p><p></p><p>"I know," Yan Dan said heavily. "Inclusive love, non-aggression..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, inclusive love, non-aggression, utterly ridiculous..." Ying Xiao said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Your resistance is only because you cannot bear to lose your rights and wealth. You keep claiming it's for the people under heaven, which is utter nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"Yan Dan, let me ask you, why was the Yan state destroyed? Was it because the Great Qin was powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"No, in the Yan state, the king was not a true king but incompetent and useless. The officials were not true officials, only knowing how to accumulate wealth by oppressing the people. In the court there was corruption, and among the people resentment."</p><p></p><p>"Is that not so?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao's words, Yan Dan's expression changed, and for a moment he didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ying Xiao turned his gaze to Da Tiechuiand said, "Da Tiechui, you used to be in the Yan army. Why did your brothers die? Was it because of my Great Qin iron cavalry? Or was it not because no one came to rescue them? Was it not because your king abandoned you?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Da Tiechui wanted to say something, but found he had no words.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao then looked at Gao Jianlian and Xue Nu. "You two, why did you rebel against the Yan state before its fall? Was it not because of that Yan Chunjun? Tell me, under the law of my Great Qin, are there still people like Yan Chunjun left in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianlian and Xue Nu also had no response.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Dan, to you, what is 'all under heaven'? It's just the power in your hands, isn't it?" Ying Xiao said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Then Ying Xiao's gaze fell on Wei Zhuang. "Master Wei Zhuang, why do you think the Han state was destroyed?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao continued, "Han Fei was an immensely talented strategist, and even the son of the Han king. But in the end? The great Han state became nothing more than a pleasure garden for Ji Wuye and the Four Ruffians to accumulate wealth and indulge in killing for entertainment."</p><p></p><p>"Countless Han refugees fled to my Great Qin. Was the downfall of the Han state my Great Qin's fault?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Wei Zhuang, what do you think?</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoβs gaze fell once again on Yan Dan. He said coldly, βThe battle between the seven nations has raged for over two hundred years, with countless deaths. Yet you donβt speak of it being for the people under heaven?β</p><p></p><p>βMy great Qin has only been at war for a mere ten years, yet you all come out claiming itβs for the people under heaven.β</p><p></p><p>βYan Dan, when your granduncle Yan Chunjun was acting arrogantly in the Yan state, why didnβt you send assassins to kill him? Tell me, why not? Was he not brutal and murderous enough towards the innocent?β  </p><p></p><p>βGao Jianli, Xue NΓ¼, tell me, how many upright women did Yan Chunjun kill in the Yan state? Back then, why didnβt your crown prince send Jing Ke to assassinate him?β</p><p></p><p>βCome, tell me...β</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Mohists and people of Yan could only lower their heads.</p><p></p><p>βRevive the nation? You, Yan Dan, are qualified for that?β</p><p></p><p>βTell me, what qualifies you to revive the nation?β</p><p></p><p>βWhat you want to revive is only the power and wealth of your royal nobles.β</p><p></p><p>βDo you really care about the life and death of the commoners?β</p><p></p><p>βHeaven is fair. Was my great Qin powerful from the start? The former Qin was almost divided by the six nations.β</p><p></p><p>βYan Dan, why was it not your Yan state that unified all under heaven, but my great Qin?β</p><p></p><p>βYan Dan, why was my great Qin able to have a population rivaling the combined six nations before unifying them? And why did refugees from the six nations continually pour into my Qin lands?β</p><p></p><p>βSurely you know, you simply cannot accept losing your position as crown prince.β  </p><p></p><p>βYou nobles of the six nations acted arrogantly every day, oppressing the people and amassing wealth and power. Now that you have been overthrown, you blame my great Qin for being tyrannical.β</p><p></p><p>βNow that all under heaven has been unified for ten years, in this decade, other than suppressing the rabble like you, has my Qin cavalry ever oppressed a single commoner on Qin lands?β</p><p></p><p>βSince you claim to be for the people, then why don't you so-called chivalrous heroes go deal with the Xiongnu invading from the north, the Baiyue rebels in the south, and the barbaric tribes pillaging in the southwest?β</p><p></p><p>βWhy don't you Mohists take your so-called 'inclusive love and non-aggression' to stop the wars?β</p><p></p><p>With a thud, at this moment Yan Dan knelt down, his face contorted, drenched in sweat, staring at Ying Xiao wanting to say something but unable to open his mouth.</p><p></p><p>βWhat is 'all under heaven', Yan Dan? Let me tell you, everything the emperor does is for all under heaven.β</p><p></p><p>βYou haven't forgotten Jing Ke, have you?β </p><p></p><p>βInside the Xianyang Palace, he unleashed his ultimate fatal strike. Under that strike, no one could survive. Yet why did the emperor live? Because Jing Ke knew what 'all under heaven' meant. Master Gai, you understand this point, don't you?β</p><p></p><p>βI understand,β Gai Nie nodded.</p><p></p><p>βMaster Gai, from now on that child is a subject of Qin. Within Qin lands, he can go anywhere, unless he himself refuses to acknowledge being a Qin subject,β Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>βThank you, Prince Wu,β Gai Nie bowed deeply in gratitude to Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>βEnough, Yan Dan. From this day forth, you people will remain in this so-called paradise of yours,β Ying Xiao said. βI will let you see what 'all under heaven' truly means.β</p><p></p><p>βNo one will remember the tattered remnants of the Yan state.β</p><p></p><p>βI also advise you not to try leaving here, otherwise you will see blood. I do not wish to kill, but that does not mean I won't kill.β</p><p></p><p>βMaster Xiaoyao,β Ying Xiao ignored the Mohists and looked at Zhuangzi. βI want to know about this philosophy of yours, the School of Naturalists.β</p>

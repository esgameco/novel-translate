        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It's really not that impressive..." Ying Xiaoyun muttered. </p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the aura around Ying Xiaoyun became even more powerful than before. The Tian Wen Sword's edge flickered, cutting through Xing Hun's gathered energy blade, then quickly turned back, heading straight for Xing Hun's throat.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Xing Hun turned deathly pale in shock. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't believe his corpse demon curse had actually failed.</p><p></p><p>He had no time to think further, and could only gather energy into a blade on his right arm to block Ying Xiaoyun's sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Ssshhh!</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered as Xing Hun's right arm was sliced off, flying into the air.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh..."</p><p></p><p>A miserable scream rang out. Xing Hun's aura instantly withered, his yin-yang inner force leaking out unceasingly. For Ying Xiaoyun, it would only take one more sword strike.</p><p></p><p>However, Xing Hun's combat experience was truly abundant. In that critical moment of losing his arm, he still managed to use the recoiling force to increase the distance between him and Ying Xiaoyun.</p><p></p><p>He then gathered energy again to stop the bleeding from his severed arm wound.  </p><p></p><p>"Why?" Xing Hun hissed.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoyun didn't bother answering. He unleashed the Zong Yun Ti skill as the Nine Lone Swords entered a frenzied state.</p><p></p><p>The reason Ying Xiaoyun could quickly dispel the corpse demon curse was naturally due to the Bai Du Zhen Jing scripture.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the frenzied Nine Lone Swords, Xing Hun realized he had to use his trump card, otherwise he would surely lose his life here today.</p><p></p><p>His remaining hand swiftly formed yin-yang hand seals, carving out a yin-yang talisman that he imprinted onto his own head.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Tian Wen Sword reached him, he actually pinched the sword tip between his fingers. His immense yin-yang inner force shook Ying Xiaoyun, causing internal injuries that made him cough up a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>Then with a flick of his fingers, a force many times Ying Xiaoyun's own power rebounded back onto him.</p><p></p><p>Step step step!</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoyun was forced back over ten steps.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Wen Sword twisted and screeched incessantly. If it were any other sword, even the Yuanhong, it would have shattered by now.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Yang Divine Skill!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoyun immediately activated the Nine Yang Divine Skill for healing.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he unleashed the Rulai Divine Palm's Wanfo Chaozong stance, as Xing Hun had already attacked again, his Hun Xi Long You coalescing into a palm strike aimed at Ying Xiaoyun's Tianling Gai.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The power of Xing Hun's current Hun Xi Long You palm was dozens of times stronger than before, easily shattering the Wanfo Chaozong empowered by the Nine Yang Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of yin-yang technique is this, that can increase the one-armed Xing Hun's battle power to such a terrifying level?" Ying Xiaoyun was utterly shaken. With no choice, he unleashed the final stance of the Rulai Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>"Rulai Nirvana!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoyun was like being reborn from nirvana, the golden Rulai figure re-blooming. He managed to turn the tide, shattering Xing Hun's palm strike. However, he only shattered it and did not actually injure Xing Hun.</p><p></p><p>"Well done, Prince Wuwang...We shall meet again." With a ferocious cry, Xing Hun chose not to continue fighting and swiftly left.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiaoyun did not give chase, firstly because although he managed to turn the tide, it was a pyrrhic victory and his internal injuries were severe. Secondly, the saying goes "never pursue a desperate enemy" - with Xing Hun's yin-yang technique, he may have even stronger yin-yang arts that could destroy them both.</p><p></p><p>After Xing Hun left, Da Si Ming and Shao Si Ming immediately came to Ying Xiaoyun's side.</p><p></p><p>"Prince, are you alright?" Da Si Ming asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, but do you know what yin-yang technique that was?" Ying Xiaoyun asked heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Prince, if I'm not mistaken, it was one of the highest yin-yang arts - the Celestial Talisman Technique," Da Si Ming said. "The Ancestral Emperor once taught it to us, but unfortunately we could never comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"That level of yin-yang technique."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Xing Hun to actually learn it."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Talisman Technique!" Ying Xiao murmured, closing his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this familiar scene, Da Si Ming couldn't help but be shaken, saying gravely, "Your Highness, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Everything was just as Da Si Ming had imagined - Ying Xiao was comprehending this so-called Immortal Talisman Technique.</p><p></p><p>*Ding! The host saw Xing Hun use the Immortal Talisman Technique and comprehended the Immortal Technique!*</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes, Ying Xiao said lightly, "So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, you really comprehended it?" Da Si Ming still didn't quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, once I recover, I will teach it to you," Ying Xiao nodded. "Rest assured, what I comprehended is straightforward and even stronger than Xing Hun's version."</p><p></p><p>Da Si Ming was overjoyed, and Shao Si Ming also eagerly anticipated it.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Ying Xiao began recovering here. </p><p></p><p>It only took half an hour for Ying Xiao to fully recover.</p><p></p><p>"Gong Shu Chou, take those two children to the Moist Kin's city first and hand them over to the Moist Kin people..." Ying Xiao instructed Gong Shu Chou.</p><p></p><p>"No, there is no more Moist Kin, only my Celestial Punishment now," he corrected himself.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gong Shu Chou's expression instantly turned one of shock, thinking to himself in disbelief, "How is that possible? The Crown Prince actually subjugated that stubborn Moist Kin group?"</p><p></p><p>His Gong Shu family had fought the Moist Kin for hundreds of years, so he was all too familiar with their uncompromising nature.</p><p></p><p>They were a group that could be defeated or killed, but never subjugated.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Emperor, this Crown Prince is truly peerless and unmatched. No wonder the Emperor entrusted all martial affairs to the Crown Prince," Gong Shu Chou was shaken to the core.</p><p></p><p>"If even the Moist Kin could be subjugated, then this realm is indeed ruled by the Crown Prince."</p><p></p><p>After Gong Shu Chou left, Ying Xiao immediately began teaching Da Si Ming and Shao Si Ming the Immortal Technique.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Immortal Talisman Technique uses yin-yang inner energy to inscribe unique talismans. The human body inherently contains yin and yang energies, which are the roots of yin-yang inner energy. But normally, almost no one can activate these yin and yang energies, only using them to derive yin-yang inner energy," Ying Xiao explained.</p><p></p><p>Da Si Ming immediately understood the key point, saying, "Your Highness, I understand. Those unique inscribed talismans allow one to truly activate the yin and yang energies within the body."</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang energies are the true power of the yin-yang way."</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Ying Xiao nodded. "However, those unique talismans are profoundly abstruse and complex. Unless you are a paramount genius in the yin-yang way, it is impossible to inscribe them."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if you can inscribe them, more often than not they end up as wasted talismans. This is also related to all the meridians in the body."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder..." Da Si Ming said heavily. "Xing Hun, as expected of a yin-yang genius born once in a century. It's no wonder he became a Protector at such a young age and was highly regarded by the Eastern Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, if Xing Hun had use of both hands from the start and unleashed this Immortal Talisman Technique in full force attack, not only would I have lost today, I very likely could have been killed," Ying Xiao said gravely as well.  </p><p></p><p>"Da Si Ming, your Yin-Yang Sect is no simple matter."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, my apologies. Although I am an elder of the Yin-Yang Sect, I truly know very little about the sect's core or the Eastern Emperor," Da Si Ming quickly apologized.</p>

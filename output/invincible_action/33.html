        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Your Highness, leave it to us." The Grand Scribe smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Duanmu, Lady Xuenu, perhaps you two have not yet witnessed the dark and bloody side of a world. This time, you shall see it," Xing Xiao spoke to Duanmu Rong and Xuenu alone. </p><p></p><p>"A world can never be perfect. Where there are gains, there are losses. Where there is life, there is death. Where there is light, darkness is destined to exist. No matter the era or the new realm, bloodshed and filth are inevitable."</p><p></p><p>"If you want the realm in your heart, then you must be able to bear the corresponding bloodshed and filth."</p><p></p><p>"We understand, Your Highness," the two women nodded deeply.</p><p></p><p>After the Grand Scribe's four ladies and Meng Yi's heavenly punishers left, Xing Xiao immediately led Chi Lian to the Night Nightingale's nest.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the desolate dune area became even more desolate. The desert wind blew, withered grass drifted about, accompanied by the smell of blood. Under the sand, white bones gradually emerged, an ominous aura of massacre lingering.  </p><p></p><p>Black scorpions, venomous insects...scurried between the sand and bones, as if reflecting the past scene of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"This place was indeed a battlefield, but after so many years, the so-called smell of blood should have disappeared," said Chi Lian, her jade hands on her slender waist, standing gracefully beside Xing Xiao on a dune.</p><p></p><p>"Yet the smell of blood in this desert wind is so fresh."</p><p></p><p>"Li Si once controlled the Luo Wang. He knows better than anyone about Luo Wang's bloody killing training," said Xing Xiao. "In order to catch up with Luo Wang, he would have spared no excessive efforts for the Night Nightingales."</p><p></p><p>Chirp!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a call attracted Xing Xiao and Chi Lian's attention.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the wind and sand, a nightingale bird flew swiftly forward.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the venomous insects and black scorpions in the sand and bones, this may be the only living creature here," said Chi Lian. "And this, could it mean the Night Nightingales have discovered us?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps it is here to guide us," said Xing Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"That would be convenient, saving us some time," said Xing Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed..." Chi Lian smiled, and immediately a sand-colored little snake emerged from her sleeve and entered the sand, closely following the nightingale bird.</p><p></p><p>The Desert Viper King, born in the desert, the king of the desert!</p><p></p><p>"Princess Honglian, what you are about to face with me may be the darkest hell. Are you afraid?" Xing Xiao looked deeply at this graceful woman who had experienced much by his side and asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness has forgotten, I have already been through the darkest hell," Chi Lian smiled. "These snakes come from that darkest hell."</p><p></p><p>Hiss hiss hiss~!</p><p></p><p>As Chi Lian spoke with a smile, from the opening of her sleeves emerged many colorful snake heads, all the most venomous snakes in the world.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xiao smiled and nodded, "Indeed, I had forgotten."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chi Lian's smile, Xing Xiao's heart ached. This woman, perhaps every one of her smiles hid tears. Her former self was so innocent and carefree.  </p><p></p><p>Now, she could only cover herself with the most venomous snakes in the world to feel a sense of safety.</p><p></p><p>Xing Xiao could not help but speak slowly, "Princess Honglian, the Great Qin owes you a perfect Korea. I promise here to give you the realm in your heart."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xing Xiao's words, Chi Lian was stunned, staring blankly at him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she suddenly felt a warmth she had not felt for a long time, the last time being so long ago that all she could remember was a smiling face.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>That face, it was his brother's.</p><p></p><p>"If your subordinate truly harbored resentment today, why would he follow Your Highness here?" </p><p></p><p>"Princess Crimson Lotus, since this king has made a promise, how could he take it back, especially when it was made to a beautiful lady." Xingxiao smiled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>These words left Chilian stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go..." It wasn't until Xingxiao spoke again that Chilian realized Xingxiao had already left his side.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Xingxiao and Chilian arrived at a place where sand dunes connected. </p><p></p><p>Sand dunes connected in all directions, forming a sandy pit in the middle.</p><p></p><p>"The night nightingale bird is gone." Retrieving the desert viper king snake from the sand, Chilian slowly said, "Obviously, this is our destination."</p><p></p><p>"Since it's underground, the only entrance would naturally be in the quicksand area." Xingxiao squinted his eyes and said lightly, looking at the sandy pit below.</p><p></p><p>"A wondrous place, this sand seems still but is actually slowly sinking down," Chilian said.</p><p></p><p>"Then this must be it, the nightingale's nest, or perhaps not the nightingale's nest, but that dark hell," Xingxiao said indifferently. He manifested a three-foot force field, enveloping himself and Chilian, and jumped into the sandy pit, sinking down with the quicksand.</p><p></p><p>In the quicksand, it was pitch black, and Xingxiao and Chilian couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>The faint sounds of the flowing sand were disruptive to their hearing.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, be careful, there's poison," Chilian suddenly said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, no poison can penetrate my three-foot force field," Xingxiao said confidently.  </p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, I forgot Your Highness also knows the Hundred Poisons Scripture..."</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a reverberating sound rang out, and Xingxiao's three-foot force field shook. Through his inner force perception, Xingxiao sensed at least ten assassins attacking him.</p><p></p><p>"The nightingale is indeed full of talents, to have assassins who can move freely in the quicksand as one with it," Xingxiao remarked with slight admiration.</p><p></p><p>"And they are all poison masters too," Chilian smiled charmingly. "Since your poisons are so exceptional, it would be discourteous not to let you taste ours."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a seven-colored snake less than half a foot long coiled around Chilian's jade-like index finger, sticking out its forked tongue of seven colors. Two drops of venom dripped from its fangs.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining these two drops of venom, Chilian immediately circulated the Hundred Poisons Scripture and struck out with her palm.</p><p></p><p>"You all can taste the Seven Steps Soul催魂散 Summoning Powder."</p><p></p><p>"Tasting it in this pitch black sand will be a unique experience, a natural grave."</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, agonizing screams rang out, cries of anguish unceasing.</p><p></p><p>"What poison is this, ahh it's killing me..."</p><p></p><p>"I want the antidote, I want the antidote..."  </p><p></p><p>"Kill me, just kill me..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these wails, Chilian giggled. "The Seven Steps Soul Summoning Powder, as the name implies, within seven steps, it summons and snatches the soul, inflicting endless pain as if the soul is being torn apart - flesh, bones, meridians will all suffer. Ultimately, bleeding from the seven orifices leads to death."</p><p></p><p>The screams soon stopped.</p><p></p><p>"No more auras," Chilian said, a bit unsatisfied. "It seems these assassins weren't very strong, they could only move three steps at most. What a letdown."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there will definitely be chances for you to have fun later," Xingxiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>Towards the nightingale people, Xingxiao would show no mercy.</p>

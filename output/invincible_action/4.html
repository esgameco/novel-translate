        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The matter at the Alchemy Palace was not over. ‚Ä¢._.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢¬¥¬Ø``‚Ä¢.¬∏¬∏.‚Ä¢` ‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ïùî•ùìæ◊ê.ƒåœÉùìÇ `‚Ä¢.¬∏¬∏.‚Ä¢¬¥¬¥¬Ø`‚Ä¢‚Ä¢._.‚Ä¢</p><p></p><p>The slaughter had just truly begun.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards had already surrounded this place. Under the cover of night, each Shadow Guard was like a ghost. Anyone who participated in Lord Yunzhong's alchemy was completely slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>This place was soon filled with the smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>Everything here needed to be washed with blood.</p><p></p><p>"All alchemists, leave none alive! All elixirs, burn them all!" Zhang Han stood on the palace roof and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a raging fire also ignited here. Only by letting everything here thoroughly turn to ashes would Emperor Qin Shi Huang's anger subside slightly.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao, the Prefect of the Central Secretariat, an imperial noble, leader of the Luo Web, and the favored official of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, was bestowed a residence no less grand than that of the Imperial Chancellor Li Si, and it stood independently.</p><p></p><p>The wide and vast streets seemed like a bridge leading to death. Under the night, the aura of death was even thicker. Where the leaves fell, it seemed to be filled with endless murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Such an atmosphere made even the Chief of Executions following beside Ying Xiao have a solemn expression. He really wanted to ask, but seeing Ying Xiao's back, he was afraid of angering him.</p><p></p><p>"Ask what you want to say." Ying Xiao spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Your Highness the Martial King, coming here is for..." The Chief of Executions cupped his hands and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, it is also to kill someone." Ying Xiao responded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing such an answer, the Chief of Executions was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao continued softly, "Chief of Executions, as one of the five great elders of the Yin-Yang Sect, it's impossible for you to not understand the Luo Web. Tell me, is the Luo Web truly loyal to His Majesty?"</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, in your eyes, does this Luo Web belong to His Majesty or to the Prefect of the Central Secretariat?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Martial King, regarding court affairs, this subordinate has never dared to speculate. This subordinate only knows to be loyal to Emperor Qin Shi Huang." The Chief of Executions spoke with some panic.</p><p></p><p>"This King believes the Chief of Executions thinks exactly as you say in your heart." Ying Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao was smiling, but the Chief of Executions felt like he had fallen into an icy abyss. His heart trembled in fear, "Your Highness the Martial King's words express distrust towards the Luo Web and also distrust towards the Yin-Yang Sect."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the real purpose of killing Lord Yunzhong was not because of the Golden Elixir, but to intimidate the Yin-Yang Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Gao underestimated His Majesty the Emperor and Your Highness the Martial King. The leader also underestimated His Majesty the Emperor and Your Highness the Martial King..."</p><p></p><p>Outside the residence of the Prefect of the Central Secretariat, Zhao Gao led the Six Sword Slaves and a group of Luo Web assassins to welcome Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Web, a net covering heaven and earth, leaving no gaps.</p><p></p><p>The moment Ying Xiao stepped in here, Zhao Gao knew. Perhaps the moment Ying Xiao entered the Alchemy Palace, Zhao Gao already knew. Or perhaps the moment Ying Xiao emerged from his seclusion, his every move was already in Zhao Gao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Zhao Gao likely didn't know was what Ying Xiao and Emperor Qin Shi Huang said in the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao wore a black and red tall hat, had blood-red hair, eagle eyes, a pale face, a lofty nose, scarlet blood-jade lips, and a cold demeanor. He was dressed in a black and red robe that resembled a spider web.</p><p></p><p>Yet such a Zhao Gao appeared like a humble gentleman, refined as jade.</p><p></p><p>So, most of the time Zhao Gao held a piece of green jade in his right hand. This time was no exception.</p><p></p><p>As Ying Xiao approached, cracks appeared on this piece of green jade.</p><p></p><p>Then, this jade turned to ashes in Zhao Gao's hand, scattering with the breeze. At the same time, Zhao Gao's gaze also swept over the Six Sword Slaves unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although Ying Xiao was still far from Zhao Gao, he heard and responded faintly, "Today is indeed not a good day."</p><p></p><p>"He heard..." Zhao Gao's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao also no longer walked slowly. Using graceful steps, he arrived in front of Zhao Gao in an instant and spoke indifferently, "It seems you still underestimated this King."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, Lord Yunzhong indeed</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter anymore. Tonight, this king wants to kill two people. One is Yun Zhong Jun, and the other..."</p><p></p><p>"Is me." At this point, Zhao Gao stopped pretending and finished Ying Xiao's sentence, regaining his composure. He spoke softly, "But Prince Wu, you only brought one Da Si Ming and one Shao Si Ming, and you want to take my head in my own residence. Isn't that a bit..."</p><p></p><p>"A bit overconfident? We'll see about that." Ying Xiao sneered coldly. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the assassins behind Zhao Gao made their move.</p><p></p><p>These assassins were all either Di-level or Sha-level, numbering twenty in total.</p><p></p><p>Di-level assassins were all at the ninth-rank realm.</p><p></p><p>Sha-level assassins were all at the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Luo Wang truly belongs only to you, Zhao Gao." Ying Xiao spoke calmly, "In the hearts of every assassin, there is no First Emperor, only you, the Zhong Che Prefect. Through cruel and bloody training, they obey your every command."</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu, you are right, yet also not entirely correct." Zhao Gao spoke softly, "The Luo Wang has its own system. They don't listen to Zhao Gao or the Zhong Che Prefect, but to the leader of the Luo Wang."</p><p></p><p>"Absolute obedience to the leader, this is the system of the Luo Wang. This is also what the First Emperor wants."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Then if His Majesty orders you to die, why don't you kill yourself?" Ying Xiao laughed disdainfully and also made his move. Fierce internal energy instantly gathered in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms - Dragon Battles in the Wild!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the Nine Yang Divine Technique. The scorching internal energy elevated the fierce power of the Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms to another level, reaching its limit.</p><p></p><p>Several dragon shadows roared out in all directions with Ying Xiao at the center, sweeping across everything.</p><p></p><p>Amidst wails, all the Di-level and Sha-level assassins fell to the ground and did not get up again.</p><p></p><p>"Again, that incomparably fierce and domineering palm technique. With one strike, twenty experts seem uninjured on the surface, but their internal organs have all been shattered." Da Si Ming was once again shocked by the Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms.</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of palm technique is this? There's a feeling that no yin-yang technique can penetrate this fierce and domineering palm technique."</p><p></p><p>"True dragon form, could this be a martial arts palm technique unique to the Ying clan lineage?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms with his own eyes, Zhao Gao's hawk-like eyes were also shocked. In his heart, he thought, "What a Prince Wu. In the past, I truly underestimated him."</p><p></p><p>Despite his inner shock, Zhao Gao appeared as calm as ever, responding to Ying Xiao, "Prince Wu, the only ones who can kill the leader of the Luo Wang are His Majesty's direct verbal order or His Majesty's imperial decree."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from that, even if Prince Wu has the Tian Wen Sword in hand, you have no authority to make the leader of the Luo Wang die."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..." Ying Xiao snorted and laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Six Sword Slaves made their move.</p><p></p><p>All six of them were first-class Tian-level, at the Human Immortal realm, either in the late stage or at the peak.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the six of them moved as one, with unparalleled skill and seamless coordination.</p><p></p><p>In their hands were all famous swords.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when the twenty Di-level and Sha-level assassins made their move, including Zhao Gao's continuous debate with Ying Xiao, it was all to create the perfect opportunity for the Six Sword Slaves to strike and kill Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Slaves, whenever they took action, always ended the battle in an instant, not giving the enemy any chance to react.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Sword Slaves, not bad opponents, worthy of the Tian Wen Sword being unsheathed."</p><p></p><p>Unlike when battling Yun Zhong Jun, in this instant, Ying Xiao felt a strong killing intent, even the aura of death. This killing intent and aura of death made Ying Xiao's fighting spirit burn in a flash, and in that flash, he drew the Tian Wen Sword.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang!</p><p></p><p>Sword light crisscrossed, figures darted about. In the blink of an eye, Ying Xiao and the Six Sword Slaves had exchanged several rounds between life and death.</p><p></p><p>As the internal energy of both sides brutally collided amidst the sword qi, the repelling force gave them their first interval to cease.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene thoroughly shocked Zhao Gao.</p>

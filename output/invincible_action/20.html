        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the words of the Mohist leader, Ying Xiao smiled helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang walked over slowly, even more disdainful. "The ignorant will always remain ignorant, hmph."</p><p></p><p>"Wei Zhuang, shut your mouth," Da Tiechui angrily said. </p><p></p><p>"Believe it or not, if you don't shut your mouth, you'll die even faster than your leader," Wei Zhuang spoke coldly, his murderous eyes staring straight at Da Tiechui.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, Da Tiechui didn't dare utter another word.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..." Wei Zhuang snorted coldly, growing even more contemptuous of the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu Wang, what is your intention?" the Mohist leader asked Ying Xiao again.</p><p></p><p>"My intention is to witness the power of Mo Mei," said Ying Xiao. "And, to conduct an experiment to see if I can eliminate the Yin-Yang Sect's Six Soul Terror Curse."</p><p></p><p>"The Six Soul Terror Curse, one of the Yin Curses. Let me experience it then."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Ying Xiao activated the internal energy of the Nine Yang Divine Skill. His entire body instantly became scorching hot. With a suction force from his palm, the Mohist leader immediately appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Leader..." The Mohist disciples reacted and immediately made their move.</p><p></p><p>But they were stopped by Gai Nie and Xiaoyao Zi. </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Mohist brothers, wait a moment..." Xiaoyao Zi spoke heavily.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli also immediately noticed something was wrong and hurriedly said, "Everyone, step back..."</p><p></p><p>"Such scorching internal energy, such vast internal energy..." Gai Nie exclaimed in shock. "With internal energy like this, I'm afraid no one in the world can match it."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of scorching heat is the most terrifying I've ever witnessed in my life," Xiaoyao Zi also exclaimed in shock. "As such, it's truly possible to eliminate the Six Soul Terror Curse."</p><p></p><p>"What? Ying Xiao is saving the leader?" Da Tiechui hissed, unwilling to believe what he was seeing.</p><p></p><p>"Martial King Ying Xiao, what exactly is he trying to do?" Gao Jianli and the others also hissed, unwilling to believe this scene.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's eyes narrowed as he silently thought, "Ying Xiao is definitely not a soft-hearted person. He has seen the true hidden danger to this empire. But can he really tame the Mohists?"</p><p></p><p>"Attacking a city is inferior, attacking the heart is superior. This has always been what the Mohists excel at."</p><p></p><p>"Martial King Ying Xiao, what will you do?"</p><p></p><p>As the internal energy of the Nine Yang Divine Skill continued to activate, the power of the Six Soul Terror Curse within the Mohist leader's body gradually dissipated. In less than half an hour, the Mohist leader was restored to his original state.</p><p></p><p>"It really succeeded," Gai Nie spoke heavily. "What kind of martial art is that? I've never seen it before, nor heard my master mention it. It can actually use yang to overcome yin and eliminate the most terrifying Six Soul Terror Curse."</p><p></p><p>"Extremely unyielding and extremely yang, nothing surpasses this," Xiaoyao Zi praised.</p><p></p><p>"So this is his internal energy..." Wei Zhuang's heart was filled with the desire to fight.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli, Da Tiechui, Xue Nv and the others were dumbfounded. How could they have imagined that their greatest enemy would save the person they respected most?</p><p></p><p>"Prince Wu Wang, thank you, but what exactly are you trying to do?" The Mohist leader spoke coldly as he retreated slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt Ying Xiao's terrifying nature.</p><p></p><p>As the Mohist leader, he understood even more clearly that sometimes not killing was more skillful than killing.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I say, to witness the true Mo Mei," Ying Xiao said. "And to prove one thing - the Yin-Yang Sect seems to be just ordinary to me."</p><p></p><p>"As you wish, Prince Wu Wang." The Mohist leader nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had to defeat Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, with one sword strike, it was his strongest sword.</p><p></p><p>Countless ink-colored paintings overlapped repeatedly, looking</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed beautiful, appearing to have no killing intent, but in reality, it was filled with deadly sword energy. Once the opponent was trapped inside, they would either die or be injured if they tried to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Convergence of Ten Thousand Swords!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Xiao spoke softly, entering a state of unity between man and sword, using his fingers as swords.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you use the Tianwen Sword?" the Mohist leader asked.</p><p></p><p>"Since Mohist's sword has no edge, why should I use the Tianwen Sword? Moreover, in terms of swordsmanship, I am confident that I can defeat you without a sword," Ying Xiao responded as the Convergence of Ten Thousand Swords fully erupted.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if heaven and earth had descended, with every corner becoming Ying Xiao's sword, endless and continuous.</p><p></p><p>"This sword..." Gai Nie's pupils contracted sharply, unable to see through it for a moment. "Defeating a sword without a sword... Defeating a sword without a sword..."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the intertwining sword light, a figure was heavily pushed backâ€”it was the Mohist leader.</p><p></p><p>With this sword, he was defeated.</p><p></p><p>"The leader is defeated?" The Mohists were unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"You can all attack together. As I said before, I promise that if you defeat me, you can leave unharmed." Ying Xiao's gaze swept over Gao Jianli and the others as he spoke in a condescending tone.</p><p></p><p>"Together!" At this moment, the Mohists no longer hesitated and attacked Ying Xiao with full force from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Battles in the Wild!" Ying Xiao spoke calmly, and the roar of dragons echoed around him. Nine dragon-shaped internal forces howled out, directly sweeping across the Mohists. Then, with another move called "Proud Dragon's Remorse," the dragon-shaped internal forces swirled and attacked, completely defeating the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Gai Nie exclaimed in amazement, "Such palm techniques are not inferior to the previous sword, and moreover, they seem even more profound than the Yin-Yang Art."</p><p></p><p>"I have never heard of this Prince Wuwang being so powerful," Xiaoyao Zi said heavily. "Mr. Gai, I'm afraid even your master, Gui Guzi, is far from his match."</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Mohists are probably..."</p><p></p><p>"His palm techniques are also this strong..." Wei Zhuang felt an urge in his heart, an incomparably strong urge.</p><p></p><p>"Mohist leader, it seems I have to refuse your deal," Ying Xiao said calmly, looking at the Mohist leader, whose expression had begun to turn ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Kill me or skin me, do as you please," the Mohist leader said coldly. "Besides, this life was saved by you, Wuwang Ying Xiao, in the first place."</p><p></p><p>"In this jianghu, killing is the easiest thing," Ying Xiao said with a smile. "Therefore, Mohist leader, you will not die."</p><p></p><p>"Wuwang Ying Xiao, what exactly do you want?" the Mohist leader hissed. "Are you toying with us Mohists?"</p><p></p><p>"Toying? I have no interest in that," Ying Xiao laughed. "Now, I want to ask you a question. Crown Prince of Yan, can you give me a satisfactory answer?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao's words, the Mohist leader's entire body trembled instantly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's eyes also fell on the Mohist leader in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"How... did you know?" The Mohist leader removed his cloak and stared intently at Ying Xiao, asking heavily.</p><p></p><p>"What? The leader is actually the crown prince..." Da Tiechui was shocked beyond belief.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Dan..." Wei Zhuang was also shocked. "I never thought it would be you..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Zhuang felt a strong sense of defeat in his heart. His sure-kill sword had been escaped twice, and he tightly gripped his shark-toothed weapon, wishing to fight Yan Dan again immediately.</p><p></p><p>With a faint, cold smile at the corner of his mouth, Ying Xiao responded softly, "How I knew is very simple. In this jianghu, I am the one in control, so naturally, I know everything."</p>

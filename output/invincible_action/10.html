        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Buchen and Fenji's hearts were excited. ‚òúüç™‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ï–Ωùì§–ñ.Ôº£œÉ‡πì‚ô£üíù</p><p></p><p>Truly excited!</p><p></p><p>How long had it been since they encountered an opponent that made them instantly feel the presence of life and death? Even Guiguzi, who could make the feudal lords fear with a single rage and bring peace to the world, was just one of the hundred schools of thought in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, you have really given us enough surprises." Buchen spoke with a grin, one hand tightly gripping the hilt of his sword, the other hand's fingers lightly passing over the blade. The golden sword qi dispersed in the killing, forming two opposing forces like yin and yang.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, people have two sides, good and evil. The killing of the sword also has two sides, which are also good and evil."</p><p></p><p>"Two sides of good and evil!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Buchen thrust out his sword, instantly making Dasiming and Shaosiming in the distance feel as if their bodies were about to be cut in half, and the yin and yang internal forces in their bodies were about to be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"What a terrifying sword, making everything in opposition. This opposition is even above the yin and yang forces. What kind of swordsmanship is this? Luowang actually has such a master. Compared to him, the Six Sword Slaves are truly like a firefly against the bright moon." Dasiming was extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Fenji also made his move at this instant.</p><p></p><p>The sword was like fire, the qi was fierce, and the fierce sword qi contained a terrifying taste of death.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the wildfire cannot be extinguished, and the spring breeze will blow it again.</p><p></p><p>But under such a fierce and deadly sword, all the vitality of spring would be turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, I, Fenji, will control your vitality, and I, Fenji, will cut off your life." Fenji spoke calmly, his sword moving with his body, following behind Buchen.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the two exchanged positions, with Fenji in front and Buchen behind.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, one was on the left and the other on the right.</p><p></p><p>In the world of martial arts, only speed is unbreakable. The swords of the two Luowang elders had reached the ultimate speed.</p><p></p><p>However, Ying Xiao didn't even blink. Under his madness, there was only one sword in his eyes. His sword was the strongest sword. Madly seeking defeat, yet never being defeated.</p><p></p><p>Sword lights crisscrossed, internal forces collided, and figures intertwined.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, everything returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>Under the hazy moonlight, the dripping of two drops of blood seemed to dye half the horizon red.</p><p></p><p>Buchen and Fenji half-knelt down, each with an additional sword mark on their necks, the blood slowly thickening.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you won't have the chance to see my second sword. But you can also be proud. Such a mad sword seeking defeat, breaking all the swords in the world, you are the first to see it." Ying Xiao spoke softly as he slowly turned around.</p><p></p><p>"The swords of Luowang, defeat is death. But as Your Highness said, with such a sword, we die proudly." Buchen and Fenji spoke in unison, their eyes showing no fear of death, nor any unwillingness. Then, they fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Lingbo Micro-Steps!"</p><p></p><p>After Buchen and Fenji fell, Ying Xiao had already left afterimages among the surrounding Luowang assassins. Dragon roars echoed, and dragons battled in the wild.</p><p></p><p>The screams echoed quickly and also disappeared quickly.</p><p></p><p>As Ying Xiao finished dealing with these small fries, Dasiming and Shaosiming each brought Buchen and Fenji's swords to Ying Xiao's side.</p><p></p><p>"Buchen, Fenji, I've never heard of these two swords. Have you heard of them?" Ying Xiao asked Dasiming and Shaosiming.</p><p></p><p>Dasiming shook his head slightly, "Your Highness, I've never heard of them. Moreover, I didn't even know that Luowang had assassins at the elder level."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Gao..." Ying Xiao repeated, the seriousness in his pupils increasing.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ying Xiao released a signal flare, the signal flare of the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This matter must be quickly made known to Zhang Han, otherwise Brother Zheng may be in danger.</p><p></p><p>After firing the signal flare, Ying Xiao picked up the Buchen Sword and closed his eyes, recalling the sword technique displayed by the assassin Buchen.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension, Ying Xiao quickly grasped what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host recalls the strongest sword strike of the Luowang assassin Buchen and comprehends the Buchen Sword Technique!]</p><p></p><p>As he comprehended it, Ying Xiao opened his eyes, wielded the Buchen Sword, and performed the Buchen Sword Technique once, sighing deeply, "It is truly a heaven-defying sword technique, with both good and evil sides. No wonder the Luowang elder-level assassins are superior to the Six Sword Slaves."</p><p></p><p>This directly stunned Da Siming.</p><p></p><p>She could not imagine that Ying Xiao, just by battling Buchen, could comprehend the terrifying sword technique belonging to the Luowang assassin Buchen in a short moment.</p><p></p><p>"Throughout history, the number one sword dao genius..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ying Xiao, true admiration began to rise in Da Siming's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was the second person after Dong Huang Taiyi who truly earned Da Siming's admiration.</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming's purple pupils were also contracting.</p><p></p><p>She was indifferent to everything, her heart as quiet as the stillness of death, but since following Ying Xiao, she had been moved several times.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ying Xiao picked up the Fenji Sword.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The host recalls the strongest sword strike of the Luowang assassin Fenji and comprehends the Fenji Sword Technique!]</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he also used the Fenji Sword to display the Fenji Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Death, raging flames, as if from the fires of hell, this sword technique originates from the battlefield, the flames of war, where hundreds of thousands of lost souls perished under this sword technique," Ying Xiao murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Da Siming, keep these two swords safe," Ying Xiao then instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty," Da Siming nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since Luowang is no longer under my command, I need to establish a new force," Ying Xiao murmured, "Han Fei of the Legalist school said it well, 'Confucianism disrupts the law with civility, chivalry violates prohibitions with force.'"</p><p></p><p>"In this jianghu, only punishment can stop punishment. This new force shall be called Tianxing."</p><p></p><p>"Tianxing..." Da Siming whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Da Siming, tell me, are you first an elder of the Yinyang Sect, or first a member of my Tianxing?" Walking to Da Siming's side, Ying Xiao's lips lightly spoke next to Da Siming's ear.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this question, Da Siming's expression trembled.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming also immediately cupped her hands, ready to answer.</p><p></p><p>But Ying Xiao stopped her, "No rush, I want to hear this answer after some time. As for how long, I will ask again when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"So, I'm giving you time to think carefully. Then think carefully, Da Siming..."</p><p></p><p>The last three words, Ying Xiao's lips were almost pressed against Da Siming's jade ear, making Da Siming feel flustered.</p><p></p><p>However, Da Siming had no time to feel flustered.</p><p></p><p>She clearly knew that for this question from Ying Xiao, there was only one answer he wanted - that she would forever leave the Yinyang Sect and only be Da Siming of Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>"Yinyang Sect, Tianxing..." Da Siming murmured in her heart, feeling the threat of death for the first time.</p><p></p><p>She feared Dong Huang Taiyi, and she also feared the current Ying Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, Da Siming looked at Shao Siming, asking in her heart, "And what answer will you give?"</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming, perhaps avoiding, or perhaps truly not knowing the meaning of Da Siming's gaze, slowly moved and followed Ying Xiao to where the horses were.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two figures swiftly approached through the forest.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>What shocked and sobered Bai Feng was not that Ying Xiao had caught up with him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't know how Ying Xiao had managed to catch up.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible..." Bai Feng muttered to himself, immediately holding nothing back and advancing at full speed.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how fast he went, every time he looked back, Ying Xiao was always by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Feather!" </p><p></p><p>Bai Feng was already using his ultimate move.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Ladder!" Ying Xiao spoke calmly, always staying ahead of Bai Feng with ease. If Ying Xiao wished, he could leave Bai Feng in the dust in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Grand Commander was right. Even trying a thousand more times would yield the same result. This helpless gap in power... and it's in the speed I take pride in." Bai Feng gave up the contest and sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"You are already very good," Ying Xiao said. "The so-called feeling of powerlessness is only because you are facing me, the King."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst overlapping mountain ranges, a thick fog obscured the view.</p><p></p><p>A giant white bird descended from the sky, landing on a cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate, Meng Yi!"</p><p></p><p>"Gong Shu Chou!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Your Highness, the Martial King!"</p><p></p><p>As Ying Xiao dismounted, valiant and extraordinary generals, a half-man half-machine elder, and a group of elite Shadow Guards all knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang and Chi Lian also showed their respect for Ying Xiao, nodding at him.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang spoke, "Your Highness arrives at just the right time. A good show is about to unfold."</p><p></p><p>Gathering internal energy in his eyes, Ying Xiao looked in the direction of Wei Zhuang's sharp gaze. Through layers of thick fog, he saw frenzied lightning energy in the dense forest, like a storm.</p><p></p><p>"The Mohist Iron Hammer, Thunder God Hammer Second Layer - Power of the Thunder God," Ying Xiao said. "Besides that, there is another frenzied giant force, the Peerless Demon."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Peerless Demon is not the protagonist. The hidden bats of Reverse Flow Sand and that Black Qilin are the main characters. As night falls, it's their time to take the stage."</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, the Black Qilin is the sole protagonist."</p><p></p><p>"Dark moon, cold wind, invisible reaper, ever-changing and inexplicable, the Ink Jade Qilin."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Xiao's words, Wei Zhuang's sharp eyes were filled with shock. He felt once again that he had no secrets before Ying Xiao. He said in a deep voice, "Your Highness is very familiar with the Flow Sand, as if you had foreseen this scene."</p><p></p><p>"When leaving Xianyang, I said that this jianghu is dominated by me," Ying Xiao smiled. It was a gentle smile, but in Wei Zhuang's eyes, it seemed like the most terrifying sword.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ying Xiao's gaze fell on Meng Yi.</p><p></p><p>"General Meng, why have you come?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, your subordinate is now a member of Tian Xing," Meng Yi responded. "These Shadow Guards are no longer Shadow Guards, but people of Tian Xing."</p><p></p><p>"Very well. Tian Xing is newly established and indeed needs you." Ying Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Xing..." Wei Zhuang murmured.</p><p></p><p>"After all, you were once the strongest weapon to stop punishment with punishment."</p><p></p><p>"However, even as the strongest weapon, it's still a waste of your talents."</p><p></p><p>"The place that can truly accommodate Sir Wei Zhuang is the vast battlefield," Ying Xiao continued. "The Xiongnu in the north, the Baiyue in the south, a battlefield of ten thousand miles with clashing armies. Doesn't Sir Wei Zhuang want to see it?"</p><p></p><p>"But I digress. Night is about to fall..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Zhuang's expression had clearly changed.</p><p></p><p>The strongest assassin, the strongest weapon - these were never what he wanted. When he first entered the Valley of Ghosts, he indeed</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He only thought about what the strongest sword was, including the first question he asked his master, Guiguzi.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùìºùì±ùìæùîÅ.ùì¨ùì∏ùì∂</p><p></p><p>But after leaving Guigu, his ambition was already the true ambition of Guigu Zongheng.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight will be a wonderful night." Wei Zhuang's eyes changed only for a moment, and the next moment, they had returned to being sharp.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a scream also came from the dense forest below.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Hidden Bat has joined the battle, and Big Iron Hammer is about to be defeated," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"His defeat is inevitable," Wei Zhuang said. "The darkness of the night belongs to Hidden Bat and even more so to Lin'er. Please wait quietly, Your Majesty King Wu."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At some point, there was a sound of a flute coming from below, and snow fell from the fog, and there was a burst of cold air spreading upward.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Jianli of the Mohists, Snow Woman," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Since Big Iron Hammer was rescued, it means that Lin'er succeeded." Chi Lian spoke charmingly, her jade hand turned over, and a bottle appeared. "White Phoenix, please take care of this. Tomorrow morning, give it to Lin'er."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, bring back what Master Gongshu wants. Calculating the time, Lin'er should have it by tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." With a soft voice, White Phoenix left this place.</p><p></p><p>"Chi Lian should thank Your Majesty King Wu." Immediately, Chi Lian walked to Ying Xiao's side, twisting her water snake waist and respectfully said, "If it weren't for the Hundred Poisons True Scripture taught by Your Majesty King Wu, Chi Lian would not have been able to develop this Zhen Yu Qingfeng in just a few short days."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Zhen Yu Qingfeng, what's the trick? Tell me about it," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty King Wu, Zhen Yu Qianye, when the sun is at its zenith, it will slaughter the entire city, while Zhen Yu Qingfeng, when the clear wind blows, the city will be silent," Chi Lian said. "Tomorrow, when the clear wind blows through the Mechanical City, the Mohist disciples will not be able to stand up again, and they will only be weak and powerless, at the mercy of others."</p><p></p><p>"Princess Hong Lian, if I remember correctly, among the Mohists, there is a woman named Duan Murong, known as the Medicine Immortal," Ying Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty King Wu can rest assured, she will only be powerless," Chi Lian said with a smile. "Perhaps, she will live up to her reputation as the Medicine Immortal and find the antidote to Zhen Yu Qingfeng, but that will take time."</p><p></p><p>"And Your Majesty King Wu will not give her that time, will you?"</p><p></p><p>"Princess Hong Lian is not wrong," Ying Xiao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ying Xiao instructed Gongshu Chou, "Master Gongshu, then the layers of mechanical traps outside the Mechanical City will be left to you. Three hundred years ago, your Gongshu family's ancestors were defeated by the Mohist patriarch. Today, such a scene will not be repeated, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty King Wu can rest assured that the shame of the ancestors three hundred years ago will be washed away by Gongshu Chou."</p><p></p><p>"Good, I hope you will not disappoint me," Ying Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Click! Click!</p><p></p><p>After bowing respectfully, Gongshu Chou slowly walked away from the cliff with his mechanical feet. Behind Gongshu Chou, a mechanical lizard emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then, there were two, three... a hundred... thousands.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking ground seven lang, no hole is impenetrable, opening mountains and breaking stones," Ying Xiao said softly. "The hundred schools of thought, each has its own strengths."</p><p></p><p>"Meng Yi, lead the people of Tian Xing to prepare as well."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty King Wu."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Wei Zhuang, then I wish you success in becoming the new leader of Guigu Zongheng tomorrow," Ying Xiao also said to Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>"That is natural..."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang spoke heavily, his eyes falling on the ring he wore that represented the leader of Guigu.</p>
